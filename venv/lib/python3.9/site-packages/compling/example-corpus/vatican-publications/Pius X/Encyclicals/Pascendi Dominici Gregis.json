Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The office divinely committed to Us of feeding the Lord s flock has especially this_duty assigned to it by Christ , namely , to guard with the greatest vigilance the deposit of the faith delivered to the saints , rejecting the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called . There has_never been a time_when this watchfulness of the supreme pastor was_not necessary to the Catholic body ; for , owing to the efforts of the enemy of the human_race , there have_never been lacking '' men speaking perverse things '' Acts xx . , '' vain talkers and seducers '' Tit . , '' erring and driving into error '' Tim . Still it must be confessed that the number of the enemies of the cross of Christ has in these last days increased exceedingly , who_are striving , by arts , entirely new and full of subtlety , to destroy the vital energy of the Church , and , if they_can , to overthrow utterly Christ s kingdom itself . Wherefore We may no longer be silent , lest We should seem to fail in Our most_sacred duty , and lest the kindness that , in the hope of wiser counsels , We have hitherto shown them , should be attributed to forgetfulness of Our office . Gravity of the Situation . That We make no delay in this_matter -isaia- rendered necessary especially by the fact_that the partisans of error are to be sought not_only among the Church s open enemies ; they lie hid , a thing to be deeply deplored and feared , in her very bosom and heart , and are the more mischievous , the less conspicuously they appear . We allude , Venerable Brethren , to many who belong to the Catholic laity , nay , and this_-isaia- far more lamentable , to the ranks of the priesthood itself , who , feigning a love for the Church , lacking the firm protection of philosophy and theology , nay more , thoroughly imbued_with the poisonous doctrines taught by the enemies of the Church , and lost to all sense of modesty , vaunt themselves as reformers of the Church ; and , forming more boldly into line of attack , assail all that_-isaia- most_sacred in the work of Christ , not sparing even the person of the Divine Redeemer , whom , with sacrilegious daring , they reduce to a simple , mere man . Though they express astonishment themselves , no one_can justly be surprised that We number such men among the enemies of the Church , if , leaving out of consideration the internal disposition of soul , of which God alone_-isaia- the judge , he -isaia- acquainted with_their tenets , their manner of speech , their conduct . Nor indeed will he err in accounting them the most pernicious of all the adversaries of the Church . For as We have_said , they put their designs for_her ruin into operation not from without but_from within ; hence , the danger -isaia- present almost in the very veins and heart of the Church , whose injury -isaia- the more certain , the more intimate -isaia- their knowledge of her . Moreover they lay the axe not to the branches and shoots , but to the very root , that_-isaia- , to the faith and its deepest fires . And having struck -atti_degli_apostoli- this root of immortality , they proceed to disseminate poison through the whole tree , so that_there_-isaia- no part of Catholic truth from which_they hold their hand , none that they_do_not strive to corrupt . Further , none -isaia- more skilful , none more astute than they , in the employment of a thousand noxious arts ; for they double the parts of rationalist and Catholic , and this so craftily that_they easily lead the unwary into error ; and since audacity -isaia- their chief characteristic , there_-isaia- no conclusion of any_kind from which_they shrink or which they_do_not thrust forward with pertinacity and assurance . To this_must be added the fact , which indeed -isaia- well calculated to deceive souls , that_they lead a life of the greatest activity , of assiduous and ardent application to every branch of learning , and that_they possess , as a rule , a reputation for the strictest morality . Finally , and this almost destroys all hope of cure , their_very doctrines have_given such a bent to their_minds , that_they disdain all authority and brook no restraint ; and relying upon a false conscience , they attempt to ascribe to a love of truth that_which_-isaia- in reality the result of pride and obstinacy . Once indeed We had hopes of recalling them to a better sense , and to this_end we first of all showed them kindness as Our children , then we treated them_with severity , and -atti_degli_apostoli- last We have_had recourse , though with_great reluctance , to public reproof . But you_know , Venerable Brethren , how fruitless has_been Our action . They bowed their head for a moment , but it was soon uplifted more arrogantly than_ever . If it were a matter which concerned them alone , We might perhaps have overlooked it : but the security of the Catholic name -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake . Wherefore , as to maintain it longer would be a crime , We must now break silence , in order to expose before the whole Church in their true colours those men who_have assumed this bad disguise . Division of the Encyclical . But since_the Modernists as they_are commonly and rightly called employ a very clever artifice , namely , to present their doctrines without order and systematic arrangement into one whole , scattered and disjointed one from another , so as to appear to be in doubt and uncertainty , while they_are in reality firm and steadfast , it will be of advantage , Venerable Brethren , to bring their teachings together here into one group , and to point_out the connexion between_them , and thus to pass to an examination of the sources of the errors , and to prescribe remedies for averting the evil . ANALYSIS OF MODERNIST TEACHING . To proceed in an orderly manner in this recondite subject , it must first of all be noted_that every Modernist sustains and comprises within himself many personalities ; he -isaia- a philosopher , a believer , a theologian , an historian , a critic , an apologist , a reformer . These roles must be clearly distinguished from one_another by all who_would accurately know their system and thoroughly comprehend the principles and the consequences of their doctrines . Agnosticism its Philosophical Foundation . We begin , then , with the philosopher . Modernists place the foundation of religious philosophy in that doctrine which_-isaia- usually called Agnosticism . According to this_teaching human_reason -isaia- confined entirely within_the field of phenomena , that_-isaia- to say , to things_that_are perceptible to the senses , and in the manner in which_they_are perceptible ; it has no right and no power to transgress these limits . Hence it -isaia- incapable of lifting itself up to God , and of recognising His existence , even by means of visible things . From this it -isaia- inferred that God can_never be the direct object of science , and that , as regards history , He must_not be considered as an historical subject . Given these premises , all will readily perceive what becomes of Natural Theology , of the motives of credibility , of external revelation . The Modernists simply make away with_them altogether ; they include them in Intellectualism , which_they call a ridiculous and long ago defunct system . Nor does the fact_that the Church has formally condemned these portentous errors exercise the slightest restraint upon them . Yet the Vatican Council has defined , '' If anyone says_that the one true God , our Creator and Lord , cannot be known with certainty by the natural light of human_reason by means of the things_that_are made , let_him be anathema '' De Revel . I ; and also : '' If anyone says that_it_-isaia- not_possible or not expedient that_man be taught , through the medium of divine_revelation , about God and the worship to be paid Him , let_him be anathema '' Ibid . ; and finally , '' If anyone says_that divine_revelation cannot be made credible by external signs , and that therefore men should be drawn to the faith only by their_personal internal experience or by private inspiration , let_him be anathema '' De Fide , can . But how the Modernists make_the transition from Agnosticism , which_-isaia- a state of pure nescience , to scientific and historic Atheism , which_-isaia- a doctrine of positive denial ; and consequently , by what legitimate process of reasoning , starting from ignorance as to whether God has in fact intervened in the history of the human_race or not , they proceed , in their explanation of this history , to ignore God altogether , as if He really had not intervened , let_him answer who_can . Yet it -isaia- a fixed and established principle among_them that both science and history must be atheistic : and within their boundaries there_-isaia- room_for nothing but phenomena ; God and all that_-isaia- divine are utterly excluded . We shall soon see clearly what , according to this_most absurd teaching , must be held touching the most_sacred Person of Christ , what concerning the mysteries of His life and death , and of His Resurrection and Ascension into_heaven . However , this Agnosticism -isaia- only the negative part of the system of the Modernist : the positive side of it consists in what_they call vital immanence . This -isaia- how they advance from one to the other . Religion , whether natural or supernatural , must , like every_other fact , admit of some explanation . But when Natural theology has_been destroyed , the road to revelation closed through the rejection of the arguments of credibility , and all external revelation absolutely denied , it -isaia- clear_that this explanation will be sought in vain outside man_himself . It must , therefore , be looked for in man ; and since religion_-isaia- a form of life , the explanation must certainly be found in the life of man . Hence the principle of religious immanence -isaia- formulated . Moreover , the first actuation , so to say , of every vital phenomenon , and religion , as has been_said , belongs to this category , -isaia- due to a certain necessity or impulsion ; but it has its origin , speaking more particularly of life , in a movement of the heart , which movement -isaia- called a sentiment . Therefore , since God -isaia- the object of religion , we must conclude that faith_,_which -isaia- the basis and the foundation of all religion , consists in a sentiment which originates from a need of the divine . This need of the divine , which_-isaia- experienced only in special and favourable circumstances , cannot , of itself , appertain to the domain of consciousness ; it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- first latent within_the consciousness , or , to borrow a term from modern philosophy , in the subconsciousness , where also its roots lies hidden and undetected . Should anyone ask how it -isaia- that_this need of the divine which_man experiences within himself grows up into a religion , the Modernists reply thus : Science and history , they_say , are confined within two limits , the one external , namely , the visible world , the other internal , which_-isaia- consciousness . When one or other of these boundaries has_been reached , there_can be no further progress , for beyond -isaia- the unknowable . In presence of this unknowable , whether it -isaia- outside man and beyond_the visible world of nature , or lies hidden within in the subconsciousness , the need of the divine , according to the principles of Fideism , excites in a soul with a propensity towards religion a certain special sentiment , without_any previous advertence of the mind : and this sentiment possesses , implied within itself both as its_own object and as its intrinsic cause , the reality of the divine , and in a way unites man with God . It -isaia- this sentiment to which Modernists give the name of faith , and this it -isaia- which_they consider_the beginning of religion . But we have_not yet come to the end of their philosophy , or , to speak more accurately , their folly . For Modernism finds in this sentiment not faith only , but_with and in faith , as they understand it , revelation , they_say , abides . For what more can one require for revelation ? Is not_that religious sentiment which_-isaia- perceptible in the consciousness revelation , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least the beginning of revelation ? Nay , -isaia- not God Himself , as He manifests Himself to the soul , indistinctly it -isaia- true , in this_same religious sense , revelation ? And they add : Since God -isaia- both the object and the cause of faith , this revelation -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time of God and from God ; that_-isaia- , God -isaia- both the revealer and the revealed . Hence , Venerable Brethren , springs that ridiculous proposition of the Modernists , that_every religion , according to the different aspect under which_it_-isaia- viewed , must be considered as both natural and supernatural . Hence it -isaia- that_they make consciousness and revelation synonymous . Hence the law , according to which religious consciousness -isaia- given as the universal rule , to be put on an equal footing with revelation , and to which all must submit , even the supreme_authority of the Church , whether in its teaching capacity , or in that of legislator in the province of sacred_liturgy or discipline . Deformation of Religious History the Consequence . However , in all this_process , from which , according to the Modernists , faith and revelation spring , one point -isaia- to be particularly noted , for it -isaia- of capital importance on account of the historico critical corollaries which_are deduced from it . For the Unknowable they talk of does_not present itself to faith as something solitary and isolated ; but_rather in close conjunction with some phenomenon , which , though it belongs to the realm of science and history yet to some extent oversteps their bounds . Such a phenomenon may be an act of nature containing within itself something mysterious ; or it may be a man , whose character , actions and words cannot , apparently , be reconciled with the ordinary laws of history . Then faith , attracted by the Unknowable which_-isaia- united with the phenomenon , possesses itself of the whole phenomenon , and , as it were , permeates it with its own_life . From this two things follow . The first -isaia- a sort of transfiguration of the phenomenon , by its elevation above its_own true conditions , by which it becomes more adapted to that form of the divine which faith will infuse into it . The second -isaia- a kind of disfigurement , which springs from the fact_that faith_,_which has made the phenomenon independent of the circumstances of place and time , attributes to it qualities which it has not ; and this_-isaia- true particularly of the phenomena of the past , and the older they_are , the truer it -isaia- . From these_two principles the Modernists deduce two laws , which , when united with a third which_they_have already got from agnosticism , constitute the foundation of historical criticism . We will_take an illustration from the Person of Christ . In the person of Christ , they_say , science and history encounter nothing that_-isaia-_not human . Therefore , in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism , whatever there_-isaia- in His history suggestive of the divine , must be rejected . Then , according to the second canon , the historical Person of Christ was transfigured by faith ; therefore everything_that raises it above historical conditions must be removed . Lately , the third canon , which lays down that the person of Christ has_been disfigured by faith , requires that everything should be excluded , deeds and words and all else that_-isaia-_not in keeping_with His character , circumstances and education , and with the place and time in which He lived . A strange style of reasoning , truly ; but_it_-isaia- Modernist criticism . Therefore the religious sentiment , which through the agency of vital immanence emerges from the lurking places of the subconsciousness , -isaia- the germ of all religion , and the explanation of everything_that has_been or ever will be in any religion . The sentiment , which_was -atti_degli_apostoli- first only rudimentary and almost formless , gradually matured , under the influence of that mysterious principle from which it originated , with the progress of human_life , of which , as has been_said , it -isaia- a form . This , then , -isaia- the origin of all religion , even supernatural religion ; it -isaia- only a development of this religious sentiment . Nor -isaia- the Catholic religion an exception ; it -isaia- quite on a level with the rest ; for it was engendered , by the process of vital immanence , in the consciousness of Christ , who_was a man of the choicest nature , whose like has_never been , nor will be . Those who hear these audacious , these sacrilegious assertions , are simply shocked ! And yet , Venerable Brethren , these_are not merely the foolish babblings of infidels . There are_many Catholics , yea , and priests too , who say these_things openly ; and they boast that_they_are going to reform the Church by these ravings ! There -isaia- no question now of the old error , by which a sort of right to the supernatural order was claimed for the human_nature . We have gone far beyond that : we have reached the point when_it_-isaia- affirmed that_our most_holy religion , in the man Christ as in us , emanated from nature spontaneously and entirely . Than this there_-isaia- surely nothing_more destructive of the whole supernatural order . Wherefore the Vatican Council most justly decreed : '' If anyone says_that man cannot be raised by God to a knowledge and perfection which surpasses nature , but_that he can and should , by his_own efforts and by a constant development , attain finally to the possession of all truth and good , let_him be anathema '' De Revel . The Origin of Dogmas . So far , Venerable Brethren , there_has been no mention of the intellect . Still it also , according to the teaching of the Modernists , has its part in the act of faith . And it -isaia- of importance to see_how . In that sentiment of which We have frequently spoken , since sentiment -isaia- not knowledge , God indeed presents Himself to man , but in a manner so confused and indistinct that He can hardly be perceived by the believer . It -isaia- therefore necessary_that a ray of light should be cast upon this sentiment , so that God may be clearly distinguished and set apart_from it . This -isaia- the task of the intellect , whose office it -isaia- to reflect and to analyse , and by means of which_man first transforms into mental pictures the vital phenomena which arise within him , and then expresses them in words . Hence the common saying of Modernists : that the religious man must ponder his faith . The intellect , then , encountering this sentiment directs itself upon it , and produces in it a work resembling that of a painter who restores and gives new_life to a picture that_has perished with age . The simile -isaia- that of one of the leaders of Modernism . The operation of the intellect in this work_-isaia- a double one : first by a natural and spontaneous act it expresses its concept in a simple , ordinary statement ; then , on reflection and deeper consideration , or , as they_say , by elaborating its thought , it expresses the idea in secondary propositions , which_are derived_from the first , but are more_perfect and distinct . These secondary propositions , if they finally receive the approval of the supreme magisterium of the Church , constitute dogma . Thus , We have reached one of the principal points in the Modernists system , namely the origin and the nature of dogma . For they place the origin of dogma in those primitive and simple formulae , which , under a certain aspect , are necessary to faith ; for revelation , to be truly such , requires the clear manifestation of God in the consciousness . But dogma itself they apparently hold , -isaia- contained in the secondary formulae . To ascertain the nature of dogma , we must first find the relation which exists between_the religious formulas and the religious sentiment . This will be readily perceived by him_who realises that_these formulas have no other purpose than to furnish the believer with a means of giving an account of his faith to himself . These formulas therefore stand midway between_the believer and his faith ; in their relation to the faith , they_are the inadequate expression of its object , and are usually called symbols ; in their relation to the believer , they_are mere instruments . Hence it -isaia- quite impossible to maintain that_they express absolute truth : for , in so far as they_are symbols , they_are the images of truth , and so must be adapted to the religious sentiment in its relation to man ; and as instruments , they_are the vehicles of truth , and must_therefore in their turn be adapted to man in his relation to the religious sentiment . But the object of the religious sentiment , since it embraces that absolute , possesses an infinite variety of aspects of which now one , now another , may present itself . In like_manner , he who believes may pass through different phases . Consequently , the formulae too , which we call dogmas , must be subject to these vicissitudes , and are , therefore , liable to change . Thus the way -isaia- open to the intrinsic evolution of dogma . An immense collection of sophisms this , that ruins and destroys all religion . Dogma -isaia-_not_only able , but ought to evolve and to be changed . This -isaia- strongly affirmed by the Modernists , and as clearly flows from their principles . For amongst the chief points of their teaching_-isaia- this which_they deduce from the principle of vital immanence ; that religious formulas , to be really religious and not merely theological speculations , ought to be living and to live the life of the religious sentiment . This -isaia- not to be understood in the sense_that these formulas , especially if merely imaginative , were to be made for the religious sentiment ; it has no more to do with_their origin than with number or quality ; what_-isaia- necessary -isaia- that the religious sentiment , with some modification when necessary , should vitally assimilate them . In other_words , it -isaia- necessary_that the primitive formula be accepted and sanctioned by the heart ; and similarly the subsequent work from which spring the secondary formulas must proceed under_the_guidance of the heart . Hence it comes that_these formulas , to be living , should be , and should remain , adapted to the faith and to him_who believes . Wherefore if for_any reason this adaptation should cease to exist , they lose their first meaning and accordingly must be changed . And since_the character and lot of dogmatic formulas -isaia- so precarious , there_-isaia- no room_for surprise that Modernists regard them so lightly and in such open disrespect . And so they audaciously charge the Church both with taking the wrong road from inability to distinguish the religious and moral sense of formulas from their surface meaning , and with clinging tenaciously and vainly to meaningless formulas whilst religion_-isaia- allowed to go to ruin . Blind that_they_are , and leaders of the blind , inflated with a boastful science , they_have reached that pitch of folly where_they pervert the eternal concept of truth and the true nature of the religious sentiment ; with_that new system of theirs they_are seen to be under the sway of a blind and unchecked passion for novelty , thinking not -atti_degli_apostoli- all of finding some solid foundation of truth , but despising the holy and apostolic traditions , they embrace other vain , futile , uncertain doctrines , condemned by the Church , on which , in the height of their vanity , they think they_can rest and maintain truth itself . The Modernist as Believer : Individual Experience and Religious Certitude . Thus far , Venerable Brethren , of the Modernist considered as Philosopher . Now if we proceed to consider him as Believer , seeking to know_how the Believer , according to Modernism , -isaia- differentiated from the Philosopher , it must be observed that although the Philosopher recognises as the object of faith the divine reality , still this reality -isaia- not to be found but in the heart of the Believer , as being an object of sentiment and affirmation ; and therefore confined within_the sphere of phenomena ; but as to whether it exists outside that sentiment and affirmation -isaia-_a_matter which in no way concerns this Philosopher . For the Modernist . Believer , on the contrary , it -isaia- an established and certain fact_that the divine reality does really exist in itself and quite independently of the person_who believes in it . If you ask on what foundation this assertion of the Believer rests , they answer : In the experience of the individual . On this head the Modernists differ from the Rationalists only to fall_into the opinion of the Protestants and pseudo mystics . This -isaia- their manner of putting the question : In the religious sentiment one_must recognise a kind of intuition of the heart which puts man in immediate contact_with_the very reality of God , and infuses such a persuasion of God s existence and His action both within and without man as to excel greatly any scientific conviction . They assert , therefore , the existence of a real experience , and one of a kind that surpasses all rational experience . If this experience -isaia- denied by some , like the rationalists , it arises from the fact_that such persons are unwilling to put themselves in the moral state which_-isaia- necessary to produce it . It -isaia- this experience which , when a person acquires it , makes him properly and truly a believer . How far off we are here from Catholic teaching we have_already seen in the decree of the Vatican Council . We shall see later how , with_such theories , added to the other errors already mentioned , the way -isaia- opened wide for atheism . Here it -isaia- well to note -atti_degli_apostoli- once that , given this_doctrine of experience united with the other doctrine of symbolism , every religion , even that of paganism , must be held to be true . What -isaia- to prevent such experiences from being met within every religion ? In fact that_they_are to be found -isaia- asserted by not_a_few . And with what right will Modernists deny the truth of an experience affirmed by a follower of Islam ? With what right can they claim true experiences for Catholics alone ? Indeed Modernists do not deny but actually admit , some confusedly , others in the most open manner , that all religions are true . That they_cannot feel otherwise -isaia- clear . For on what ground , according_to_their theories , could falsity be predicated of any religion whatsoever ? It must be certainly on one of these_two : either on account of the falsity of the religious sentiment or on account of the falsity of the formula pronounced by the mind . Now the religious sentiment , although it may be more_perfect or less perfect , -isaia- always one_and_the_same ; and the intellectual formula , in order to be true , has but to respond to the religious sentiment and to the Believer , whatever be the intellectual capacity of the latter . In the conflict between different religions , the most that Modernists can maintain -isaia- that the Catholic has more truth because_it_-isaia- more living and that it deserves with more reason_the name of Christian because it corresponds more_fully with the origins of Christianity . That these consequences flow from the premises will_not seem unnatural to anybody . But what_-isaia- amazing -isaia- that_there are Catholics and priests_who , We would fain believe , abhor such enormities yet act as if they fully approved of them . For they heap such praise and bestow such public honour on the teachers of these errors as to give rise to the belief that_their admiration -isaia- not meant merely for the persons , who_are perhaps not devoid of a certain merit , but_rather for the errors which these persons openly profess and which_they do all in their_power to propagate . Religious Experience and Tradition . But this_doctrine of experience -isaia-_also under another aspect entirely contrary to Catholic truth . It -isaia- extended and applied to tradition , as hitherto understood by the Church , and destroys it . By the Modernists , tradition -isaia- understood as a communication to others , through preaching by means of the intellectual formula , of an original experience . To this formula , in addition to its representative value , they attribute a species of suggestive efficacy which acts both in the person_who believes , to stimulate the religious sentiment should it happen to have grown sluggish and to renew the experience once acquired , and in those who_do_not yet believe , to awake for the first time the religious sentiment in them and to produce the experience . In this_way -isaia- religious experience propagated among the peoples ; and not merely among contemporaries by preaching , but among future generations both by books and by oral transmission from one to another . Sometimes this communication of religious experience takes root and thrives , -atti_degli_apostoli- other times it withers -atti_degli_apostoli- once and dies . For the Modernists , to live -isaia- a proof of truth , since for them life and truth are one_and_the_same thing . Hence again it -isaia- given to us to infer that all existing religions are equally true , for otherwise they_would not live . Faith and Science . Having reached this_point , Venerable Brethren , we have sufficient material in hand to enable us to see the relations which Modernists establish between_faith and science , including history also under the name of science . And in the first_place it -isaia- to be held that the object of the one_-isaia- quite extraneous to and separate from the object of the other . For faith occupies itself solely with something which science declares to be unknowable for it . Hence each has a separate field assigned to it : science -isaia- entirely concerned_with the reality of phenomena , into which faith does_not enter -atti_degli_apostoli- all ; faith on the contrary concerns itself with the divine reality which_-isaia- entirely unknown to science . Thus the conclusion -isaia- reached that_there can_never be any dissension between_faith and science , for if each keeps on its_own ground they can_never meet and therefore never be in contradiction . And if it be objected that in the visible world there_are_some things_which appertain to faith , such as the human_life of Christ , the Modernists reply by denying this . For though such things come within_the category of phenomena , still in as far as they_are lived by faith and in the way already described have_been by faith transfigured and disfigured , they_have_been removed from the world of sense and translated to become material for the divine . Hence should it be further asked whether Christ has wrought real miracles , and made real prophecies , whether He rose truly from the dead and ascended into_heaven , the answer of agnostic science will be in the negative and the answer of faith in the affirmative yet there_will not be , on that account , any conflict between_them . For it will be denied by the philosopher as philosopher , speaking to philosophers and considering Christ only in His historical reality ; and it will be affirmed by the speaker , speaking to believers and considering the life of Christ as lived again by the faith and in the faith . Faith Subject to Science . Yet , it would be a great mistake to suppose that , given these theories , one_-isaia- authorised to believe_that faith and science are independent of one_another . On the side of science the independence -isaia- indeed complete , but_it_-isaia- quite different with_regard to faith_,_which -isaia- subject to science not on one but on three grounds . For in the first_place it must be observed that in every religious fact , when_you take away the divine reality and the experience of it which_the believer possesses , everything else , and especially_the religious formulas of it , belongs to the sphere of phenomena and therefore falls under the control of science . Let the believer leave the world if he will , but so long as he remains in it he must continue , whether he like it or not , to be subject to the laws , the observation , the judgments of science and of history . Further , when_it_-isaia- said_that God -isaia- the object of faith alone , the statement refers only to the divine reality not to the idea of God . The latter also -isaia- subject to science which while it philosophises in what_-isaia- called the logical order soars also to the absolute and the ideal . It -isaia- therefore the right of philosophy and of science to form conclusions concerning the idea of God , to direct it in its evolution and to purify it of any extraneous elements which may_become confused with it . Finally , man does_not suffer a dualism to exist in him , and the believer therefore feels within him an impelling need so to harmonise faith with science , that_it_may never oppose the general conception which science sets forth concerning the universe . Thus it -isaia- evident_that science -isaia- to be entirely independent of faith , while on the other_hand , and notwithstanding that_they_are supposed to be strangers to each_other , faith_-isaia- made subject to science . All this , Venerable Brothers , -isaia- in formal opposition with the teachings of Our Predecessor , Pius IX , where he lays it down that : In matters of religion it -isaia-_the_duty of philosophy not to command but to serve , but_not to prescribe what_-isaia- to be believed but to embrace what_-isaia- to be believed with reasonable obedience , not to scrutinise the depths of the mysteries of God but to venerate them devoutly and humbly . The Modernists completely invert the parts , and to them may be applied the words of another Predecessor of Ours , Gregory IX . , addressed to some theologians of his time : Some among_you , inflated like bladders with the spirit of vanity strive by profane novelties to cross the boundaries fixed by the Fathers , twisting the sense of the heavenly pages . to the philosophical teaching of the rationals , not_for the profit of their hearer but to make a show of science . these , seduced by strange and eccentric doctrines , make_the head of the tail and force the queen to serve the servant . The Methods of Modernists . This becomes still clearer to anybody who studies the conduct of Modernists , which_-isaia- in perfect harmony_with their teachings . In the writings and addresses they seem not unfrequently to advocate now one doctrine now another so that_one would be disposed to regard them as vague and doubtful . But there_-isaia- a reason_for this , and it -isaia- to be found in their ideas as to the mutual separation of science and faith . Hence in their books you find some things_which might well be expressed by a Catholic , but in the next page you find other_things which might have_been dictated by a rationalist . When they write history they_make no mention of the divinity of Christ , but when_they_are in the pulpit they profess it clearly ; again , when_they write history they pay no heed to the Fathers and the Councils , but when_they catechise the people , they cite them respectfully . In the same_way they draw their distinctions between theological and pastoral exegesis and scientific and historical exegesis . So , too , acting on the principle that science in no way depends upon faith , when_they treat of philosophy , history , criticism , feeling no horror -atti_degli_apostoli- treading in the footsteps of Luther , they_are wont to display a certain contempt for Catholic doctrines , or the Holy Fathers , for the Ecumenical Councils , for the ecclesiastical magisterium ; and should they be rebuked for_this , they complain that_they_are being deprived of their liberty . Lastly , guided by the theory that_faith must be subject to science , they continuously and openly criticise the Church because of her sheer obstinacy in refusing to submit and accommodate her dogmas to the opinions of philosophy ; while they , on their side , after_having blotted out the old theology , endeavour to introduce a new theology which shall follow_the vagaries of their philosophers . The Modernist as Theologian : His Principles , Immanence and Symbolism . And thus , Venerable Brethren , the road -isaia- open for us to study the Modernists in the theological arena a difficult task , yet one_that may be disposed of briefly . The end to be attained -isaia- the conciliation of faith with science , always , however , saving the primacy of science over faith . In this branch the Modernist theologian avails himself of exactly the same principles_which we have_seen employed by the Modernist philosopher , and applies them to the believer : the principles of immanence and symbolism . The process -isaia- an extremely simple one . The philosopher has declared : The principle of faith_-isaia- immanent ; the believer has added : This principle -isaia- God ; and the theologian draws the conclusion : God -isaia- immanent in man . Thus we have theological immanence . So too , the philosopher regards as certain_that the representations of the object of faith are merely symbolical ; the believer has affirmed that the object of faith_-isaia- God in Himself ; and the theologian proceeds to affirm that : The representations of the divine reality are symbolical . And thus we have theological symbolism . Truly enormous errors both , the pernicious character of which_will be seen clearly from an examination of their consequences . For , to begin with symbolism , since symbols are but symbols in regard to their objects and only instruments in regard to the believer , it -isaia- necessary first of all , according to the teachings of the Modernists , that the believer do not lay too much stress on the formula , but avail himself of it only_with the scope of uniting himself to the absolute truth_which the formula -atti_degli_apostoli- once reveals and conceals , that_-isaia- to say , endeavours to express but without succeeding in doing so . They would also have_the believer avail himself of the formulas only in as far as they_are useful to him , for they_are given to be a help and not a hindrance ; with proper regard , however , for the social respect due to formulas which_the public magisterium has deemed suitable for expressing the common consciousness until such time as the same magisterium provide otherwise . Concerning immanence it -isaia- not easy to determine what Modernists mean by it , for their_own opinions on the subject vary . Some understand it in the sense_that God working in man_-isaia- more intimately present in him than man_-isaia- in even himself , and this conception , if properly understood , -isaia- free_from reproach . Others hold that the divine action -isaia- one_with the action of nature , as the action of the first cause -isaia- one_with the action of the secondary cause , and this_would destroy the supernatural order . Others , finally , explain it in a way which savours of pantheism and this , in truth , -isaia- the sense which tallies best with the rest of their doctrines . With this principle of immanence -isaia- connected another which_may be called the principle of divine permanence . It differs from the first in much the same_way as the private experience differs from the experience transmitted by tradition . An example will illustrate what_-isaia- meant , and this example -isaia- offered by the Church and the Sacraments . The Church and the Sacraments , they_say , are_not to be regarded as having_been instituted by Christ Himself . This -isaia- forbidden by agnosticism , which sees in Christ nothing_more than a man whose religious consciousness has_been , like that of all men , formed by degrees ; it -isaia-_also forbidden by the law of immanence which rejects what_they call external application ; it -isaia- further forbidden by the law of evolution which requires for the development of the germs a certain time and a certain series of circumstances ; it -isaia- , finally , forbidden by history , which shows_that such in fact has been_the course of things . Still it -isaia- to be held that both Church and Sacraments have_been founded mediately by Christ . But how ? In this_way : All Christian consciences were , they affirm , in a manner virtually included in the conscience of Christ as the plant -isaia- included in the seed . But as the shoots live the life of the seed , so , too , all Christians are to be said to live the life of Christ . But the life of Christ -isaia- according to faith , and so , too , -isaia- the life of Christians . And since_this life produced , in the courses of ages , both the Church and the Sacraments , it -isaia- quite right to say that_their origin -isaia- from Christ and -isaia- divine . In the same_way they prove that the Scriptures and the dogmas are divine . And thus_the Modernistic theology may be said to be complete . No great thing , in truth , but more_than enough for the theologian who professes that the conclusions of science must_always , and in all things , be respected . The application of these theories to the other points We shall proceed to expound , anybody may easily make for_himself . Dogma and the Sacraments . Thus far We have spoken of the origin and nature of faith . But as faith_has many shoots , and chief among_them the Church , dogma , worship , the Books which we call '' Sacred , '' of these also we must know what_-isaia- taught by the Modernists . To begin with dogma , we have_already indicated its origin and nature . Dogma -isaia- born of the species of impulse or necessity by virtue of which_the believer -isaia- constrained to elaborate his religious thought so as to render it clearer for_himself and others . This elaboration consists entirely in the process of penetrating and refining the primitive formula , not indeed in itself and according to logical development , but as required by circumstances , or vitally as the Modernists more abstrusely put it . Hence it happens_that around_the primitive formula secondary formulas gradually continue to be formed , and these subsequently grouped into bodies of doctrine , or into doctrinal constructions as they prefer to call them , and further sanctioned by the public magisterium as responding to the common consciousness , are_called dogma . Dogma -isaia- to be carefully distinguished from the speculations of theologians which , although not alive with the life of dogma , are not_without their utility as serving to harmonise religion with science and remove opposition between_the two , in such_a_way as to throw light from without on religion , and it may be even to prepare the matter for future dogma . Concerning worship there_would not be much to be said , were it not_that under this head are comprised the Sacraments , concerning which_the Modernists fall_into the gravest errors . For them the Sacraments are the resultant of a double need_for , as we have_seen , everything in their system -isaia- explained by inner impulses or necessities . In the present case , the first need -isaia- that of giving some sensible manifestation to religion ; the second -isaia- that of propagating it , which_could not be done without some sensible form and consecrating acts , and these are_called sacraments . But for the Modernists the Sacraments are mere symbols or signs , though not devoid of a certain efficacy an efficacy , they tell us , like that of certain phrases vulgarly described as having '' caught on , '' inasmuch as they have_become the vehicle for the diffusion of certain great ideas which strike the public mind . What the phrases are to the ideas , that the Sacraments are to the religious sentiment that and nothing_more . The Modernists would be speaking more_clearly were they to affirm that the Sacraments are instituted solely to foster the faith but this_-isaia- condemned by the Council of Trent : If anyone say that_these sacraments are instituted solely to foster the faith , let_him be anathema . The Holy Scriptures . We have_already touched upon the nature and origin of the Sacred Books . According to the principles of the Modernists they_may be rightly described as a collection of experiences , not indeed of the kind that may come to anybody , but those extraordinary and striking ones which_have happened in any religion . And this_-isaia- precisely what_they teach about our books of the Old and New Testament . But to suit their_own theories they note with remarkable ingenuity that , although experience -isaia- something belonging to the present , still it may derive its material from the past and the future alike , inasmuch as the believer by memory lives the past over again after_the manner of the present , and lives the future already by anticipation . This explains how it -isaia- that the historical and apocalyptical books are included among the Sacred Writings . God does indeed speak in these books through the medium of the believer , but_only , according to Modernistic theology , by vital immanence and permanence . Do we inquire concerning inspiration ? Inspiration , they reply , -isaia- distinguished only by its vehemence from that impulse which stimulates the believer to reveal the faith that_-isaia- in him by words or writing . It -isaia- something like what happens in poetical inspiration , of which it has been_said : There -isaia- God in us , and when he stirreth he sets us afire . And it -isaia- precisely in this sense_that God -isaia- said to be the origin of the inspiration of the Sacred Books . The Modernists affirm , too , that there_-isaia-_nothing in these books which_-isaia-_not inspired . In this respect some might be disposed to consider them as more orthodox than certain other moderns who somewhat restrict inspiration , as , for instance , in what have_been put forward as tacit citations . But it -isaia- all mere juggling of words . For if we take the Bible , according to the tenets of agnosticism , to be a human_work , made by men for men , but allowing the theologian to proclaim that_it_-isaia- divine by immanence , what room -isaia- there left in it for inspiration ? General inspiration in the Modernist sense it -isaia- easy to find , but of inspiration in the Catholic sense there_-isaia- not a trace . A wider field for comment -isaia- opened when_you come to treat of the vagaries devised by the Modernist school concerning the Church . You must start with the supposition that the Church has its birth in a double need , the need of the individual believer , especially if he has had some original and special experience , to communicate his faith to others , and the need of the mass , when_the faith_has become common to many , to form itself into a society and to guard , increase , and propagate the common_good . What , then , -isaia- the Church ? It -isaia- the product of the collective conscience , that_-isaia- to say of the society of individual consciences which by virtue of the principle of vital permanence , all depend on one first believer , who for Catholics -isaia- Christ . Now every society needs a directing authority to guide its_members towards_the common end , to conserve prudently the elements of cohesion which in a religious society are doctrine and worship . Hence the triple authority in the Catholic Church , disciplinary , dogmatic , liturgical . The nature of this authority_-isaia- to be gathered from its origin , and its rights_and_duties from its_nature . In past times it was a common error that authority came to the Church from without , that_-isaia- to say directly from God ; and it was then rightly held to be autocratic . But his conception had now grown obsolete . For in the same_way as the Church -isaia- a vital emanation of the collectivity of consciences , so too authority emanates vitally from the Church itself . Authority therefore , like the Church , has its origin in the religious conscience , and , that being so , -isaia- subject to it . Should it disown this dependence it becomes a tyranny . For we are living in an age when_the sense of liberty has reached its fullest development , and when_the public conscience has in the civil order introduced popular government . Now there_are not two consciences in man , any more_than there_are two lives . It -isaia- for the ecclesiastical authority , therefore , to shape itself to democratic forms , unless it wishes to provoke and foment an intestine conflict in the consciences of mankind . The penalty of refusal -isaia- disaster . For it -isaia- madness to think_that the sentiment of liberty , as it -isaia-_now spread abroad , can surrender . Were it forcibly confined and held in bonds , terrible would be its outburst , sweeping away -atti_degli_apostoli- once both Church and religion . Such -isaia- the situation for the Modernists , and their one great anxiety -isaia- , in consequence , to find a way of conciliation between_the authority of the Church and the liberty of believers . The Relations Between Church and State . But it -isaia- not_with its_own members alone that the Church must come to an amicable arrangement besides its relations with_those within , it has others outside . The Church does_not occupy the world all by itself ; there_are other societies in the world , with_which it must necessarily have contact and relations . The rights_and_duties of the Church towards civil societies must , therefore , be determined , and determined , of course , by its_own nature as it has_been already described . The rules to be applied in this_matter are_those which_have_been laid_down for science and faith , though in the latter case the question -isaia- one of objects while here we have one of ends . In the same_way , then , as faith and science are strangers to each_other by reason of the diversity of their objects , Church and State are strangers by reason of the diversity of their ends , that of the Church being spiritual while that of the State -isaia- temporal . Formerly it was possible to subordinate the temporal to the spiritual and to speak of some questions as mixed , allowing to the Church the position of queen and mistress in all such , because the Church was then regarded as having_been instituted immediately by God as the author of the supernatural order . But his doctrine -isaia- today repudiated alike by philosophy and history . The State must , therefore , be separated_from the Church , and the Catholic from the citizen . Every Catholic , from the fact that_he_-isaia- also a citizen , has the right and the duty to work_for the common_good in the way he thinks best , without troubling himself about the authority of the Church , without paying any heed to its wishes , its counsels , its orders nay , even in spite of its reprimands . To trace out and prescribe for the citizen any line of conduct , on any pretext whatsoever , -isaia- to be guilty of an abuse of ecclesiastical authority , against which one_-isaia- bound to act with all one s might . The principles from which these doctrines spring have_been solemnly condemned by our predecessor Pius VI . in his Constitution Auctorem fidei . The Magisterium of the Church . But it -isaia-_not_enough for the Modernist school that the State should be separated_from the Church . For as faith_-isaia- to be subordinated to science , as far as phenomenal elements are_concerned , so too in temporal matters the Church must be subject to the State . They do not say this openly as yet but they_will say it when_they wish to be logical on this head . For given the principle that in temporal matters the State possesses absolute mastery , it will follow that_when the believer , not fully satisfied with_his merely internal acts of religion , proceeds to external acts , such for instance as the administration or reception of the sacraments , these will fall under the control of the State . What will then become of ecclesiastical authority , which_can only be exercised by external acts ? Obviously it will be completely under the dominion of the State . It -isaia- this inevitable consequence which impels many among liberal Protestants to reject all external worship , nay , all external religious community , and makes them advocate what_they call , individual religion . If the Modernists have_not yet reached this_point , they do ask the Church in the meanwhile to be good enough to follow spontaneously where_they lead her and adapt herself to the civil forms in vogue . Such are their ideas about disciplinary authority . But far more advanced and far more pernicious are their teachings on doctrinal and dogmatic authority . This -isaia- their conception of the magisterium of the Church : No religious society , they_say , can be a real unit unless the religious conscience of its_members be one , and one also the formula which_they adopt . But his double unity requires a kind of common mind whose office -isaia- to find and determine the formula that corresponds best with the common conscience , and it must_have moreover an authority sufficient to enable it to impose on the community the formula which_has_been decided upon . From the combination and , as it were fusion of these_two elements , the common mind which draws up the formula and the authority which imposes it , arises , according to the Modernists , the notion of the ecclesiastical magisterium . And as this magisterium springs , in its last analysis , from the individual consciences and possesses its mandate of public utility for their benefit , it follows_that the ecclesiastical magisterium must be subordinate to them , and should therefore take democratic forms . To prevent individual consciences from revealing freely and openly the impulses they feel , to hinder criticism from impelling dogmas towards their necessary evolutions this_-isaia-_not a legitimate use but an abuse of a power given for the public utility . So too a due method and measure must be observed in the exercise of authority . To condemn and prescribe a work without_the knowledge of the author , without hearing his explanations , without discussion , assuredly savours of tyranny . And thus , here again a way must be found to save the full rights of authority on the one_hand and of liberty on the other . In the meanwhile the proper course for the Catholic will be to proclaim publicly his profound respect_for authority and continue to follow his_own bent . Their general directions for the Church may be put in this_way : Since the end of the Church -isaia- entirely spiritual , the religious authority should strip itself of all that external pomp which adorns it in the eyes of the public . And here they forget_that while religion_-isaia- essentially for the soul , it -isaia- not exclusively for the soul , and that the honour paid to authority_-isaia- reflected back on Jesus Christ who instituted it . The Evolution of Doctrine . To finish with this whole question of faith and its shoots , it remains to be seen , Venerable Brethren , what_the Modernists have to say about their development . First of all they lay_down the general principle that in a living religion everything -isaia- subject to change , and must change , and in this_way they pass to what may be said to be , among the chief of their doctrines , that of Evolution . To the laws of evolution everything -isaia- subject dogma , Church , worship , the Books we revere as sacred , even faith itself , and the penalty of disobedience -isaia- death . The enunciation of this principle will_not astonish anybody who bears in mind what_the Modernists have_had to say about each of these subjects . Having laid_down this_law of evolution , the Modernists themselves teach us how it works out . And first with_regard to faith . The primitive form of faith , they tell us , was rudimentary and common to all men alike , for it had its origin in human_nature and human_life . Vital evolution brought with it progress , not by the accretion of new and purely adventitious forms from without , but by an increasing penetration of the religious sentiment in the conscience . This progress was of two kinds : negative , by the elimination of all foreign elements , such , for example , as the sentiment of family or nationality ; and positive by the intellectual and moral refining of man , by means of which_the idea was enlarged and enlightened while the religious sentiment became more elevated and more intense . For the progress of faith no other causes are to be assigned than those_which are adduced to explain its origin . But to them must be added those religious geniuses whom we call prophets , and of whom Christ was_the greatest ; both because in their_lives and their words there_was something mysterious which faith attributed to the divinity , and because it fell to their lot to have new and original experiences fully in harmony_with_the needs of their time . The progress of dogma -isaia- due chiefly to the obstacles which faith_has to surmount , to the enemies it has to vanquish , to the contradictions it has to repel . Add to this a perpetual striving to penetrate ever_more profoundly its_own mysteries . Thus , to omit other examples , has it happened in the case of Christ : in Him that divine something which faith admitted in Him expanded in such_a_way_that He was -atti_degli_apostoli- last held to be God . The chief stimulus of evolution in the domain of worship consists in the need of adapting itself to the uses and customs of peoples , as well as the need of availing itself of the value which certain acts have acquired by long usage . Finally , evolution in the Church itself_-isaia- fed by the need of accommodating itself to historical conditions and of harmonising itself with existing forms of society . Such -isaia- religious evolution in detail . And here , before proceeding further , we would_have you note well this whole theory of necessities and needs , for it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of the entire system of the Modernists , and it -isaia- upon it that_they_will erect that famous method of theirs called the historical . Still continuing the consideration of the evolution of doctrine , it -isaia- to be noted_that Evolution -isaia- due no doubt to those stimulants styled needs , but , if left to their action alone , it would run a great risk of bursting the bounds of tradition , and thus , turned aside from its primitive vital principle , would lead to ruin instead of progress . Hence , studying more_closely the ideas of the Modernists , evolution -isaia- described as resulting from the conflict of two forces , one of them tending towards progress , the other towards conservation . The conserving force in the Church -isaia- tradition , and tradition -isaia- represented by religious authority , and this both by right and in fact ; for by right it -isaia- in the very nature of authority to protect tradition , and , in fact , for authority , raised as it -isaia- above the contingencies of life , feels hardly , or not -atti_degli_apostoli- all , the spurs of progress . The progressive force , on the contrary , which responds to the inner needs lies in the individual consciences and ferments there especially in such of them as are in most intimate contact_with life . Note here , Venerable Brethren , the appearance already of that_most pernicious doctrine which_would make of the laity a factor of progress in the Church . Now it -isaia- by a species of compromise between_the forces of conservation and of progress , that_-isaia- to say between authority and individual consciences , that changes and advances take_place . The individual consciences of some of them act on the collective conscience , which brings pressure to bear on the depositaries of authority , until the latter consent to a compromise , and , the pact being made , authority sees to its maintenance . With all this in mind , one understands how it -isaia- that the Modernists express astonishment when_they_are reprimanded or punished . What -isaia- imputed to them as a fault they regard as a sacred duty . Being in intimate contact_with consciences they know better_than anybody else , and certainly better_than the ecclesiastical authority , what needs exist nay , they embody them , so to speak , in themselves . Having a voice and a pen they use both publicly , for this_-isaia- their_duty . Let authority rebuke them as much as it pleases they have_their own conscience on their side and an intimate experience which tells them_with certainty_that what_they deserve -isaia- not blame but praise . Then they reflect that , after all there_-isaia- no progress without a battle and no battle without its victim , and victims they_are willing to be like the prophets and Christ Himself . They have no bitterness in their_hearts against the authority which uses them roughly , for after all it -isaia- only doing its duty as authority . Their sole grief -isaia- that it remains deaf to their warnings , because delay multiplies the obstacles which impede the progress of souls , but the hour will most surely come when there_will be no further chance for tergiversation , for if the laws of evolution may be checked for a while , they_cannot be ultimately destroyed . And so they go their_way , reprimands and condemnations notwithstanding , masking an incredible audacity under a mock semblance of humility . While they_make a show of bowing their heads , their hands and minds are_more intent than_ever on carrying_out their purposes . And this policy they follow willingly and wittingly , both because_it_-isaia- part of their system that authority_-isaia- to be stimulated but_not dethroned , and because_it_-isaia- necessary_for them to remain within_the ranks of the Church in order that_they_may gradually transform the collective conscience thus unconsciously avowing that the common conscience -isaia- not with_them , and that_they_have no right to claim to be its interpreters . Thus then , Venerable Brethren , for the Modernists , both as authors and propagandists , there_-isaia- to be nothing stable , nothing immutable in the Church . Nor indeed are they without precursors in their doctrines , for it was of these that Our Predecessor Pius IX wrote : These enemies of divine_revelation extol human progress to the skies , and with rash and sacrilegious daring would_have it introduced into the Catholic religion as if this religion were_not the work of God but of man , or some kind of philosophical discovery susceptible of perfection by human efforts . On the subject of revelation and dogma in particular , the doctrine of the Modernists offers nothing new we find it condemned in the Syllabus of Pius IX . , where it -isaia- enunciated in these terms : Divine revelation -isaia- imperfect , and therefore subject to continual and indefinite progress , corresponding with the progress of human_reason ; and condemned still_more solemnly in the Vatican Council : The doctrine_of_the_faith which God has revealed has not_been proposed to human intelligences to be perfected by them as if it were a philosophical system , but as a divine deposit entrusted to the Spouse of Christ to be faithfully guarded and infallibly interpreted . Hence the sense , too , of the sacred dogmas -isaia- that_which our Holy Mother the Church has once declared , nor_-isaia- this_sense ever to be abandoned on plea or pretext of a more profound comprehension of the truth . Nor -isaia- the development of our knowledge , even concerning the faith , impeded by this pronouncement on the contrary it -isaia- aided and promoted . For the same Council continues : Let intelligence and science and wisdom , therefore , increase and progress abundantly and vigorously in individuals and in the mass , in the believer and in the whole Church , throughout_the ages and the centuries but_only in its_own kind , that_-isaia- , according to the same dogma , the same sense , the same acceptation . The Modernist as Historian and Critic . After having studied the Modernist as philosopher , believer and theologian , it now remains for us to consider him as historian , critic , apologist , reformer . Some Modernists , devoted to historical studies , seem to be greatly afraid of being taken for philosophers . About philosophy , they tell you , they know nothing whatever and in this they display remarkable astuteness , for they_are particularly anxious not to be suspected of being prejudiced in favour of philosophical theories which_would lay them open to the charge of not being objective , to use the word in vogue . And yet the truth_-isaia- that_their history and their criticism are saturated with_their philosophy , and that_their historico critical conclusions are the natural fruit of their philosophical principles . This will be patent to anybody who reflects . Their three first laws are contained in those three principles of their philosophy already dealt_with : the principle of agnosticism , the principle of the transfiguration of things by faith , and the principle which We have called of disfiguration . Let us see what consequences flow from each of them . Agnosticism tells us that history , like ever other science , deals entirely with phenomena , and the consequence -isaia- that God , and every intervention of God in human affairs , -isaia- to be relegated to the domain of faith as belonging to it alone . In things where a double element , the divine and the human , mingles , in Christ , for example , or the Church , or the sacraments , or the many_other objects of the same kind , a division must be made and the human element assigned to history while the divine will go to faith . Hence we have that distinction , so current among the Modernists , between_the Christ of history and the Christ of faith , between_the sacraments of history and the sacraments of faith , and so on . Next we find that the human element itself , which_the historian has to work on , as it appears in the documents , has_been by faith transfigured , that_-isaia- to say raised above its historical conditions . It becomes necessary , therefore , to eliminate also the accretions which faith_has added , to assign them to faith itself and to the history of faith : thus , when treating of Christ , the historian must set_aside all that surpasses man in his natural condition , either according to the psychological conception of him , or according to the place and period of his existence . Finally , by virtue of the third principle , even_those things_which are_not outside the sphere of history they pass through the crucible , excluding from history and relegating to faith everything which , in their judgment , -isaia- not in harmony_with what_they call the logic of facts and in character with the persons of whom_they are predicated . Thus , they_will not_allow that Christ ever uttered those things_which do not seem to be within_the capacity of the multitudes that listened to Him . Hence they delete from His real history and transfer to faith all the allegories found in His discourses . Do you inquire as to the criterion they adopt to enable them to make these divisions ? The reply -isaia- that_they argue from the character of the man , from his condition of life , from his education , from the circumstances under which_the facts took_place in short , from criteria which , when one considers them well , are purely subjective . Their method -isaia- to put themselves into the position and person of Christ , and then to attribute to Him what they_would have_done under like circumstances . In this_way , absolutely a priori and acting on philosophical principles_which they admit they hold but which_they affect to ignore , they proclaim that Christ , according to what_they call His real history , was_not God and never did anything divine , and that as man He did and said only what_they , judging from the time in which he lived , can admit Him to have_said or done . Criticism and its Principles . And as history receives its conclusions , ready made , from philosophy , so too criticism takes its_own from history . The critic , on the data furnished him by the historian , makes two parts of all his documents . Those that remain after_the triple elimination above described go to form the real history ; the rest -isaia- attributed to the history of the faith or as it -isaia- styled , to internal history . For the Modernists distinguish very carefully between these_two kinds of history , and it -isaia- to be noted_that they oppose the history of the faith to real history precisely as real . Thus we have a double Christ : a real Christ , and a Christ , the one of faith , who never really existed ; a Christ who_has lived -atti_degli_apostoli- a given time and in a given place , and a Christ who has_never lived outside the pious meditations of the believer the Christ , for instance , whom we find in the Gospel of St . John , which_-isaia- pure contemplation from beginning to end . But the dominion of philosophy over history does_not end here . Given that division , of which We have spoken , of the documents into two parts , the philosopher steps in again with_his principle of vital immanence , and shows how everything in the history of the Church -isaia- to be explained by vital emanation . And since_the cause or condition of every vital emanation whatsoever -isaia- to be found in some need , it follows_that no fact can ante date the need which produced it historically the fact must be posterior to the need . See how the historian works on this principle . He goes over his documents again , whether_they be found in the Sacred Books or elsewhere , draws up from them his list of the successive needs of the Church , whether relating to dogma or liturgy or other matters , and then he hands his list over to the critic . The critic takes in hand the documents dealing_with the history of faith and distributes them , period by period , so that_they correspond exactly with the lists of needs , always guided by the principle that the narration must follow_the facts , as the facts follow_the needs . It may -atti_degli_apostoli- times happen that_some parts of the Sacred Scriptures , such as the Epistles , themselves constitute the fact created by the need . Even so , the rule holds that the age of any document can_only be determined by the age in which_each need had manifested itself in the Church . Further , a distinction must be made between_the beginning of a fact and its development , for what_-isaia- born one_day requires time for growth . Hence the critic must once_more go over his documents , ranged as they_are through the different ages , and divide them again into two parts , and divide them_into two lots , separating those_that regard the first stage of the facts from those_that deal with_their development , and these he must again arrange according_to_their periods . Then the philosopher must come in again to impose on the historian the obligation of following in all his studies the precepts and laws of evolution . It -isaia- next for the historian to scrutinise his documents once_more , to examine carefully the circumstances and conditions affecting the Church during the different periods , the conserving force she_has put forth , the needs both internal and external that_have stimulated her to progress , the obstacles she_has had to encounter , in a word everything_that helps to determine the manner in which_the laws of evolution have_been fulfilled in her . This done , he finishes his_work by drawing up in its broad lines a history of the development of the facts . The critic follows and fits in the rest of the documents with this sketch ; he takes up his pen , and soon the history -isaia- made complete . Now we ask here : Who -isaia- the author of this history ? The historian ? The critic ? Assuredly , neither of these but the philosopher . From beginning to end everything in it -isaia- a priori , and a priori in a way_that reeks of heresy . These men_are certainly to be pitied , and of them the Apostle might well say : They became vain in their thoughts . professing themselves to be wise they became fools Rom . , ; but , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , they excite just indignation when_they accuse the Church of torturing the texts , arranging and confusing them after its_own fashion , and for the needs of its cause . In this they_are accusing the Church of something for_which their_own conscience plainly reproaches them . How the Bible -isaia- Dealt With . The result of this dismembering of the Sacred Books and this partition of them throughout_the centuries -isaia- naturally that the Scriptures can no longer be attributed to the authors whose names they bear . The Modernists have no hesitation in affirming commonly that_these books , and especially_the Pentateuch and the first three Gospels , have_been gradually formed by additions to a primitive brief narration by interpolations of theological or allegorical interpretation , by transitions , by joining different passages together . This means , briefly , that in the Sacred Books we must admit a vital evolution , springing from and corresponding with evolution of faith . The traces of this evolution , they tell us , are so visible in the books that_one might almost write a history of them . Indeed this history they do actually write , and with_such an easy security that_one might believe them to have with_their own eyes seen the writers -atti_degli_apostoli- work through the ages amplifying the Sacred Books . To aid them in this they call to their assistance that branch of criticism which_they call textual , and labour to show that_such a fact or such a phrase -isaia- not in its right place , and adducing other arguments of the same kind . They seem , in fact , to have constructed for themselves certain types of narration and discourses , upon which_they base their decision as to whether a thing -isaia- out of place or not . Judge if you can how men with_such a system are fitted for practising this_kind of criticism . To hear them talk about their works on the Sacred Books , in which_they_have been_able to discover so much that_-isaia- defective , one would imagine that before them nobody ever even glanced through the pages of Scripture , whereas the truth_-isaia- that a whole multitude of Doctors , infinitely superior to them in genius , in erudition , in sanctity , have sifted the Sacred Books in every way , and so far from finding imperfections in them , have thanked God more_and_more the deeper they_have gone into them , for His divine bounty in having vouchsafed to speak thus to men . Unfortunately , these great Doctors did_not enjoy_the same aids to study that_are possessed by the Modernists for their guide and rule , a philosophy borrowed from the negation of God , and a criterion which consists of themselves . We believe , then_,_that We have set_forth with sufficient clearness the historical method of the Modernists . The philosopher leads the way , the historian follows , and then in due order come internal and textual criticism . And since_it_-isaia- characteristic of the first cause to communicate its virtue to secondary causes , it -isaia- quite clear_that the criticism We are concerned_with -isaia- an agnostic , immanentist , and evolutionist criticism . Hence anybody who embraces it and employs it , makes profession thereby of the errors contained in it , and places himself in opposition to Catholic faith . This being so , one cannot_but be greatly surprised by the consideration which_-isaia- attached to it by certain Catholics . Two causes may be assigned for_this : first , the close alliance , independent of all differences of nationality or religion , which_the historians and critics of this school have formed among_themselves ; second , the boundless effrontery of these_men . Let one of them but open his mouth and the others applaud him in chorus , proclaiming that science has made another step forward ; let an outsider but hint -atti_degli_apostoli- a desire to inspect the new discovery with_his own eyes , and they_are on him in a body ; deny it and you_are an ignoramus ; embrace it and defend it and there_-isaia- no praise too warm for you . In this_way they win over any who , did they but realise what_they are doing , would shrink back with horror . The impudence and the domineering of some , and the thoughtlessness and imprudence of others , have combined to generate a pestilence in the air which penetrates everywhere and spreads the contagion . But let us pass to the apologist . The Modernist as Apologist . The Modernist apologist depends in two ways on the philosopher . First , indirectly , inasmuch as his theme -isaia- history history dictated , as we have_seen , by the philosopher ; and , secondly , directly , inasmuch as he takes both his laws and his principles from the philosopher . Hence that common precept of the Modernist school that the new apologetics must be fed from psychological and historical sources . The Modernist apologists , then , enter_the arena by proclaiming to the rationalists that though_they are defending religion , they_have no intention of employing the data of the sacred_books or the histories in current use in the Church , and composed according to old methods , but real history written on modern principles and according to rigorously modern methods . In all this they_are_not using an argumentum ad hominem , but are stating the simple fact_that they hold , that the truth_-isaia- to be found only in this_kind of history . They feel that_it_-isaia- not necessary_for them to dwell on their_own sincerity in their writings they are_already known to and praised by the rationalists as fighting under the same banner , and they not_only plume themselves on these encomiums , which_are a kind of salary to them but would only provoke nausea in a real Catholic , but use them as an offset to the reprimands of the Church . But let us see_how the Modernist conducts his apologetics . The aim he sets before himself_-isaia- to make_the non believer attain that experience of the Catholic religion which , according to the system , -isaia- the basis of faith . There are two ways open to him , the objective and the subjective . The first of them proceeds from agnosticism . It tends to show that religion , and especially_the Catholic religion , -isaia- endowed_with such vitality as to compel every psychologist and historian of good faith to recognise that_its history hides some unknown element . To this_end it -isaia- necessary to prove that_this religion , as it exists today , -isaia- that_which was founded by Jesus Christ ; that_-isaia- to say , that_it_-isaia- the product of the progressive development of the germ which He brought into_the_world . Hence it -isaia- imperative first of all to establish what this germ was , and this_the Modernist claims to be able to do by the following formula : Christ announced the coming of the kingdom of God , which_was to be realised within a brief lapse of time and of which He was to become the Messiah , the divinely given agent and ordainer . Then it must be shown how this germ , always immanent and permanent in the bosom of the Church , has gone on slowly developing in the course of history , adapting itself successively to the different mediums through_which it has passed , borrowing from them by vital assimilation all the dogmatic , cultural , ecclesiastical forms that served its purpose ; whilst , on the other_hand , it surmounted all obstacles , vanquished all enemies , and survived all assaults and all combats . Anybody who well and duly considers this mass of obstacles , adversaries , attacks , combats , and the vitality and fecundity which_the Church has shown throughout them all , must admit that if the laws of evolution are visible in her_life they fail to explain the whole of her history the unknown rises forth_from it and presents itself before us . Thus do they argue , never suspecting that_their determination of the primitive germ -isaia- an a priori of agnostic and evolutionist philosophy , and that the formula of it has_been gratuitously invented for the sake of buttressing their position . But while they endeavour by this line of reasoning to secure access for the Catholic religion into souls , these new apologists are quite ready to admit that there_are_many distasteful things in it . Nay , they admit openly , and with ill concealed satisfaction , that_they_have found that_even its dogma -isaia- not exempt from errors and contradictions . They add also that_this_-isaia- not_only excusable but curiously enough even right and proper . In the Sacred Books there_are_many passages referring to science or history where manifest errors are to be found . But the subject of these books -isaia- not science or history but religion and morals . In them history and science serve only as a species of covering to enable the religious and moral experiences wrapped up in them to penetrate more readily among the masses . The masses understood science and history as they_are expressed in these books , and it -isaia- clear_that had science and history been expressed in a more_perfect form this_would have proved rather a hindrance than a help . Then , again , the Sacred Books being essentially religious , are consequently necessarily living . Now life has its_own truth and its_own logic , belonging as they do to a different order , viz . , truth of adaptation and of proportion both with the medium in which it exists and with the end towards which it tends . Finally the Modernists , losing all sense of control , go so far as to proclaim as true and legitimate everything_that -isaia- explained by life . We , Venerable Brethren , for_whom there_-isaia- but_one and only truth , and who hold that the Sacred Books , written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , have God for their author Conc . declare that_this_-isaia- equivalent to attributing to God Himself the lie of utility or officious lie , and We say with St . Augustine : In an authority so high , admit but_one officious lie , and there_will not remain a single passage of those apparently difficult to practise or to believe , which on the same most pernicious rule may_not be explained as a lie uttered by the author wilfully and to serve a purpose . And thus it will come about , the holy Doctor continues , that everybody will believe and refuse to believe what he likes or dislikes . But the Modernists pursue their_way gaily . They grant also_that certain arguments adduced in the Sacred Books , like those , for example , which_are based on the prophecies , have no rational foundation to rest on . But they_will defend even these as artifices of preaching , which_are justified by life . Do they stop here ? No , indeed , for they_are ready to admit , nay , to proclaim that Christ Himself manifestly erred in determining the time_when the coming of the Kingdom of God was to take_place , and they tell us that we must_not be surprised -atti_degli_apostoli- this since even Christ was subject to the laws of life ! After this what_-isaia- to become of the dogmas of the Church ? The dogmas brim over with flagrant contradictions , but_what matter that since , apart_from the fact_that vital logic accepts them , they_are_not repugnant to symbolical truth . Are we not dealing_with the infinite , and has not the infinite an infinite variety of aspects ? In short , to maintain and defend these theories they do not_hesitate to declare that the noblest homage that_can be paid to the Infinite -isaia- to make it the object of contradictory propositions ! But when_they justify even contradiction , what_-isaia- it that_they_will refuse to justify ? Subjective Arguments . But it -isaia- not solely by objective arguments that the non believer may be disposed to faith . There are_also subjective ones -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the Modernists , and for those they return to their doctrine of immanence . They endeavour , in fact , to persuade their non believer that down in the very deeps of his nature and his_life lie the need and the desire_for religion , and this not a religion of any_kind , but the specific religion known as Catholicism , which , they_say , -isaia- absolutely postulated by the perfect development of life . And here We cannot_but deplore once_more , and grievously , that_there are Catholics who , while rejecting immanence as a doctrine , employ it as a method of apologetics , and who do this so imprudently that_they seem to admit that_there_-isaia- in human_nature a true and rigorous necessity with_regard to the supernatural order and not merely a capacity and a suitability for the supernatural , order and not merely a capacity and a suitability for the supernatural , such as has -atti_degli_apostoli- all times been emphasized by Catholic apologists . Truth to tell it -isaia- only the moderate Modernists who make_this appeal to an exigency for the Catholic religion . As for the others , who might be called intergralists , they_would show to the non believer , hidden away in the very depths of his being , the very germ which Christ Himself bore in His conscience , and which He bequeathed to the world . Such , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- a summary description of the apologetic method of the Modernists , in perfect harmony , as you_may see , with_their doctrines methods and doctrines brimming over with errors , made not_for edification but_for destruction , not_for the formation of Catholics but_for the plunging of Catholics into heresy ; methods and doctrines that_would be fatal to any religion . The Modernist as Reformer . It remains for Us now to say a few words about the Modernist as reformer . From all that_has preceded , some idea may be gained of the reforming mania which possesses them : in all Catholicism there_-isaia- absolutely nothing on which it does_not fasten . Reform of philosophy , especially in the seminaries : the scholastic philosophy -isaia- to be relegated to the history of philosophy among obsolete systems , and the young_men are to be taught modern philosophy which alone_-isaia- true and suited to the times in which we live . Reform of theology ; rational theology -isaia- to have modern philosophy for its foundation , and positive theology -isaia- to be founded on the history of dogma . As for history , it must be for the future written and taught only according_to_their modern methods and principles . Dogmas and their evolution are to be harmonised with science and history . In the Catechism no dogmas are to be inserted except those_that have_been duly reformed and are within_the capacity of the people . Regarding worship , the number of external devotions -isaia- to be reduced , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least steps must_be_taken to prevent their further increase , though , indeed , some of the admirers of symbolism are disposed to be more indulgent on this head . Ecclesiastical government requires to be reformed in all its branches , but especially in its disciplinary and dogmatic parts . Its spirit with the public conscience , which_-isaia-_not wholly for democracy ; a share in ecclesiastical government should therefore be given to the lower ranks of the clergy , and even to the laity , and authority should be decentralised . The Roman Congregations , and especially_the index and the Holy Office , are to be reformed . The ecclesiastical authority must change its line of conduct in the social and political world ; while keeping outside political and social organization , it must adapt itself to those_which exist in order to penetrate them_with its spirit . With regard to morals , they adopt the principle of the Americanists , that the active virtues are more_important than the passive , both in the estimation in which_they must be held and in the exercise of them . The clergy are asked to return to their ancient lowliness and poverty , and in their ideas and action to be guided by the principles of Modernism ; and there_are_some who , echoing the teaching of their Protestant masters , would_like the suppression of ecclesiastical celibacy . What -isaia- there left in the Church which_-isaia-_not to be reformed according_to_their principles ? Modernism and All the Heresies . It may be , Venerable Brethren , that_some may think We have dwelt too long on this exposition of the doctrines of the Modernists . But it was necessary , both in order to refute their customary charge that We do not understand their ideas , and to show that_their system does_not consist in scattered and unconnected theories but in a perfectly organised body , all the parts of which_are solidly joined so that_it_-isaia- not_possible to admit one without admitting all . For this_reason , too , We have_had to give this exposition a somewhat didactic form and not to shrink from employing certain uncouth terms in use among the Modernists . And now , can anybody who takes a survey of the whole system be surprised that We should define it as the synthesis of all heresies ? Were one to attempt the task of collecting together all the errors that have_been broached against the faith and to concentrate the -sapienza- and substance of them all into one , he could_not better succeed than the Modernists have_done . Nay , they have_done more_than this , for , as we have_already intimated , their system means the destruction not of the Catholic religion alone but of all religion . With good_reason do the rationalists applaud them , for the most sincere and the frankest among the rationalists warmly welcome the modernists as their most valuable allies . For let us return for a moment , Venerable Brethren , to that_most disastrous doctrine of agnosticism . By it every avenue that leads the intellect to God -isaia- barred , but the Modernists would seek to open others available for sentiment and action . Vain efforts ! For , after all , what_-isaia- sentiment but the reaction of the soul on the action of the intelligence or the senses . Take away the intelligence , and man , already inclined to follow_the senses , becomes their slave . Vain , too , from another point_of_view , for all these fantasias on the religious sentiment will_never be able to destroy common sense , and common sense tells us that emotion and everything_that leads the heart captive proves a hindrance instead of a help to the discovery of truth . We speak , of course , of truth in itself as for that other purely subjective truth , the fruit of sentiment and action , if it serves its purpose for the jugglery of words , it -isaia- of no use to the man_who wants to know above all things whether outside himself there_-isaia- a God into whose hands he -isaia- one_day to fall . True , the Modernists do call in experience to eke out_their system , but_what does this experience add to sentiment ? Absolutely nothing beyond a certain intensity and a proportionate deepening of the conviction of the reality of the object . But these_two will_never make sentiment into anything but sentiment , nor deprive it of its characteristic which_-isaia- to cause deception when_the intelligence -isaia- not there to guide it ; on the contrary , they but confirm and aggravate this characteristic , for the more intense sentiment -isaia- the more it -isaia- sentimental . In matters of religious sentiment and religious experience , you_know , Venerable Brethren , how necessary -isaia- prudence and how necessary , too , the science which directs prudence . You know it from your_own dealings with sounds , and especially with souls in whom sentiment predominates ; you_know it also from your reading of ascetical books books for_which the Modernists have but little esteem , but_which testify to a science and a solidity very different from theirs , and to a refinement and subtlety of observation of which_the Modernists give no evidence . Is it not really folly , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least sovereign imprudence , to trust oneself without control to Modernist experiences ? Let us for a moment put the question : if experiences have so much value in their_eyes , why do they not attach equal weight to the experience that thousands upon thousands of Catholics have that the Modernists are on the wrong road ? It -isaia- , perchance , that all experiences except those felt by the Modernists are false and deceptive ? The vast majority of mankind holds and always will hold firmly that sentiment and experience alone , when not enlightened and guided by reason , do not lead to the knowledge of God . What remains , then , but the annihilation of all religion , atheism ? Certainly it -isaia- not the doctrine of symbolism will save us from this . For if all the intellectual elements , as they call them , of religion are pure symbols , will_not the very name of God or of divine personality be also a symbol , and if this be admitted will_not the personality of God become a matter of doubt and the way opened to Pantheism ? And to Pantheism that other doctrine of the divine immanence leads directly . For does it , We ask , leave God distinct from man or not ? If yes , in what does it differ from Catholic doctrine , and why reject external revelation ? If no , we are_-atti_degli_apostoli- once in Pantheism . Now the doctrine of immanence in the Modernist acceptation holds and professes that_every phenomenon of conscience proceeds from man as man . The rigorous conclusion from this_-isaia- the identity of man with God , which means Pantheism . The same conclusion follows from the distinction Modernists make between science and faith . The object of science they_say -isaia- the reality of the knowable ; the object of faith , on the contrary , -isaia- the reality of the unknowable . Now what makes_the unknowable unknowable -isaia- its disproportion with the intelligible a disproportion which nothing whatever , even in the doctrine of the Modernist , can suppress . Hence the unknowable remains and will eternally remain unknowable to the believer as well as to the man of science . Therefore if any religion -atti_degli_apostoli- all -isaia- possible it can_only be the religion of an unknowable reality . And why this religion might not be that universal soul of the universe , of which a rationalist speaks , -isaia- something We do see . Certainly this suffices to show superabundantly by how_many roads Modernism leads to the annihilation of all religion . The first step in this direction was taken by Protestantism ; the second -isaia- made by Modernism ; the next will plunge headlong into atheism . THE CAUSE OF MODERNISM . To penetrate still deeper into Modernism and to find a suitable remedy for_such a deep sore , it behoves Us , Venerable Brethren , to investigate the causes which_have engendered it and which foster its growth . That the proximate and immediate cause consists in a perversion of the mind cannot be open to doubt . The remote causes seem to us to be reduced to two : curiosity and pride . Curiosity by itself , if not prudently regulated , suffices to explain all errors . Such -isaia- the opinion of Our Predecessor , Gregory XVI . , who wrote : A lamentable spectacle -isaia- that presented by the aberrations of human_reason when it yields to the spirit of novelty , when against the warning of the Apostle it seeks to know beyond what it -isaia- meant to know , and when relying too much on itself it thinks it can_find the fruit outside the Church wherein truth_-isaia- found without_the slightest shadow of error Ep . Singulari nos , Kal . But it -isaia- pride which exercises an incomparably greater sway over the soul to blind it and plunge it into error , and pride sits in Modernism as in its_own house , finding sustenance everywhere in its doctrines and an occasion to flaunt itself in all its aspects . It -isaia- pride which fills Modernists with_that confidence in themselves and leads them to hold themselves up as the rule for all , pride which puffs them up with_that vainglory which allows them to regard themselves as the sole possessors of knowledge , and makes them say , inflated with presumption , We are_not as the rest of men , and which , to make_them really not as other men , leads them to embrace all kinds of the most absurd novelties ; it -isaia- pride which rouses in them the spirit of disobedience and causes them to demand a compromise between authority and liberty ; it -isaia- pride that makes of them the reformers of others , while they forget to reform themselves , and which begets their absolute want of respect_for authority , not excepting the supreme_authority . No , truly , there_-isaia- no road which_leads so directly and so quickly to Modernism as pride . When a Catholic laymen or a priest forgets that precept of the Christian life_which obliges us to renounce ourselves if we would follow Jesus Christ and neglects to tear pride from his_heart , ah ! but he -isaia- a fully ripe subject for the errors of Modernism . Hence , Venerable Brethren , it will be your first duty to thwart such proud men , to employ them only in the lowest and obscurest offices ; the higher they try to rise , the lower let_them be placed , so that_their lowly position may deprive them of the power of causing damage . Sound your young clerics , too , most carefully , by yourselves and by the directors of your seminaries , and when_you find the spirit of pride among any of them reject them without compunction from the priesthood . Would to God that_this had always_been done with the proper vigilance and constancy . If we pass from the moral to the intellectual causes of Modernism , the first which presents itself , and the chief one , -isaia- ignorance . Yes , these very Modernists who pose as Doctors of the Church , who puff out_their cheeks when_they speak of modern philosophy , and show such contempt for scholasticism , have embraced the one_with all its false glamour because their ignorance of the other has left them without_the means of being able to recognise confusion of thought , and to refute sophistry . Their whole system , with all its errors , has_been born of the alliance between_faith and false philosophy . If only they_had displayed less zeal and energy in propagating it ! But such_-isaia- their activity and such their unwearying capacity_for work on behalf of their cause , that_one cannot_but be pained to see them waste such labour in endeavouring to ruin the Church when they_might have_been of such service to her had their_efforts been better employed . Their articles to delude men s minds are of two kinds , the first to remove obstacles from their path , the second to devise and apply actively and patiently every instrument that_can serve their purpose . They recognise that the three chief difficulties for them are scholastic philosophy , the authority of the fathers and tradition , and the magisterium of the Church , and on these they wage unrelenting war . For scholastic philosophy and theology they_have only ridicule and contempt . Whether it -isaia- ignorance or fear , or both , that inspires this conduct in them , certain it -isaia- that the passion for novelty -isaia- always united in them_with hatred of scholasticism , and there_-isaia- no surer sign that a man_-isaia- on the way to Modernism than when he begins to show his dislike for_this system . Modernists and their admirers should remember the proposition condemned by Pius IX : The method and principles_which have served the doctors of scholasticism when treating of theology no longer correspond with the exigencies of our_time or the progress of science Syll . They exercise all their ingenuity in diminishing the force and falsifying the character of tradition , so as to rob it of all its weight . But for Catholics the second Council of Nicea will_always have_the force of law , where it condemns those_who dare , after_the impious fashion of heretics , to deride the ecclesiastical traditions , to invent novelties of some kind . or endeavour by malice or craft to overthrow any_one of the legitimate traditions of the Catholic Church ; and Catholics will hold for law , also , the profession of the fourth Council of Constantinople : We therefore profess to conserve and guard the rules bequeathed to the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church by the Holy and most illustrious Apostles , by the orthodox Councils , both general and local , and by every_one of those divine interpreters the Fathers and Doctors of the Church . Wherefore the Roman Pontiffs , Pius IV . , ordered the insertion in the profession_of_faith of the following declaration : I most firmly admit and embrace the apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions and other observances and constitutions of the Church . The Modernists pass the same judgment on the most_holy Fathers of the Church as they pass on tradition ; decreeing , with amazing effrontery that , while personally most worthy of all veneration , they_were entirely ignorant of history and criticism , for which_they_are only excusable on account of the time in which_they lived . Finally , the Modernists try in every way to diminish and weaken the authority of the ecclesiastical magisterium itself by sacrilegiously falsifying its origin , character , and rights , and by freely repeating the calumnies of its adversaries . To all the band of Modernists may be applied those words_which Our Predecessor wrote with_such pain : To bring contempt and odium on the mystic Spouse of Christ , who_-isaia- the true light , the children of darkness have_been wont to cast in her face before the world a stupid calumny , and perverting the meaning and force of things and words , to depict her as the friend of darkness and ignorance , and the enemy of light , science , and progress Motu proprio , Ut mysticum , March , . This being so , Venerable Brethren , no wonder the Modernists vent all their gall and hatred on Catholics who sturdily fight the battles of the Church . But of all the insults they heap on them those of ignorance and obstinacy are the favourites . When an adversary rises up against them_with an erudition and force that render him redoubtable , they try to make a conspiracy of silence around him to nullify the effects of his attack , while in flagrant contrast with this policy towards Catholics , they load with constant praise the writers who range themselves on their side , hailing their works , excluding novelty in every page , with choruses of applause ; for them the scholarship of a writer -isaia- in direct proportion to the recklessness of his attacks on antiquity , and of his efforts to undermine tradition and the ecclesiastical magisterium ; when one of their number falls under the condemnations of the Church the rest of them , to the horror of good Catholics , gather round him , heap public praise upon him , venerate him almost as a martyr to truth . The young , excited and confused by all this glamour of praise and abuse , some of them afraid of being branded as ignorant , others ambitious to be considered learned , and both classes goaded internally by curiosity and pride , often surrender and give themselves up to Modernism . And here we have_already some of the artifices employed by Modernists to exploit their wares . What efforts they_make to win new recruits ! They seize upon chairs in the seminaries and universities , and gradually make of them chairs of pestilence . From these sacred chairs they scatter , though not_always openly , the seeds of their doctrines ; they proclaim their teachings without disguise in congresses ; they introduce them and make_them the vogue in social institutions . Under their_own names and under pseudonyms they publish numbers of books , newspapers , reviews , and sometimes one_and_the_same writer adopts a variety of pseudonyms to trap the incautious reader into believing in a whole multitude of Modernist writers in short they leave nothing untried , in action , discourses , writings , as though there_were a frenzy of propaganda upon them . And the results of all this ? We have to lament -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of many_young men once full of promise and capable of rendering great services to the Church , now gone astray . And there_-isaia- another sight that saddens Us too : that of so many_other Catholics , who , while they certainly do not go so far as the former , have yet grown into the habit , as though_they had_been breathing a poisoned atmosphere , of thinking and speaking and writing with a liberty that ill becomes Catholics . They are to be found among the laity , and in the ranks of the clergy , and they_are_not wanting even in the last place_where one might expect to meet them , in religious institutes . If they treat of biblical questions , it -isaia- upon Modernist principles ; if they write history , it -isaia- to search out with curiosity and to publish openly , on the pretext of telling the whole truth and with a species of ill concealed satisfaction , everything_that looks to them like a stain in the history of the Church . Under the sway of certain a priori rules they destroy as far as they_can the pious traditions of the people , and bring ridicule on certain relics highly venerable from their antiquity . They are possessed by the empty desire of being talked about , and they know they_would never succeed in this were they to say only what_has_been always said . It may be that_they_have persuaded themselves that in all this they_are really serving God and the Church in reality they only offend both , less perhaps by their works themselves than by the spirit in which_they write and by the encouragement they_are giving to the extravagances of the Modernists . Against this host of grave errors , and its secret and open advance , Our Predecessor Leo XIII . , of happy_memory , worked strenuously especially as regards the Bible , both in his_words and his acts . But , as we have_seen , the Modernists are_not easily deterred by such weapons with an affectation of submission and respect , they proceeded to twist the words of the Pontiff to their_own sense , and his acts they described as directed against others than themselves . And the evil has gone on increasing from day to day . We therefore , Venerable Brethren , have determined to adopt -atti_degli_apostoli- once the most efficacious measures in Our power , and We beg and conjure you to see_to_it_that in this_most grave matter nobody will ever be able to say that_you have_been in the slightest degree wanting in vigilance , zeal or firmness . And what We ask of you and expect of you , We ask and expect also of all other pastors of souls , of all educators and professors of clerics , and in a very_special way of the superiors of religious institutions . The Study of Scholastic Philosophy . In the first_place , with_regard to studies , We will and ordain that scholastic philosophy be made the basis of the sacred sciences . It goes without saying that if anything -isaia- met with among the scholastic doctors which_may be regarded as an excess of subtlety , or which_-isaia- altogether destitute of probability , We have no desire whatever to propose it for the imitation of present generations Leo XIII . And let it be clearly understood above all things_that the scholastic philosophy We prescribe -isaia- that_which the Angelic Doctor has bequeathed to us , and We , therefore , declare that all the ordinances of Our Predecessor on this_subject continue fully in force , and , as far as may be necessary , We do decree anew , and confirm , and ordain that_they be by all strictly observed . In seminaries where_they may have_been neglected let_the Bishops impose them and require their observance , and let this apply also to the Superiors of religious institutions . Further let Professors remember_that they_cannot set St . Thomas aside , especially in metaphysical questions , without grave detriment . On this philosophical foundation the theological edifice -isaia- to be solidly raised . Promote the study of theology , Venerable Brethren , by all means in your power , so that_your clerics on leaving the seminaries may admire and love it , and always find_their delight in it . For in the vast and varied abundance of studies opening before the mind desirous of truth , everybody knows how the old maxim describes theology as so far in front of all others that_every science and art should serve it and be to it as handmaidens Leo XIII . We will add that We deem worthy of praise those_who with full respect_for tradition , the Holy Fathers , and the ecclesiastical magisterium , undertake , with well balanced judgment and guided by Catholic principles which_-isaia-_not always the case , seek to illustrate positive theology by throwing the light of true history upon it . Certainly more attention must be paid to positive theology than in the past , but this_must be done without detriment to scholastic theology , and those are to be disapproved as of Modernist tendencies who exalt positive theology in such_a_way as to seem to despise the scholastic . With regard to profane studies suffice it to recall here what Our Predecessor has admirably said : Apply yourselves energetically to the study of natural sciences : the brilliant discoveries and the bold and useful applications of them made in our_times which_have won such applause by our contemporaries will be an object of perpetual praise for those_that come after us Leo XIII . But this do without interfering with sacred studies , as Our Predecessor in these most grave words prescribed : If you carefully search_for the cause of those errors you will_find that it lies in the fact_that in these_days when_the natural sciences absorb so much study , the more severe and lofty studies have_been proportionately neglected some of them have almost passed into oblivion , some of them are pursued in a half hearted or superficial way , and , sad to say , now that_they_are fallen from their old estate , they_have_been dis figured by perverse doctrines and monstrous errors loco cit . We ordain , therefore_,_that the study of natural science in the seminaries be carried on under this_law . All these prescriptions and those of Our Predecessor are to be borne in mind whenever there_-isaia- question of choosing directors and professors for seminaries and Catholic Universities . Anybody who in any_way -isaia- found to be imbued_with Modernism -isaia- to be excluded without compunction from_these offices , and those_who already occupy them are to be withdrawn . The same policy -isaia- to be adopted towards those_who favour Modernism either by extolling the Modernists or excusing their culpable conduct , by criticising scholasticism , the Holy Father , or by refusing obedience to ecclesiastical authority in any of its depositaries ; and towards those_who show a love of novelty in history , archaeology , biblical exegesis , and finally towards those_who neglect the sacred sciences or appear to prefer to them the profane . In all this_question of studies , Venerable Brethren , you cannot be too watchful or too constant , but most of all in the choice of professors , for as a rule_the students are modelled after_the pattern of their masters . Strong in the consciousness of your duty , act always prudently but vigorously . Equal diligence and severity are to be used in examining and selecting candidates_for Holy Orders . Far , far from the clergy be the love of novelty ! God hates the proud and the obstinate . For the future the doctorate of theology and canon_law must_never be conferred on anybody who_has not made the regular course of scholastic philosophy ; if conferred it shall be held as null and void . The rules laid_down in by the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars for the clerics , both secular and regular , of Italy concerning the frequenting of the Universities , We now decree to be extended to all nations . Clerics and priests inscribed in a Catholic Institute or University must_not in the future follow in civil Universities those courses for which_there are chairs in the Catholic Institutes to which_they belong . If this has_been permitted anywhere in the past , We ordain that it be not allowed for the future . Let the Bishops who form the Governing Board of such Catholic Institutes or Universities watch with all care that_these Our commands be constantly observed . Episcopal Vigilance Over Publications . It -isaia-_also the duty of the bishops to prevent writings infected with Modernism or favourable to it from being read when they_have_been published , and to hinder their publication when they_have not . No book or paper or periodical of this_kind must ever be permitted to seminarists or university students . The injury to them would be equal to that caused by immoral reading nay , it would be greater for_such writings poison Christian life -atti_degli_apostoli- its_very fount . The same decision -isaia- to be taken concerning the writings of some Catholics , who , though not badly disposed themselves but ill instructed in theological studies and imbued_with modern philosophy , strive to make_this harmonize with the faith , and , as they_say , to turn it to the account of the faith . The name and reputation of these authors cause them to be read without suspicion , and they_are , therefore , all the more dangerous in preparing the way_for Modernism . To give_you some more general directions , Venerable Brethren , in a matter of such moment , We bid you do everything in your power to drive out of your dioceses , even by solemn interdict , any pernicious books that may be in circulation there . The Holy See neglects no means to put down writings of this_kind , but the number of them has now grown to such an extent that_it_-isaia- impossible to censure them all . Hence it happens_that the medicine sometimes arrives too late , for the disease has_taken root during the delay . We will , therefore_,_that the Bishops , putting aside all fear and the prudence of the flesh , despising the outcries of the wicked , gently by all means but constantly , do each his_own share of this_work , remembering the injunctions of Leo XIII . in the Apostolic Constitution Officiorum : Let the Ordinaries , acting in this also as Delegates of the Apostolic See , exert themselves to prescribe and to put out of reach of the faithful injurious books or other writings printed or circulated in their dioceses . In this passage the Bishops , it -isaia- true , receive a right , but_they have_also a duty imposed on them . Let no Bishop think_that he fulfils this_duty by denouncing to us one or two books , while a great many_others of the same kind are_being published and circulated . Nor are you to be deterred by the fact_that a book has obtained the Imprimatur elsewhere , both because this may be merely simulated , and because it may have_been granted through carelessness or easiness or excessive confidence in the author as may sometimes happen in religious Orders . Besides , just as the same food does_not agree equally with everybody , it may happen that a book harmless in one may , on account of the different circumstances , be hurtful in another . Should a Bishop , therefore , after_having taken the advice of prudent persons , deem it right to condemn any of such books in his diocese , We not_only give him ample faculty to do so but We impose it upon him as a duty to do so . Of course , it -isaia- Our wish_that in such action proper regard be used , and sometimes it will suffice to restrict the prohibition to the clergy ; but_even in such cases it will be obligatory on Catholic booksellers not to put on sale books condemned by the Bishop . And while We are on this_subject of booksellers , We wish the Bishops to see_to_it_that they_do_not , through desire_for gain , put on sale unsound books . It -isaia- certain_that in the catalogues of some of them the books of the Modernists are_not unfrequently announced with no small praise . If they refuse obedience let_the Bishops have no hesitation in depriving them of the title of Catholic booksellers ; so too , and with more reason , if they_have the title of Episcopal booksellers , and if they_have that of Pontifical , let_them be denounced to the Apostolic See . Finally , We remind all of the XXVI . article of the abovementioned Constitution Officiorum : All those_who_have obtained an apostolic faculty to read and keep forbidden books , are_not thereby authorised to read books and periodicals forbidden by the local Ordinaries , unless the apostolic faculty expressly concedes permission to read and keep books condemned by anybody . But it -isaia-_not_enough to hinder the reading and the sale of bad books it -isaia-_also necessary to prevent them_from being printed . Hence let_the Bishops use the utmost severity in granting permission to print . Under the rules of the Constitution Officiorum , many publications require the authorisation of the Ordinary , and in some dioceses it has been_made the custom to have a suitable number of official censors for the examination of writings . We have_the highest praise for_this institution , and We not_only exhort , but We order_that it be extended to all dioceses . In all episcopal Curias , therefore , let censors be appointed for the revision of works intended for publication , and let_the censors be chosen from both ranks of the clergy secular and regular men of age , knowledge and prudence who_will know_how to follow_the golden mean in their judgments . It shall be their office to examine everything which requires permission for publication according to Articles XLI . of the above mentioned Constitution . The Censor shall give his verdict in writing . If it be favourable , the Bishop will_give the permission for publication by the word Imprimatur , which must_always be preceded by the Nihil obstat and the name of the Censor . In the Curia of Rome official censors shall be appointed just as elsewhere , and the appointment of them shall appertain to the Master of the Sacred Palaces , after they_have_been proposed to the Cardinal Vicar and accepted by the Sovereign Pontiff . It will_also be the office of the Master of the Sacred Palaces to select the censor for each writing . Permission for publication will be granted by him as well as by the Cardinal Vicar or his Vicegerent , and this permission , as above prescribed , must_always be preceded by the Nihil obstat and the name of the Censor . Only on very rare and exceptional occasions , and on the prudent decision of the bishop , shall it be possible to omit mention of the Censor . The name of the Censor shall never be made_known to the authors until he shall have_given a favourable decision , so that_he_may not_have to suffer annoyance either while he -isaia- engaged in the examination of a writing or in case he should deny his approval . Censors shall never be chosen from the religious_orders until the opinion of the Provincial , or in Rome of the General , has_been privately obtained , and the Provincial or the General must give a conscientious account of the character , knowledge and orthodoxy of the candidate . We admonish religious superiors of their solemn duty never to allow anything to be published by any of their subjects without permission from themselves and from the Ordinary . Finally We affirm and declare that the title of Censor has no value and can_never be adduced to give credit to the private opinions of the person_who holds it . Having said this much in general , We now ordain in particular a more careful observance of Article XLII . of the above mentioned Constitution Officiorum . It -isaia- forbidden to secular priests , without_the previous consent of the Ordinary , to undertake the direction of papers or periodicals . This permission shall be withdrawn from any priest who makes a wrong use of it after_having been admonished . With regard to priests_who are correspondents or collaborators of periodicals , as it happens not unfrequently that_they write matter infected with Modernism for their papers or periodicals , let_the Bishops see to it that_this_-isaia- not permitted to happen , and , should they fail in this_duty , let_the Bishops make due provision with authority delegated by the Supreme Pontiff . Let there be , as far as this_-isaia- possible , a special Censor for newspapers and periodicals written by Catholics . It shall be his office to read in due time each number after it has_been published , and if he find anything dangerous in it let_him order_that it be corrected . The Bishop shall_have the same right even_when the Censor has seen nothing objectionable in a publication . We have_already mentioned congresses and public gatherings as among the means used by the Modernists to propagate and defend their opinions . In the future Bishops shall_not permit Congresses of priests except on very rare occasions . When they do permit them it shall only be on condition that matters appertaining to the Bishops or the Apostolic See be not treated in them , and that no motions or postulates be allowed that_would imply a usurpation of sacred authority , and that no mention be made in them of Modernism , presbyterianism , or laicism . At Congresses of this_kind , which_can only be held after permission in writing has_been obtained in due time and for each case , it shall_not be lawful for priests of other dioceses to take_part without_the written permission of their Ordinary . Further no priest must lose sight of the solemn recommendation of Leo XIII . : Let priests hold as sacred the authority of their pastors , let_them take it for certain_that the sacerdotal ministry , if not exercised under_the_guidance of the Bishops , can_never be either holy , or very fruitful or respectable Lett . Nobilissima Gallorum , Feb . VI Diocesan Watch Committees . But of what avail , Venerable Brethren , will be all Our commands and prescriptions if they be not dutifully and firmly carried_out ? And , in order_that this may be done , it has seemed expedient to Us to extend to all dioceses the regulations laid_down with_great wisdom many years_ago by the Bishops of Umbria for theirs . '' In order , '' they_say , '' to extirpate the errors already propagated and to prevent their further diffusion , and to remove those teachers of impiety through whom_the pernicious effects of such dif fusion are_being perpetuated , this sacred Assembly , following_the_example of St . Charles Borromeo , has decided to establish in each of the dioceses a Council consisting of approved members of both branches of the clergy , which shall be charged the task of noting the existence of errors and the devices by which new ones are introduced and propagated , and to inform the Bishop of the whole so that_he_may take counsel with_them as to the best means_for nipping the evil in the bud and preventing it spreading for the ruin of souls or , worse still , gaining strength and growth '' Acts of the Congress of the Bishops of Umbria , Nov . We decree , therefore_,_that in every diocese a council of this_kind , which We are pleased to name '' the Council of Vigilance , '' be instituted without delay . The priests called to form part in it shall be chosen somewhat after_the manner above prescribed for the Censors , and they_shall meet every two months on an appointed day under the presidency of the Bishop . They shall be bound to secrecy as to their deliberations and decisions , and their function shall be as follows : They shall watch most carefully for_every trace and sign of Modernism both in publications and in teaching , and , to preserve from it the clergy and the young , they_shall take all prudent , prompt and efficacious measures . Let them combat novelties of words remembering the admonitions of Leo XIII . , : It -isaia- impossible to approve in Catholic publications of a style inspired by unsound novelty which seems to deride the piety of the faithful and dwells on the introduction of a new order of Christian life , on new directions of the Church , on new aspirations of the modern soul , on a new vocation of the clergy , on a new Christian civilisation . Language of this_kind -isaia- not to be tolerated either in books or from chairs of learning . The Councils must_not neglect the books treating of the pious traditions of different places or of sacred relics . Let them_not permit such questions to be discussed in periodicals destined to stimulate piety , neither with expressions savouring of mockery or contempt , nor by dogmatic pronouncements , especially_when , as -isaia-_often the case , what_-isaia- stated as a certainty either does_not pass the limits of probability or -isaia- merely based on prejudiced opinion . Concerning sacred relics , let this be the rule : When Bishops , who alone are judges in such matters , know for certain the a relic -isaia- not genuine , let_them remove it -atti_degli_apostoli- once from the veneration of the faithful ; if the authentications of a relic happen to have_been lost through civil disturbances , or in any_other way , let it not be exposed for public veneration until the Bishop has verified it . The argument of prescription or well founded presumption -isaia- to have weight only_when devotion to a relic -isaia- commendable by reason of its antiquity , according to the sense of the Decree issued in by the Congregation of Indulgences and Sacred Relics : Ancient relics are to retain the veneration they have_always enjoyed except when in individual instances there_are clear arguments that_they_are false or suppositions . In passing judgment on pious traditions be it always borne in mind_that in this_matter the Church uses the greatest prudence , and that she_does not_allow traditions of this_kind to be narrated in books except with the utmost caution and with the insertion of the declaration imposed by Urban VIII , and even then she does_not guarantee the truth of the fact narrated ; she simply does but forbid belief in things for_which human arguments are_not wanting . On this_matter the Sacred Congregation of Rites , thirty years_ago , decreed as follows : These apparitions and revelations have neither been approved nor condemned by the Holy See , which_has simply allowed that_they be believed on purely human faith , on the tradition which_they relate , corroborated by testimonies and documents worthy of credence Decree , May , . Anybody who follows this rule has no cause for fear . For the devotion based on any apparition , in as far as it regards the fact itself , that_-isaia- to say in as far as it -isaia- relative , always implies the hypothesis of the truth of the fact ; while in as far as it -isaia- absolute , it must_always be based on the truth , seeing that_its object -isaia- the persons of the saints who_are honoured . The same -isaia- true of relics . Finally , We entrust to the Councils of Vigilance the duty of overlooking assiduously and diligently social institutions as well as writings on social questions so that_they_may harbour no trace of Modernism , but obey the prescriptions of the Roman Pontiffs . VII Triennial Returns . Lest what We have laid_down thus far should fall_into oblivion , We will and ordain that the Bishops of all dioceses , a year after_the publication of these letters and every three years thenceforward , furnish the Holy See with a diligent and sworn report on all the prescriptions contained in them , and on the doctrines that find currency among the clergy , and especially in the seminaries and other Catholic institutions , and We impose the like obligation on the Generals of Religious Orders with_regard to those under them . This , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- what_we_have thought it our_duty to write to you for the salvation of all who_believe . The adversaries of the Church will doubtless abuse what_we_have said to refurbish the old calumny by which_we_are traduced as the enemy of science and of the progress of humanity . In order to oppose a new answer to such accusations , which_the history of the Christian religion refutes by never failing arguments , it -isaia- Our intention to establish and develop by every_means in our power a special Institute in which , through the co operation of those Catholics who are_most eminent for their learning , the progress of science and other realms of knowledge may be promoted under_the_guidance and teaching of Catholic truth . God grant that_we_may happily realise our design with the ready assistance of all those_who bear a sincere love for the Church of Christ . But of this we will speak on another occasion . Meanwhile , Venerable Brethren , fully confident in your zeal and work , we beseech for you with_our whole heart and soul the abundance of heavenly light , so that in the midst of this_great perturbation of men s minds from the insidious invasions of error from every side , you_may see clearly what_you ought to do and may perform the task with all your strength and courage . May Jesus Christ , the author and finisher of our_faith , be with you by His power ; and may the Immaculate Virgin , the destroyer of all heresies , be with you by her prayers and aid . And We , as a pledge of Our affection and of divine assistance in adversity , grant most affectionately and with all Our heart to you , your clergy_and_people the Apostolic Benediction .

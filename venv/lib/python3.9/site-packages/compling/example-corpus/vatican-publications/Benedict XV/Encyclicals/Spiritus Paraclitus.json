JEROME TO ALL THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHOPS , AND ORDINARIES IN UNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE . Since the Holy Spirit , the Comforter , had bestowed the Scriptures on the human_race for their instruction in Divine things , He also raised up in successive ages saintly and learned men whose task it should be to develop that treasure and so provide_for the faithful plenteous '' consolation from the Scriptures . '' Foremost among_these teachers stands St . Him the Catholic Church acclaims and reveres as her '' Greatest Doctor , '' divinely given her for the understanding of the Bible . And now that the fifteenth centenary of his_death -isaia- approaching we would_not willingly let pass so favorable an opportunity of addressing you on the debt we owe him . For the responsibility of our Apostolic office impels us to set before you his wonderful example and so promote the study of Holy Scripture in accordance_with_the teaching of our_predecessors , Leo XIII and Pius X , which we desire to apply more precisely still to the present needs of the Church . Jerome '' strenuous Catholic , learned in the Scriptures , '' '' teacher of Catholics , '' '' model of virtue , world s teacher '' has by his earnest and illuminative defense of Catholic doctrine on Holy Scripture left us most_precious instructions . These we propose to set before you and so promote among the children of the Church , and especially among the clergy , assiduous and reverent study of the Bible . No need to remind you , Venerable Brethren , that Jerome was_born in Stridonia , in a town '' on the borders of Dalmatia and Pannonia '' ; that_from his infancy he was brought up a Catholic ; that after_his baptism here in Rome he lived to an advanced age and devoted all his powers to studying , expounding , and defending the Bible . At Rome he had learned Latin and Greek , and hardly had he left the school of rhetoric than he ventured on a Commentary on Abdias the Prophet . This '' youthful piece of work '' kindled in him such love of the Bible that he decided like the man in the Gospel who found a treasure to spurn '' any emoluments the world could provide , '' and devote himself wholly to such studies . Nothing could deter him from this stern resolve . He left home , parents , sister , and relatives ; he denied himself_the more delicate food he had_been accustomed to , and went to the East so that_he_might gather from studious reading of the Bible the fuller riches of Christ and true knowledge of his Savior . Jerome himself tells us in several places how assiduously he toiled : An eager desire to learn obsessed me . But I was_not so foolish as to try and teach myself . At Antioch I regularly attended the lectures of Apollinaris of Laodicea ; but while I learned much from him about the Bible , I would never accept his doubtful teaching about its interpretation . From Antioch be betook to the desert of Chalcis , in Syria , to perfect himself in his knowledge of the Bible , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to curb '' youthful desires '' by means of hard study . Here he engaged a convert Jew to teach him Hebrew and Chaldaic . What a toil it was ! How difficult I found it ! How often I was on the point of giving it up in despair , and yet in my eagerness to learn took it up again ! Myself can bear_witness of this , and so , too , can those_who had lived with me -atti_degli_apostoli- the time . Yet I thank God for the fruit I won from that bitter seed . Lest , however , he should grow idle in this desert where_there were no heretics to vex him , Jerome betook himself to Constantinople , where for nearly three years he studied Holy Scripture under St . Gregory the Theologian , then Bishop of that See and in the height of his fame as a teacher . While there he translated into Latin Origen s Homilies on the Prophets and Eusebius Chronicle ; he also wrote on Isaias vision of the Seraphim . He then returned to Rome on ecclesiastical business , and Pope Damasus admitted him into_his court . However , he let nothing distract him from continual occupation with the Bible , and the task of copying various manuscripts , as well as answering the many questions put to him by students of both sexes . Pope Damasus had entrusted to him a most laborious task , the correction of the Latin text of the Bible . So well did Jerome carry this out that_even today men versed in such studies appreciate its value more_and_more . But he ever yearned for Palestine , and when_the Pope died he retired to Bethlehem to a monastery nigh to the cave where Christ was_born . Every moment he could spare from prayer he gave to Biblical studies . Though my hair was now growing gray and though I looked more like professor than student , yet I went to Alexandria to attend Didymus lectures . I owe him much . What I did not_know I learned . What I knew already I did_not lose through_his different presentation of it . Men thought I had done with tutors ; but_when I got back to Jerusalem and Bethlehem how hard I worked and what a price I paid for my night time teacher Baraninus ! Like another Nicodemus he was afraid of the Jews ! . Nor was Jerome content merely to gather up this or that teacher s words ; he gathered from all quarters whatever might prove of use to him in this_task . From the outset he had accumulated the best possible copies of the Bible and the best commentators on it , but now he worked on copies from the synagogues and from the library formed -atti_degli_apostoli- Caesarea by Origen and Eusebius ; he hoped by assiduous comparison of texts to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- greater certainty touching the actual text and its meaning . With this_same purpose he went all through Palestine . For he was thoroughly convinced of the truth of what he once wrote to Domnio and Rogatian : A man will understand_the Bible better if he has seen Judaea with_his own eyes and discovered its ancient cities and sites either under the old names or newer ones . In company with some learned Hebrews I went through the entire land the names of whose sites are on every Christian s lips . He nourished his_soul unceasingly on this_most pleasant food : he explained St . Paul s Epistles ; he corrected the Latin version of the Old Testament by the Greek ; he translated afresh nearly all the books of the Old Testament from Hebrew into Latin ; day_by_day he discussed Biblical questions with the brethren who came to him , and answered letters on Biblical questions which poured in upon him from all sides ; besides all this , he was constantly refuting men_who assailed Catholic doctrine and unity . Indeed , such was his_love for Holy Scripture that he ceased not from writing or dictating till his hand stiffened in death and his voice was silent forever . So it was that , sparing himself neither labor nor watching nor expense , he continued to extreme old age meditating day and night beside the Crib on the Law of the Lord ; of greater profit to the Catholic cause by his_life and example in his solitude than if he had passed his_life -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , the capital of the world . After this preliminary account of St . Jerome s life and labors we may now treat of his_teaching on the divine dignity and absolute truth of Scripture . You will_not find a page in his writings which_does_not show clearly that he , in common with the whole Catholic Church , firmly and consistently held that the Sacred Books written as they_were under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit have God for their Author , and as such were delivered to the Church . Thus he asserts that the Books of the Bible were composed -atti_degli_apostoli- the inspiration , or suggestion , or even -atti_degli_apostoli- the dictation of the Holy Spirit ; even that_they were written and edited by Him . Yet he never questions but_that the individual authors of these Books worked in full freedom under the Divine afflatus , each of them in accordance_with his individual nature and character . Thus he -isaia- not merely content to affirm as a general principle what indeed pertains to all the sacred writers that_they followed the Spirit of God as they wrote , in such sort that God -isaia- the principal cause of all that Scripture means and says ; but he also accurately describes what pertains to each_individual writer . In each case Jerome shows us how , in composition , in language , in style and mode of expression , each of them uses his_own gifts and powers ; hence he -isaia- able to portray and describe for us their individual character , almost their_very features ; this -isaia-_especially so in his treatment of the Prophets and of St . This partnership of God and man in the production of a work in common Jerome illustrates by the case of a workman who uses instruments for the production of his_work ; for he says_that whatsoever the sacred authors say '' Is the word of God , and not their_own ; and what_the Lord says by their mouths He says , as it were , by means of an instrument . If we ask how we are to explain this_power and action of God , the principal cause , on the sacred writers we shall find that St . Jerome in no wise differs from the common teaching of the Catholic Church . For he holds that God , through His grace , illumines the writer s mind regarding the particular truth_which , '' in the person of God , '' he -isaia- to set before men ; he holds , moreover , that God moves the writer s will nay , even impels it to write ; finally , that God abides with_him unceasingly , in unique fashion , until his task -isaia- accomplished . Whence the Saint infers the supreme excellence and dignity of Scripture , and declares that knowledge of it -isaia- to be likened to the '' treasure '' and the '' pearl beyond price , '' since in them are to be found the riches of Christ and '' silver wherewith to adorn God s house . Jerome also insists on the supereminent authority of Scripture . When controversy arose he had recourse to the Bible as a storehouse of arguments , and he used its testimony as a weapon for refuting his adversaries arguments , because he held that the Bible s witness afforded solid and irrefutable arguments . Thus , when Helvidius denied the perpetual virginity of the Mother of God , Jerome was content simply to reply : Just as we do not deny these_things which_are written , so do we repudiate things_that_are not written . That God was_born of a Virgin we believe , because we read it . That Mary was married after His birth we do not believe because we do not read it . In the same fashion he undertakes to defend against Jovinian , with precisely_the same weapons , the Catholic doctrines of the virginal state , of perseverance , of abstinence , and of the merit of good_works : In refuting his statements I shall rely especially on the testimony of Scripture , lest he should grumble and complain that_he_has been vanquished rather by my eloquence than by the truth . So , too , when defending himself against the same Helvidius , he says : '' He was , you might say , begged to yield to me , and be led away as a willing and unresisting captive in the bonds of truth . '' Again , '' We must_not follow_the errors of our parents , nor of those_who_have gone before us ; we have_the authority of the Scriptures and God s teaching to command us . '' Once more , when showing Fabiola how to deal_with critics , he says : When you_are really instructed in the Divine Scriptures , and have realized that_its laws and testimonies are the bonds of truth , then you can contend with adversaries ; then you will fetter them and lead_them bound into captivity ; then of the foes you have_made captive you will_make freemen of God . Jerome further shows_that the immunity of Scripture from error or deception -isaia- necessarily bound up with its Divine inspiration and supreme_authority . He says he had learnt this in the most celebrated schools , whether of East or West , and that_it_was taught him as the doctrine of the Fathers , and generally received . Thus when , -atti_degli_apostoli- the instance of Pope Damasus , he had begun correcting the Latin text of the New Testament , and certain '' manikins '' had vehemently attacked him for '' making corrections in the Gospels in face of the authority of the Fathers and of general opinion , '' Jerome briefly replied that he was_not so utterly stupid nor so grossly uneducated as to imagine that the Lord s words needed any correction or were_not divinely inspired . Similarly , when explaining Ezechiel s first vision as portraying the Four Gospels , he remarks : That the entire body and the back were full of eyes will be plain to anybody who realizes that_there_-isaia- nought in the Gospels which_does_not shine and illumine the world by its splendor , so that_even things_that seem trifling and unimportant shine with the majesty of the Holy Spirit . What he has said here of the Gospels he applies in his Commentaries to the rest of the Lord s words ; he regards it as the very rule and foundation of Catholic interpretation ; indeed , for Jerome , a true prophet was to be distinguished from a false by this_very note of truth : '' The Lord s words are true ; for Him to say it , means that_it_-isaia- . '' Again , '' Scripture cannot lie '' ; it -isaia- wrong to say Scripture lies , nay , it -isaia- impious even to admit the very notion of error where_the Bible -isaia- concerned . '' The Apostles , '' he says , '' are one_thing ; other writers '' that_-isaia- , profane writers '' are another ; '' '' the former always tell the truth ; the latter as being mere men sometimes err , '' and though many things_are said in the Bible which seem incredible , yet they_are true ; in this '' word of truth '' you cannot find things or statements which_are contradictory , '' there_-isaia-_nothing discordant nor conflicting '' ; consequently , '' when Scripture seems to be in conflict with itself both passages are true despite their diversity . Holding principles like these , Jerome was compelled , when he discovered apparent discrepancies in the Sacred Books , to use every endeavor to unravel the difficulty . If he felt that he had not satisfactorily settled the problem , he would return to it again_and_again , not_always , indeed , with the happiest results . Yet he would never accuse the sacred writers of the slightest mistake '' that we leave to impious folk like Celsus , Porphyry , and Julian . '' Here he -isaia- in full agreement with Augustine , who wrote to Jerome that to the Sacred Books alone had he been wont to accord such honor and reverence as firmly to believe_that none of their writers had ever fallen into any error ; and that consequently , if in the said books he came across anything which seemed to run counter to the truth , he did_not think_that that_was really the case , but either that_his copy was defective or that the translator had made a mistake , or again , that he himself had failed to understand . He continues : Nor do I deem that_you think otherwise . Indeed , I absolutely decline to think_that you would_have people read your_own books in the same_way as they read those of the Prophets and Apostles ; the idea that_these latter could contain any errors -isaia- impious . Jerome s teaching on this_point serves to confirm and illustrate what our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , declared to be the ancient and traditional belief of the Church touching the absolute immunity of Scripture from error : So far -isaia- it from being the case that error can be compatible with inspiration , that , on the contrary , it not_only of its_very nature precludes the presence of error , but as necessarily excludes it and forbids it as God , the Supreme Truth , necessarily cannot be the Author of error . Then , after giving the definitions of the Councils of Florence and Trent , confirmed by the Council of the Vatican , Pope Leo continues : Consequently it -isaia- not to the point to suggest that the Holy Spirit used men as His instruments for writing , and that therefore , while no error -isaia- referable to the primary Author , it may well be due to the inspired authors themselves . For by supernatural power the Holy Spirit so stirred them and moved them to write , so assisted them as they wrote , that their_minds could rightly conceive only those and all those things_which He himself bade them conceive ; only such things could they faithfully commit to writing and aptly express with unerring truth ; else God would_not be the Author of the entirety of Sacred Scripture . But although these_words of our predecessor leave no room_for doubt or dispute , it grieves us to find that not_only men outside , but_even children of the Catholic Church nay , what_-isaia- a peculiar sorrow to us , even clerics and professors of sacred learning who in their_own conceit either openly repudiate or -atti_degli_apostoli- least attack in secret the Church s teaching on this_point . We warmly commend , of course , those_who , with the assistance of critical methods , seek to discover new ways of explaining the difficulties in Holy Scripture , whether for their_own guidance or to help others . But we remind them that_they_will only come to miserable grief if they neglect our predecessor s injunctions and overstep the limits set by the Fathers . Yet no one_can pretend that certain recent writers really adhere to these limitations . For while conceding that inspiration extends to every phrase and , indeed , to every single word of Scripture yet , by endeavoring to distinguish between what_they style the primary or religious and the secondary or profane element in the Bible , they claim that the effect of inspiration namely , absolute truth and immunity from error are to be restricted to that primary or religious element . Their notion -isaia- that_only what concerns religion_-isaia- intended and taught by God in Scripture , and that all the rest things concerning '' profane knowledge , '' the garments in which Divine truth_-isaia- presented God merely permits , and even leaves to the individual author s greater or less knowledge . Small wonder , then_,_that in their view a considerable number of things occur in the Bible touching physical science , history and the like , which_cannot be reconciled with modern progress in science ! . Some even maintain that_these views do not conflict with what our predecessor laid_down since so they claim he said_that the sacred writers spoke in accordance_with_the external and thus deceptive appearance of things in nature . But the Pontiff s own words show that_this_-isaia- a rash and false deduction . For sound philosophy teaches_that the senses can_never be deceived as regards their_own proper and immediate object . Therefore , from the merely external appearance of things of which , of course , we have_always to take account as Leo XIII , following in the footsteps of St . Thomas , most wisely remarks we can_never conclude that_there_-isaia- any error in Sacred Scripture . Moreover , our predecessor , sweeping aside all such distinctions between what these critics are pleased to call primary and secondary elements , says in no ambiguous fashion that '' those_who fancy that_when it -isaia-_a_question of the truth of certain expressions we have_not got to consider so much what God said as why He said it , '' are_very far indeed from the truth . He also teaches_that Divine inspiration extends to every_part of the Bible without_the slightest exception , and that no error can occur in the inspired text : '' It would be wholly impious to limit inspiration to certain portions only of Scripture or to concede that the sacred authors themselves could have erred . Those , too , who hold that the historical portions of Scripture do not rest on the absolute truth of the facts but merely upon what_they are pleased to term their relative truth , namely , what people then commonly thought , are no less_than are the aforementioned critics out of harmony_with_the Church s teaching , which_-isaia- endorsed by the testimony of Jerome and other Fathers . Yet they_are_not afraid to deduce such views from the words of Leo XIII on the ground that he allowed that the principles he had laid_down touching the things of nature could be applied to historical things as well . Hence they maintain that precisely as the sacred writers spoke of physical things according to appearance , so , too , while ignorant of the facts , they narrated them in accordance_with general opinion or even on baseless evidence ; neither do they tell us the sources whence they derived their knowledge , nor do they_make other peoples narrative their_own . Such views are clearly false , and constitute a calumny on our predecessor . After all , what analogy -isaia- there between physics and history ? For whereas physics -isaia- concerned_with '' sensible appearances '' and must consequently square with phenomena , history on the contrary , must square with the facts , since history -isaia- the written account of events as they actually occurred . If we were to accept such views , how could we maintain the truth insisted on throughout Leo XIII s Encyclical viz . that the sacred narrative -isaia- absolutely free_from error ? . And if Leo XIII does say that_we_can apply to history and cognate subjects the same principles_which hold good for science , he yet does_not lay this down as a universal law , but simply says that_we_can apply a like line of argument when refuting the fallacies of adversaries and defending the historical truth of Scripture from their assaults . Nor do modern innovators stop here : they even try to claim St . Jerome as a patron of their views on the ground that he maintained that historic truth and sequence were_not observed in the Bible , '' precisely as things actually took_place , but in accordance_with what men thought -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , '' and that he even held that_this was_the true norm for history . Jerome s words ! He does_not say that_when giving us an account of events the writer was ignorant of the truth and simply adopted the false views then current ; he merely says_that in giving names to persons or things he followed general custom . Thus the Evangelist calls St . Joseph the father of Jesus , but_what he meant by the title '' father '' here -isaia- abundantly clear from the whole context . Jerome '' the true norm of history '' -isaia- this : when_it_-isaia- question of such appellatives as '' father , '' etc , and when there_-isaia- no danger or error , then a writer must adopt the ordinary forms of speech simply because such forms of speech are in ordinary use . More than_this : Jerome maintains that belief in the Biblical narrative -isaia- as necessary to salvation as -isaia- belief in the doctrines of the faith ; thus in his Commentary on the Epistle to Philemon he says : '' What I mean -isaia- this : Does any man believe in God the Creator ? He cannot do so unless he first believe_that the things written of God s Saints are true . '' He then gives examples from the Old Testament , and adds : '' Now unless a man believes all these and other_things too which_are written of the Saints he cannot believe in the God of the Saints . Jerome -isaia- in complete agreement with St . Augustine , who sums up the general belief of Christian antiquity when he says : Holy Scripture -isaia- invested with supreme_authority by reason of its sure and momentous teachings regarding the faith . Whatever , then , it tells us of Enoch , Elias and Moses that we believe . We do not , for instance , believe_that God s Son was_born of the Virgin Mary simply because He could_not otherwise have appeared in the flesh and walked amongst men as Faustus would_have it but we believe it simply because_it_-isaia- written in Scripture ; and unless we believe in Scripture we can neither be Christians nor be saved . Then there_are other assailants of Holy Scripture who misuse principles_which are only sound , if kept within due bounds in order to overturn the fundamental truth of the Bible and thus destroy Catholic teaching handed_down by the Fathers . If Jerome were living now he would sharpen his keenest controversial weapons against people_who set_aside what_-isaia- the mind and judgment of the Church , and take too ready a refuge in such notions as '' implicit quotations '' or '' pseudo historical narratives , '' or in '' kinds of literature '' in the Bible such as cannot be reconciled with the entire and perfect truth of God s word , or who suggest such origins of the Bible as must inevitably weaken if not destroy its authority . What can we say of men_who in expounding the very Gospels so whittle away the human trust we should repose in it as to overturn Divine faith in it ? They refuse to allow that the things_which Christ said or did have come down to us unchanged and entire through witnesses who carefully committed to writing what they_themselves had seen or heard . They maintain and particularly in their treatment of the Fourth Gospel that much -isaia- due of course to the Evangelists who , however , added much from their_own imaginations ; but much , too , -isaia- due to narratives compiled by the faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- other periods , the result , of course , being that the twin streams now flowing in the same channel cannot be distinguished from one_another . Not thus did Jerome and Augustine and the other Doctors of the Church understand_the historical trustworthiness of the Gospels ; yet of it one wrote : '' He who saw it has borne witness , and his witness -isaia- true ; and he knows that he tells the truth , and you also may believe '' Jn . Jerome : after rebuking the heretical framers of the apocryphal Gospels for '' attempting rather to fill up the story than to tell it truly , '' he says of the Canonical Scriptures : '' None can doubt but_that what_-isaia- written took_place . '' Here again he -isaia- in fullest harmony_with Augustine , who so beautifully says : '' These things_are true ; they_are faithfully and truthfully written of Christ ; so that whosoever believes His Gospel may be thereby instructed in the truth and misled by no lie . All this shows us how earnestly we must strive to avoid , as children of the Church , this insane freedom in ventilating opinions which_the Fathers were careful to shun . This we shall more readily achieve if you , Venerable Brethren , will_make both clergy and laity committed to your_care by the Holy Spirit realize_that neither Jerome nor the other Fathers of the Church learned their doctrine touching Holy Scripture save in the school of the Divine Master Himself . We know what He felt about Holy Scripture : when He said , '' It -isaia- written , '' and '' the Scripture must needs be fulfilled , '' we have therein an argument which admits of no exception and which_should put an end to all controversy . Yet it -isaia- worthwhile dwelling on this_point a little : when Christ preached to the people , whether on the Mount by the lakeside , or in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , or in His own city of Capharnaum , He took His points and His arguments from the Bible . From the same source came His weapons when disputing with the Scribes and Pharisees . Whether teaching or disputing He quotes from all parts of Scripture and takes His example from it ; He quotes it as an argument which_must be accepted . He refers without_any discrimination of sources to the stories of Jonas and the Ninivites , of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon , of Elias and Eliseus , of David and of Noe , of Lot and the Sodomites , and even of Lot s wife . How solemn His witness to the truth of the sacred_books : '' One jot , or one tittle shall_not pass of the Law till all be fulfilled '' Mt . : ; and again : '' The Scripture cannot be broken '' Jn . : ; and consequently : '' He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments , and shall so teach men shall be called the least in the kingdom_of_heaven '' Mt . Before His Ascension , too , when He would steep His Apostles in the same doctrine : '' He opened their understanding that they_might understand_the Scriptures . And He said to them : thus it -isaia- written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise again from the dead the third day '' Lk . In a word , then : Jerome s teaching on the superexcellence and truth of Scripture -isaia- Christ s teaching . Wherefore we exhort all the Church s children , and especially_those whose duty it -isaia- to teach in seminaries , to follow closely in St . If they_will but do so they_will learn to prize as he prized the treasure of the Scriptures , and will derive from them most abundant and blessed fruit . Now , if we make_use of the '' Greatest of Doctors '' as our guide and teacher we shall derive from so doing not_only the gains signalized above , but others too , which_cannot be regarded as trifling or few . What these gains are , Venerable Brethren , we will set_out briefly . At the outset , then , we are deeply impressed by the intense love of the Bible which St . Jerome exhibits in his whole_life and teaching : both are steeped in the Spirit of God . This intense love of the Bible he was ever striving to kindle in the hearts of the faithful , and his_words on this_subject to the maiden Demetrias are really addressed to us all : '' Love the Bible and wisdom will love you ; love it and it will preserve you ; honor it and it will embrace you ; these_are the jewels which you_should wear on your breast and in your ears . His unceasing reading of the Bible and his painstaking study of each book nay , of every phrase and word gave him a knowledge of the text such as no other ecclesiastical writer of old possessed . It -isaia- due to this familiarity with the text and to his_own acute judgment that the Vulgate version Jerome made -isaia- , in the judgment of all capable men , preferable to any_other ancient version , since it appears to give us the sense of the original more accurately and with_greater elegance than they . The said Vulgate , '' approved by so many centuries of use in the Church '' was pronounced by the Council of Trent '' authentic , '' and the same Council insisted that_it_was to be used in teaching and in the liturgy . If God in His mercy grants us life , we sincerely hope to see an amended and faithfully restored edition . We have no doubt_that when this arduous task entrusted by our predecessor , Pius X , to the Benedictine Order has_been completed it will prove of great assistance in the study of the Bible . Jerome s love of the Bible : this_-isaia- so conspicuous in his letters that_they almost seem woven out of Scripture texts ; and , as St . Bernard found no taste in things_which did_not echo the most sweet Name of Jesus , so no literature made any appeal to Jerome unless it derived its light from Holy Scripture . Thus he wrote to Paulinus , formerly senator and even consul , and only recently converted to the faith : If only you had this foundation knowledge of Scripture ; nay , more if you would let Scripture give the finishing touches to your work I should find nothing_more beautiful , more learned , even nothing_more Latin than your volumes . If you could but add to your wisdom and eloquence study of and real acquaintance with Holy Scripture , we should speedily have to acknowledge you a leader amongst us . How we are to seek for this_great treasure , given as it -isaia- by our Father in heaven for our solace during_this earthly pilgrimage , St . Jerome s example shows us . First , we must be well prepared and must possess a good_will . Thus Jerome himself , immediately on his baptism , determined to remove whatever might prove a hindrance to his ambitions in this respect . Like the men_who found a treasure and '' for joy thereof went and sold all that he had and bought that field '' Mt . : , so did Jerome say farewell to the idle pleasures of this passing world ; he went into the desert , and since he realized what risks he had run in the past through the allurements of vice , he adopted a most severe style of life . With all obstacles thus removed he prepared his_soul for '' the knowledge of Jesus Christ '' and for putting on Him Who was '' meek and humble of heart . '' But he went through what Augustine also experienced when he took up the study of Scripture . For the latter has told us how , steeped as a youth in Cicero and profane authors , the Bible seemed to him unfit to be compared with Cicero . My swelling pride shrank from its modest garb , while my gaze could_not pierce to what_the latter hid . Of a truth Scripture was meant to grow up with the childlike ; but then I could_not be childlike ; turgid eloquence appealed mightily to me . Jerome ; even_though withdrawn into the desert he still found such delight in profane literature that -atti_degli_apostoli- first he failed to discern the lowly Christ in His lowly Scriptures : Wretch that I was ! I read Cicero even before I broke my fast ! And after_the long night watches , when memory of my past sins wrung tears from my soul , even then I took up my Plautus ! Then perhaps I would come to my senses and would start reading the Prophets . But their uncouth language made me shiver , and , since blind eyes do not see the light , I blamed the sun and not my own eyes . But in a brief space Jerome became so enamored of the '' folly of the Cross '' that he himself serves as a proof of the extent to which a humble and devout frame of mind -isaia- conducive to the understanding of Holy Scripture . He realized that '' in expounding Scripture we need God s Holy Spirit '' ; he saw that one_cannot otherwise read or understand it '' than the Holy Spirit by Whom it was written demands . '' Consequently , he was ever humbly praying for God s assistance and for the light of the Holy Spirit , and asking his friends to do the same for him . We find him commending to the Divine assistance and to his brethren s prayers his Commentaries on various books as he began them , and then rendering God due thanks when completed . As he trusted to God s grace , so too did he rely upon the authority of his predecessors : '' What I have learned I did_not teach myself a wretchedly presumptous teacher ! but I learned it from illustrious men in the Church . '' Again : '' In studying Scripture I never trusted to myself . '' To Theophilus , Bishop of Alexandria , he imparted the rule he had laid_down for his_own student life : '' It has_always_been my custom to fight for the prerogatives of a Christian , not to overpass the limits set by the Fathers , always to bear in mind_that Roman faith praised by the Apostle . He ever paid submissive homage to the Church , our supreme teacher through the Roman Pontiffs . Thus , with_a_view to putting an end to the controversy raging in the East concerning the mystery of the Holy Trinity , he submitted the question to the Roman See for settlement , and wrote from the Syrian desert to Pope Damasus as follows : I decided , therefore , to consult the Chair of Peter and that Roman faith_which the Apostle praised ; I ask for my soul s food from that city wherein I first put on the garment of Christ . I , who follow no other leader save Christ , associate myself with Your Blessedness , in communion , that_-isaia- , with the Chair of Peter . For I know_the Church was built upon that Rock . I beg you to settle this dispute . If you desire it I shall_not be afraid to say there_are Three Hypostases . If it -isaia- your wish let_them draw up a Symbol of faith subsequent to that of Nicaea , and let us orthodox praise God in the same form of words as the Arians employ . And in his next letter : '' Meanwhile I keep crying out , Any man who_-isaia- joined to Peter s Chair , he -isaia- my man . '' Since he had learnt this '' rule of faith '' from his study of the Bible , he was able to refute a false interpretation of a Biblical text with the simple remark : '' Yes , but the Church of God does_not admit that . '' When , again , Vigilantius quoted an Apocryphal book , Jerome was content to reply : '' A book I have_never so much as read ! For what_-isaia- the good of soiling one s hands with a book the Church does_not receive ? '' With his strong insistence on adhering to the integrity of the faith , it -isaia- not to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- that he attacked vehemently those_who left the Church ; he promptly regarded them as his_own personal enemies . '' To put it briefly , '' he says , '' I have_never spared heretics , and have_always striven to regard the Church s enemies as my own . '' To Rufinus he writes : '' There -isaia- one point in which I cannot agree with you : you ask me to spare heretics or , in other_words not to prove myself a Catholic . '' Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time Jerome deplored the lamentable state of heretics , and adjured them to return to their sorrowing Mother , the one source of salvation ; he prayed , too , with all earnestness for the conversion of those '' who_had quitted the Church and put away the Holy Spirit s teaching to follow their_own notions . Was there ever a time , Venerable Brethren , when there_was greater call than now for us all , lay and cleric alike , to imbibe the spirit of this '' Greatest of Doctors '' ? For there_are_many contumacious folk now who sneer -atti_degli_apostoli- the authority and government of God , Who has revealed Himself , and of the Church which teaches . You know for Leo XIII warned us '' how insistently men fight against us ; You know_the arms and arts they rely upon . '' It -isaia- your duty , then , to train as many really fit defenders of this holiest of causes as you can . They must be ready to combat not_only those_who deny the existence of the Supernatural Order altogether , and are thus led to deny the existence of any divine_revelation or inspiration , but those , too , who through an itching desire_for novelty venture to interpret the sacred_books as though_they were of purely human origin ; Those , too , who scoff -atti_degli_apostoli- opinions held of old in the Church , or who , through contempt of its teaching office , either reck little of , or silently disregard , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least obstinately endeavor to adapt to their_own views , the Constitutions of the Apostolic See or the decisions of the Pontifical Biblical Commission . Would that all Catholics would cling to St . Jerome s golden rule and obediently listen to their Mother s words , so as modestly to keep within_the bounds marked out by the Fathers and ratified by the Church . To return , however , to the question of the formation of Biblical students . We must lay the foundations in piety and humility of mind ; only_when we have_done that does St . Jerome invite us to study the Bible . In the first_place , he insists , in season and out , on daily reading of the text . '' Provided , '' he says , '' our bodies are_not the slaves of sin , wisdom will come to us ; but exercise your mind , feed it daily with Holy Scripture . '' And again : '' We have got , then , to read Holy Scripture assiduously ; we have got to meditate on the Law of God day and night so that , as expert money changers , we may_be_able to detect false coin from true . For matrons and maidens alike he lays down the same rule . Thus , writing to the Roman matron Laeta about her daughter s training , he says : Every day she should give_you a definite account of her Bible reading . For her the Bible must_take the place of silks and jewels . Let her learn the Psalter first , and find her recreation in its songs ; let her learn from Solomon s Proverbs the way_of_life , from Ecclesiastes how to trample on the world . In Job she will_find an example of patient virtue . Thence let her pass to the Gospels ; they should_always be in her hands . She should steep herself in the Acts and the Epistles . And when_she has enriched her soul with_these treasures she should commit to memory the Prophets , the Heptateuch , Kings and Chronicles , Esdras and Esther : then she_can learn the Canticle of Canticles without_any fear . He says the same to Eustochium : '' Read assiduously and learn as much as you can . Let sleep find you holding your Bible , and when your head nods let it be resting on the sacred page . '' When he sent Eustochium the epitaph he had composed for_her mother Paula , he especially praised that holy woman for having so wholeheartedly devoted herself and her daughter to Bible study that_she knew the Bible through and through , and had committed it to memory . He continues : I will tell you another thing about her , though evil disposed people may cavil -atti_degli_apostoli- it : she determined to learn Hebrew , a language which I myself , with immense labor and toil from my youth upwards , have only partly learned , and which I even_now dare not_cease studying lest it should quit me . But Paula learned it , and so well that_she could chant the Psalms in Hebrew , and could speak it , too , without_any trace of a Latin accent . We can_see the same thing even_now in her daughter Eustochium . He tells us much the same of Marcella , who also knew the Bible exceedingly well . And none can fail to see what profit and sweet tranquillity must result in well disposed souls from such devout reading of the Bible . Whosoever comes to it in piety , faith and humility , and with determination to make progress in it , will assuredly find therein and will eat the '' Bread that cometh down from heaven '' Jn . : ; he will , in his_own person , experience the truth of David s words : '' The hidden and uncertain things of Thy Wisdom Thou hast made manifest to me ! '' Ps . : , for_this table of the '' Divine Word '' does really '' contain holy teaching , teach the true faith , and lead us unfalteringly beyond_the veil into the Holy of Holies . '' Hence , as far as in us lies , we , Venerable Brethren , shall , with St . Jerome as our guide , never desist from urging the faithful to read daily the Gospels , the Acts and the Epistles , so as to gather thence food for their_souls . Our thoughts naturally turn just now to the Society of St . Jerome , which we ourselves were instrumental in founding ; its success has gladdened us , and we trust that the future will see a great impulse given to it . The object of this Society -isaia- to put into the hands of as many_people as possible the Gospels and Acts , so that_every Christian family may_have them and become accustomed to reading them . This we have much -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , for we have_seen how useful it -isaia- . We earnestly hope , then_,_that similar Societies will be founded in your dioceses and affiliated to the parent Society here . Commendation , too , -isaia- due to Catholics in other countries who_have published the entire New Testament , as well as selected portions of the Old , in neat and simple form so as to popularize their use . Much again must accrue to the Church of God when numbers of people thus approach this table of heavenly instruction which_the Lord provided through the ministry of His Prophets , Apostles and Doctors for the entire Christian world . Jerome begs for assiduous reading of the Bible by the faithful in general , he insists on it for those_who_are called to '' bear the yoke of Christ '' and preach His word . His words to Rusticus the monk apply to all clerics : So long as you_are in your_own country regard you cell as your orchard ; there you can gather Scripture s various fruits and enjoy_the pleasures it affords you . Always have a book in your hands and read it ; learn the Psalter by heart ; pray unceasingly ; watch over your senses lest idle thoughts creep in . Similarly to Nepotian : Constantly read the Bible ; in fact , have it always in your hands . Learn what_you have got to teach . Get firm hold of that '' faithful word that_-isaia- according to doctrine , that_you_may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and convince the gainsayers . '' When reminding Paulinus of the lessons St . Paul gave to Timothy and Titus , and which he himself had derived_from the Bible , Jerome says : A mere holy rusticity only avails the man_himself ; but however much a life so meritorious may serve to build up the Church of God , it does as much harm to the Church if it fails to '' resist the gainsayer . '' Malachias the Prophet says , or rather the Lord says it by Malachias : '' Ask for the Law from the priests . '' For it -isaia- the priest s duty to give an answer when asked about the Law . In Deuteronomy we read : '' Ask thy father and he will tell thee ; ask the priests and they_will tell thee . '' Daniel , too , -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of his glorious vision , declares that '' the just shall shine like stars and they that_are learned as the brightness of the firmament . '' What a vast difference , then , between a righteous rusticity and a learned righteousness ! The former likened to the stars ; the latter to the heavens themselves ! He writes ironically to Marcella about the '' self righteous lack of education '' noticeable in some clerics , who '' think_that to be without culture and to be holy are the same thing , and who dub themselves disciples of the fisherman ; as though_they were holy simply because ignorant ! '' Nor -isaia- it only the '' uncultured '' whom Jerome condemns . Learned clerics sin through ignorance of the Bible ; therefore he demands of them an assiduous reading of the text . Strive , then , Venerable Brethren , to bring home to your clerics and priests these teachings of the Sainted Commentator . You have to remind them constantly of the demands made by their divine vocation if they_would be worthy of it : '' The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge , and men shall ask the Law -atti_degli_apostoli- his mouth , for he -isaia- the Angel of the Lord of hosts '' Mal . They must realize , then_,_that they_cannot neglect study of the Bible , and that_this can_only be undertaken along the lines laid_down by Leo XIII in his Encyclical Providentissimus Deus . They cannot do this better_than by frequenting the Biblical Institute established by our predecessor , Pius X , in accordance_with_the wishes of Leo XIII . As the experience of the past ten years has shown , it has proved a great gain to the Church . Not all , however , can avail themselves of this . It will be well , then , Venerable Brethren , that picked men , both of the secular and regular clergy , should come to Rome for Biblical study . All will_not come with the same object . Some , in accordance_with_the real purpose of the Institute , will so devote_themselves to Biblical study that '' afterwards , both in private and in public , whether by writing or by teaching , whether as professors in Catholic schools or by writing in defense of Catholic truth , they may_be_able worthily to uphold the cause of Biblical study . '' Others , however , already priests , will obtain here a wider knowledge of the Bible than they_were able to acquire during their theological course ; they_will gain , too , an acquaintance with the great commentators and with Biblical history and geography . Such knowledge will avail them much in their_ministry ; they_will be '' instructed to every good work . We learn , then , from St . Jerome s example and teaching the qualities required in one who_would devote himself to Biblical study . But what , in his view , -isaia- the goal of such study ? First , that_from the Bible s pages we learn spiritual perfection . Meditating as he did day and night on the Law of the Lord and on His Scriptures , Jerome himself found there the '' Bread that cometh down from heaven , '' the manna containing all delights . And we certainly cannot do without that bread . How can a cleric teach others the way of salvation if through neglect of meditation on God s word he fails to teach himself ? What confidence can he have that , when ministering to others , he -isaia- really '' a leader of the blind , a light to them that_are in darkness , an instructor of the foolish , having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law , '' if he -isaia- unwilling to study the said Law and thus shuts the door on any divine illumination on it ? Alas ! many of God s ministers , through never looking -atti_degli_apostoli- their Bible , perish themselves and allow many_others to perish also . '' The children have asked for bread , and there_was none to break it unto them '' Lam . : ; and '' With desolation -isaia- all the land made desolate , for there_-isaia- none than meditateth in the heart '' Jer . Secondly , it -isaia- from the Bible that we gather confirmations and illustrations of any particular doctrine we wish to defend . In this Jerome was marvelously expert . When disputing with the heretics of his day he refuted them by singularly apt and weighty arguments drawn_from the Bible . If men of the present age would but imitate him in this we should see realized what our predecessor , Leo XIII , in his Encyclical , Providentissimus Deus , said was so eminently desirable : '' The Bible influencing our theological teaching and indeed becoming its_very soul . Lastly , the real value of the Bible -isaia- for our preaching if the latter -isaia- to be fruitful . On this_point it -isaia- a pleasure to illustrate from Jerome what we ourselves said in our Encyclical on '' preaching the Word of God , '' entitled Humani generis . How insistently Jerome urges on priests assiduous reading of the Bible if they_would worthily teach and preach ! Their words will_have neither value nor weight nor any power to touch men s souls save in proportion as they_are '' informed '' by Holy Scripture : '' Let a priest s speech be seasoned with the Bible , '' for '' the Scriptures are a trumpet that stirs us with a mighty voice and penetrates to the soul of them that believe , '' and '' nothing so strikes home as an example taken from the Bible . These mainly concern the exegetes , yet preachers , too , must_always bear them in mind . Jerome s first rule -isaia- careful study of the actual words so that_we_may be perfectly certain what_the writer really does say . He was most careful to consult the original text , to compare various versions , and , if he discovered any mistake in them , to explain it and thus make_the text perfectly clear . The precise meaning , too , that attaches to particular words has to be worked out , for '' when discussing Holy Scripture it -isaia- not words we want so much as the meaning of words . '' We do not_for a moment deny that Jerome , in imitation of Latin and Greek doctors before him , leaned too much , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset , towards allegorical interpretations . But his_love of the Bible , his unceasing toil in reading and re reading it and weighing its meaning , compelled him to an ever growing appreciation of its literal sense and to the formulation of sound principles regarding it . These we set down here , for they provide a safe path for us all to follow in getting from the Sacred Books their full meaning . In the first_place , then , we must study the literal or historical meaning : I earnestly warn the prudent reader not to pay attention to superstitious interpretations such as are given cut and dried according to some interpreter s fancy . He should study the beginning , middle , and end , and so form a connected idea of the whole of what he finds written . Jerome then goes on to say that all interpretation rests on the literal sense , and that_we_are not to think that_there_-isaia- no literal sense merely because a thing -isaia- said metaphorically , for '' the history itself_-isaia- often presented in metaphorical dress and described figuratively . '' Indeed , he himself affords the best refutation of those_who maintain that he says_that certain passages have no historical meaning : '' We are_not rejecting the history , we are merely giving a spiritual interpretation of it . '' Once , however , he has firmly established the literal or historical meaning , Jerome goes on to seek our deeper and hidden meanings , as to nourish his mind with more delicate food . Thus he says of the Book of Proverbs and he makes_the same remark about other parts of the Bible that we must_not stop -atti_degli_apostoli- the simple literal sense : '' Just as we have to seek gold in the earth , for the kernel in the shell , for the chestnut s hidden fruit beneath its hairy coverings , so in Holy Scripture we have to dig deep for its divine meaning . When teaching Paulinus '' how to make true progress in the Bible , '' he says : '' Everything we read in the Sacred Books shines and glitters even in its outer shell ; but the marrow of it -isaia- sweeter . If you want the kernel you_must break the shell . '' At the same_time , he insists that in searching for_this deeper meaning we must proceed in due order , '' lest in our search_for spiritual riches we seem to despise the history as poverty stricken . '' Consequently he repudiates many mystical interpretations alleged by ancient writers ; for he feels that_they_are not sufficiently based on the literal meaning : When all these promises of which_the Prophets sang are regarded not merely as empty sounds or idle tropological expressions , but as established on earth and having solid historical foundations , then , can we put on them the coping stone of a spiritual interpretation . On this_point he makes_the wise remark that we ought not to desert the path mapped out by Christ and His Apostles , who , while regarding the Old Testament as preparing for and foreshadowing the New Covenant , and whilst consequently explaining various passages in the former as figurative , yet do not give a figurative interpretation of all alike . In confirmation of this he often refers us to St . Paul , who , when '' explaining the mystery of Adam and Eve , did_not deny that_they were formed , but on that historical basis erected a spiritual interpretation , and said : Therefore shall a man leave , etc . If only Biblical students and preachers would but follow this example of Christ and His Apostles ; if they_would but obey the directions of Leo XIII , and not neglect '' those allegorical or similar explanations which_the Fathers have_given , especially_when these_are based on the literal sense , and are supported by weighty authority '' ; if they_would pass from the literal to the more profound meaning in temperate fashion , and thus lift themselves to a higher plane , they_would , with St . Jerome , realize how true are St . Paul s words : '' All Scripture -isaia- inspired by God and useful for teaching , for reproving , for correcting , for instructing in justice '' Tim . They would , too , derive abundant help from the infinite treasury of facts and ideas in the Bible , and would thence be able to mold firmly but gently the lives and characters of the faithful . As for methods of expounding Holy Scripture '' for amongst the dispensers of the mysteries of God it -isaia- required that a man be found faithful '' St . Jerome lays down that_we_have got to keep to the '' true interpretation , and that the real function of a commentator -isaia- to set_forth not what he himself would_like his author to mean , but_what he really does mean . '' And he continues : '' It -isaia- dangerous to speak in the Church , lest through some faulty interpretation we make Christ s Gospel into man s Gospel . '' And again : '' In explaining the Bible we need no florid oratorical composition , but_that learned simplicity which_-isaia- truth . '' This ideal he ever kept before him ; he acknowledges that in his Commentaries he '' seeks no praise , but so to set_out what another has well said that_it_may be understood in the sense in which it was said . '' He further demands of an expositor of Scripture a style which , '' while leaving no impression of haziness . yet explains things , sets out the meaning , clears up obscurities , and -isaia- not mere verbiage . And here we may set down some passages from his writings which_will serve to show to what an extent he shrank from that declamatory kind of eloquence which simply aims -atti_degli_apostoli- winning empty applause by an equally empty and noisy flow of words . He says to Nepotian : I do not want you to be a declaimer or a garrulous brawler ; rather be skilled in the Mysteries , learned in the Sacraments of God . To make_the populace gape by spinning words and speaking like a whirlwind -isaia- only worthy of empty headed men . And once_more : Students ordained -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time seem not to think how they_may get -atti_degli_apostoli- the real marrow of Holy Scripture , but how best they_may make peoples ears tingle by their flowery declamations ! Again : I prefer to say nothing of men_who , like myself , have passed from profane literature to Biblical study , but who , if they happen once to have caught men s ears by their ornate sermons , straightway begin to fancy that whatsoever they_say -isaia- God s law . Apparently they_do_not think it worth while to discover what_the Prophets and Apostles really meant ; they_are content to string together texts made to fit the meaning they want . One would almost fancy that instead of being a degraded species of oratory , it must be a fine thing to pervert the meaning of the text and compel the reluctant Scripture to yield the meaning one wants ! . '' As a matter of fact , mere loquacity would_not win any credit unless backed by Scriptural authority , that_-isaia- , when men see_that the speaker -isaia- trying to give his false doctrine Biblical support '' Tit . Moreover , this garrulous eloquence and wordy rusticity '' lacks biting power , has nothing vivid or life_giving in it ; it -isaia- flaccid , languid and enervated ; it -isaia- like boiled herbs and grass , which speedily dry up and wither away . '' On the contrary the Gospel teaching_-isaia- straightforward , it -isaia- like that '' least of all seeds '' the mustard seed '' no mere vegetable , but something_that grows into a tree so that the birds of the air come and dwell in its branches . '' The consequence -isaia- that everybody hears gladly this simple and holy fashion of speech , for it -isaia- clear and has real beauty without artificiality : There are certain eloquent folk who puff out_their cheeks and produce a foaming torrent of words ; may_they win all the eulogiums they crave for ! For myself , I prefer so to speak that I may be intelligible ; when I discuss the Bible I prefer the Bible s simplicity . A cleric s exposition of the Bible should , of course , have a certain becoming eloquence ; but he must keep this in the background , for he must ever have in view the human_race and not the leisurely philosophical schools with_their choice coterie of disciples . If the younger clergy would but strive to reduce principles like these to practice , and if their elders would keep such principles before their_eyes , we are_well assured that they_would prove of very real assistance to those_to_whom they minister . It only remains for us , Venerable Brethren , to refer to those '' sweet fruits '' which Jerome gathered from '' the bitter seed '' of literature . For we confidently hope_that his example will fire both clergy and laity with enthusiasm for the study of the Bible . It will be better , however , for you to gather from the lips of the saintly hermit rather_than from our words what real spiritual delight he found in the Bible and its study . Notice , then , in what strain he writes to Paulinus , '' my companion , friend , and fellow mystic '' : '' I beseech you to live amidst these_things . To meditate on them , to know nought else , to have no other interests , this_-isaia- really a foretaste of the joys of heaven . He says much the same to his pupil Paula : Tell me whether you_know of anything more sacred than_this sacred mystery , anything more delightful than the pleasure found herein ? What food , what honey could be sweeter than to learn of God s Providence , to enter_into His shrine and look into the mind of the Creator , to listen to the Lord s words -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the wise of this_world laugh , but_which really are full of spiritual teaching ? Others may have_their wealth , may drink out of jeweled cups , be clad in silks , enjoy popular applause , find it impossible to exhaust their wealth by dissipating it in pleasures of all kinds ; but our delight -isaia- to meditate on the Law of the Lord day and night , to knock -atti_degli_apostoli- His door when shut , to receive our food from the Trinity of Persons , and , under_the_guidance of the Lord , trample under foot the swelling tumults of this_world . And in his Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians , which he dedicated to Paula and her daughter Eustochium , he says : '' If aught could sustain and support a wise man in this_life or help him to preserve his equanimity amid the conflicts of the world , it -isaia- , I reckon , meditation on and knowledge of the Bible . And so it was with Jerome himself : afflicted with many mental anxieties and bodily pains , he yet ever enjoyed an interior peace . Nor was this due simply to some idle pleasure he found in such studies : it sprang from love of God and it worked itself out in an earnest love of God s Church the divinely appointed guardian of God s Word . For in the Books of both Testaments Jerome saw the Church of God foretold . Did not practically every_one of the illustrious and sainted women_who hold a place of honor in the Old Testament prefigure the Church , God s Spouse ? Did not the priesthood , the sacrifices , the solemnities , nay , nearly everything described in the Old Testament shadow forth that_same Church ? How many Psalms and Prophecies he saw fulfilled in that Church ? To him it was clear_that the Church s greatest privileges were set_forth by Christ and His Apostles . Small wonder , then_,_that growing familiarity with the Bible meant for Jerome growing love of the Spouse of Christ . We have_seen with what reverent yet enthusiastic love he attached himself to the Roman Church and to the See of Peter , how eagerly he attacked those_who assailed her . So when applauding Augustine , his junior yet his fellow soldier , and rejoicing in the fact_that they_were one in their hatred of heresy , he hails him_with the words : Well done ! You are famous throughout_the_world . Catholics revere you and point you out as the establisher of the old time faith ; and an even greater glory all heretics hate you . And they hate me too ; unable to slay us with the sword , they_would that wishes could kill . Sulpicius Severus quotes Postumianus to the same effect : His unceasing conflict with wicked men brings on him their hatred . Heretics hate him , for he never ceases attacking them ; clerics hate him , for he assails their criminal lives . But all good men admire him and love him . And Jerome had to endure much from heretics and abandoned men , especially_when the Pelagians laid waste the monastery -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem . Yet all this he bore with equanimity , like a man who_would not_hesitate to die for the faith : I rejoice when I hear that my children are fighting for Christ . May He in whom we believe confirm our zeal so that_we_may gladly shed our blood for His faith . Our very home -isaia- as far as worldly belongings go completely ruined by the heretics ; yet through Christ s mercy it -isaia- filled_with spiritual riches . It -isaia- better to have to be content with dry bread than to lose one s faith . And while he never suffered errors to creep in unnoticed , he likewise never failed to lash with biting tongue any looseness in morals , for he was always anxious '' to present , '' unto Christ '' the Church in all her glory , not having spot or wrinkle or any such things , but_that she might be holy and without blemish '' Eph . How terribly he upbraids men who_have degraded the dignity of the priesthood ! With what vigor he inveighs against the pagan morals then infecting Rome ! But he rightly felt that_nothing could better avail to stem this flood of vice than the spectacle afforded by the real beauty of the Christian life ; and that a love of what_-isaia- really good -isaia- the best antidote to evil . Hence he urged that young_people must be piously brought up , the married taught a holy integrity of life , pure souls have_the beauty of virginity put before them , that the sweet austerity of an interior life should be extolled , and since_the primal law of Christian religion was_the combination of toil with charity , that if this could only be preserved human_society would recover from its disturbed state . Of this charity he says very beautifully : '' The believing soul -isaia- Christ s true temple . Adorn it , deck it out , offer your gifts to it , in it receive Christ . Of what profit to have your walls glittering with jewels while Christ dies of hunger in poverty ? '' . As for toil , his whole_life and not merely his writings afford the best example . Postumianus , who spent six months with_him -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem , says : '' He -isaia- wholly occupied in reading and with books ; he rests neither day nor night ; he -isaia- always either reading or writing something . '' Jerome s love of the Church , too , shines out even in his Commentaries wherein he lets slip no opportunity_for praising the Spouse of Christ : The choicest things of all the nations have come and the Lord s House -isaia- filled_with glory : that_-isaia- , '' the Church of the Living God , the pillar and the ground of truth . With jewels like these -isaia- the Church richer than_ever was_the synagogue ; with_these living stones -isaia- the House of God built up and eternal peace bestowed upon her . Come , let us go up to the Mount of the Lord : for we must needs go up if we would come to Christ and to the House of the God of Jacob , to the Church which_-isaia- '' the pillar and ground of truth . '' By the Lord s voice -isaia- the Church established upon the rock , and her hath the King brought into His chamber , to her by secret condescension hath He put forth His hand through the lattices . Again and again , as in the passages just given , does Jerome celebrate the intimate_union between Christ and His Church . For since_the Head can_never be separated_from the mystical_body , so , too , love of Christ -isaia- ever associated_with zeal of His Church ; and this_love of Christ must ever be the chiefest and most agreeable result of a knowledge of Holy Scripture . So convinced indeed was Jerome that familiarity with the Bible was_the royal road to the knowledge and love of Christ that he did not_hesitate to say : '' Ignorance of the Bible means ignorance of Christ . '' And '' what other life can there be without knowledge of the Bible wherein Christ , the life of them that believe , -isaia- set before us ? Every single page of either Testament seems to center around Christ ; hence Jerome , commenting on the words of the Apocalypse about the River and the Tree of Life , says : One stream flows out from the throne of God , and that_-isaia- the Grace of the Holy Spirit , and that grace of the Holy Spirit -isaia- in the Holy Scriptures , that_-isaia- in the stream of the Scriptures . Yet has that stream twin banks , the Old Testament and the New , and the Tree planted on either side -isaia- Christ . Small wonder , then , if in his devout meditations he applied everything in the Bible to Christ : When I read the Gospel and find there testimonies from the Law and from the Prophets , I see only Christ ; I so see Moses and the Prophets and I understand them of Christ . Then when I come to the splendor of Christ Himself , and when I gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- that glorious sunlight , I care not to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the lamplight . For what light can a lamp give when lit in the daytime ? If the sun shines out , the lamplight does_not show . So , too , when Christ -isaia- present_the Law and the Prophets do not show . Not that I would detract from the Law and the Prophets ; rather do I praise them in that_they show forth Christ . But I so read the Law and the Prophets as not to abide in them but_from them to pass to Christ . Hence was Jerome wondrously uplifted to love for and knowledge of Christ through_his study of the Bible in which he discovered the precious pearl of the Gospel : '' There -isaia- one most priceless pearl : the knowledge of the Savior , the mystery of His Passion , the secret of His Resurrection . '' Burning as he did with the love of Christ we cannot_but marvel that he , poor and lowly with Christ , with soul freed from earthly cares , sought Christ alone , by His spirit was he led , with Him he lived in closest intimacy , by imitating Him he would bear about the image of His sufferings in himself . For him nought more glorious than to suffer with and for Christ . Hence it was that_when on Damasus death he , wounded and weary from evil men s assaults , left Rome and wrote just before he embarked : Though some fancy me a scoundrel and guilty of every crime and , indeed , this_-isaia- a small matter when I think of my sins yet you do well when from your soul you reckon evil men good . Thank God I -amos- deemed worthy to be hated by the world . What real sorrows have I to bear I who fight for the Cross ? Men heap false accusations on me ; yet I know that_through ill report and good report we win the kingdom_of_heaven . In like fashion does he exhort the maiden Eustochium to courageous and lifelong toil for Christ s sake : To become what_the Martyrs , the Apostles , what even Christ Himself was , means immense labor but_what a reward ! . What I have_been saying to you will sound hard to one who_does_not love Christ . But those_who consider worldly pomp a mere offscouring and all under the sun mere nothingness if only they_may win Christ , those_who_are dead with Christ , have risen with Him and have crucified the flesh with its vices and concupiscences they_will echo the words : '' Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ ? '' . Immense , then , was_the profit Jerome derived_from reading Scripture ; hence came those interior illuminations whereby he was ever more_and_more drawn to knowledge and love of Christ ; hence , too , that_love of prayer of which_he_has written so well ; hence his wonderful familiarity with Christ , Whose sweetness drew him so that he ran unfalteringly along the arduous way of the Cross to the palm of victory . Hence , too , his ardent love for the Holy Eucharist : '' Who -isaia- wealthier than he who carries the Lord s Body in his wicker basket , the Lord s Blood in his crystal vessel ? '' Hence , too , his_love for Christ s Mother , whose perpetual virginity he had so keenly defended , whose title as God s Mother and as the greatest example of all the virtues he constantly set before Christ s spouses for their imitation . No one , then , can wonder that Jerome should_have been so powerfully drawn to those spots in Palestine which_had_been consecrated by the presence of our Redeemer and His Mother . It -isaia- easy to recognize_the hand of Jerome in the words written from Bethlehem to Marcella by his_disciples , Paula and Eustochium : What words can serve to describe to you the Savior s cave ? As for the manger in which He lay well , our silence does it more honor than_any poor words of ours . Will the day ever dawn where we can enter His cave to weep -atti_degli_apostoli- His tomb with the sister of Lazarus and mourn with His Mother ; when we can kiss the wood of His Cross and , with the ascending Lord on Olivet , be uplifted in mind and spirit ? Filled with memories such as these , Jerome could , while far away from Rome and leading a life hard for the body but inexpressibly sweet to the soul , cry out : '' Would that Rome had what tiny Bethlehem possesses ! '' . But we rejoice and Rome with us that the Saint s desire has_been fulfilled , though far otherwise than he hoped for . For whereas David s royal city once gloried in the possession of the relics of '' the Greatest Doctor '' reposing in the cave where he dwelt so long , Rome now possesses them , for they lie in St . Mary Major s beside the Lord s Crib . His voice -isaia-_now still , though -atti_degli_apostoli- one time the whole Catholic world listened to it when it echoed from the desert ; yet Jerome still speaks in his writings , which '' shine like lamps throughout_the_world . '' Jerome still calls to us . His voice rings out , telling us of the super excellence of Holy Scripture , of its integral character and historical trustworthiness , telling us , too , of the pleasant fruits resulting from reading and meditating upon it . His voice summons all the Church s children to return to a truly Christian standard of life , to shake themselves free_from a pagan type of morality which seems to have sprung to life again in these_days . His voice calls upon us , and especially on Italian piety and zeal , to restore to the See of Peter divinely established here that honor and liberty which its Apostolic dignity and duty demand . The voice of Jerome summons those Christian nations which_have unhappily fallen away from Mother Church to turn once_more to her in whom lies all hope of eternal_salvation . Would , too , that the Eastern Churches , so long in opposition to the See of Peter , would listen to Jerome s voice . When he lived in the East and sat -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of Gregory and Didymus , he said only what_the Christians of the East thought in his time_when he declared that '' If anyone -isaia- outside the Ark of Noe he will perish in the over whelming flood . '' Today this flood seems on the verge of sweeping away all human institutions unless God steps in to prevent it . And surely this calamity must come if men persist in sweeping on one side God the Creator and Conserver of all things ! Surely whatever cuts itself off from Christ must perish ! Yet He Who -atti_degli_apostoli- His disciples prayer calmed the raging sea can restore peace to the tottering fabric of society . May Jerome , who so loved God s Church and so strenuously defended it against its enemies , win for us the removal of every element of discord , in accordance_with Christ s prayer , so that_there may be '' one fold and one shepherd . Delay not , Venerable Brethren , to impart to your_people and clergy what on the fifteenth centenary of the death of '' the Greatest Doctor '' we have here set before you . Urge upon all not merely to embrace under Jerome s guidance Catholic doctrine touching the inspiration of Scripture , but to hold fast to the principles laid_down in the Encyclical Providentissimus Deus , and in this present Encyclical . Our one desire_for all the Church s children -isaia- that , being saturated with the Bible , they_may arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the all surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ . In testimony of which desire and of our fatherly feeling for you we impart to you and all your flocks the Apostolic blessing . Peter s , Rome , September , , the seventh year_of_our Pontificate .

{"title": "Gaudium Et Spes", "author": "Vatican Council II", "type_of_text": "Documents", "pub_date": "07/12/1965", "text": "The joys and the hopes , the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age , especially_those who_are poor or in any_way afflicted , these_are the joys and hopes , the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ . Indeed , nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their_hearts . For theirs -isaia- a community composed of men . United in Christ , they_are led by the Holy Spirit in their journey to the Kingdom of their Father and they_have welcomed the news of salvation which_-isaia- meant for_every man . That -isaia- why this community realizes that_it_-isaia- truly linked_with mankind and its history by the deepest of bonds . . Hence this Second Vatican Council , having probed more profoundly into the mystery of the Church , now addresses itself without hesitation , not_only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ , but to the whole of humanity . For the council yearns to explain to everyone how it conceives of the presence and activity of the Church in the world of today . Therefore , the council focuses its attention on the world of men , the whole human_family along_with the sum of those realities in the midst of which it lives ; that world which_-isaia- the theater of man s history , and the heir of his energies , his tragedies and his triumphs ; that world_which the Christian sees as created and sustained by its Maker s love , fallen indeed into the bondage of sin , yet emancipated now by Christ , Who was crucified and rose again to break the strangle hold of personified evil , so that_the_world might be fashioned anew according to God s design and reach its fulfillment . . Though mankind -isaia- stricken with wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- its_own discoveries and its power , it often raises anxious questions about the current trend of the world , about the place and role of man in the universe , about the meaning of its individual and collective strivings , and about the ultimate destiny of reality and of humanity . Hence , giving witness and voice to the faith of the whole_people of God gathered together by Christ , this council can provide no more eloquent proof of its solidarity with , as well as its respect and love for the entire human_family with which_it_-isaia- bound up , than by engaging with it in conversation about these various problems . The council brings to mankind light kindled from the Gospel , and puts -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal those saving resources which_the Church herself , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , receives from her Founder . For the human_person deserves to be preserved ; human_society deserves to be renewed . Hence the focal point of our total presentation will be man_himself , whole and entire , body_and_soul , heart and conscience , mind and will . Therefore , this sacred synod , proclaiming the noble destiny of man and championing the Godlike seed which_has_been sown in him , offers to mankind the honest assistance of the Church in fostering that brotherhood of all men which corresponds to this destiny of theirs . Inspired by no earthly ambition , the Church seeks but a solitary goal : to carry forward the work of Christ under the lead of the befriending Spirit . And Christ entered this_world to give witness to the truth , to rescue and not to sit in judgment , to serve and not to be served . INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT THE SITUATION OF MEN IN THE MODERN WORLD . To carry_out such a task , the Church has_always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel . Thus , in language intelligible to each generation , she_can respond to the perennial questions which men ask about_this present life and the life to come , and about the relationship of the one to the other . We must_therefore recognize and understand_the world in which we live , its explanations , its longings , and its often dramatic characteristics . Some of the main features of the modern_world can be sketched as follows . Today , the human_race -isaia- involved in a new stage of history . Profound and rapid changes are spreading by degrees around_the whole_world . Triggered by the intelligence and creative energies of man , these changes recoil upon him , upon his decisions and desires , both individual and collective , and upon his manner of thinking and acting with_respect to things and to people . Hence we can already speak of a true cultural and social transformation , one_which has repercussions on man s religious_life as well . As happens in any crisis of growth , this transformation has brought serious difficulties in its wake . Thus while man extends his_power in every direction , he does not_always succeed in subjecting it to his_own welfare . Striving to probe more profoundly into the deeper recesses of his_own mind , he frequently appears more unsure of himself . Gradually and more precisely he lays bare the laws of society , only to be paralyzed by uncertainty about the direction to give it . Never has the human_race enjoyed such an abundance of wealth , resources and economic power , and yet a huge proportion of the worlds citizens are_still tormented by hunger and poverty , while countless numbers suffer from total illiteracy . Never before has man had so keen an understanding of freedom , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time new_forms of social and psychological slavery make_their appearance . Although the world of today has a very vivid awareness of its unity and of how one man depends on another in needful solidarity , it -isaia- most grievously torn into opposing camps by conflicting forces . For political , social , economic , racial and ideological disputes still continue bitterly , and with_them the peril of a war which_would reduce everything to ashes . True , there_-isaia- a growing exchange of ideas , but the very words by which key concepts are expressed take on quite different meanings in diverse ideological systems . Finally , man painstakingly searches for a better world , without a corresponding spiritual advancement . Influenced by such a variety of complexities , many of our contemporaries are kept from accurately identifying permanent values and adjusting them properly to fresh discoveries . As a result , buffeted between hope and anxiety and pressing one_another with questions about the present course of events , they_are burdened down with uneasiness . This same course of events leads men to look for answers ; indeed , it forces them to do so . . Today s spiritual agitation and the changing conditions of life are part of a broader and deeper revolution . As a result of the latter , intellectual formation_-isaia- ever increasingly based on the mathematical and natural sciences and on those dealing_with man_himself , while in the practical order the technology which stems from_these sciences takes on mounting importance . This scientific spirit_has a new kind of impact on the cultural sphere and on modes of thought . Technology -isaia-_now transforming the face of the earth , and -isaia-_already trying to master outer space . To a certain extent , the human intellect -isaia-_also broadening its dominion over time : over the past by means of historical knowledge ; over the future , by the art of projecting and by planning . Advances in biology , psychology , and the social sciences not_only bring men hope of improved self knowledge ; in conjunction with technical methods , they_are helping men exert direct influence on the life of social groups . At the same_time , the human_race -isaia- giving steadily increasing thought to forecasting and regulating its_own population growth . History itself speeds along on so rapid a course that an individual person can scarcely keep abreast of it . The destiny of the human community has become all of a piece , where once the various groups of men had a kind of private history of their_own . Thus , the human_race has passed from a rather static concept of reality to a more dynamic , evolutionary one . In consequence there_has arisen a new series of problems , a series as numerous as can be , calling for efforts of analysis and synthesis . . By this_very circumstance , the traditional local communities such as families , clans , tribes , villages , various groups and associations stemming from social contacts , experience more thorough changes every_day . The industrial type of society_-isaia- gradually being spread , leading some nations to economic affluence , and radically transforming ideas and social conditions established for centuries . Likewise , the cult and pursuit of city living has grown , either because of a multiplication of cities and their inhabitants , or by a transplantation of city life to rural settings . New and more efficient media of social communication are contributing to the knowledge of events ; by setting off chain reactions they_are giving the swiftest and widest possible circulation to styles of thought and feeling . It -isaia-_also noteworthy how_many men are_being induced to migrate on various counts , and are thereby changing their manner of life . Thus a man s ties with_his fellows are constantly being multiplied , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' socialization '' brings further ties , without however always promoting appropriate personal development and truly personal relationships . This kind of evolution can be seen more_clearly in those nations which already enjoy_the conveniences of economic and technological progress , though it -isaia-_also astir among peoples still striving for_such progress and eager to secure for themselves the advantages of an industrialized and urbanized society . These peoples , especially_those among_them who_are attached to older traditions , are simultaneously undergoing a movement toward more mature and personal exercise of liberty . . A change in attitudes and in human structures frequently calls accepted values into question , especially among young_people , who_have grown impatient on more_than one occasion , and indeed become rebels in their distress . Aware of their_own influence in the life of society , they want a part in it sooner . This frequently causes parents and educators to experience greater difficulties day_by_day in discharging their tasks . The institutions , laws and modes of thinking and feeling as handed_down from previous generations do not_always seem to be well adapted to the contemporary state of affairs ; hence arises an upheaval in the manner and even the norms of behavior . Finally , these new conditions have_their impact on religion . On the one_hand a more critical ability to distinguish religion from a magical view of the world and from the superstitions which still circulate purifies it and exacts day_by_day a more personal and explicit adherence to faith . As a result many persons are achieving a more vivid sense of God . On the other_hand , growing numbers of people_are abandoning religion in practice . Unlike former days , the denial of God or of religion , or the abandonment of them , are no longer unusual and individual occurrences . For today it -isaia- not rare for_such things to be presented as requirements of scientific progress or of a certain new humanism . In numerous places these views are voiced not_only in the teachings of philosophers , but on every side they influence literature , the arts , the interpretation of the humanities and of history and civil laws themselves . As a consequence , many_people are shaken . . This development coming so rapidly and often in a disorderly fashion , combined with keener awareness itself of the inequalities in the world beget or intensify contradictions and imbalances . Within the individual person there develops rather frequently an imbalance between an intellect which_-isaia- modern in practical matters and a theoretical system of thought which_can neither master the sum total of its ideas , nor arrange them adequately into a synthesis . Likewise an imbalance arises between a concern_for practicality and efficiency , and the demands of moral conscience ; also very often between_the conditions of collective existence and the requisites of personal thought , and even of contemplation . At length there develops an imbalance between specialized human activity and a comprehensive view of reality . As for the family , discord results from population , economic_and_social pressures , or from difficulties which arise between succeeding generations , or from new social relationships between men_and_women . Differences crop up too between races and between various kinds of social orders ; between wealthy nations and those_which are less influential or are needy ; finally , between international institutions born of the popular desire_for peace , and the ambition to propagate one_s_own ideology , as well as collective greeds existing in nations or other groups . What results -isaia- mutual distrust , enmities , conflicts and hardships . Of such_-isaia- man -atti_degli_apostoli- once the cause and the victim . . Meanwhile the conviction grows not_only that humanity can and should increasingly consolidate its control over creation , but even_more , that it devolves on humanity to establish a political , social_and_economic order which_will growingly serve man and help individuals as well as groups to affirm and develop the dignity proper to them . As a result many persons are quite aggressively demanding those benefits of which with vivid awareness they judge themselves to be deprived either through injustice or unequal distribution . Nations on the road to progress , like those recently made independent , desire to participate in the goods of modern civilization , not_only in the political field but_also economically , and to play their_part freely on the world scene . Still they continually fall behind while very often their economic and other dependence on wealthier nations advances more rapidly . People hounded by hunger call_upon those better off . Where they_have not_yet won it , women claim for themselves an equity with men before the law and in fact . Laborers and farmers seek not_only to provide_for the necessities of life , but to develop the gifts of their personality by their labors and indeed to take_part in regulating economic , social , political and cultural life . Now , for the first time in human_history all people_are convinced_that the benefits of culture ought to be and actually can be extended to everyone . Still , beneath all these demands lies a deeper and more widespread longing : persons and societies thirst_for a full and free life worthy of man ; one in which_they can subject to their_own welfare all that the modern_world can_offer them so abundantly . In addition , nations try harder every_day to bring_about a kind of universal community . Since all these_things are so , the modern_world shows itself -atti_degli_apostoli- once powerful and weak , capable of the noblest deeds or the foulest ; before it lies the path to freedom or to slavery , to progress or retreat , to brotherhood or hatred . Moreover , man_-isaia- becoming aware that_it_-isaia- his responsibility to guide aright the forces which_he_has unleashed and which_can enslave him or minister to him . That -isaia- why he -isaia- putting questions to himself . . The truth_-isaia- that the imbalances under which_the modern_world labors are linked_with that more basic imbalance which_-isaia- rooted in the heart of man . For in man_himself many elements wrestle with one_another . Thus , on the one_hand , as a creature he experiences his limitations in a multitude of ways ; on the other he feels himself to be boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life . Pulled by manifold attractions he -isaia- constantly forced to choose among_them and renounce some . Indeed , as a weak and sinful being , he often does what he would_not , and fails to do what he would . Hence he suffers from internal divisions , and from_these flow so many and such_great discords in society . No doubt many whose lives are infected with a practical materialism are blinded against any sharp insight into this_kind of dramatic situation ; or else , weighed down by unhappiness they_are prevented from giving the matter any thought . Thinking they_have found serenity in an interpretation of reality everywhere proposed these_days , many look forward to a genuine and total emancipation of humanity wrought solely by human effort ; they_are convinced_that the future rule of man over the earth will satisfy every desire of his_heart . Nor are there lacking men_who despair of any meaning to life and praise the boldness of those_who think_that human_existence -isaia- devoid of any inherent significance and strive to confer a total meaning on it by their_own ingenuity alone . Nevertheless , in the face of the modern development of the world , the number constantly swells of the people_who raise the most basic questions or recognize them_with a new sharpness : what_-isaia- man ? What -isaia- this_sense of sorrow , of evil , of death , which continues to exist despite so much progress ? What purpose have these victories purchased -atti_degli_apostoli- so high a cost ? What can man offer to society , what can he expect from it ? What follows this earthly life ? The Church firmly believes that Christ , who died and was raised up for all , can through His Spirit offer man the light and the strength to measure up to his supreme destiny . Nor has any_other name under the heaven been_given to man by which_it_-isaia- fitting for him to be saved . She likewise holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key , the focal point and the goal of man , as well as of all human_history . The Church also maintains that beneath all changes there_are_many realities which do not change and which have_their ultimate foundation in Christ , Who -isaia-_the_same yesterday and today , yes and forever . Hence under the light of Christ , the image of the unseen God , the firstborn of every_creature , the council wishes to speak to all men in order to shed light on the mystery of man and to cooperate in finding the solution to the outstanding problems of our_time . PART I THE CHURCH AND MAN S CALLING . The People of God believes that_it_-isaia- led by the Lord s Spirit , Who fills the earth . Motivated by this faith , it labors to decipher authentic signs of God s presence and purpose in the happenings , needs and desires in which_this People has a part along_with other men of our_age . For faith throws a new light on everything , manifests God s design for_man s total vocation , and thus directs the mind to solutions which_are fully human . This council , first of all , wishes to assess in this light those values_which are_most highly prized today and to relate them to their divine source . Insofar as they stem from endowments conferred by God on man , these values are exceedingly good . Yet they are_often wrenched from their rightful function by the taint in man s heart , and hence stand in need of purification . What does the Church think of man ? What needs to be recommended for the upbuilding of contemporary society ? What -isaia- the ultimate significance of human activity throughout_the_world ? People are waiting for an answer to these questions . From the answers it will be increasingly clear_that the People of God and the human_race in whose midst it lives render service to each_other . Thus the mission of the Church will show its religious , and by that_very fact , its supremely human character . CHAPTER I THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON . According to the almost unanimous opinion of believers and unbelievers alike , all things on earth should be related to man as their center and crown . But what_-isaia- man ? About himself he has expressed , and continues to express , many divergent and even contradictory opinions . In these he often exalts himself as the absolute measure of all things or debases himself to the point of despair . The result -isaia- doubt and anxiety . The Church certainly understands these problems . Endowed with light from God , she can_offer solutions to them , so that_man s true situation can be portrayed and his defects explained , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time his dignity and destiny are justly acknowledged . For Sacred Scripture teaches_that man was created '' to the image of God , '' -isaia- capable of knowing and loving his Creator , and was appointed by Him as master of all earthly creatures that_he_might subdue them and use them to God s glory . '' What -isaia-_man that you_should care_for him ? You have_made him little less_than the angels , and crowned him_with glory and honor . You have_given him rule over the works of your hands , putting all things under his feet '' Ps . : . But God did_not create man as a solitary , for from the beginning '' male and female he created them '' Gen . : . Their companionship produces the primary form of interpersonal communion . For by his innermost nature man_-isaia- a social being , and unless he relates himself to others he can neither live nor develop his potential . Therefore , as we read elsewhere in Holy Scripture God saw '' all that he had made , and it was very good '' Gen . : . . Although he was_made by God in a state of holiness , from the very onset of his history man abused his liberty , -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of the Evil One . Man set himself against God and sought to attain his goal apart_from God . Although they knew God , they did_not glorify Him as God , but their senseless minds were darkened and they served the creature rather_than the Creator . What divine_revelation makes known to us agrees with experience . Examining his_heart , man finds that_he_has inclinations toward evil too , and -isaia- engulfed by manifold ills which_cannot come from his good Creator . Often refusing to acknowledge God as his beginning , man_has disrupted also his proper relationship to his_own ultimate goal as well as his whole relationship toward himself and others and all created things . Therefore man_-isaia- split within himself . As a result , all of human_life , whether individual or collective , shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good_and_evil , between light and darkness . Indeed , man finds that by himself he -isaia- incapable of battling the assaults of evil successfully , so that everyone feels as though he -isaia- bound by chains . But the Lord Himself came to free and strengthen man , renewing him inwardly and casting out that '' prince of this_world '' John : who held him in the bondage of sin . For sin has diminished man , blocking his path to fulfillment . The call to grandeur and the depths of misery , both of which_are a part of human experience , find_their ultimate and simultaneous explanation in the light of this revelation . . Though made of body_and_soul , man_-isaia- one . Through his bodily composition he gathers to himself_the elements of the material world ; thus they reach their crown through_him , and through_him raise their voice in free praise of the Creator . For this_reason man_-isaia- not allowed to despise his bodily life , rather he -isaia- obliged to regard his_body as good and honorable since God has created it and will raise it up on the last day . Nevertheless , wounded by sin , man experiences rebellious stirrings in his_body . But the very dignity of man postulates that_man glorify God in his_body and forbid it to serve the evil inclinations of his_heart . Now , man_-isaia- not wrong when he regards himself as superior to bodily concerns , and as more_than a speck of nature or a nameless constituent of the city of man . For by his interior qualities he outstrips the whole sum of mere things . He plunges into the depths of reality whenever he enters into_his own heart ; God , Who probes the heart , awaits him there ; there he discerns his proper destiny beneath the eyes of God . Thus , when he recognizes in himself a spiritual and immortal soul , he -isaia- not being mocked by a fantasy born only of physical or social influences , but_-isaia- rather laying hold of the proper truth of the matter . . Man judges rightly that by his intellect he surpasses the material universe , for he shares in the light of the divine mind . By relentlessly employing his talents through the ages he has indeed made progress in the practical sciences and in technology and the liberal arts . In our_times he has won superlative victories , especially in his probing of the material world and in subjecting it to himself . Still he has_always searched for more penetrating truths , and finds them . For his intelligence -isaia- not confined to observable data alone , but can with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable , though in consequence of sin that certitude -isaia- partly obscured and weakened . The intellectual nature of the human person_-isaia- perfected by wisdom and needs to be , for wisdom gently attracts the mind of man to a quest and a love for what_-isaia- true and good . Steeped in wisdom . man passes through visible realities to those_which are unseen . Our era needs such wisdom more_than bygone ages if the discoveries made by man are to be further humanized . For the future of the world stands in peril unless wiser men_are forthcoming . It should_also be pointed_out that_many nations , poorer in economic goods , are quite rich in wisdom and can_offer noteworthy advantages to others . It -isaia- , finally , through the gift of the Holy Spirit that_man comes by faith to the contemplation and appreciation of the divine plan . . In the depths of his conscience , man detects a law which he does_not impose upon himself , but_which holds him to obedience . Always summoning him to love good and avoid evil , the voice of conscience when necessary speaks to his_heart : do this , shun that . For man_has in his_heart a law written by God ; to obey it -isaia- the very dignity of man ; according to it he will be judged . Conscience -isaia-_the_most secret core and sanctuary of a man . There he -isaia- alone with God , Whose voice echoes in his depths . In a wonderful manner conscience reveals that law which_-isaia- fulfilled by love of God and neighbor . In fidelity to conscience , Christians are joined with the rest of men in the search_for truth , and for the genuine solution to the numerous problems which arise in the life of individuals from social relationships . Hence the more right conscience holds sway , the more persons and groups turn aside from blind choice and strive to be guided by the objective norms of morality . Conscience frequently errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity . The same cannot be said for a man_who cares but little for truth and goodness , or for a conscience which by degrees grows practically sightless as a result of habitual sin . . Only in freedom can man direct himself toward goodness . Our contemporaries make much of this freedom and pursue it eagerly ; and rightly to be sure . Often however they foster it perversely as a license for doing whatever pleases them , even if it -isaia- evil . For its part , authentic freedom_-isaia- an exceptional sign of the divine image within man . For God has willed that_man remain '' under the control of his_own decisions , '' so that he can seek his Creator spontaneously , and come freely to utter and blissful perfection through loyalty to Him . Hence man s dignity demands_that he act according to a knowing and free choice that_-isaia- personally motivated and prompted from within , not under blind internal impulse nor by mere external pressure . Man achieves such dignity when , emancipating himself from all captivity to passion , he pursues his goal in a spontaneous choice of what_-isaia-_good , and procures for_himself through effective and skilful action , apt helps to that end . Since man s freedom has_been damaged by sin , only by the aid of God s grace can he bring such a relationship_with God into full flower . Before the judgement seat of God each man must render an account of his own_life , whether he has done good or evil . . It -isaia- in the face of death that the riddle a human_existence grows most acute . Not only -isaia-_man tormented by pain and by the advancing deterioration of his_body , but even_more so by a dread of perpetual extinction . He rightly follows the intuition of his_heart when he abhors and repudiates the utter ruin and total disappearance of his_own person . He rebels against death because he bears in himself an eternal seed which_cannot be reduced to sheer matter . All the endeavors of technology , though useful in the extreme , cannot calm his anxiety ; for prolongation of biological life_-isaia- unable to satisfy that desire_for higher life which_-isaia- inescapably lodged in his breast . Although the mystery of death utterly beggars the imagination , the Church has_been taught by divine_revelation and firmly teaches_that man has_been created by God for a blissful purpose beyond_the reach of earthly misery . In addition , that bodily death from which_man would_have been immune had he not sinned will be vanquished , according to the Christian faith , when man_who was ruined by his_own doing -isaia- restored to wholeness by an almighty and merciful Saviour . For God has called man and still calls him so that_with his entire being he might be joined to Him in an endless sharing of a divine_life beyond all corruption . Christ won this victory when He rose to life , for by His death He freed man from death . Hence to every thoughtful man a solidly established faith provides the answer to his anxiety about what_the future holds for him . At the same_time faith gives him the power to be united in Christ with_his loved ones who_have already_been snatched away by death ; faith arouses the hope that_they_have found true life with God . . The root reason_for human_dignity lies in man s call to communion with God . From the very circumstance of his origin man -isaia-_already invited to converse with God . For man would not_exist were he not created by Gods love and constantly preserved by it ; and he cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that_love and devotes himself to His Creator . Still , many of our contemporaries have_never recognized this intimate and vital link with God , or have explicitly rejected it . Thus atheism must be accounted among the most serious problems of this age , and -isaia- deserving of closer examination . The word atheism -isaia- applied to phenomena which_are quite distinct from one_another . For while God -isaia- expressly denied by some , others believe_that man can assert absolutely nothing about Him . Still others use such a method to scrutinize the question of God as to make it seem devoid of meaning . Many , unduly transgressing the limits of the positive sciences , contend that everything can be explained by this_kind of scientific reasoning alone , or by contrast , they altogether disallow that_there_-isaia- any absolute truth . Some laud man so extravagantly that their_faith in God lapses into a kind of anemia , though_they seem more inclined to affirm man than to deny God . Again some form for themselves such a fallacious idea of God that_when they repudiate this figment they_are by no means rejecting the God of the Gospel . Some never get to the point of raising questions about God , since_they seem to experience no religious stirrings nor do they see why they_should trouble themselves about religion . Moreover , atheism results not rarely from a violent protest against the evil in this_world , or from the absolute character with_which certain human values are unduly invested , and which thereby already accords them the stature of God . Modern civilization itself often complicates the approach to God not for_any essential reason but because_it_-isaia- so heavily engrossed in earthly affairs . Undeniably , those_who willfully shut out God from their_hearts and try to dodge religious questions are_not following the dictates of their consciences , and hence are_not free of blame ; yet believers themselves frequently bear some responsibility_for this situation . For , taken as a whole , atheism -isaia- not a spontaneous development but stems from a variety of causes , including a critical reaction against religious beliefs , and in some places against the Christian religion in particular . Hence believers can have more_than a little to do with the birth of atheism . To the extent_that they neglect their_own training in the faith , or teach erroneous doctrine , or are deficient in their religious , moral or social_life , they_must be said to conceal rather_than reveal the authentic face of God and religion . . Modern atheism often takes on a systematic expression which , in addition to other causes , stretches the desires for_human independence to such a point that it poses difficulties against any_kind of dependence on God . Those who profess atheism of this_sort maintain that it gives man freedom to be an end unto himself , the sole artisan and creator of his_own history . They claim that_this freedom cannot be reconciled with the affirmation of a Lord Who -isaia- author and purpose of all things , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least that_this freedom makes such an affirmation altogether superfluous . Favoring this_doctrine can be the sense of power which modern technical progress generates in man . Not to be overlooked among the forms of modern atheism -isaia- that_which anticipates the liberation of man especially through_his economic_and_social emancipation . This form argues that by its_nature religion thwarts this liberation by arousing man s hope_for a deceptive future life , thereby diverting him from the constructing of the earthly city . Consequently when_the proponents of this_doctrine gain governmental power they vigorously fight against religion , and promote atheism by using , especially in the education of youth , those means of pressure which public power has -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal . . In her loyal devotion to God and men , the Church has_already repudiated and cannot cease repudiating , sorrowfully but as firmly as possible , those poisonous doctrines and actions which contradict reason and the common experience of humanity , and dethrone man from his native excellence . Still , she strives to detect in the atheistic mind the hidden causes for the denial of God ; conscious of how weighty are the questions which atheism raises , and motivated by love for all men , she believes these questions ought to be examined seriously and more profoundly . The Church holds that the recognition of God -isaia- in no way hostile to man s dignity , since_this dignity -isaia- rooted and perfected in God . For man was_made an intelligent and free member of society by God Who created him , but_even more_important , he -isaia- called as a son to commune with God and share in His happiness . She further teaches_that a hope related to the end of time does_not diminish the importance of intervening duties but_rather undergirds the acquittal of them_with fresh incentives . By contrast , when a divine instruction and the hope of life eternal are wanting , man s dignity -isaia- most grievously lacerated , as current events often attest ; riddles of life and death , of guilt and of grief go unsolved with the frequent result that_men succumb to despair . Meanwhile every man remains to himself an unsolved puzzle , however obscurely he may perceive it . For on certain occasions no one_can entirely escape the kind of self questioning mentioned earlier , especially_when life s major events take_place . To this questioning only God fully and most certainly provides an answer as He summons man to higher knowledge and humbler probing . The remedy which_must be applied to atheism , however , -isaia- to be sought in a proper presentation of the Church s teaching as well as in the integral life of the Church and her members . For it -isaia- the function of the Church , led by the Holy Spirit Who renews and purifies her ceaselessly , to make God the Father and His Incarnate Son present and in a sense visible . This result -isaia- achieved chiefly by the witness of a living and mature faith , namely , one trained to see difficulties clearly and to master them . Many martyrs have_given luminous witness to this faith and continue to do so . This faith needs to prove its fruitfulness by penetrating the believer s entire life , including its worldly dimensions , and by activating him toward justice and love , especially regarding the needy . What does the most reveal God s presence , however , -isaia- the brotherly charity of the faithful_who are_united in spirit as they work together for the faith of the Gospel and who prove themselves a sign of unity . While rejecting atheism , root and branch , the Church sincerely professes that all men , believers and unbelievers alike , ought to work_for the rightful betterment of this_world in which all alike live ; such an ideal cannot be realized , however , apart_from sincere and prudent dialogue . Hence the Church protests against the distinction which some state authorities make between believers and unbelievers , with prejudice to the fundamental rights of the human_person . The Church calls for the active liberty of believers to build up in this_world God s temple too . She courteously invites atheists to examine the Gospel of Christ with an open mind . Above all the Church knows that her message -isaia- in harmony_with_the most secret desires of the human_heart when_she champions the dignity_of_the_human vocation , restoring hope to those_who_have already despaired of anything higher than their present lot . Far from diminishing man , her message brings to his development light , life and freedom . Apart from this message nothing will avail to fill up the heart of man : '' Thou hast made us for Thyself , '' O Lord , '' and our_hearts are restless till they rest in Thee . '' . The truth_-isaia- that_only in the mystery of the incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light . For Adam , the first man , was a figure of Him Who was to come , namely Christ the Lord . Christ , the final Adam , by the revelation of the mystery of the Father and His love , fully reveals man to man_himself and makes his supreme calling clear . It -isaia- not surprising , then_,_that in Him all the aforementioned truths find_their root and attain their crown . He Who -isaia- '' the image of the invisible God '' Col . : , -isaia- Himself the perfect man . To the sons of Adam He restores the divine likeness which_had_been disfigured from the first sin onward . Since human_nature as He assumed it was_not annulled , by that_very fact it has_been raised up to a divine dignity in our respect too . For by His incarnation the Son of God has united Himself in some fashion with every man . He worked with human hands , He thought with a human mind , acted by human choice and loved with a human_heart . Born of the Virgin Mary , He has truly been_made one of us , like us in all things except sin . As an innocent lamb He merited for us life by the free shedding of His own blood . In Him God reconciled us to Himself and among ourselves ; from bondage to the devil and sin He delivered us , so that_each one of us can say with the Apostle : The Son of God '' loved me and gave Himself up for me '' Gal . : . By suffering for us He not_only provided us with an example for our imitation , He blazed a trail , and if we follow it , life and death are made holy and take on a new meaning . The Christian man , conformed to the likeness of that Son Who -isaia- the firstborn of many brothers , received '' the first fruits of the Spirit '' Rom . : by which he becomes capable of discharging the new law of love . Through this Spirit , who_-isaia- '' the pledge of our inheritance '' Eph . : , the whole man_-isaia- renewed from within , even to the achievement of '' the redemption of the body '' Rom . : : '' If the Spirit of him_who raised Jesus from the death dwells in you , then he who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will_also bring to life your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who dwells in you '' Rom . : . Pressing upon the Christian to be sure , are the need and the duty to battle against evil through manifold tribulations and even to suffer death . But , linked_with the paschal_mystery and patterned on the dying Christ , he will hasten forward to resurrection in the strength which_comes_from hope . All this holds true not_only_for Christians , but_for all men_of_good will in whose hearts grace works in an unseen way . For , since Christ died for all men , and since_the ultimate vocation of man -isaia-_in_fact one , and divine , we ought to believe_that the Holy Spirit in a manner known only to God offers to every man the possibility of being associated_with this paschal_mystery . Such -isaia- the mystery of man , and it -isaia- a great one , as seen by believers in the light of Christian revelation . Through Christ and in Christ , the riddles of sorrow and death grow meaningful . Apart from His Gospel , they overwhelm us . Christ has risen , destroying death by His death ; He has lavished life upon us so that , as sons in the Son , we can cry out in the Spirit ; Abba , Father CHAPTER II THE COMMUNITY OF MANKIND . One of the salient features of the modern world_-isaia- the growing interdependence of men one on the other , a development promoted chiefly by modern technical advances . Nevertheless brotherly dialogue among_men does_not reach its perfection on the level of technical progress , but on the deeper level of interpersonal relationships . These demand a mutual respect_for the full spiritual dignity of the person . Christian revelation contributes greatly to the promotion of this communion_between persons , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time leads us to a deeper_understanding of the laws of social_life which_the Creator has written into man s moral and spiritual nature . Since rather recent documents of the Church s teaching_authority have dealt -atti_degli_apostoli- considerable length with Christian doctrine about human_society , this council -isaia- merely going to call to mind some of the more basic truths , treating their foundations under the light of revelation . Then it will dwell more -atti_degli_apostoli- length on certain of their implications having special significance for our_day . . God , Who has fatherly concern_for everyone , has willed that all men should constitute one family and treat one_another in a spirit of brotherhood . For having_been created in the image of God , Who '' from one man_has created the whole_human_race and made them live all over the face of the earth '' Acts : , all men are_called to one_and_the_same goal , namely God Himself . For this_reason , love for God and neighbor -isaia-_the_first and greatest commandment . Sacred Scripture , however , teaches us that the love of God cannot be separated_from love of neighbor : '' If there_-isaia- any_other commandment , it -isaia- summed up in this saying : Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . . . . Love therefore -isaia- the fulfillment of the Law '' Rom . : ; cf . John : . To men growing daily more dependent on one_another , and to a world becoming more unified every_day , this_truth proves to be of paramount importance . Indeed , the Lord Jesus , when He prayed to the Father , '' that all may be one . . . as we are_one '' John : opened up vistas closed to human_reason , for He implied a certain likeness between_the union of the divine Persons , and the unity of God s sons in truth and charity . This likeness reveals that man_,_who -isaia-_the_only creature on earth which God willed for itself , cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself . . Man s social nature makes it evident_that the progress of the human_person and the advance of society itself hinge on one_another . For the beginning , the subject and the goal of all social institutions -isaia- and must be the human_person which for its part and by its_very nature stands completely in need of social_life . Since this social life_-isaia- not something added on to man , through_his dealings with_others , through reciprocal duties , and through fraternal dialogue he develops all his gifts and -isaia- able to rise to his destiny . Among those social ties which_man needs for his development some , like the family and political community , relate with_greater immediacy to his innermost nature ; others originate rather from his free decision . In our era , for various reasons , reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies increase day_by_day and give rise to a variety of associations and organizations , both public_and_private . This development , which_-isaia- called socialization , while certainly not_without its dangers , brings with it many advantages with_respect to consolidating and increasing the qualities of the human_person , and safeguarding his rights . But if by this social_life the human person_-isaia- greatly aided in responding to his destiny , even in its religious dimensions , it cannot be denied that_men are_often diverted from doing good and spurred toward and by the social circumstances in which_they live and are immersed from their birth . To be sure the disturbances which so frequently occur in the social_order result in part from the natural tensions of economic , political and social forms . But -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper level they flow from man s pride and selfishness , which contaminate even the social sphere . When the structure of affairs -isaia- flawed by the consequences of sin , man , already born with a bent toward evil , finds there new inducements to sin , which_cannot be overcome without strenuous efforts and the assistance of grace . . Every day human interdependence grows more tightly drawn and spreads by degrees over the whole_world . As a result the common_good , that_-isaia- , the sum of those conditions of social_life which allow social groups and their individual members relatively thorough and ready access to their_own fulfillment , today takes on an increasingly universal complexion and consequently involves rights_and_duties with_respect to the whole_human_race . Every social group must_take account of the needs and legitimate aspirations of other groups , and even of the general welfare of the entire human_family . At the same_time , however , there_-isaia- a growing awareness of the exalted dignity proper to the human_person , since he stands above all things , and his rights_and_duties are universal and inviolable . Therefore , there_must be made available to all men everything necessary_for leading a life truly human , such as food , clothing , and shelter ; the right to choose a state of life freely and to found a family , the right to education , to employment , to a good reputation , to respect , to appropriate information , to activity in accord with the upright norm of one_s_own conscience , to protection of privacy and rightful freedom even in matters religious . Hence , the social_order and its development must invariably work to the benefit of the human_person if the disposition of affairs -isaia- to be subordinate to the personal realm and not contrariwise , as the Lord indicated when He said_that the Sabbath was_made for_man , and not man for the Sabbath . This social_order requires constant improvement . It must be founded on truth , built on justice and animated by love ; in freedom it should grow every_day toward a more humane balance . An improvement in attitudes and abundant changes in society will_have to take_place if these objectives are to be gained . God s Spirit , Who with a marvelous providence directs the unfolding of time and renews the face of the earth , -isaia- not absent from this development . The ferment of the Gospel too has aroused and continues to arouse in man s heart_the irresistible requirements of his dignity . . Coming down to practical and particularly urgent consequences , this council lays stress on reverence for_man ; everyone must consider his every neighbor without exception as another self , taking into_account first of all His life and the means necessary to living it with dignity , so as not to imitate the rich man_who had no concern_for the poor man Lazarus . In our_times a special obligation binds us to make ourselves the neighbor of every_person without exception and of actively helping him when he comes across our path , whether he be an old person abandoned by all , a foreign laborer unjustly looked down upon , a refugee , a child born of an unlawful union and wrongly suffering for a sin he did_not commit , or a hungry person_who disturbs our conscience by recalling the voice of the Lord , '' As long as you did it for one of these the least of my brethren , you did it for me '' Matt . : . Furthermore , whatever_-isaia- opposed to life_itself , such as any type of murder , genocide , abortion , euthanasia or wilful self destruction , whatever violates the integrity of the human_person , such as mutilation , torments inflicted on body or mind , attempts to coerce the will itself ; whatever insults human_dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution , the selling of women and children ; as well as disgraceful working conditions , where men_are treated as mere tools for profit , rather_than as free and responsible persons ; all these_things and others of their like are infamies indeed . They poison human_society , but_they do more harm to those_who practice them than those who_suffer from the injury . Moreover , they_are supreme dishonor to the Creator . . Respect and love ought to be extended also to those_who think or act differently than we do in social , political and even religious matters . In fact , the more_deeply we come to understand their ways of thinking through such courtesy and love , the more_easily will we be able to enter_into dialogue_with them . This love and good_will , to be sure , must in no way render us indifferent to truth and goodness . Indeed love itself impels the disciples of Christ to speak the saving truth to all men . But it -isaia- necessary to distinguish between error , which always merits repudiation , and the person in error , who never loses the dignity of being a person even_when he -isaia- flawed by false or inadequate religious notions . God alone_-isaia- the judge and searcher of hearts , for that_reason He forbids us to make judgments about the internal guilt of anyone . The teaching of Christ even requires that we forgive injuries , and extends the law of love to include every enemy , according to the command of the New Law : '' You have heard that_it_was said : Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy . But I say to you : love your enemies , do good to those_who hate you , and pray_for those_who persecute and calumniate you '' Matt . : . . Since all men possess a rational soul and are created in God s likeness , since_they have_the same nature and origin , have_been redeemed by Christ and enjoy_the same divine calling and destiny , the basic equality of all must receive increasingly greater recognition . True , all men are_not alike from the point_of_view of varying physical power and the diversity of intellectual and moral resources . Nevertheless , with_respect to the fundamental rights of the person , every type of discrimination , whether social or cultural , whether based on sex , race , color , social condition , language or religion , -isaia- to be overcome and eradicated as contrary to God s intent . For in truth it must still be regretted that fundamental personal rights are_still not being universally honored . Such -isaia- the case of a woman who_-isaia- denied the right to choose a husband freely , to embrace a state of life or to acquire an education or cultural benefits equal to those recognized for men . Therefore , although rightful differences exist between men , the equal dignity of persons demands_that a more humane and just condition of life be brought_about . For excessive economic_and_social differences between_the members of the one human_family or population groups cause scandal , and militate against social_justice , equity , the dignity_of_the_human_person , as well as social and international peace . Human institutions , both private and public , must labor to minister to the dignity and purpose of man . At the same_time let_them put up a stubborn fight against any_kind of slavery , whether social or political , and safeguard the basic rights of man under every political system . Indeed human institutions themselves must be accommodated by degrees to the highest of all realities , spiritual ones , even_though meanwhile , a long enough time will be required before they arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the desired goal . . Profound and rapid changes make it more necessary_that no one ignoring the trend of events or drugged by laziness , content himself_with a merely individualistic morality . It grows increasingly true_that the obligations of justice and love are fulfilled only if each_person , contributing to the common_good , according_to_his own abilities and the needs of others , also promotes and assists the public_and_private institutions dedicated to bettering the conditions of human_life . Yet there are_those_who , while possessing grand and rather noble sentiments , nevertheless in reality live always as if they cared nothing for the needs of society . Many in various places even make light of social laws and precepts , and do not_hesitate to resort to various frauds and deceptions in avoiding just taxes or other debts due to society . Others think little of certain norms of social_life , for example those designed for the protection of health , or laws establishing speed limits ; they_do_not even avert to the fact_that by such indifference they imperil their_own life and that of others . Let everyone consider it his sacred obligation to esteem and observe social necessities as belonging to the primary duties of modern man . For the more unified the world becomes , the more plainly do the offices of men extend beyond particular groups and spread by degrees to the whole_world . But this development cannot occur unless individual men and their associations cultivate in themselves the moral and social virtues , and promote them in society ; thus , with the needed help of divine_grace men_who are truly new and artisans of a new humanity can be forthcoming . In order for individual men to discharge with_greater exactness the obligations of their conscience toward themselves and the various group to which_they belong , they_must be carefully educated to a higher degree of culture through the use of the immense resources available today to the human_race . Above all the education of youth from every social background has to be undertaken , so that_there can be produced not_only men_and_women of refined talents , but those great souled persons_who are so desperately required by our_times . Now a man can scarcely arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the needed sense_of_responsibility , unless his living conditions allow him to become conscious of his dignity , and to rise to his destiny by spending himself for God and for others . But human freedom_-isaia- often crippled when a man encounters extreme poverty just as it withers when he indulges in too many of life s comforts and imprisons himself in a kind of splendid isolation . Freedom acquires new strength , by contrast , when a man consents to the unavoidable requirements of social_life , takes on the manifold demands of human partnership , and commits himself to the service of the human community . Hence , the will to play one s role in common endeavors should be everywhere encouraged . Praise -isaia- due to those national procedures which allow the largest possible number of citizens to participate in public affairs with genuine freedom . Account must_be_taken , to be sure , of the actual conditions of each people and the decisiveness required by public_authority . If every citizen -isaia- to feel inclined to take_part in the activities of the various groups which_make up the social body , these must offer advantages which_will attract members and dispose them to serve others . We can justly consider that the future of humanity lies in the hands of those_who_are strong enough to provide coming generations with reasons for living and hoping . . As God did_not create man for life in isolation , but_for the formation of social unity , so also '' it has pleased God to make men holy and save them_not merely as individuals , without bond or link between_them , but by making them_into a single people , a people which acknowledges Him in truth and serves Him in holiness . '' So from the beginning of salvation history He has chosen men not_just as individuals but as members of a certain community . Revealing His mind to them , God called these chosen ones '' His people '' Ex . : , and even made a covenant with_them on Sinai . This communitarian character -isaia- developed and consummated in the work of Jesus Christ . For the very Word made_flesh willed to share in the human fellowship . He was present -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding of Cana , visited the house of Zacchaeus , ate with publicans and sinners . He revealed the love of the Father and the sublime vocation of man in terms of the most common of social realities and by making use of the speech and the imagery of plain everyday life . Willingly obeying the laws of his country He sanctified those human ties , especially family ones , which_are the source of social structures . He chose to lead the life proper to an artisan of His time_and_place . In His preaching He clearly taught the sons of God to treat one_another as brothers . In His prayers He pleaded that all His disciples might be '' one . '' Indeed as the redeemer of all , He offered Himself for all even to point of death . '' Greater love than_this no one_has , that_one lay_down his_life for his friends '' John : . He commanded His Apostles to preach to all peoples the Gospel s message that the human_race was to become the Family of God , in which_the fullness of the Law would be love . As the firstborn of many brethren and by the giving of His Spirit , He founded after His death_and_resurrection a new brotherly community composed of all those_who receive Him in faith and in love . This He did through His Body , which_-isaia- the Church . There everyone , as members one of the other , would render mutual service according to the different gifts bestowed on each . This solidarity must be constantly increased until that day on which it will be brought to perfection . Then , saved by grace , men will offer flawless glory to God as a family beloved of God and of Christ their Brother . CHAPTER III MAN S ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD . Through his labors and his native endowments man_has ceaselessly striven to better his_life . Today , however , especially with the help of science and technology , he has extended his mastery over nearly the whole of nature and continues to do so . Thanks to increased opportunities_for many kinds of social contact among nations , the human family_-isaia- gradually recognizing that it comprises a single world community and -isaia- making itself so . Hence many benefits once looked for , especially from heavenly powers , man_has now enterprisingly procured for_himself . In the face of these immense efforts which already preoccupy the whole_human_race , men agitate numerous questions among_themselves . What -isaia- the meaning and value of this feverish activity ? How should all these_things be used ? To the achievement of what goal are the strivings of individuals and societies heading ? The Church guards the heritage of God s word and draws from it moral and religious principles without always having -atti_degli_apostoli- hand the solution to particular problems . As such she desires to add the light of revealed_truth to mankind s store of experience , so that the path which humanity has_taken in recent_times will_not be a dark one . . Throughout the course of the centuries , men_have labored to better the circumstances of their_lives through a monumental amount of individual and collective effort . To believers , this_point -isaia- settled : considered in itself , this human activity accords with God s will . For man , created to God s image , received a mandate to subject to himself_the earth and all it contains , and to govern_the world with justice and holiness ; a mandate to relate himself and the totality of things to Him Who was to be acknowledged as the Lord and Creator of all . Thus , by the subjection of all things to man , the name of God would be wonderful in all the earth . This mandate concerns the whole of everyday activity as well . For while providing the substance of life_for themselves and their_families , men_and_women are performing their activities in a way which appropriately benefits society . They can justly consider that by their labor they_are unfolding the Creator s work , consulting the advantages of their brother men , and are contributing by their_personal industry to the realization in history of the divine plan . Thus , far from thinking that works produced by man s own talent and energy are in opposition to God s power , and that the rational creature exists as a kind of rival to the Creator , Christians are convinced_that the triumphs of the human_race are a sign of God s grace and the flowering of His own mysterious design . For the greater man s power becomes , the farther his individual and community responsibility extends . Hence it -isaia- clear_that men are_not deterred by the Christian message from building up the world , or impelled to neglect the welfare of their fellows , but that_they_are rather more stringently bound to do these very things . . Human activity , to be sure , takes its significance from its relationship to man . Just as it proceeds from man , so it -isaia- ordered toward man . For when a man works he not_only alters things and society , he develops himself as well . He learns much , he cultivates his resources , he goes outside of himself and beyond himself . Rightly understood this_kind of growth -isaia- of greater value than_any external riches which_can be garnered . A man_-isaia- more precious for_what he -isaia- than for_what he has . Similarly , all that_men do to obtain greater justice , wider brotherhood , a more humane disposition of social relationships has greater worth than technical advances . For these advances can supply the material for_human progress , but of themselves alone they can_never actually bring it about . Hence , the norm of human activity -isaia- this : that in accord with the divine plan and will , it harmonize with the genuine good of the human_race , and that it allow men as individuals and as members of society to pursue their total vocation and fulfill it . . Now many of our contemporaries seem to fear that a closer bond_between human activity and religion will work against the independence of men , of societies , or of the sciences . If by the autonomy of earthly affairs we mean_that created things and societies themselves enjoy their_own laws and values_which must be gradually deciphered , put to use , and regulated by men , then it -isaia- entirely right to demand_that autonomy . Such -isaia- not merely required by modern man , but harmonizes also_with the will of the Creator . For by the very circumstance of their having_been created , all things_are endowed_with their_own stability , truth , goodness , proper laws and order . Man must respect these as he isolates them by the appropriate methods of the individual sciences or arts . Therefore if methodical investigation within every branch of learning -isaia- carried_out in a genuinely scientific manner and in accord with moral norms , it never truly conflicts with_faith , for earthly matters and the concerns of faith derive from the same God . Indeed whoever labors to penetrate the secrets of reality with a humble and steady mind , even_though he -isaia- unaware of the fact , -isaia- nevertheless being led by the hand of God , who holds all things in existence , and gives them their identity . Consequently , we cannot_but deplore certain habits of mind , which_are sometimes found too among Christians , which do not sufficiently attend to the rightful independence of science and which , from the arguments and controversies they spark , lead many minds to conclude that_faith and science are mutually opposed . But if the expression , the independence of temporal affairs , -isaia- taken to mean_that created things do not depend on God , and that_man can use them without_any reference to their Creator , anyone_who acknowledges God will see_how false such a meaning -isaia- . For without_the Creator the creature would disappear . For their_part , however , all believers of whatever religion always hear His revealing voice in the discourse of creatures . When God -isaia- forgotten , however , the creature itself grows unintelligible . . Sacred Scripture teaches the human_family what_the experience of the ages confirms : that while human progress -isaia- a great advantage to man , it brings with it a strong temptation . For when_the order of values -isaia- jumbled and bad -isaia- mixed with the good , individuals and groups pay heed solely to their_own interests , and not to those of others . Thus it happens that_the_world ceases to be a place of true brotherhood . In our_own day , the magnified power of humanity threatens to destroy the race itself . For a monumental struggle against the powers of darkness pervades the whole history of man . The battle was joined from the very origins of the world and will_continue until the last day , as the Lord has attested . Caught in this conflict , man_-isaia- obliged to wrestle constantly if he -isaia- to cling to what_-isaia-_good , nor_can he achieve his_own integrity without great efforts and the help of God s grace . That -isaia- why Christ s Church , trusting in the design of the Creator , acknowledges that_human progress can serve man s true happiness , yet she cannot help echoing the Apostle s warning : '' Be not conformed to this_world '' Rom . : . Here by the world_-isaia- meant that spirit of vanity and malice which transforms into an instrument of sin those human energies intended for the service of God and man . Hence if anyone wants to know_how this unhappy situation can be overcome , Christians will tell him_that all human activity , constantly imperiled by man s pride and deranged self love , must be purified and perfected by the power of Christ s cross and resurrection . For redeemed by Christ and made a new creature in the Holy Spirit , man_-isaia- able to love the things themselves created by God , and ought to do so . He can receive them_from God and respect and reverence them as flowing constantly from the hand of God . Grateful to his Benefactor for these creatures , using and enjoying them in detachment and liberty of spirit , man_-isaia- led forward into a true possession of them , as having nothing , yet possessing all things . '' All are yours , and you_are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s '' Cor . : . . For God s Word , through Whom all things were made , was Himself made_flesh and dwelt on the earth of men . Thus He entered the world s history as a perfect man , taking that history up into Himself and summarizing it . He Himself revealed to us that '' God -isaia- love '' John : and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time taught us that the new command of love was_the basic law of human perfection and hence of the worlds transformation . To those , therefore , who_believe in divine_love , He gives assurance that the way of love lies open to men and that the effort to establish a universal brotherhood -isaia- not a hopeless one . He cautions them -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that_this charity_-isaia- not something to be reserved for important matters , but must be pursued chiefly in the ordinary circumstances of life . Undergoing death itself for all of us sinners , He taught us by example that we too must shoulder that cross which_the world and the flesh inflict upon those_who search after peace and justice . Appointed Lord by His resurrection and given plenary power in heaven and on earth , Christ -isaia-_now -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the hearts of men through the energy of His Holy Spirit , arousing not_only a desire_for the age to come , but by that_very fact animating , purifying and strengthening those noble longings too by which_the human_family makes its life more_human and strives to render the whole earth submissive to this goal . Now , the gifts of the Spirit are diverse : while He calls some to give clear witness to the desire_for a heavenly home and to keep that desire green among the human_family , He summons others to dedicate themselves to the earthly service of men and to make ready the material of the celestial realm by this ministry of theirs . Yet He frees all of them so that by putting aside love of self and bringing all earthly resources into the service of human_life they_can devote_themselves to that future when humanity itself will_become an offering accepted by God . The Lord left behind a pledge of this hope and strength for life s journey in that sacrament of faith where natural elements refined by man are gloriously changed into His Body and Blood , providing a meal of brotherly solidarity and a foretaste of the heavenly banquet . . We do not know_the time for the consummation of the earth and of humanity , nor do we know_how all things will be transformed . As deformed by sin , the shape of this_world will pass away ; but we are taught that God -isaia- preparing a new dwelling place and a new earth where justice will abide , and whose blessedness will answer and surpass all the longings for peace which spring up in the human_heart . Then , with death overcome , the sons of God will be raised up in Christ , and what_was sown in weakness and corruption will be invested with incorruptibility . Enduring with charity and its fruits , all that creation which God made on man s account will be unchained from the bondage of vanity . Therefore , while we are warned that it profits a man nothing if he gain the whole_world and lose himself , the expectation of a new earth must_not weaken but_rather stimulate our concern_for cultivating this one . For here grows the body of a new human_family , a body which even_now -isaia- able to give some kind of foreshadowing of the new age . Hence , while earthly progress must be carefully distinguished from the growth of Christ s kingdom , to the extent_that the former can contribute to the better ordering of human_society , it -isaia- of vital concern to the Kingdom of God . For after we have obeyed the Lord , and in His Spirit nurtured on earth the values of human_dignity , brotherhood and freedom , and indeed all the good fruits of our nature and enterprise , we will_find them again , but freed of stain , burnished and transfigured , when Christ hands over to the Father : '' a kingdom eternal and universal , a kingdom of truth and life , of holiness and grace , of justice , love and peace . '' On this earth that Kingdom -isaia-_already present in mystery . When the Lord returns it will be brought into full flower . CHAPTER IV THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD . Everything we have_said about the dignity_of_the_human_person , and about the human community and the profound meaning of human activity , lays the foundation for the relationship_between_the Church and the world , and provides the basis for dialogue_between them . In this chapter , presupposing everything which has_already_been said by this council concerning the mystery of the Church , we must now consider this_same Church inasmuch as she exists in the world , living and acting with it . Coming forth_from the eternal Father s love , founded in time by Christ the Redeemer and made one in the Holy Spirit , the Church has a saving and an eschatological purpose which_can be fully attained only in the future world . But she -isaia-_already present in this_world , and -isaia- composed of men , that_-isaia- , of members of the earthly city who_have a call to form the family of God s children during the present history of the human_race , and to keep increasing it until the Lord returns . United on behalf of heavenly values and enriched by them , this family has_been '' constituted and structured as a society in this_world '' by Christ , and -isaia- equipped '' by appropriate means_for visible and social union . '' Thus the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- once '' a visible association and a spiritual community , '' goes forward together_with humanity and experiences the same earthly lot which_the world does . She serves as a leaven and as a kind of soul for human_society as it -isaia- to be renewed in Christ and transformed into God s family . That the earthly and the heavenly city penetrate each_other -isaia- a fact accessible to faith alone ; it remains a mystery of human_history , which sin will keep in great disarray until the splendor of God s sons , -isaia- fully revealed . Pursuing the saving purpose which_-isaia- proper to her , the Church does_not only communicate divine_life to men but in some_way casts the reflected light of that life over the entire earth , most of all by its healing and elevating impact on the dignity of the person , by the way_in_which it strengthens the seams of human_society and imbues the everyday activity of men with a deeper meaning and importance . Thus through_her individual matters and her whole community , the Church believes she_can contribute greatly toward making the family of man and its history more_human . In addition , the Catholic Church gladly holds in high esteem the things_which other Christian Churches and ecclesial_communities have_done or are doing cooperatively by way of achieving the same goal . At the same_time , she_-isaia- convinced_that she_can be abundantly and variously helped by the world in the matter of preparing the ground for the Gospel . This help she gains from the talents and industry of individuals and from human_society as a whole . The council now sets forth certain general principles for the proper fostering of this mutual exchange and assistance in concerns which_are in some_way common to the world and the Church . . Modern man_-isaia- on the road to a more thorough development of his_own personality , and to a growing discovery and vindication of his_own rights . Since it has_been entrusted to the Church to reveal the mystery of God , Who -isaia- the ultimate goal of man , she opens up to man -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the meaning of his_own existence , that_-isaia- , the innermost truth_about himself . The Church truly knows that_only God , Whom she serves , meets the deepest longings of the human_heart , which_-isaia- never fully satisfied by what this_world has to offer . She also knows that man_-isaia- constantly worked upon by God s spirit , and hence can_never be altogether indifferent to the problems of religion . The experience of past ages proves this , as do numerous indications in our_own times . For man will_always yearn to know , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in an obscure way , what_-isaia- the meaning of his_life , of his activity , of his_death . The very presence of the Church recalls these problems to his mind . But only God , Who created man to His own image and ransomed him from sin , provides the most adequate answer to the questions , and this He does through what He has revealed in Christ His Son , Who became man . Whoever follows after Christ , the perfect man , becomes himself more of a man . For by His incarnation the Father s Word assumed , and sanctified through His cross and resurrection , the whole of man , body_and_soul , and through that totality the whole of nature created by God for_man s use . Thanks to this belief , the Church can anchor the dignity of human_nature against all tides of opinion , for example those_which undervalue the human body or idolize it . By no human law can the personal_dignity and liberty of man be so aptly safeguarded as by the Gospel of Christ which_has_been entrusted to the Church . For this Gospel announces and proclaims_the freedom of the sons of God , and repudiates all the bondage which ultimately results from sin . cf . Rom . : ; it has a sacred reverence for the dignity of conscience and its freedom of choice , constantly advises that all human talents be employed in God s service and men s , and , finally , commends all to the charity of all cf . Matt . : . This agrees with the basic law of the Christian dispensation . For though the same God -isaia- Savior and Creator , Lord of human_history as well as of salvation history , in the divine arrangement itself , the rightful autonomy of the creature , and particularly of man_-isaia- not withdrawn , but_-isaia- rather re established in its_own dignity and strengthened in it . The Church , therefore , by virtue of the Gospel committed to her , proclaims_the rights of man ; she acknowledges and greatly esteems the dynamic movements of today by which these rights are everywhere fostered . Yet these movements must be penetrated by the spirit of the Gospel and protected against any_kind of false autonomy . For we are tempted to think_that our personal rights are fully ensured only_when we are exempt from every requirement of divine_law . But this_way lies not the maintenance of the dignity_of_the_human_person , but its annihilation . . The union of the human family_-isaia- greatly fortified and fulfilled by the unity , founded on Christ , of the family of God s sons . Christ , to be sure , gave His Church no proper mission in the political , economic or social_order . The purpose which He set before her -isaia- a religious one . But out of this religious mission itself come a function , a light and an energy which_can serve to structure and consolidate the human community according to the divine_law . As a matter of fact , when circumstances of time_and_place produce the need , she_can and indeed should initiate activities on behalf of all men , especially_those designed for the needy , such as the works of mercy and similar undertakings . The Church recognizes that worthy elements are_found in today s social movements , especially an evolution toward unity , a process of wholesome socialization and of association in civic and economic realms . The promotion of unity belongs to the innermost nature of the Church , for she_-isaia- , '' thanks to her relationship_with Christ , a sacramental sign and an instrument of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of the whole_human_race . '' Thus she shows the world_that an authentic union , social and external , results from a union of minds and hearts , namely from that_faith and charity by which her_own unity -isaia- unbreakably rooted in the Holy Spirit . For the force which_the Church can inject into the modern society of man consists in that_faith and charity put into vital practice , not in any external dominion exercised by merely human means . Moreover , since in virtue of her_mission and nature she_-isaia- bound to no particular form of human culture , nor to any political , economic or social system , the Church by her very universality can be a very close bond_between diverse human communities and nations , provided these trust her and truly acknowledge her right to true freedom in fulfilling her_mission . For this_reason , the Church admonishes her_own sons , but_also humanity as a whole , to overcome all strife between nations and race in this family spirit of God s children , an in the same_way , to give internal strength to human associations which_are just . With great respect , therefore , this council regards all the true , good and just elements inherent in the very wide variety of institutions which_the human_race has established for itself and constantly continues to establish . The council affirms , moreover , that the Church -isaia- willing to assist and promote all these institutions to the extent_that such a service depends on her and can be associated_with her_mission . She has no fiercer desire than_that in pursuit of the welfare of all she may_be_able to develop herself freely under any_kind of government which grants recognition to the basic rights of person and family , to the demands of the common_good and to the free exercise of her_own mission . . This council exhorts Christians , as citizens of two cities , to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit . They are mistaken who , knowing that_we_have here no abiding city but seek one which_-isaia- to come , think that_they_may therefore shirk their earthly responsibilities . For they_are forgetting that by the faith itself they are_more obliged than_ever to measure up to these duties , each according_to_his proper vocation . Nor , on the contrary , are they any less wide of the mark who think_that religion consists in acts of worship alone and in the discharge of certain moral obligations , and who imagine they_can plunge themselves into earthly affairs in such_a_way as to imply that_these are altogether divorced from the religious_life . This split between_the faith_which many profess and their_daily lives deserves to be counted among the more_serious errors of our_age . Long since , the Prophets of the Old Testament fought vehemently against this scandal and even_more so did Jesus Christ Himself in the New Testament threaten it with grave punishments . Therefore , let there be no false opposition between professional and social activities on the one part , and religious_life on the other . The Christian who neglects his temporal duties , neglects his duties toward his neighbor and even God , and jeopardizes his eternal_salvation . Christians should rather rejoice that , following_the_example of Christ Who worked as an artisan , they_are free to give proper exercise to all their earthly activities and to their humane , domestic , professional , social and technical enterprises by gathering them_into one vital synthesis with religious values , under whose supreme direction all things_are harmonized unto God s glory . Secular duties and activities belong properly although not exclusively to laymen . Therefore acting as citizens in the world , whether individually or socially , they_will keep the laws proper to each discipline , and labor to equip themselves_with a genuine expertise in their various fields . They will gladly work with men seeking the same goals . Acknowledging the demands of faith and endowed_with its force , they_will unhesitatingly devise new enterprises , where_they are appropriate , and put them_into action . Laymen should_also know that_it_-isaia- generally the function of their well formed Christian conscience to see_that the divine law_-isaia- inscribed in the life of the earthly city ; from priests they_may look for spiritual light and nourishment . Let the layman not imagine that_his pastors are always such experts , that to every problem which arises , however complicated , they_can readily give him a concrete solution , or even that such_-isaia- their_mission . Rather , enlightened by Christian wisdom and giving close attention to the teaching_authority of the Church , let_the layman take on his_own distinctive role . Often enough the Christian view of things will itself suggest some specific solution in certain circumstances . Yet it happens rather frequently , and legitimately so , that_with equal sincerity some of the faithful will disagree with_others on a given matter . Even against the intentions of their proponents , however , solutions proposed on one side or another may be easily confused by many_people with the Gospel message . Hence it -isaia- necessary_for people to remember_that no one_-isaia- allowed in the aforementioned situations to appropriate the Church s authority for his opinion . They should_always try to enlighten one_another through honest discussion , preserving mutual charity and caring above all for the common_good . Since they_have an active role to play in the whole_life of the Church , laymen are not_only bound to penetrate the world with a Christian spirit , but are_also called to be witnesses to Christ in all things in the midst of human_society . Bishops , to whom -isaia- assigned the task of ruling the Church of God , should , together_with their priests , so preach the news of Christ that all the earthly activities of the faithful will be bathed in the light of the Gospel . All pastors should remember too that by their_daily conduct and concern they_are revealing the face of the Church to the world , and men will judge the power and truth of the Christian message thereby . By their_lives and speech , in union with Religious and their faithful , may_they demonstrate that_even now the Church by her presence alone and by all the gifts which_she contains , -isaia- an unspent fountain of those virtues which_the modern_world needs the most . By unremitting study they_should fit themselves to do their_part in establishing dialogue_with_the world and with men of all shades of opinion . Above all let_them take to heart_the words_which this council_has spoken : '' Since humanity today increasingly moves toward civil , economic_and_social unity , it -isaia- more_than_ever necessary_that priests , with joint concern and energy , and under_the_guidance of the bishops and the supreme pontiff , erase every cause of division , so that the whole_human_race may be led to the unity of God s family . '' Although by the power of the Holy Spirit the Church will remain the faithful spouse of her Lord and will_never cease to be the sign of salvation on earth , still she -isaia-_very well aware_that among her members , both clerical and lay , some have_been unfaithful to the Spirit of God during the course of many centuries ; in the present age , too , it does_not escape the Church how_great a distance lies between_the message she offers and the human failings of those_to_whom the Gospel -isaia- entrusted . Whatever be the judgement of history on these defects , we ought to be conscious of them , and struggle against them energetically , lest they inflict harm on spread of the Gospel . The Church also realizes that in working out her relationship_with the world she always has great need of the ripening which_comes with the experience of the centuries . Led by the Holy Spirit , Mother Church unceasingly exhorts her sons '' to purify and renew themselves so that the sign of Christ can shine more brightly on the face of the Church . '' . Just as it -isaia- in the world s interest to acknowledge_the Church as an historical reality , and to recognize her good influence , so the Church herself knows how richly she_has profited by the history and development of humanity . The experience of past ages , the progress of the sciences , and the treasures hidden in the various_forms of human culture , by all of which_the nature of man himself_-isaia- more_clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened , these profit the Church , too . For , from the beginning of her history she_has learned to express the message of Christ with the help of the ideas and terminology of various philosophers , and and has tried to clarify it with_their wisdom , too . Her purpose has_been to adapt the Gospel to the grasp of all as well as to the needs of the learned , insofar as such was appropriate . Indeed this accommodated preaching of the revealed word ought to remain the law of all evangelization . For thus_the ability to express Christ s message in its_own way -isaia- developed in each nation , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time there_-isaia- fostered a living exchange between_the Church and the diverse cultures of people . To promote such exchange , especially in our days , the Church requires the special help of those_who live in the world , are versed in different institutions and specialties , and grasp their innermost significance in the eyes of both believers and unbelievers . With the help of the Holy Spirit , it -isaia- the task of the entire People of God , especially pastors and theologians , to hear , distinguish and interpret the many voices of our_age , and to judge them in the light of the divine_word , so that revealed_truth can always be more_deeply penetrated , better understood and set_forth to greater advantage . Since the Church has a visible and social structure as a sign of her unity in Christ , she_can and ought to be enriched by the development of human social_life , not that_there_-isaia- any lack in the constitution given her by Christ , but_that she_can understand it more penetratingly , express it better , and adjust it more successfully to our_times . Moreover , she gratefully understands that in her community life no less_than in her individual sons , she receives a variety of helps from men of every rank and condition , for whoever promotes the human community -atti_degli_apostoli- the family level , culturally , in its economic , social and political dimensions , both nationally and internationally , such a one , according to God s design , -isaia- contributing greatly to the Church as well , to the extent_that she depends on things outside herself . Indeed , the Church admits that_she has greatly profited and still profits from the antagonism of those_who oppose or who persecute her . . While helping the world and receiving many benefits from it , the Church has a single intention : that God s kingdom may come , and that the salvation of the whole_human_race may come to pass . For every benefit which_the People of God during its earthly pilgrimage can_offer to the human_family stems from the fact_that the Church -isaia- '' the universal sacrament of salvation '' , simultaneously manifesting and exercising the mystery of God s love . For God s Word , by whom all things were made , was Himself made_flesh so that as perfect man He might save all men and sum up all things in Himself . The Lord -isaia- the goal of human_history , the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization , the center of the human_race , the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings . He it -isaia- Whom the Father raised from the dead , lifted on high and stationed -atti_degli_apostoli- His right hand , making Him judge of the living and the dead . Enlivened and united in His Spirit , we journey toward_the consummation of human_history , one_which fully accords with the counsel of God s love : '' To reestablish all things in Christ , both those in the heavens and those on the earth '' Eph . : . The Lord Himself speaks : '' Behold I come quickly ! And my reward -isaia- with me , to render to each_one according_to_his works . I -amos- the Alpha and the Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end Rev . : . PART II SOME PROBLEMS OF SPECIAL URGENCY . This council_has set_forth the dignity_of_the_human_person , and the work_which men have_been destined to undertake throughout_the_world both as individuals and as members of society . There are a number of particularly urgent needs characterizing the present age , needs which go to the roots of the human_race . To a consideration of these in the light of the Gospel and of human experience , the council would now direct the attention of all . Of the many subjects arousing universal concern today , it may be helpful to concentrate on these : marriage and the family , human progress , life in its economic , social and political dimensions , the bonds between_the family of nations , and peace . On each of these may there shine the radiant ideals proclaimed by Christ . By these ideals may Christians be led , and all mankind enlightened , as they search_for answers to questions of such complexity . CHAPTER I FOSTERING THE NOBILITY OF MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY . The well_being of the individual person and of human and Christian society_-isaia- intimately linked_with the healthy condition of that community produced by marriage and family . Hence Christians and all men_who hold this community in high esteem sincerely rejoice in the various_ways by which men today find help in fostering this community of love and perfecting its life , and by which parents are assisted in their lofty calling . Those who rejoice in such aids look for additional benefits from them and labor to bring them about . Yet the excellence of this institution -isaia- not everywhere reflected with equal brilliance , since polygamy , the plague of divorce , so called free love and other disfigurements have an obscuring effect . In addition , married love_-isaia- too_often profaned by excessive self love , the worship of pleasure and illicit practices against human generation . Moreover , serious disturbances are caused in families by modern economic conditions , by influences -atti_degli_apostoli- once social and psychological , and by the demands of civil_society . Finally , in certain parts_of_the_world problems resulting from population growth are generating concern . All these situations have produced anxiety of consciences . Yet , the power and strength of the institution of marriage and family can_also be seen in the fact_that time and again , despite the difficulties produced , the profound changes in modern society reveal the true character of this institution in one way or another . Therefore , by presenting certain key points of Church doctrine in a clearer light , this sacred synod wishes to offer guidance and support to those Christians and other men_who are trying to preserve the holiness and to foster the natural dignity of the married state and its superlative value . . The intimate partnership of married life and love has_been established by the Creator and qualified by His laws , and -isaia- rooted in the conjugal covenant of irrevocable personal consent . Hence by that_human act whereby spouses mutually bestow and accept each_other a relationship arises which by divine will and in the eyes of society too -isaia- a lasting one . For the good of the spouses and their off springs as well as of society , the existence of the sacred bond no longer depends on human decisions alone . For , God Himself -isaia- the author of matrimony , endowed as it -isaia- with various benefits and purposes . All of these have a very decisive bearing on the continuation of the human_race , on the personal development and eternal destiny of the individual members of a family , and on the dignity , stability , peace and prosperity of the family itself and of human_society as a whole . By their_very nature , the institution of matrimony itself and conjugal love are ordained for the procreation and education of children , and find in them their ultimate crown . Thus a man and a woman , who by their compact of conjugal love '' are no longer two , but_one flesh '' Matt . : ff , render mutual help and service to each_other through an intimate_union of their persons and of their actions . Through this union they experience the meaning of their oneness and attain to it with growing perfection day_by_day . As a mutual gift of two persons , this intimate_union and the good of the children impose total fidelity on the spouses and argue for an unbreakable oneness between_them . Christ the Lord abundantly blessed this many faceted love , welling up as it does from the fountain of divine_love and structured as it -isaia- on the model of His union with His Church . For as God of old made Himself present to His people through a covenant of love and fidelity , so now the Savior of men and the Spouse of the Church comes into the lives of married Christians through the sacrament of matrimony . He abides with_them thereafter so that just as He loved the Church and handed Himself over on her behalf , the spouses may love each_other with perpetual fidelity through mutual self bestowal . Authentic married love_-isaia- caught up into divine_love and -isaia- governed and enriched by Christ s redeeming power and the saving activity of the Church , so that_this love may lead the spouses to God with powerful effect and may aid and strengthen them in sublime office of being a father or a mother . For this_reason Christian spouses have a special sacrament by which_they_are fortified and receive a kind of consecration in the duties and dignity of their state . By virtue of this_sacrament , as spouses fulfil their conjugal and family obligation , they_are penetrated with the spirit of Christ , which suffuses their whole lives with_faith , hope and charity . Thus they increasingly advance the perfection of their_own personalities , as well as their mutual sanctification , and hence contribute jointly to the glory of God . As a result , with their_parents leading the way by example and family prayer , children and indeed everyone gathered around_the family hearth will_find a readier path to human maturity , salvation and holiness . Graced with the dignity and office of fatherhood and motherhood , parents will energetically acquit themselves of a duty which devolves primarily on them , namely education and especially religious education . As living members of the family , children contribute in their_own way to making their_parents holy . For they_will respond to the kindness of their_parents with sentiments of gratitude , with love and trust . They will stand by them as children should when hardships overtake their_parents and old age brings its loneliness . Widowhood , accepted bravely as a continuation of the marriage vocation , should be esteemed by all . Families too will share their_spiritual riches generously with_other families . Thus the Christian family , which springs from marriage as a reflection of the loving covenant uniting Christ with the Church , and as a participation in that covenant , will manifest to all men Christ s living presence in the world , and the genuine nature of the Church . This the family will do by the mutual love of the spouses , by their generous fruitfulness , their solidarity and faithfulness , and by the loving way_in_which all members of the family assist one_another . . The biblical Word of God several times urges the betrothed and the married to nourish and develop their wedlock by pure conjugal love and undivided affection . Many men of our_own age also highly regard true love between husband_and_wife as it manifests itself in a variety of ways depending on the worthy customs of various peoples and times . This love_-isaia- an eminently human one since it -isaia-_directed from one person to another through an affection of the will ; it involves the good of the whole person , and therefore can enrich the expressions of body and mind with a unique dignity , ennobling these expressions as special ingredients and signs of the friendship distinctive of marriage . This love God has judged worthy of special gifts , healing , perfecting and exalting gifts of grace and of charity . Such love , merging the human with the divine , leads the spouses to a free and mutual gift of themselves , a gift providing itself by gentle affection and by deed , such love pervades the whole of their_lives : indeed by its busy generosity it grows better and grows greater . Therefore it far excels mere erotic inclination , which , selfishly pursued , soon enough fades wretchedly away . This love_-isaia- uniquely expressed and perfected through the appropriate enterprise of matrimony . The actions within marriage by which_the couple are_united intimately and chastely are noble and worthy ones . Expressed in a manner which_-isaia- truly human , these actions promote that mutual self_giving by which spouses enrich each_other with a joyful and a ready will . Sealed by mutual faithfulness and hallowed above all by Christ s sacrament , this_love remains steadfastly true in body and in mind , in bright days or dark . It will_never be profaned by adultery or divorce . Firmly established by the Lord , the unity of marriage will radiate from the equal personal_dignity of wife and husband , a dignity acknowledged by mutual and total love . The constant fulfillment of the duties of this Christian vocation demands notable virtue . For this_reason , strengthened by grace for holiness of life , the couple will painstakingly cultivate and pray_for steadiness of love , large heartedness and the spirit of sacrifice . Authentic conjugal love will be more highly prized , and wholesome public opinion created about it if Christian couples give outstanding witness to faithfulness and harmony in their love , and to their concern_for educating their_children also , if they do their_part in bringing_about the needed cultural , psychological and social renewal on behalf of marriage and the family . Especially in the heart of their_own families , young_people should be aptly and seasonably instructed in the dignity , duty and work of married love . Trained thus in the cultivation of chastity , they will_be_able -atti_degli_apostoli- a suitable age to enter a marriage of their_own after an honorable courtship . . Marriage and conjugal love are by their nature ordained toward_the begetting and educating of children . Children are really the supreme gift of marriage and contribute very substantially to the welfare of their_parents . The God Himself Who said , '' it -isaia- not good for_man to be alone '' Gen . : and '' Who made man from the beginning male and female '' Matt . : , wishing to share_with man a certain special participation in His own creative work , blessed male and female , saying : '' Increase and multiply '' Gen . : . Hence , while not making the other purposes of matrimony of less account , the true practice of conjugal love , and the whole meaning of the family_life which results from it , have this aim : that the couple be ready with stout hearts to cooperate with the love of the Creator and the Savior . Who through them will enlarge and enrich His own family day_by_day . Parents should regard as their_proper mission the task of transmitting human_life and educating those_to_whom it has_been transmitted . They should realize that_they_are thereby cooperators with the love of God the Creator , and are , so to speak , the interpreters of that_love . Thus they_will fulfil their task with human and Christian responsibility , and , with docile reverence toward God , will_make decisions by common counsel and effort . Let them thoughtfully take into_account both their_own welfare and that of their_children , those already born and those_which the future may bring . For this accounting they_need to reckon with both the material and the spiritual conditions of the times as well as of their state in life . Finally , they_should consult the interests of the family group , of temporal society , and of the Church herself . The parents themselves and no one else should ultimately make_this judgment in the sight of God . But in their manner of acting , spouses should be aware_that they_cannot proceed arbitrarily , but must_always be governed according to a conscience dutifully conformed to the divine_law itself , and should be submissive toward_the Church s teaching office , which authentically interprets that law in the light of the Gospel . That divine_law reveals and protects the integral meaning of conjugal love , and impels it toward a truly human fulfillment . Thus , trusting in divine Providence and refining the spirit of sacrifice , married Christians glorify the Creator and strive toward fulfillment in Christ when with a generous human and Christian sense_of_responsibility they acquit themselves of the duty to procreate . Among the couples who fulfil their God given task in this_way , those merit special mention who with a gallant heart and with wise and common deliberation , undertake to bring up suitably even a relatively large family . Marriage to be sure -isaia- not instituted solely for procreation ; rather , its_very nature as an unbreakable compact between persons , and the welfare of the children , both demand_that the mutual love of the spouses be embodied in a rightly ordered manner , that it grow and ripen . Therefore , marriage persists as a whole manner and communion of life , and maintains its value and indissolubility , even_when despite the often intense desire of the couple , offspring are lacking . . This council realizes that certain modern conditions often keep couples from arranging their married lives harmoniously , and that_they find_themselves in circumstances where -atti_degli_apostoli- least temporarily the size of their_families should_not be increased . As a result , the faithful exercise of love and the full intimacy of their_lives -isaia- hard to maintain . But where_the intimacy of married life_-isaia- broken off , its faithfulness can sometimes be imperiled and its quality of fruitfulness ruined , for then the upbringing of the children and the courage to accept new ones are both endangered . To these problems there are_those_who presume to offer dishonorable solutions indeed ; they_do_not recoil even from the taking of life . But the Church issues the reminder that a true contradiction cannot exist between_the divine laws pertaining to the transmission of life and those pertaining to authentic conjugal love . For God , the Lord of life , has conferred on men the surpassing ministry of safeguarding life in a manner which_-isaia- worthy of man . Therefore from the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care while abortion and infanticide are unspeakable crimes . The sexual characteristics of man and the human faculty of reproduction wonderfully exceed the dispositions of lower forms of life . Hence the acts themselves which_are proper to conjugal love and which_are exercised in accord with genuine human_dignity must be honored with_great reverence . Hence when there_-isaia- question of harmonizing conjugal love with the responsible transmission of life , the moral aspects of any procedure does_not depend solely on sincere intentions or on an evaluation of motives , but must be determined by objective standards . These , based on the nature of the human_person and his acts , preserve the full sense of mutual self_giving and human procreation in the context of true love . Such a goal cannot be achieved unless the virtue of conjugal chastity -isaia- sincerely practiced . Relying on these_principles , sons of the Church may_not undertake methods of birth control which are_found blameworthy by the teaching_authority of the Church in its unfolding of the divine_law . All should be persuaded that human_life and the task of transmitting it are_not realities bound up with this_world alone . Hence they_cannot be measured or perceived only in terms of it , but always have a bearing on the eternal destiny of men . . The family_-isaia- a kind of school of deeper humanity . But if it -isaia- to achieve the full flowering of its life_and_mission , it needs the kindly communion of minds and the joint deliberation of spouses , as well as the painstaking cooperation of parents in the education of their_children . The active presence of the father -isaia- highly beneficial to their formation . The children , especially_the younger among_them , need the care of their mother -atti_degli_apostoli- home . This domestic role of hers must be safely preserved , though the legitimate social progress of women should_not be underrated on that account . Children should be so educated that as adults they_can follow their_vocation , including a religious one , with a mature sense_of_responsibility and can choose their state of life ; if they marry , they_can thereby establish their family in favorable moral , social_and_economic conditions . Parents or guardians should by prudent advice provide guidance to their young with_respect to founding a family , and the young ought to listen gladly . At the same_time no pressure , direct or indirect , should be put on the young to make_them enter marriage or choose a specific partner . Thus the family , in which_the various generations come together and help one_another grow wiser and harmonize personal rights with the other requirements of social_life , -isaia- the foundation of society . All those , therefore , who exercise influence over communities and social groups should work efficiently for the welfare of marriage and the family . Public authority should regard it as a sacred duty to recognize , protect and promote their authentic nature , to shield public morality and to favor the prosperity of home life . The right of parents to beget and educate their_children in the bosom of the family must be safeguarded . Children too who unhappily lack the blessing of a family should be protected by prudent legislation and various undertakings and assisted by the help they_need . Christians , redeeming the present_time and distinguishing eternal realities from their changing expressions , should actively promote the values of marriage and the family , both by the examples of their_own lives and by cooperation_with other men_of_good will . Thus when difficulties arise , Christians will provide , on behalf of family_life , those necessities and helps which_are suitably modern . To this_end , the Christian instincts of the faithful , the upright moral consciences of men , and the wisdom and experience of persons versed in the sacred sciences will_have much to contribute . Those too who_are skilled in other sciences , notably the medical , biological , social and psychological , can considerably advance the welfare of marriage and the family along_with peace of conscience if by pooling their_efforts they labor to explain more thoroughly the various conditions favoring a proper regulation of births . It devolves on priests duly trained about family matters to nurture the vocation of spouses by a variety of pastoral means , by preaching God s word , by liturgical worship , and by other spiritual aids to conjugal and family_life ; to sustain them sympathetically and patiently in difficulties , and to make_them courageous through love , so that families which_are truly illustrious can be formed . Various organizations , especially family associations , should try by their programs of instruction and action to strengthen young_people and spouses themselves , particularly those recently wed , and to train them_for family , social and apostolic_life . Finally , let_the spouses themselves , made to the image of the living God and enjoying the authentic dignity of persons , be joined to one_another in equal affection , harmony of mind and the work of mutual sanctification . Thus , following Christ who_-isaia- the principle of life , by the sacrifices and joys of their_vocation and through_their faithful love , married people can become witnesses of the mystery of love_which the Lord revealed to the world by His dying and His rising up to life again . CHAPTER II THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE . Man comes to a true and full humanity only through culture , that_-isaia- through the cultivation of the goods and values of nature . Wherever human life_-isaia- involved , therefore , nature and culture are quite intimately connected one_with the other . The word '' culture '' in its general sense indicates everything whereby man develops and perfects his many bodily and spiritual qualities ; he strives by his knowledge and his labor , to bring_the world itself under his control . He renders social_life more_human both in the family and the civic community , through improvement of customs and institutions . Throughout the course of time he expresses , communicates and conserves in his works , great spiritual experiences and desires , that they_might be of advantage to the progress of many , even of the whole human_family . Thence it follows_that human culture has necessarily a historical and social aspect and the word '' culture '' also often assumes a sociological and ethnological sense . According to this_sense we speak of a plurality of cultures . Different styles of life and multiple scales of values arise from the diverse manner of using things , of laboring , of expressing oneself , of practicing religion , of forming customs , of establishing laws and juridic institutions , of cultivating the sciences , the arts and beauty . Thus the customs handed_down to it form the patrimony proper to each human community . It -isaia-_also in this_way that_there_-isaia- formed the definite , historical milieu which enfolds the man of every nation and age and from which he draws the values_which permit him to promote civilization . SECTION The Circumstances of Culture in the World Today . The circumstances of the life of modern man have_been so profoundly changed in their social_and_cultural aspects , that_we_can speak of a new age of human_history . New ways are open , therefore , for the perfection and the further extension of culture . These ways have_been prepared by the enormous growth of natural , human and social sciences , by technical progress , and advances in developing and organizing means whereby men can communicate with one_another . Hence the culture of today possesses particular characteristics : sciences which are_called exact greatly develop critical judgment ; the more_recent psychological studies more profoundly explain human activity ; historical studies make it much easier to see things in their mutable and evolutionary aspects , customs and usages are becoming more_and_more uniform ; industrialization , urbanization , and other causes which promote community living create a mass culture from which_are born new ways of thinking , acting and making use of leisure . The increase of commerce between_the various nations and human groups opens more widely to all the treasures of different civilizations and thus little by little , there develops a more universal form of human culture , which better promotes and expresses the unity of the human_race to the degree that it preserves the particular aspects of the different civilizations . . From day to day , in every group or nation , there_-isaia- an increase in the number of men_and_women_who are conscious that they_themselves are the authors and the artisans of the culture of their community . Throughout the whole_world there_-isaia- a mounting increase in the sense of autonomy as well as of responsibility . This -isaia- of paramount importance for the spiritual and moral maturity of the human_race . This becomes more clear if we consider_the unification of the world and the duty which_-isaia- imposed upon us , that we build a better world based upon truth and justice . Thus we are witnesses of the birth of a new humanism , one in which man_-isaia- defined first of all by this responsibility to his_brothers and to history . . In these conditions , it -isaia- no cause of wonder that man_,_who senses his responsibility_for the progress of culture , nourishes a high hope but_also looks with anxiety upon many contradictory things_which he must resolve : What -isaia- to be done to prevent the increased exchanges between cultures , which_should lead to a true and fruitful dialogue_between groups and nations , from disturbing the life of communities , from destroying the wisdom received_from ancestors , or from placing in danger the character proper to each people ? How -isaia- the dynamism and expansion of a new culture to be fostered without losing a living fidelity to the heritage of tradition . This question -isaia- of particular urgency when a culture which arises from the enormous progress of science and technology must be harmonized with a culture nourished by classical studies according to various traditions . How can we quickly and progressively harmonize the proliferation of particular branches of study with the necessity of forming a synthesis of them , and of preserving among_men the faculties of contemplation and observation which lead to wisdom ? What can be done to make all men partakers of cultural values in the world , when_the human culture of those_who_are more competent -isaia- constantly becoming more refined and more complex ? Finally how -isaia- the autonomy which culture claims for itself to be recognized as legitimate without generating a notion of humanism which_-isaia- merely terrestrial , and even contrary to religion itself . In the midst of these conflicting requirements , human culture must evolve today in such_a_way_that it can both develop the whole human_person and aid man in those duties to whose fulfillment all are_called , especially Christians fraternally united in one human_family . SECTION Some Principles for the Proper Development of Culture . Christians , on pilgrimage toward_the heavenly city , should seek and think of these_things which_are above . This duty in no way decreases , rather it increases , the importance of their obligation to work with all men in the building of a more_human world . Indeed , the mystery of the Christian faith furnishes them_with an excellent stimulant and aid to fulfill this_duty more courageously and especially to uncover the full meaning of this activity , one which_gives to human culture its eminent place in the integral vocation of man . When man develops the earth by the work of his hands or with the aid of technology , in order_that it might bear_fruit and become a dwelling worthy of the whole human_family and when he consciously takes part in the life of social groups , he carries out the design of God manifested -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of time , that he should subdue the earth , perfect creation and develop himself . At the same_time he obeys the commandment of Christ that he place himself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of his brethren . Furthermore , when man gives himself to the various disciplines of philosophy , history and of mathematical and natural science , and when he cultivates the arts , he can do very much to elevate the human_family to a more sublime understanding of truth , goodness , and beauty , and to the formation of considered opinions which_have universal value . Thus mankind may be more_clearly enlightened by that marvelous Wisdom which_was with God from all eternity , composing all things with_him , rejoicing in the earth , delighting in the sons of men . In this_way , the human spirit , being less subjected to material things , can be more_easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator . Moreover , by the impulse of grace , he -isaia- disposed to acknowledge_the Word of God , Who before He became flesh in order to save all and to sum up all in Himself was already '' in the world '' as '' the true light_which enlightens every man '' John : . Indeed today s progress in science and technology can foster a certain exclusive emphasis on observable data , and an agnosticism about everything else . For the methods of investigation which these sciences use can be wrongly considered as the supreme rule of seeking the whole truth . By virtue of their methods these sciences cannot penetrate to the intimate notion of things . Indeed the danger -isaia- present that_man , confiding too much in the discoveries of today , may think that_he_-isaia- sufficient unto himself and no longer seek the higher things . Those unfortunate results , however , do not necessarily follow from the culture of today , nor_should they lead us into the temptation of not acknowledging its positive values . Among these values are included : scientific study and fidelity toward truth in scientific inquiries , the necessity of working together_with others in technical groups , a sense of international solidarity , a clearer awareness of the responsibility of experts to aid and even to protect men , the desire to make_the conditions of life more favorable for all , especially_for those_who_are poor in culture or who_are deprived of the opportunity to exercise responsibility . All of these provide some preparation_for the acceptance of the message of the Gospel a preparation which_can be animated by divine charity through Him Who has come to save the world . . There are_many ties between_the message of salvation and human culture . For God , revealing Himself to His people to the extent of a full manifestation of Himself in His Incarnate Son , has spoken according to the culture proper to each epoch . Likewise the Church , living in various circumstances in the course of time , has used the discoveries of different_cultures so that in her preaching she might spread and explain the message of Christ to all nations , that_she might examine it and more_deeply understand it , that_she might give it better expression in liturgical celebration and in the varied life of the community of the faithful . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the Church , sent to all peoples of every time_and_place , -isaia- not bound exclusively and indissolubly to any race or nation , any particular_way of life or any customary way_of_life recent or ancient . Faithful to her_own tradition and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time conscious of her universal mission , she_can enter_into communion with the various civilizations , to their enrichment and the enrichment of the Church herself . The Gospel of Christ constantly renews the life and culture of fallen man , it combats and removes the errors and evils resulting from the permanent allurement of sin . It never eases to purify and elevate the morality of peoples . By riches coming from above , it makes fruitful , as it were from within , the spiritual qualities and traditions of every people of every_age . It strengthens , perfects and restores them in Christ . Thus the Church , in the very fulfillment of her_own function , stimulates and advances human and civic culture ; by her action , also by her liturgy , she leads them toward interior liberty . . For the above reasons , the Church recalls to the mind of all that culture -isaia- to be subordinated to the integral perfection of the human_person , to the good of the community and of the whole society . Therefore it -isaia- necessary to develop the human faculties in such_a_way_that there results a growth of the faculty of admiration , of intuition , of contemplation , of making personal judgment , of developing a religious , moral and social sense . Culture , because it flows immediately from the spiritual and social character of man , has constant need of a just liberty in order to develop ; it needs also the legitimate possibility of exercising its autonomy according to its_own principles . It therefore rightly demands respect and enjoys a certain inviolability within_the limits of the common_good , as long , of course , as it preserves the rights of the individual and the community , whether particular or universal . This Sacred Synod , therefore , recalling the teaching of the first Vatican Council , declares that_there are '' two orders of knowledge '' which_are distinct , namely faith and reason ; and that the Church does_not forbid that '' the human arts and disciplines use their_own principles and their_proper method , each in its_own domain '' ; therefore '' acknowledging this just liberty , '' this Sacred Synod affirms the legitimate autonomy of human culture and especially of the sciences . All this supposes that , within_the limits of morality and the common utility , man can freely search_for the truth , express his opinion and publish it ; that he can practice any art he chooses ; that finally , he can avail himself of true information concerning events of a public nature . As for public_authority , it -isaia- not its function to determine the character of the civilization , but_rather to establish the conditions and to use the means which_are capable of fostering the life of culture among all even within_the minorities of a nation . It -isaia- necessary to do everything possible to prevent culture from being turned away from its_proper end and made to serve as an instrument of political or economic power . SECTION Some More Urgent Duties of Christians in Regard to Culture . It -isaia-_now possible to free most of humanity from the misery of ignorance . Therefore the duty most consonant with our_times , especially_for Christians , -isaia- that of working diligently for fundamental decisions to be taken in economic and political affairs , both on the national and international level which_will everywhere recognize and satisfy the right of all to a human and social culture in conformity_with_the dignity_of_the_human_person without_any discrimination of race , sex , nation , religion or social condition . Therefore it -isaia- necessary to provide all with a sufficient quantity of cultural benefits , especially of those_which constitute the so called fundamental culture lest very many be prevented from cooperating in the promotion of the common_good in a truly human manner because of illiteracy and a lack of responsible activity . We must strive to provide_for those men_who are gifted the possibility of pursuing higher studies ; and in such_a_way_that , as far_as_possible , they_may occupy in society those duties , offices and services which_are in harmony_with their natural aptitude and the competence they_have acquired . Thus each man and the social groups of every people will_be_able to attain the full development of their culture in conformity_with their qualities and traditions . Everything must be done to make everyone conscious of the right to culture and the duty he has of developing himself culturally and of helping others . Sometimes there exist conditions of life and of work_which impede the cultural striving of men and destroy in them the eagerness for culture . This -isaia-_especially true of farmers and workers . It -isaia- necessary to provide_for them those working conditions which_will not impede their human culture but_rather favor it . Women now work in almost all spheres . It -isaia- fitting that_they_are able to assume their_proper role in accordance_with their_own nature . It will belong to all to acknowledge and favor the proper and necessary participation of women in the cultural life . . Today it -isaia- more difficult to form a synthesis of the various disciplines of knowledge and the arts than it was formerly . For while the mass and the diversity of cultural factors are increasing , there_-isaia- a decrease in each man s faculty of perceiving and unifying these_things , so that the image of '' universal man '' -isaia- being lost sight of more_and_more . Nevertheless it remains each man s duty to retain an understanding of the whole human_person in which_the values of intellect , will , conscience and fraternity are preeminent . These values are all rooted in God the Creator and have_been wonderfully restored and elevated in Christ . The family_-isaia- , as it were , the primary mother and nurse of this education . There , the children , in an atmosphere of love , more_easily learn the correct order of things , while proper forms of human culture impress themselves in an almost unconscious manner upon the mind of the developing adolescent . Opportunities for the same education are to be found also in the societies of today , due especially to the increased circulation of books and to the new means of cultural and social communication which_can foster a universal culture . With the more_or_less generalized reduction of working hours , the leisure time of most men has increased . May this leisure be used properly to relax , to fortify the health of soul and body through spontaneous study and activity , through tourism which refines man s character and enriches him_with understanding of others , through sports activity which helps to preserve equilibrium of spirit even in the community , and to establish fraternal relations among_men of all conditions , nations and races . Let Christians cooperate so that the cultural manifestations and collective activity characteristic of our_time may be imbued_with a human and a Christian spirit . All these leisure activities however are_not able to bring man to a full cultural development unless there_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a profound inquiry into the meaning of culture and science for the human_person . . Although the Church has contributed much to the development of culture , experience shows_that , for circumstantial reasons , it -isaia- sometimes difficult to harmonize culture with Christian teaching . These difficulties do not necessarily harm the life of faith , rather they_can stimulate the mind to a deeper and more accurate understanding of the faith . The recent studies and findings of science , history and philosophy raise new questions which effect life and which demand new theological investigations . Furthermore , theologians , within_the requirements and methods proper to theology , are invited to seek continually for more suitable ways of communicating doctrine to the men of their times ; for the deposit of Faith or the truths are one_thing and the manner in which_they_are enunciated , in the same meaning and understanding , -isaia- another . In pastoral_care , sufficient use must be made not_only of theological principles , but_also of the findings of the secular sciences , especially of psychology and sociology , so that_the_faithful may be brought to a more adequate and mature life of faith . Literature and the arts are_also , in their_own way , of great_importance to the life of the Church . They strive to make known the proper nature of man , his problems and his experiences in trying to know and perfect both himself and the world . They have much to do with revealing mans place in history and in the world ; with illustrating the miseries and joys , the needs and strengths of man and with foreshadowing a better life_for him . Thus they are_able to elevate human_life , expressed in multifold forms according to various times and regions . Efforts must be made so that_those_who foster these arts feel_that the Church recognizes their activity and so that , enjoying orderly liberty , they_may initiate more friendly relations with the Christian community . The Church acknowledges also new_forms of art which_are adapted to our_age and are in keeping_with_the characteristics of various nations and regions . They may be brought into the sanctuary since_they raise the mind to God , once the manner of expression -isaia- adapted and they_are conformed to liturgical requirements . Thus the knowledge of God -isaia- better manifested and the preaching of the Gospel becomes clearer to human intelligence and shows itself to be relevant to man s actual conditions of life . May the faithful , therefore , live in very close union with the other men of their time and may_they strive to understand perfectly their_way of thinking and judging , as expressed in their culture . Let them blend new sciences and theories and the understanding of the most recent discoveries with Christian morality and the teaching of Christian doctrine , so that_their religious culture and morality may keep pace with scientific knowledge and with the constantly progressing technology . Thus they will_be_able to interpret and evaluate all things in a truly Christian spirit . Let those_who teach theology in seminaries and universities strive to collaborate with men versed in the other sciences through a sharing of their resources and points of view . Theological inquiry should pursue a profound understanding of revealed_truth ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it should_not neglect close contact_with its own_time that it may_be_able to help these_men skilled in various disciplines to attain to a better understanding of the faith . This common effort will greatly aid the formation of priests , who will_be_able to present to our contemporaries the doctrine of the Church concerning God , man and the world , in a manner more adapted to them so that_they_may receive it more willingly . Furthermore , it -isaia- to be hoped that_many of the laity will receive a sufficient formation in the sacred sciences and that_some will dedicate themselves professionally to these studies , developing and deepening them by their_own labors . In order that_they_may fulfill their function , let it be recognized that all the faithful , whether clerics or laity , possess a lawful freedom of inquiry , freedom of thought and of expressing their mind with humility and fortitude in those matters on which_they enjoy competence . CHAPTER III ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE . In the economic_and_social realms , too , the dignity and complete vocation of the human_person and the welfare of society as a whole are to be respected and promoted . For man -isaia-_the_source , the center , and the purpose of all economic_and_social life . Like other areas of social_life , the economy of today -isaia- marked by man s increasing domination over nature , by closer and more intense relationships between citizens , groups , and countries and their mutual dependence , and by the increased intervention of the state . At the same_time progress in the methods of production and in the exchange of goods and services has made the economy an instrument capable of better meeting the intensified needs of the human_family . Reasons for anxiety , however , are_not lacking . Many people , especially in economically advanced areas , seem , as it were , to be ruled by economics , so that almost their entire personal and social life_-isaia- permeated with a certain economic way of thinking . Such -isaia- true both of nations that favor a collective economy and of others . At the very time_when the development of economic_life could mitigate social inequalities provided_that it be guided and coordinated in a reasonable and human way , it -isaia-_often made to embitter them ; or , in some places , it even results in a decline of the social status of the underprivileged and in contempt for the poor . While an immense number of people still lack the absolute necessities of life , some , even in less advanced areas , live in luxury or squander wealth . Extravagance and wretchedness exist side by side . While a few enjoy very great power of choice , the majority are deprived of almost all possibility of acting on their_own initiative and responsibility , and often subsist in living and working conditions unworthy of the human_person . A similar lack of economic_and_social balance -isaia- to be noticed between agriculture , industry , and the services , and also between different parts of one_and_the_same country . The contrast between_the economically more advanced countries and other countries -isaia- becoming more_serious day_by_day , and the very peace of the world can be jeopardized thereby . Our contemporaries are coming to feel these inequalities with an ever sharper awareness , since_they are thoroughly convinced_that the ampler technical and economic possibilities which_the world of today enjoys can and should correct this unhappy state of affairs . Hence , many reforms in the socioeconomic realm and a change of mentality and attitude are required of all . For this_reason_the Church down through the centuries and in the light of the Gospel has worked out the principles of justice and equity demanded by right_reason both_for individual and social_life and for international life , and she_has proclaimed them especially in recent_times . This sacred council intends to strengthen these_principles according to the circumstances of this age and to set_forth certain guidelines , especially with_regard to the requirements of economic development . SECTION Economic Development . Today more_than_ever before attention -isaia- rightly given to the increase of the production of agricultural and industrial goods and of the rendering of services , for the purpose of making provision for the growth of population and of satisfying the increasing desires of the human_race . Therefore , technical progress , an inventive spirit , an eagerness to create and to expand enterprises , the application of methods of production , and the strenuous efforts of all who engage in production in a word , all the elements making for_such development must be promoted . The fundamental finality of this production -isaia- not the mere increase of products nor profit or control but_rather the service of man , and indeed of the whole man with_regard for the full range of his material needs and the demands of his intellectual , moral , spiritual , and religious_life ; this applies to every man whatsoever and to every group of men , of every race and of every part_of_the_world . Consequently , economic activity -isaia- to be carried on according to its_own methods and laws within_the limits of the moral_order , '' so that God s plan_for mankind may be realized . . Economic development must remain under man s determination and must_not be left to the judgment of a few men or groups possessing too much economic power or of the political community alone or of certain more powerful nations . It -isaia- necessary , on the contrary , that -atti_degli_apostoli- every level the largest possible number of people and , when it -isaia-_a_question of international relations , all nations have an active share in directing that development . There -isaia- need as well of the coordination and fitting and harmonious combination of the spontaneous efforts of individuals and of free groups with the undertakings of public_authorities . Growth -isaia- not to be left solely to a kind of mechanical course of the economic activity of individuals , nor to the authority of government . For this_reason , doctrines which obstruct the necessary reforms under the guise of a false liberty , and those_which subordinate the basic rights of individual persons and groups to the collective organization of production must be shown to be erroneous . Citizens , on the other_hand , should remember that_it_-isaia- their right and duty , which_-isaia- also to be recognized by the civil authority , to contribute to the true progress of their_own community according_to_their ability . Especially in underdeveloped areas , where all resources must urgently be employed , those_who hold back their unproductive resources or who deprive their community of the material or spiritual aid that it needs saving the personal right of migration gravely endanger the common_good . . To satisfy the demands of justice and equity , strenuous efforts must be made , without disregarding the rights of persons or the natural qualities of each country , to remove as quickly as possible the immense economic inequalities , which now exist and in many cases are growing and which_are connected_with individual and social discrimination . Likewise , in many areas , in view of the special difficulties of agriculture relative to the raising and selling of produce , country people must be helped both to increase and to market what_they produce , and to introduce the necessary development and renewal and also obtain a fair income . Otherwise , as too_often happens , they_will remain in the condition of lower class citizens . Let farmers themselves , especially young ones , apply themselves to perfecting their professional skill , for without it , there_can be no agricultural advance . Justice and equity likewise require that the mobility , which_-isaia- necessary in a developing economy , be regulated in such_a_way as to keep the life of individuals and their_families from becoming insecure and precarious . When workers come from another country or district and contribute to the economic advancement of a nation or region by their labor , all discrimination as regards wages and working conditions must be carefully avoided . All the people , moreover , above all the public_authorities , must treat them_not as mere tools of production but as persons , and must help_them to bring their_families to live with_them and to provide themselves_with a decent dwelling ; they must_also see_to_it_that these workers are incorporated into the social_life of the country or region that receives them . Employment opportunities , however , should be created in their_own areas as far_as_possible . In economic affairs which today are subject to change , as in the new_forms of industrial society in which automation , for example , -isaia- advancing , care must_be_taken that sufficient and suitable work and the possibility of the appropriate technical and professional formation are furnished . The livelihood and the human_dignity especially of those_who_are in very difficult conditions because of illness or old age must be guaranteed . SECTION Certain Principles Governing Socio Economic Life as a Whole . Human labor which_-isaia- expended in the production and exchange of goods or in the performance of economic services -isaia- superior to the other elements of economic_life , for the latter have only the nature of tools . This labor , whether it -isaia- engaged in independently or hired by someone else , comes immediately from the person , who as it were stamps the things of nature with_his seal and subdues them to his_will . By his labor a man ordinarily supports himself and his family , -isaia- joined to his fellow men and serves them , and can exercise genuine charity and be a partner in the work of bringing divine creation to perfection . Indeed , we hold that_through labor offered to God man_-isaia- associated_with the redemptive work of Jesus Christ , Who conferred an eminent dignity on labor when -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth He worked with His own hands . From this there follows for_every man the duty of working faithfully and also the right to work . It -isaia-_the_duty of society , moreover , according to the circumstances prevailing in it , and in keeping_with its role , to help the citizens to find sufficient employment . Finally , remuneration for labor -isaia- to be such that_man may be furnished the means to cultivate worthily his_own material , social , cultural , and spiritual_life and that of his dependents , in view of the function and productiveness of each_one , the conditions of the factory or workshop , and the common_good . Since economic activity for the most part implies the associated work of human_beings , any_way of organizing and directing it which_may be detrimental to any working men_and_women would be wrong and inhuman . It happens too_often , however , even in our days , that workers are reduced to the level of being slaves to their_own work . This -isaia- by no means justified by the so called economic laws . The entire process of productive work , therefore , must be adapted to the needs of the person and to his way_of_life , above all to his domestic life , especially in respect to mothers of families , always with due regard_for sex and age . The opportunity , moreover , should be granted to workers to unfold their_own abilities and personality through the performance of their_work . Applying their time and strength to their employment with a due sense_of_responsibility , they should_also all enjoy sufficient rest and leisure to cultivate their familial , cultural , social and religious_life . They should_also have_the opportunity freely to develop the energies and potentialities which perhaps they_cannot bring to much fruition in their professional work . . In economic enterprises it -isaia- persons_who are joined together , that_-isaia- , free and independent human_beings created to the image of God . Therefore , with attention to the functions of each owners or employers , management or labor and without doing harm to the necessary unity of management , the active sharing of all in the administration and profits of these enterprises in ways to be properly determined -isaia- to be promoted . Since more often , however , decisions concerning economic_and_social conditions , on which_the future lot of the workers and of their_children depends , are made not within_the business itself but by institutions on a higher level , the workers themselves should_have a share also in determining these conditions in person or through freely elected delegates . Among the basic rights of the human person_-isaia- to be numbered the right of freely founding unions for working people . These should be able truly to represent them and to contribute to the organizing of economic_life in the right way . Included -isaia- the right of freely taking part in the activity of these unions without risk of reprisal . Through this orderly participation joined to progressive economic_and_social formation , all will grow day_by_day in the awareness of their_own function and responsibility , and thus they_will be brought to feel that_they_are comrades in the whole task of economic development and in the attainment of the universal common_good according_to_their capacities and aptitudes . When , however , socio economic disputes arise , efforts must be made to come to a peaceful settlement . Although recourse must_always be had first to a sincere dialogue_between the parties , a strike , nevertheless , can remain even in present_day circumstances a necessary , though ultimate , aid for the defense of the workers own rights and the fulfillment of their just desires . As soon as possible , however , ways should be sought to resume negotiation and the discussion of reconciliation . . God intended the earth with everything contained in it for the use of all human_beings and peoples . Thus , under the leadership of justice and in the company of charity , created goods should be in abundance for all in like_manner . Whatever the forms of property may be , as adapted to the legitimate institutions of peoples , according to diverse and changeable circumstances , attention must_always be paid to this universal destination of earthly goods . In using them , therefore , man should regard the external things_that he legitimately possesses not_only as his_own but_also as common in the sense that_they_should be able to benefit not_only him but_also others . On the other_hand , the right of having a share of earthly goods sufficient for oneself and one s family belongs to everyone . The Fathers and Doctors of the Church held this opinion , teaching that_men are obliged to come to the relief of the poor and to do so not merely out of their superfluous goods . If one_-isaia- in extreme necessity , he has the right to procure for_himself what he needs out of the riches of others . Since there_are so many_people prostrate with hunger in the world , this sacred council urges all , both individuals and governments , to remember the aphorism of the Fathers , '' Feed the man dying of hunger , because if you have_not fed him , you_have killed him , '' and really to share and employ their earthly goods , according to the ability of each , especially by supporting individuals or peoples with the aid by which_they may_be_able to help and develop themselves . In economically less advanced societies the common destination of earthly goods -isaia- partly satisfied by means of the customs and traditions proper to the community , by which_the absolutely necessary things_are furnished to each member . An effort must be made , however , to avoid regarding certain customs as altogether unchangeable , if they no longer answer the new needs of this age . On the other_hand , imprudent action should_not be taken against respectable customs which , provided they_are suitably adapted to present_day circumstances , do not_cease to be very useful . Similarly , in highly developed nations a body of social institutions dealing_with protection and security can , for its_own part , bring to reality the common destination of earthly goods . Family and social services , especially_those that provide_for culture and education , should be further promoted . When all these_things are_being organized , vigilance -isaia- necessary to present_the citizens from being led into a certain inactivity vis a vis society or from rejecting the burden of taking up office or from refusing to serve . . Investments , for their_part , must be directed toward procuring employment and sufficient income for the people both now and in the future . Whoever makes decisions concerning these investments and the planning of the economy whether_they be individuals or groups of public_authorities are_bound to keep these objectives in mind and to recognize their serious obligation of watching , on the one_hand , that provision be made for the necessities required_for a decent life both of individuals and of the whole community and , on the other , of looking out for the future and of establishing a right balance between_the needs of present_day consumption , both individual and collective , and the demands of investing for the generation to come . They should_also always bear in mind the urgent needs of underdeveloped countries or regions . In monetary matters they_should beware of hurting the welfare of their_own country or of other countries . Care should_also be taken lest the economically weak countries unjustly suffer any loss from a change in the value of money . . Since property and other_forms of private ownership of external goods contribute to the expression of the personality , and since , moreover , they furnish one an occasion to exercise his function in society and in the economy , it -isaia-_very important_that the access of both individuals and communities to some ownership of external goods be fostered Private property or some ownership of external goods confers on everyone a sphere wholly necessary_for the autonomy of the person and the family , and it should be regarded as an extension of human_freedom . Lastly , since it adds incentives for carrying on one s function and charge , it constitutes one of the conditions for civil liberties . The forms of such ownership or property are varied today and are becoming increasingly diversified . They all remain , however , a cause of security not to be underestimated , in spite of social funds , rights , and services provided by society . This -isaia- true not_only of material property but_also of immaterial things such as professional capacities . The right of private ownership , however , -isaia- not opposed to the right inherent in various_forms of public property . Goods can be transferred to the public domain only by the competent authority , according to the demands and within_the limits of the common_good , and with fair compensation . Furthermore , it -isaia- the right of public_authority to prevent anyone from abusing his private_property to the detriment of the common_good . By its_very nature private_property has a social quality which_-isaia- based on the law of the common destination of earthly goods . If this social quality -isaia- overlooked , property often becomes an occasion of passionate desires for wealth and serious disturbances , so that a pretext -isaia- given to the attackers for calling the right itself into question . In many underdeveloped regions there_are large or even extensive rural estates which_are only slightly cultivated or lie completely idle for the sake of profit , while the majority of the people either are without land or have only very small fields , and , on the other_hand , it -isaia- evidently urgent to increase the productivity of the fields . Not infrequently those_who_are hired to work_for the landowners or who till a portion of the land as tenants receive a wage or income unworthy of a human_being , lack decent housing and are exploited by middlemen . Deprived of all security , they live under such personal servitude that almost every opportunity of acting on their_own initiative and responsibility -isaia- denied to them and all advancement in human culture and all sharing in social and political_life -isaia- forbidden to them . According to the different cases , therefore , reforms are necessary : that income may grow , working conditions should be improved , security in employment increased , and an incentive to working on one_s_own initiative given . Indeed , insufficiently cultivated estates should be distributed to those_who can_make these lands fruitful ; in this case , the necessary things and means , especially educational aids and the right facilities for cooperative organization , must be supplied . Whenever , nevertheless , the common_good requires expropriation , compensation must be reckoned in equity after all the circumstances have_been weighed . . Christians who take an active part in present_day socio economic development and fight for_justice and charity should be convinced_that they can_make a great contribution to the prosperity of mankind and to the peace of the world . In these activities let_them , either as individuals or as members of groups , give a shining example . Having acquired the absolutely necessary skill and experience , they_should observe the right order in their earthly activities in faithfulness to Christ and His Gospel . Thus their whole_life , both individual and social , will be permeated with the spirit of the beatitudes , notably with a spirit of poverty . Whoever in obedience to Christ seeks first the Kingdom of God , takes therefrom a stronger and purer love for helping all his brethren and for perfecting the work of justice under the inspiration of charity . CHAPTER IV THE LIFE OF THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY . In our_day , profound changes are apparent also in the structure and institutions of peoples . These result from their cultural , economic_and_social evolution . Such changes have a great influence on the life of the political community , especially regarding the rights_and_duties of all in the exercise of civil freedom and in the attainment of the common_good , and in organizing the relations of citizens among_themselves and with_respect to public_authority . The present keener sense of human_dignity has_given rise in many parts_of_the_world to attempts to bring_about a politico juridical order which_will give better protection to the rights of the person in public_life . These include the right freely to meet and form associations , the right to express one_s_own opinion and to profess one s religion both publicly and privately . The protection of the rights of a person_-isaia- indeed a necessary condition so that citizens , individually or collectively , can take an active part in the life and government of the state . Along with cultural , economic_and_social development , there_-isaia- a growing desire among many_people to play a greater part in organizing the life of the political community . In the conscience of many arises an increasing concern that the rights of minorities be recognized , without_any neglect for their_duties toward_the political community . In addition , there_-isaia- a steadily growing respect_for men of other opinions or other_religions . At the same_time , there_-isaia- wider cooperation to guarantee the actual exercise of personal rights to all citizens , and not_only to a few privileged individuals . However , those political systems , prevailing in some parts_of_the_world are to be reproved which hamper civic or religious_freedom , victimize large numbers through avarice and political crimes , and divert the exercise of authority from the service of the common_good to the interests of one or another faction or of the rulers themselves . There -isaia- no better way to establish political_life on a truly human basis than by fostering an inward sense of justice and kindliness , and of service to the common_good , and by strengthening basic convictions as to the true nature of the political community and the aim , right exercise , and sphere of action of public_authority . . Men , families and the various groups which_make up the civil community are aware_that they_cannot achieve a truly human_life by their_own unaided efforts . They see the need_for a wider community , within which_each one makes his specific contribution every_day toward an ever broader realization of the common_good . For this_purpose they set up a political community according to various_forms . The political community exists , consequently , for the sake of the common_good , in which it finds_its full justification and significance , and the source of its inherent legitimacy . Indeed , the common_good embraces the sum of those conditions of the social_life whereby men , families and associations more adequately and readily may attain their_own perfection . Yet the people_who come together in the political community are_many and diverse , and they_have every right to prefer divergent solutions . If the political community -isaia- not to be torn apart while everyone follows his_own opinion , there_must be an authority to direct the energies of all citizens toward_the common_good , not in a mechanical or despotic fashion , but by acting above all as a moral force which appeals to each_one s freedom and sense_of_responsibility . It -isaia- clear , therefore_,_that the political community and public_authority are founded on human_nature and hence belong to the order designed by God , even_though the choice of a political regime and the appointment of rulers are left to the free will of citizens . It follows also_that political authority , both in the community as such and in the representative bodies of the state , must_always be exercised within_the limits of the moral_order and directed toward_the common_good with a dynamic concept of that good according to the juridical order legitimately established or due to be established . When authority_-isaia- so exercised , citizens are_bound in conscience to obey . Accordingly , the responsibility , dignity and importance of leaders are indeed clear . But where citizens are oppressed by a public_authority overstepping its competence , they_should not protest against those things_which are objectively required_for the common_good ; but_it_-isaia- legitimate for them to defend their_own rights and the rights of their fellow citizens against the abuse of this authority , while keeping within those limits drawn by the natural_law and the Gospels . According to the character of different peoples and their historic development , the political community can , however , adopt a variety of concrete solutions in its structures and the organization of public_authority . For the benefit of the whole human_family , these solutions must_always contribute to the formation of a type of man who_will be cultivated , peace loving and well disposed towards all his fellow men . . It -isaia- in full conformity_with human_nature that there_should be juridico political structures providing all citizens in an ever better fashion and without_any discrimination the practical possibility of freely and actively taking part in the establishment of the juridical foundations of the political community and in the direction of public affairs , in fixing the terms of reference of the various public bodies and in the election of political leaders . All citizens , therefore , should be mindful of the right and also the duty to use their free vote to further the common_good . The Church praises and esteems the work of those_who for the good of men devote_themselves to the service of the state and take on the burdens of this office . If the citizens responsible cooperation -isaia- to produce the good results which_may be expected in the normal course of political_life , there_must be a statute of positive law providing for a suitable division of the functions and bodies of authority and an efficient and independent system for the protection of rights . The rights of all persons , families and groups , and their practical application , must be recognized , respected and furthered , together_with_the duties binding on all citizen . Among the latter , it will be well to recall_the duty of rendering the political community such material and personal service as are required by the common_good . Rulers must be careful not to hamper the development of family , social or cultural groups , nor that of intermediate bodies or organizations , and not to deprive them of opportunities_for legitimate and constructive activity ; they_should willingly seek rather to promote the orderly pursuit of such activity . Citizens , for their_part , either individually or collectively , must be careful not to attribute excessive power to public_authority , not to make exaggerated and untimely demands upon it in their_own interests , lessening in this_way the responsible role of persons , families and social groups . The complex circumstances of our_day make it necessary_for public_authority to intervene more often in social , economic and cultural matters in order to bring_about favorable conditions which_will give more_effective help to citizens and groups in their free pursuit of man s total well_being . The relations , however , between socialization and the autonomy and development of the person can be understood in different_ways according to various regions and the evolution of peoples . But when_the exercise of rights -isaia- restricted temporarily for the common_good , freedom should be restored immediately upon change of circumstances . Moreover , it -isaia- inhuman for public_authority to fall back on dictatorial systems or totalitarian methods which violate the rights of the person or social groups . Citizens must cultivate a generous and loyal spirit of patriotism , but without being narrow minded . This means that_they_will always direct their attention to the good of the whole human_family , united by the different ties which bind together races , people and nations . All Christians must be aware of their_own specific vocation within_the political community . It -isaia- for them to give an example by their sense_of_responsibility and their service of the common_good . In this_way they_are to demonstrate concretely how authority can be compatible with freedom , personal initiative with the solidarity of the whole social organism , and the advantages of unity with fruitful diversity . They must recognize_the legitimacy of different opinions with_regard to temporal solutions , and respect citizens , who , even as a group , defend their points of view by honest methods . Political parties , for their_part , must promote those things_which in their judgement are required_for the common_good ; it -isaia- never allowable to give their interests priority over the common_good . Great care must_be_taken about civic and political formation , which_-isaia- of the utmost necessity today for the population as a whole , and especially_for youth , so that all citizens can play their_part in the life of the political community . Those who_are suited or can become suited should prepare themselves for the difficult , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , the very noble art of politics , and should seek to practice this art without regard_for their_own interests or for material advantages . With integrity and wisdom , they must_take action against any form of injustice and tyranny , against arbitrary domination by an individual or a political party and any intolerance . They should dedicate themselves to the service of all with sincerity and fairness , indeed , with the charity and fortitude demanded by political_life . . It -isaia- very_important , especially where a pluralistic society prevails , that_there be a correct notion of the relationship_between_the political community and the Church , and a clear distinction between_the tasks which Christians undertake , individually or as a group , on their_own responsibility as citizens guided by the dictates of a Christian conscience , and the activities which , in union with_their pastors , they carry_out in the name of the Church . The Church , by reason of her role and competence , -isaia- not identified in any_way with the political community nor bound to any political system . She -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a sign and a safeguard of the transcendent character of the human_person . The Church and the political community in their_own fields are autonomous and independent from each_other . Yet both , under different titles , are devoted to the personal and social vocation of the same men . The more that both foster sounder cooperation between themselves_with due consideration for the circumstances of time_and_place , the more_effective will their service be exercised for the good of all . For man s horizons are_not limited only to the temporal order ; while living in the context of human_history , he preserves intact his eternal vocation . The Church , for_her part , founded on the love of the Redeemer , contributes toward_the reign of justice and charity within_the borders of a nation and between nations . By preaching the truths of the Gospel , and bringing to bear on all fields of human endeavor the light of her doctrine and of a Christian witness , she respects and fosters the political freedom and responsibility of citizens . The Apostles , their successors and those_who cooperate with_them , are sent to announce to mankind Christ , the Savior . Their apostolate -isaia- based on the power of God , Who very often shows forth the strength of the Gospel on the weakness of its witnesses . All those dedicated to the ministry of God s Word must use the ways and means proper to the Gospel which in a great many respects differ from the means proper to the earthly city . There are , indeed , close links between earthly things and those elements of man s condition which transcend the world . The Church herself makes use of temporal things insofar as her_own mission requires it . She , for_her part , does_not place her trust in the privileges offered by civil authority . She will even give up the exercise of certain rights which_have_been legitimately acquired , if it becomes clear_that their use will cast doubt on the sincerity of her witness or that new ways of life demand new methods . It -isaia- only right , however_,_that -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and in all places , the Church should_have true freedom to preach the faith , to teach her social_doctrine , to exercise her role freely among_men , and also to pass moral judgment in those matters which regard public order when_the fundamental rights of a person or the salvation_of_souls require it . In this , she should make_use of all the means but_only those_which accord with the Gospel and which correspond to the general good according to the diversity of times and circumstances . While faithfully adhering to the Gospel and fulfilling her_mission to the world , the Church , whose duty it -isaia- to foster and elevate all that_-isaia- found to be true , good and beautiful in the human community , strengthens peace among_men for the glory of God . CHAPTER V THE FOSTERING OF PEACE AND THE PROMOTION OF A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS . In our generation when men continue to be afflicted by acute hardships and anxieties arising from the ravages of war or the threat of it , the whole human_family faces an hour of supreme crisis in its advance toward maturity . Moving gradually together and everywhere more conscious already of its unity , this family cannot accomplish its task of constructing for all men everywhere a world more genuinely human unless each_person devotes himself to the cause of peace with renewed vigor . Thus it happens_that the Gospel message , which_-isaia- in harmony_with_the loftier strivings and aspirations of the human_race , takes on a new luster in our_day as it declares that the artisans of peace are blessed '' because_they will be called the sons of God '' Matt . : . Consequently , as it points_out the authentic and noble meaning of peace and condemns the frightfulness of war , the Council wishes passionately to summon Christians to cooperate , under the help of Christ the author of peace , with all men in securing among_themselves a peace based on justice and love and in setting up the instruments of peace . . Peace -isaia- not merely the absence of war ; nor_can it be reduced solely to the maintenance of a balance of power between enemies ; nor_-isaia- it brought_about by dictatorship . Instead , it -isaia- rightly and appropriately called an enterprise of justice . Peace results from that order structured into human_society by its divine Founder , and actualized by men as they thirst after ever_greater justice . The common_good of humanity finds_its ultimate meaning in the eternal law . But since_the concrete demands of this common_good are constantly changing as time goes on , peace_-isaia- never attained once and for all , but must be built up ceaselessly . Moreover , since_the human will -isaia- unsteady and wounded by sin , the achievement of peace requires a constant mastering of passions and the vigilance of lawful authority . But this -isaia-_not_enough . This peace on earth cannot be obtained unless personal well_being -isaia- safeguarded and men freely and trustingly share_with one_another the riches of their inner spirits and their talents . A firm determination to respect other men and peoples and their_dignity , as well as the studied practice of brotherhood are absolutely necessary_for the establishment of peace . Hence peace_-isaia- likewise the fruit of love_,_which goes beyond what justice can provide . That earthly peace which arises from love of neighbor symbolizes and results from the peace of Christ which radiates from God the Father . For by the cross the incarnate Son , the prince of peace reconciled all men with God . By thus restoring all men to the unity of one people and one_body , He slew hatred in His own flesh ; and , after being lifted on high by His resurrection , He poured forth the spirit of love into the hearts of men . For this_reason , all Christians are urgently summoned to do in love what_the truth requires , and to join with all true peacemakers in pleading for peace and bringing it about . Motivated by this same_spirit , we cannot_fail to praise those_who renounce the use of violence in the vindication of their_rights and who resort to methods of defense which_are otherwise available to weaker parties too , provided this_can be done without injury to the rights_and_duties of others or of the community itself . Insofar as men_are sinful , the threat of war hangs over them , and hang over them it will until the return of Christ . But insofar as men vanquish sin by a union of love , they_will vanquish violence as well and make these_words come true : '' They shall turn their swords into plough shares , and their spears into sickles . Nation shall_not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more '' Isaiah : . SECTION The Avoidance of War . Even though recent wars have wrought physical and moral havoc on our_world , the devastation of battle still goes on day_by_day in some part_of_the_world . Indeed , now that every_kind of weapon produced by modern science -isaia- used in war , the fierce character of warfare threatens to lead the combatants to a savagery far surpassing that of the past . Furthermore , the complexity of the modern_world and the intricacy of international relations allow guerrilla warfare to be drawn out by new methods of deceit and subversion . In many causes the use of terrorism -isaia- regarded as a new_way to wage war . Contemplating this melancholy state of humanity , the council wishes , above all things else , to recall_the permanent binding force of universal natural_law and its all embracing principles . Man s conscience itself gives ever_more emphatic voice to these_principles . Therefore , actions which deliberately conflict with_these same principles , as well as orders commanding such actions are criminal , and blind obedience cannot excuse those_who yield to them . The most infamous among_these are actions designed for the methodical extermination of an entire people , nation or ethnic minority . Such actions must be vehemently condemned as horrendous crimes . The courage of those_who fearlessly and openly resist those_who issue such commands merits supreme commendation . On the subject of war , quite a large number of nations have subscribed to international agreements aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- making military activity and its consequences less inhuman . Their stipulations deal_with such matters as the treatment of wounded soldiers and prisoners . Agreements of this_sort must be honored . Indeed they_should be improved upon so that the frightfulness of war can be better and more workably held in check . All men , especially government officials and experts in these_matters , are_bound to do everything they_can to effect these improvements . Moreover , it seems right that laws make humane provisions for the case of those_who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms , provided however_,_that they agree to serve the human community in some other way . Certainly , war has not_been rooted out of human affairs . As long as the danger of war remains and there_-isaia- no competent and sufficiently powerful authority -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level , governments cannot be denied the right to legitimate defense once every_means of peaceful settlement has_been exhausted . State authorities and others_who share public responsibility have_the duty to conduct such grave matters soberly and to protect the welfare of the people entrusted to their care . But it -isaia- one_thing to undertake military action for the just defense of the people , and something else again to seek the subjugation of other nations . Nor , by the same token , does the mere fact_that war has unhappily begun mean_that all -isaia- fair between_the warring parties . Those too who devote_themselves to the military service of their_country should regard themselves as the agents of security and freedom of peoples . As long as they fulfill this role properly , they_are making a genuine contribution to the establishment of peace . . The horror and perversity of war -isaia- immensely magnified by the addition of scientific weapons . For acts of war involving these weapons can inflict massive and indiscriminate destruction , thus going far beyond_the bounds of legitimate defense . Indeed , if the kind of instruments which_can now be found in the armories of the great nations were to be employed to their fullest , an almost total and altogether reciprocal slaughter of each side by the other would follow , not to mention the widespread devastation that_would take_place in the world and the deadly after effects that_would be spawned by the use of weapons of this_kind . All these considerations compel us to undertake an evaluation of war with an entirely new attitude . The men of our_time must realize that_they_will have to give a somber reckoning of their deeds of war for the course of the future will depend greatly on the decisions they_make today . With these truths in mind , this most_holy synod makes its_own the condemnations of total war already pronounced by recent popes , and issues the following declaration . Any act of war aimed indiscriminately -atti_degli_apostoli- the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along_with their population -isaia- a crime against God and man_himself . It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation . The unique hazard of modern warfare consists in this : it provides those_who possess modern scientific weapons with a kind of occasion for perpetrating just such abominations ; moreover , through a certain inexorable chain of events , it can catapult men into the most atrocious decisions . That such may never truly happen in the future , the bishops of the whole_world gathered together , beg all men , especially government officials and military leaders , to give unremitting thought to their gigantic responsibility before God and the entire human_race . . To be sure , scientific weapons are_not amassed solely for use in war . Since the defensive strength of any nation -isaia- considered to be dependent upon its capacity_for immediate retaliation , this accumulation of arms , which increases each year , likewise serves , in a way heretofore unknown , as deterrent to possible enemy attack . Many regard this procedure as the most effective way by which peace of a sort can be maintained between nations -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . Whatever be the facts about_this method of deterrence , men should be convinced_that the arms race in which an already considerable number of countries are engaged -isaia- not a safe way to preserve a steady peace , nor_-isaia- the so called balance resulting from this race a sure and authentic peace . Rather than being eliminated thereby , the causes of war are in danger of being gradually aggravated . While extravagant sums are_being spent for the furnishing of ever_new weapons , an adequate remedy cannot be provided for the multiple miseries afflicting the whole modern_world . Disagreements between nations are_not really and radically healed ; on the contrary , they spread the infection to other parts of the earth . New approaches based on reformed attitudes must_be_taken to remove this trap and to emancipate the world from its crushing anxiety through the restoration of genuine peace . Therefore , we say it again : the arms race -isaia- an utterly treacherous trap for_humanity , and one_which ensnares the poor to an intolerable degree . It -isaia- much to be feared that if this race persists , it will eventually spawn all the lethal ruin whose path it -isaia-_now making ready . Warned by the calamities which_the human_race has made possible , let us make_use of the interlude granted us from above and for which_we_are thankful to become more conscious of our_own responsibility and to find means_for resolving our disputes in a manner more worthy of man . Divine Providence urgently demands of us that we free ourselves from the age old slavery of war . If we refuse to make_this effort , we do not_know where we will be led by the evil road we have set upon . It -isaia-_our clear duty , therefore , to strain every muscle in working for the time_when all war can be completely outlawed by international consent . This goal undoubtedly requires the establishment of some universal public_authority acknowledged as such by all and endowed_with the power to safeguard on the behalf of all , security , regard for_justice , and respect_for rights . But before this hoped for authority can be set up , the highest existing international centers must devote_themselves vigorously to the pursuit of better means_for obtaining common security . Since peace must be born of mutual trust between nations and not be imposed on them through a fear of the available weapons , everyone must labor to put an end -atti_degli_apostoli- last to the arms race , and to make a true beginning of disarmament , not unilaterally indeed , but proceeding -atti_degli_apostoli- an equal pace according to agreement , and backed up by true and workable safeguards . . In the meantime , efforts which_have already_been made and are_still underway to eliminate the danger of war are_not to be underrated . On the contrary , support should be given to the good_will of the very many leaders who work hard to do away with war , which_they abominate . These men , although burdened by the extremely weighty preoccupations of their high office , are nonetheless moved by the very grave peacemaking task to which_they_are bound , even if they_cannot ignore the complexity of matters as they stand . We should fervently ask God to give these_men the strength to go forward perseveringly and to follow through courageously on this_work of building peace with vigor . It -isaia- a work of supreme love for mankind . Today it certainly demands_that they extend their thoughts and their spirit beyond_the confines of their_own nation , that_they put aside national selfishness and ambition to dominate other nations , and that_they nourish a profound reverence for the whole of humanity , which -isaia-_already making its way so laboriously toward greater unity . The problems of peace and of disarmament have already_been the subject of extensive , strenuous and constant examination . Together with international meetings dealing_with these problems , such studies should be regarded as the first steps toward solving these serious questions , and should be promoted with even greater urgency by way of yielding concrete results in the future . Nevertheless , men should_take heed not to entrust themselves only to the efforts of some , while not caring about their_own attitudes . For government officials who must -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time guarantee the good of their_own people and promote the universal good are_very greatly dependent on public opinion and feeling . It does them no good to work_for peace as long as feelings of hostility , contempt and distrust , as well as racial hatred and unbending ideologies , continue to divide men and place them in opposing camps . Consequently there_-isaia- above all a pressing need_for a renewed education of attitudes and for new inspiration in public opinion . Those who_are dedicated to the work of education , particularly of the young , or who mold public opinion , should consider it their most weighty task to instruct all in fresh sentiments of peace . Indeed , we all need a change of heart as we regard the entire world and those tasks which we can perform in unison for the betterment of our race . But we should_not let false hope deceive us . For unless enmities and hatred are put away and firm , honest agreements concerning world peace are reached in the future , humanity , which already -isaia- in the middle of a grave crisis , even_though it -isaia- endowed_with remarkable knowledge , will perhaps be brought to that dismal hour in which it will experience no peace other_than the dreadful peace of death . But , while we say this , the Church of Christ , present in the midst of the anxiety of this age , does not_cease to hope most firmly . She intends to propose to our_age over and over again , in season and out of season , this_apostolic message : '' Behold , now -isaia- the acceptable time for a change of heart ; behold ! now -isaia- the day of salvation . '' SECTION II Setting Up An International Community . In order to build up peace above all the causes of discord among_men , especially injustice , which foment wars must be rooted out . Not a few of these causes come from excessive economic inequalities and from putting off the steps needed to remedy them . Other causes of discord , however , have_their source in the desire to dominate and in a contempt for persons . And , if we look for deeper causes , we find them in human envy , distrust , pride , and other egotistical passions . Man cannot bear so many ruptures in the harmony of things . Consequently , the world_-isaia- constantly beset by strife and violence between men , even_when no war -isaia- being waged . Besides , since these same evils are present in the relations_between various nations as well , in order to overcome or forestall them and to keep violence once unleashed within limits it -isaia- absolutely necessary_for countries to cooperate more advantageously and more_closely together and to organize together international bodies and to work tirelessly for the creation of organizations which_will foster peace . . In view of the increasingly close ties of mutual dependence today between all the inhabitants and peoples of the earth , the apt pursuit and efficacious attainment of the universal common_good now require of the community of nations that it organize itself in a manner suited to its present responsibilities , especially toward_the many parts_of_the_world which are_still suffering from unbearable want . To reach this goal , organizations of the international community , for their_part , must make provision for men s different needs , both in the fields of social_life such as food supplies , health , education , labor and also in certain special circumstances which_can crop up here and there , e . g . , the need to promote the general improvement of developing countries , or to alleviate the distressing conditions in which refugees dispersed throughout_the_world find_themselves , or also to assist migrants and their_families . Already existing international and regional organizations are certainly well deserving of the human_race . These are the first efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- laying the foundations on an international level for a community of all men to work_for the solution to the serious problems of our_times , to encourage progress everywhere , and to obviate wars of whatever kind . In all of these activities the Church takes joy in the spirit of true brotherhood flourishing between Christians and non Christians as it strives to make ever_more strenuous efforts to relieve abundant misery . . The present solidarity of mankind also calls for a revival of greater international cooperation in the economic field . Although nearly all peoples have_become autonomous , they_are far_from_being free of every_form of undue dependence , and far from escaping all danger of serious internal difficulties . The development of a nation depends on human and financial aids . The citizens of each country must be prepared by education and professional training to discharge the various tasks of economic_and_social life . But this in turn requires the aid of foreign specialists who , when_they give aid , will_not act as overlords , but as helpers and fellow workers . Developing nations will_not be able to procure material assistance unless radical changes are made in the established procedures of modern_world commerce . Other aid should be provided as well by advanced nations in the form of gifts , loans or financial investments . Such help should be accorded with generosity and without greed on the one side , and received with complete honesty on the other side . If an authentic economic order -isaia- to be established on a world wide basis , an end will_have to be put to profiteering , to national ambitions , to the appetite for political supremacy , to militaristic calculations , and to machinations for the sake of spreading and imposing ideologies . . The following norms seem useful for_such cooperation : a Developing nations should_take great pains to seek as the object for progress to express and secure the total human fulfillment of their citizens . They should bear in mind_that progress arises and grows above all out of the labor and genius of the nations themselves because it has to be based , not_only on foreign aid , but especially on the full utilization of their_own resources , and on the development of their_own culture and traditions . Those who exert the greatest influence on others should be outstanding in this respect . b On the other_hand , it -isaia- a very_important duty of the advanced nations to help the developing nations in discharging their above mentioned responsibilities . They should therefore gladly carry_out on their_own home front those spiritual and material readjustments that_are required_for the realization of this universal cooperation . Consequently , in business dealings with weaker and poorer nations , they_should be careful to respect their profit , for these countries need the income they receive on the sale of their homemade products to support themselves . c It -isaia- the role of the international community to coordinate and promote development , but in such_a_way_that the resources earmarked for this_purpose will be allocated as effectively as possible , and with complete equity . It -isaia- likewise this community s duty , with due regard_for the principle of subsidiarity , so to regulate economic relations throughout_the_world that_these will be carried_out in accordance_with_the norms of justice . Suitable organizations should be set up to foster and regulate international business affairs , particularly with the underdeveloped countries , and to compensate for losses resulting from an excessive inequality of power among the various nations . This type of organization , in unison with technical cultural and financial aid , should provide the help which developing nations need so that_they_can advantageously pursue their_own economic advancement . d In many cases there_-isaia- an urgent_need to revamp economic_and_social structures . But one_must guard against proposals of technical solutions that_are untimely . This -isaia- particularly true of those solutions providing man with material conveniences , but nevertheless contrary to man s spiritual nature and advancement . For '' not by bread alone does man live , but by every word which proceeds from the mouth of God '' Matt . : . Every sector of the family of man carries within itself and in its best traditions some portion of the spiritual treasure entrusted by God to humanity , even_though many may_not be aware of the source from which it comes . . International cooperation -isaia- needed today especially_for those peoples who , besides facing so many_other difficulties , likewise undergo pressures due to a rapid increase in population . There -isaia- an urgent_need to explore , with the full and intense cooperation of all , and especially of the wealthier nations , ways whereby_the human necessities of food and a suitable education can be furnished and shared with the entire human community . But some peoples could greatly improve upon the conditions of their_life if they_would change over from antiquated methods of farming to the new technical methods , applying them_with needed prudence according_to_their own circumstances . Their life would likewise be improved by the establishment of a better social_order and by a fairer system for the distribution of land ownership . Governments undoubtedly have rights_and_duties , within_the limits of their_proper competency , regarding the population problem in their_respective countries , for instance , in the line of social and family_life legislation , or regarding the migration of country dwellers to the cities , or with_respect to information concerning the condition and needs of the country . Since men today are giving thought to this problem and are so greatly disturbed over it , it -isaia- desirable in addition that Catholic specialists , especially in the universities , skillfully pursue and develop studies and projects on all these_matters . But there_are_many today who maintain that the increase in world population , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least the population increase in some_countries , must be radically curbed by every_means possible and by any_kind of intervention on the part of public_authority . In view of this contention , the council urges everyone to guard against solutions , whether publicly or privately supported , or -atti_degli_apostoli- times even imposed , which_are contrary to the moral_law . For in keeping_with man s inalienable right to marry and generate children , a decision concerning the number of children they_will have depends on the right judgment of the parents and it cannot in any_way be left to the judgment of public_authority . But since_the judgment of the parents presupposes a rightly formed conscience , it -isaia- of the utmost importance that the way be open for everyone to develop a correct and genuinely human responsibility which respects the divine_law and takes into consideration the circumstances of the situation and the time . But sometimes this requires an improvement in educational and social conditions , and , above all , formation in religion or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a complete moral training . Men should discreetly be informed , furthermore , of scientific advances in exploring methods whereby spouses can be helped in regulating the number of their_children and whose safeness has_been well proven and whose harmony_with_the moral_order has_been ascertained . . Christians should cooperate willingly and wholeheartedly in establishing an international order_that includes a genuine respect_for all freedoms and amicable brotherhood between all . This -isaia- all the more pressing since_the greater part_of_the_world -isaia- still suffering from so much poverty that_it_-isaia- as if Christ Himself were crying out in these poor to beg the charity of the disciples . Do not let men , then , be scandalized because some_countries with a majority of citizens who_are counted as Christians have an abundance of wealth , whereas others are deprived of the necessities of life and are tormented with hunger , disease , and every_kind of misery . The spirit of poverty and charity are the glory and witness of the Church of Christ . Those Christians are to be praised and supported , therefore , who volunteer their services to help other men and nations . Indeed , it -isaia-_the_duty of the whole People of God , following the word and example of the bishops , to alleviate as far as they are_able the sufferings of the modern age . They should do this too , as was_the ancient custom in the Church , out of the substance of their goods , and not_only out of what_-isaia- superfluous . The procedure of collecting and distributing aids , without being inflexible and completely uniform , should nevertheless be carried on in an orderly fashion in dioceses , nations , and throughout_the entire world . Wherever it seems convenient , this activity of Catholics should be carried on in unison with_other Christian brothers . For the spirit of charity does_not forbid , but on the contrary commands that charitable activity be carried_out in a careful and orderly manner . Therefore , it -isaia- essential for those_who intend to dedicate themselves to the services of the developing nations to be properly trained in appropriate institutes . . Since , in virtue of her_mission received_from God , the Church preaches the Gospel to all men and dispenses the treasures of grace , she contributes to the ensuring of peace everywhere on earth and to the placing of the fraternal exchange between men on solid ground by imparting knowledge of the divine and natural_law . Therefore , to encourage and stimulate cooperation among_men , the Church must be clearly present in the midst of the community of nations both through_her official channels and through the full and sincere collaboration of all Christians a collaboration motivated solely by the desire to be of service to all . This will come about more_effectively if the faithful themselves , conscious of their responsibility as men and as Christians will exert their influence in their_own milieu to arouse a ready willingness to cooperate with the international community . Special care must_be_given , in both religious and civil education , to the formation of youth in this_regard . . An outstanding form of international activity on the part of Christians -isaia- found in the joint efforts which , both as individuals and in groups , they contribute to institutes already established or to be established for the encouragement of cooperation among nations . There are_also various Catholic associations on an international level which_can contribute in many_ways to the building up of a peaceful and fraternal community of nations . These should be strengthened by augmenting in them the number of well qualified collaborators , by increasing needed resources , and by advantageously fortifying the coordination of their energies . For today both effective action and the need_for dialogue demand joint projects . Moreover , such associations contribute much to the development of a universal outlook something certainly appropriate for Catholics . They also help to form an awareness of genuine universal solidarity and responsibility . Finally , it -isaia-_very much to be desired that Catholics , in order to fulfill their role properly in the international community , will seek to cooperate actively and in a positive manner both with_their separated brothers who together_with them profess the Gospel of charity and with all men thirsting for true peace . The council , considering the immensity of the hardships which still afflict the greater part of mankind today , regards it as most opportune that an organism of the universal Church be set up in order_that both the justice and love of Christ toward_the poor might be developed everywhere . The role of such an organism would be to stimulate the Catholic community to promote progress in needy regions and international social_justice . . Drawn from the treasures of Church teaching , the proposals of this sacred synod look to the assistance of every man of our_time , whether he believes in God , or does_not explicitly recognize Him . If adopted , they_will promote among_men a sharper insight into_their full destiny , and thereby lead_them to fashion the world more to man s surpassing dignity , to search_for a brotherhood which_-isaia- universal and more_deeply rooted , and to meet_the urgencies of our ages with a gallant and unified effort born of love . Undeniably this conciliar program -isaia- but a general one in several of its parts ; and deliberately so , given the immense variety of situations and forms of human culture in the world . Indeed while it presents teaching already accepted in the Church , the program will_have to be followed up and amplified since it sometimes deals with matters in a constant state of development . Still , we have relied on the word of God and the spirit of the Gospel . Hence we entertain the hope_that many of our proposals will prove to be of substantial benefit to everyone , especially after they_have_been adapted to individual nations and mentalities by the faithful , under_the_guidance of their pastors . . By virtue of her_mission to shed on the whole_world the radiance of the Gospel message , and to unify under one Spirit all men of whatever nation , race or culture , the Church stands forth as a sign of that brotherhood which allows honest dialogue and gives it vigor . Such a mission requires in the first_place that we foster within_the Church herself mutual esteem , reverence and harmony , through the full recognition of lawful diversity . Thus all those_who compose the one People of God , both pastors and the general faithful , can engage in dialogue_with ever abounding fruitfulness . For the bonds which unite the faithful_are mightier than anything dividing them . Hence , let there be unity in what_-isaia- necessary ; freedom in what_-isaia- unsettled , and charity in any case . Our hearts embrace also those brothers and communities not_yet living with us in full_communion ; to them we are linked nonetheless by our profession of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit , and by the bond of charity . We do not forget_that the unity of Christians -isaia- today awaited and desired by many , too , who_do_not believe in Christ ; for the farther it advances toward truth and love under the powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit , the more this_unity will be a harbinger of unity and peace for the world -atti_degli_apostoli- large . Therefore , by common effort and in ways which_are today increasingly appropriate for seeking this splendid goal effectively , let us take pains to pattern ourselves after_the Gospel more exactly every_day , and thus work as brothers in rendering service to the human_family . For , in Christ Jesus this family_-isaia- called to the family of the sons of God . We think cordially too of all who acknowledge God , and who preserve in their traditions precious elements of religion and humanity . We want frank conversation to compel us all to receive the impulses of the Spirit faithfully and to act on them energetically . For our part , the desire_for such dialogue , which_can lead to truth through love alone , excludes no one , though an appropriate measure of prudence must undoubtedly be exercised . We include those_who cultivate outstanding qualities of the human spirit , but do not_yet acknowledge_the Source of these qualities . We include those_who oppress the Church and harass her in manifold ways . Since God the Father -isaia- the origin and purpose of all men , we are all called to be brothers . Therefore , if we have_been summoned to the same destiny , human and divine , we can and we should work together without violence and deceit in order to build up the world in genuine peace . . Mindful of the Lord s saying : '' by this_will all men know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another '' John : , Christians cannot yearn for anything more ardently than to serve the men of the modern_world with mounting generosity and success . Therefore , by holding faithfully to the Gospel and benefiting from its resources , by joining with every man_who loves and practices justice , Christians have shouldered a gigantic task for fulfillment in this_world , a task concerning which_they must give a reckoning to Him who_will judge every man on the last of days . Not everyone who cries , '' Lord , Lord , '' will enter_into the kingdom_of_heaven , but those_who do the Father s will by taking a strong grip on the work -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Now , the Father wills that in all men we recognize Christ our brother and love Him effectively , in word and in deed . By thus giving witness to the truth , we will share with_others the mystery of the heavenly Father s love . As a consequence , men throughout_the_world will be aroused to a lively hope the gift of the Holy Spirit that_some day -atti_degli_apostoli- last they_will be caught up in peace and utter happiness in that fatherland radiant with the glory of the Lord . Now to Him who_-isaia- able to accomplish all things in a measure far beyond what we ask or conceive , in keeping_with_the power that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in us to Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus , down through all the ages of time without end . Amen . Eph . : . NOTES Preface . The Pastoral Constitution '' De Ecclesia in Mundo Huius Temporis '' -isaia- made up of two parts ; yet it constitutes an organic unity . By way of explanation : the constitution -isaia- called '' pastoral '' because , while resting on doctrinal principles , it seeks to express the relation of the Church to the world and modern mankind . The result -isaia- that , on the one_hand , a pastoral slant -isaia- present in the first part , and , on the other_hand , a doctrinal slant -isaia- present in the second part . In the first part , the Church develops her teaching on man , on the world which_-isaia- the enveloping context of man s existence , and on man s relations to his fellow men . In part two , the Church gives closer consideration to various aspects of modern life and human_society ; special consideration -isaia- given to those questions and problems which , in this general area , seem to have a greater urgency in our_day . As a result in part two the subject matter which_-isaia- viewed in the light of doctrinal principles -isaia- made up of diverse elements . Some elements have a permanent value ; others , only a transitory one . Consequently , the constitution must be interpreted according to the general norms of theological interpretation . Interpreters must bear in mind especially in part two the changeable circumstances which_the subject matter , by its_very nature , involves .", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Vatican Council II", "author_dob": "11/10/1962", "author_start": "11/10/1962", "author_end": "08/12/1965", "pontificate_years": 3}

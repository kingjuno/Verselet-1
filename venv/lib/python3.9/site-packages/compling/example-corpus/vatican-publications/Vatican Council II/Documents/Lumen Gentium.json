Because this_-isaia- so , this Sacred Synod gathered together in the Holy Spirit eagerly desires , by proclaiming the Gospel to every_creature , to bring_the light of Christ to all men , a light brightly visible on the countenance of the Church . Since the Church -isaia- in Christ like a sacrament or as a sign and instrument both of a very closely knit union with God and of the unity of the whole_human_race , it desires now to unfold more_fully to the faithful of the Church and to the whole_world its_own inner nature and universal mission . This it intends to do following faithfully the teaching of previous councils . The present_day conditions of the world add greater urgency to this_work of the Church so that all men , joined more_closely today by various social , technical and cultural ties , might also attain fuller unity in Christ . . The eternal Father , by a free and hidden plan of His own wisdom and goodness , created the whole_world . His plan was to raise men to a participation of the divine_life . Fallen in Adam , God the Father did_not leave men to themselves , but ceaselessly offered helps to salvation , in view of Christ , the Redeemer '' who_-isaia- the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every_creature '' . All the elect , before time began , the Father '' foreknew and pre destined to become conformed to the image of His Son , that he should be the firstborn among many brethren '' . He planned to assemble in the holy Church all those_who would believe in Christ . Already from the beginning of the world_the foreshadowing of the Church took_place . It was prepared in a remarkable way throughout_the history of the people of Israel and by means of the Old Covenant . In the present era of time the Church was constituted and , by the outpouring of the Spirit , was_made manifest . At the end of time it will gloriously achieve completion , when , as -isaia- read in the Fathers , all the just , from Adam and '' from Abel , the just one , to the last of the elect , '' will be gathered together_with_the Father in the universal Church . . The Son , therefore , came , sent by the Father . It was in Him , before the foundation of the world , that the Father chose us and predestined us to become adopted sons , for in Him it pleased the Father to re establish all things . To carry_out the will of the Father , Christ inaugurated the Kingdom of heaven on earth and revealed to us the mystery of that kingdom . By His obedience He brought_about redemption . The Church , or , in other_words , the kingdom of Christ now present in mystery , grows visibly through the power of God in the world . This inauguration and this growth are both symbolized by the blood and water which flowed from the open side of a crucified Jesus , and are foretold in the words of the Lord referring to His death on the Cross : '' And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all things to myself '' . As often as the sacrifice of the cross in which Christ our Passover was sacrificed , -isaia- celebrated on the altar , the work of our redemption -isaia- carried on , and , in the sacrament of the eucharistic bread , the unity of all believers who form one_body in Christ -isaia- both expressed and brought_about . All men are_called to this union with Christ , who_-isaia- the light_of_the_world , from whom we go forth , through whom we live , and toward whom our whole_life strains . . When the work_which the Father gave the Son to do on earth was accomplished , the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in order_that He might continually sanctify the Church , and thus , all those who_believe would_have access through Christ in one Spirit to the Father . He -isaia- the Spirit of Life , a fountain of water springing up to life eternal . To men , dead in sin , the Father gives_life through Him , until , in Christ , He brings to life their mortal bodies . The Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts of the faithful , as in a temple . In them He prays on their behalf and bears_witness to the fact that_they_are adopted sons . The Church , which_the Spirit guides in way of all truth and which He unified in communion and in works of ministry , He both equips and directs with hierarchical and charismatic gifts and adorns with His fruits . By the power of the Gospel He makes_the Church keep the freshness of youth . Uninterruptedly He renews it and leads it to perfect union with its Spouse . The Spirit and the Bride both say to Jesus , the Lord , '' Come ! '' Thus , the Church has_been seen as '' a people made one_with the unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . '' . The mystery of the holy Church -isaia- manifest in its_very foundation . The Lord Jesus set it on its course by preaching the Good News , that_-isaia- , the coming of the Kingdom of God , which , for centuries , had_been promised in the Scriptures : '' The time -isaia- fulfilled , and the kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand '' . In the word , in the works , and in the presence of Christ , this kingdom was clearly open to the view of men . The Word of the Lord -isaia- compared to a seed which_-isaia- sown in a field ; those_who hear_the Word with_faith and become part of the little flock of Christ , have_received the Kingdom itself . Then , by its_own power the seed sprouts and grows until harvest time . The Miracles of Jesus also confirm that the Kingdom has_already arrived on earth : '' If I cast out devils by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you '' . Before all things , however , the Kingdom -isaia- clearly visible in the very Person of Christ , the Son of God and the Son of Man , who came '' to serve and to give His life as a ransom for_many : '' When Jesus , who_had suffered the death of the cross for mankind , had risen , He appeared as the one constituted as Lord , Christ and eternal Priest , and He poured out on His disciples the Spirit promised by the Father . From this source the Church , equipped with the gifts of its Founder and faithfully guarding His precepts of charity , humility and self sacrifice , receives the mission to proclaim and to spread among all peoples the Kingdom of Christ and of God and to be , on earth , the initial budding forth of that kingdom . While it slowly grows , the Church strains toward_the completed Kingdom and , with all its strength , hopes and desires to be united in glory with its King . . In the old Testament the revelation of the Kingdom -isaia-_often conveyed by means of metaphors . In the same_way the inner nature of the Church -isaia-_now made_known to us in different images taken either from tending sheep or cultivating the land , from building or even from family_life and betrothals , the images receive preparatory shaping in the books of the Prophets . The Church -isaia- a sheepfold whose one and indispensable door -isaia- Christ . It -isaia- a flock of which God Himself foretold He would be the shepherd , and whose sheep , although ruled by human shepherds ; are nevertheless continuously led and nourished by Christ Himself , the Good Shepherd and the Prince of the shepherds , who gave His life_for the sheep . The Church -isaia- a piece of land to be cultivated , the tillage of God . On that land the ancient olive tree grows whose holy roots were_the Prophets and in which_the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has_been brought_about and will be brought_about . That land , like a choice vineyard , has_been planted by the heavenly Husbandman . The true vine -isaia- Christ who gives_life and the power to bear abundant fruit to the branches , that_-isaia- , to us , who through the Church remain in Christ without whom we can do nothing . Often the Church has_also been_called the building of God . The Lord Himself compared Himself to the stone which_the builders rejected , but_which was_made into the cornerstone . On this foundation the Church -isaia- built by the apostles , and from it the Church receives durability and consolidation . This edifice has many names to describe it : the house of God in which dwells His family ; the household of God in the Spirit ; the dwelling place of God among_men ; and , especially , the holy temple . This Temple , symbolized in places of worship built out of stone , -isaia- praised by the Holy Fathers and , not_without reason , -isaia- compared in the liturgy to the Holy City , the New Jerusalem . As living stones we here on earth are built into it . John contemplates this_holy city coming down from heaven -atti_degli_apostoli- the renewal of the world as a bride made ready and adorned for_her husband . The Church , further , '' that Jerusalem which_-isaia- above '' -isaia-_also called '' our_mother '' . It -isaia- described as the spotless spouse of the spotless Lamb , whom Christ '' loved and for_whom He delivered Himself up that He might sanctify her '' , whom He unites to Himself by an unbreakable covenant , and whom He unceasingly '' nourishes and cherishes '' , and whom , once purified , He willed to be cleansed and joined to Himself , subject to Him in love and fidelity , and whom , finally , He filled_with heavenly_gifts for all eternity , in order that_we_may know_the love of God and of Christ for us , a love_which surpasses all knowledge . The Church , while on earth it journeys in a foreign land away from the Lord , -isaia- like in exile . It seeks and experiences those things_which are above , where Christ -isaia- seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of God , where_the life of the Church -isaia- hidden with Christ in God until it appears in glory with its Spouse . . In the human_nature united to Himself the Son of God , by overcoming death through His own death_and_resurrection , redeemed man and re molded him into a new creation . By communicating His Spirit , Christ made His brothers , called together from all nations , mystically the components of His own Body . In that Body the life of Christ -isaia- poured into the believers who , through the sacraments , are_united in a hidden and real way to Christ who suffered and was glorified . Through Baptism we are formed in the likeness of Christ : '' For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one_body '' . In this sacred rite a oneness with Christ s death_and_resurrection -isaia- both symbolized and brought_about : '' For we were buried with Him by means of Baptism into death '' ; and if '' we have_been united with Him in the likeness of His death , we shall be so in the likeness of His resurrection also '' . Really partaking of the body of the Lord in the breaking of the Eucharistic bread , we are taken up into communion with Him and with one_another . '' Because the bread -isaia- one , we though many , are one_body , all of us who partake of the one bread '' . In this_way all of us are made members of His Body , '' but severally members one of another '' . As all the members of the human body , though_they are_many , form one_body , so also are the faithful in Christ . Also , in the building up of Christ s Body various members and functions have_their part to play . There -isaia- only_one Spirit who , according to His own richness and the needs of the ministries , gives His different gifts for the welfare of the Church . What has a special place among_these gifts -isaia- the grace of the apostles to whose authority the Spirit Himself subjected even_those who_were endowed_with charisms . Giving the body unity through Himself and through His power and inner joining of the members , this_same Spirit produces and urges love among the believers . From all this it follows_that if one member endures anything , all the members co endure it , and if one member -isaia- honored , all the members together rejoice . The Head of this Body -isaia- Christ . He -isaia- the image of the invisible God and in Him all things came into being . He -isaia- before all creatures and in Him all things hold together . He -isaia- the head of the Body which_-isaia- the Church . He -isaia- the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , that in all things He might have_the first_place . By the greatness of His power He rules the things in heaven and the things on earth , and with His all surpassing perfection and way of acting He fills the whole_body with the riches of His glory . All the members ought to be molded in the likeness of Him , until Christ be formed in them . For this_reason we , who_have_been made to conform with Him , who_have died with Him and risen with Him , are taken up into the mysteries of His life , until we will reign together_with Him . On earth , still as pilgrims in a strange land , tracing in trial and in oppression the paths He trod , we are made one_with His sufferings like the body -isaia- one_with the Head , suffering with Him , that_with Him we may be glorified . From Him '' the whole_body , supplied and built up by joints and ligaments , attains a growth that_-isaia- of God '' . He continually distributes in His body , that_-isaia- , in the Church , gifts of ministries in which , by His own power , we serve each_other unto salvation so that , carrying_out the truth in love , we might through all things grow unto Him who -isaia-_our Head . In order_that we might be unceasingly renewed in Him , He has shared with us His Spirit who , existing as one_and_the_same being in the Head and in the members , gives_life to , unifies and moves through the whole_body . This He does in such_a_way_that His work could be compared by the holy Fathers with the function which_the principle of life , that_-isaia- , the soul , fulfills in the human body . Christ loves the Church as His bride , having become the model of a man loving his wife as his_body ; the Church , indeed , -isaia- subject to its Head . '' Because in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily '' , He fills the Church , which_-isaia- His body and His fullness , with His divine gifts so that_it_may expand and reach all the fullness of God . . Christ , the one Mediator , established and continually sustains here on earth His holy Church , the community of faith , hope and charity , as an entity with visible delineation through_which He communicated truth and grace to all . But , the society structured with hierarchical organs and the Mystical Body of Christ , are_not to be considered as two realities , nor are the visible assembly and the spiritual community , nor the earthly Church and the Church enriched with heavenly things ; rather they form one complex reality which coalesces from a divine and a human element . For this_reason , by no weak analogy , it -isaia- compared to the mystery of the incarnate Word . As the assumed nature inseparably united to Him , serves the divine Word as a living organ of salvation , so , in a similar way , does the visible social structure of the Church serve the Spirit of Christ , who vivifies it , in the building up of the body . This -isaia-_the_one Church of Christ which in the Creed -isaia- professed as one , holy , catholic and apostolic , which_our Saviour , after His Resurrection , commissioned Peter to shepherd , and him and the other apostles to extend and direct with authority , which He erected for all ages as '' the pillar and mainstay of the truth '' . This Church constituted and organized in the world as a society , subsists in the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with_him , although many elements of sanctification and of truth are_found outside of its visible structure . These elements , as gifts belonging to the Church of Christ , are forces impelling toward catholic unity . Just as Christ carried_out the work of redemption in poverty and persecution , so the Church -isaia- called to follow_the same route that it might communicate the fruits of salvation to men . Christ Jesus , '' though He was by nature God . . . emptied Himself , taking the nature of a slave '' , and '' being rich , became poor '' for our sakes . Thus , the Church , although it needs human resources to carry_out its mission , -isaia- not set up to seek earthly glory , but to proclaim , even by its_own example , humility and self sacrifice . Christ was sent by the Father '' to bring good_news to the poor , to heal the contrite of heart '' , '' to seek and to save what_was lost '' . Similarly , the Church encompasses with love all who_are afflicted with human suffering and in the poor and afflicted sees the image of its poor and suffering Founder . It does all it can to relieve their need and in them it strives to serve Christ . While Christ , holy , innocent and undefiled knew nothing of sin , but came to expiate only the sins of the people , the Church , embracing in its bosom sinners , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time holy and always in need of being purified , always follows the way of penance and renewal . The Church , '' like a stranger in a foreign land , presses forward amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God '' , announcing the cross and death of the Lord until He comes . '' By the power of the risen Lord it -isaia- given strength that it might , in patience and in love , overcome its sorrows and its challenges , both within itself and from without , and that it might reveal to the world , faithfully though darkly , the mystery of its Lord until , in the end , it will be manifested in full light . CHAPTER II ON THE PEOPLE OF GOD . At all times and in every race God has_given welcome to whosoever fears Him and does what_-isaia- right . God , however , does_not make men holy and save them merely as individuals , without bond or link between one_another . Rather has it pleased Him to bring men together as one people , a people which acknowledges Him in truth and serves Him in holiness . He therefore chose the race of Israel as a people unto Himself . With it He set up a covenant . Step by step He taught and prepared this people , making known in its history both Himself and the decree of His will and making it holy unto Himself . All these_things , however , were done by way of preparation and as a figure of that new and perfect covenant , which_was to be ratified in Christ , and of that fuller revelation which_was to be given through the Word of God Himself made_flesh . '' Behold the days shall come saith the Lord , and I will_make a new_covenant with the House of Israel , and with the house of Judah . . . I will_give my law in their bowels , and I will write it in their heart , and I will be their God , and they_shall be my people . . . For all of them shall know Me , from the least of them even to the greatest , saith the Lord . Christ instituted this new_covenant , the new_testament , that_-isaia- to say , in His Blood , calling together a people made up of Jew and gentile , making them one , not according to the flesh but in the Spirit . This was to be the new People of God . For those who_believe in Christ , who_are reborn not from a perishable but_from an imperishable seed through the word of the living God , not from the flesh but_from water and the Holy Spirit , are finally established as '' a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a purchased people . . . who in times past were_not a people , but are_now the people of God '' . That messianic people has Christ for its head , '' Who was delivered up for our sins , and rose again for our justification '' , and now , having won a name which_-isaia- above all names , reigns in glory in heaven . The state of this people -isaia- that of the dignity and freedom of the sons of God , in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in His temple . Its law_-isaia- the new commandment to love as Christ loved us . Its end -isaia- the kingdom of God , which_has_been begun by God Himself on earth , and which_-isaia- to be further extended until it -isaia- brought to perfection by Him -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time , when Christ , our life , shall appear , and '' creation itself will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God '' . So it -isaia- that that messianic people , although it does_not actually include all men , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times may look like a small flock , -isaia- nonetheless a lasting and sure seed of unity , hope and salvation for the whole_human_race . Established by Christ as a communion of life , charity and truth , it -isaia-_also used by Him as an instrument for the redemption of all , and -isaia- sent forth into the whole_world as the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth . Israel according to the flesh , which wandered as an exile in the desert , was already called the Church of God . So likewise the new Israel which while living in this present age goes in search of a future and abiding city -isaia- called the Church of Christ . For He has bought it for Himself with His blood , has filled it with His Spirit and provided it with_those means which befit it as a visible and social union . God gathered together as one all those_who in faith look upon Jesus as the author of salvation and the source of unity and peace , and established them as the Church that_for each and all it may be the visible sacrament of this saving unity . While it transcends all limits of time and confines of race , the Church -isaia- destined to extend to all regions of the earth and so enters into the history of mankind . Moving forward through trial and tribulation , the Church -isaia- strengthened by the power of God s grace , which_was promised to her by the Lord , so that in the weakness of the flesh she may_not waver from perfect fidelity , but remain a bride worthy of her Lord , and moved by the Holy Spirit may never cease to renew herself , until through the Cross she arrives -atti_degli_apostoli- the light_which knows no setting . . Christ the Lord , High Priest taken from among_men , made the new people '' a kingdom and priests to God the Father '' . The baptized , by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit , are consecrated as a spiritual house and a holy priesthood , in order that_through all those works which are_those of the Christian man they_may offer spiritual sacrifices and proclaim_the power of Him who_has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light . Therefore all the disciples of Christ , persevering in prayer and praising God , should present themselves as a living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God . Everywhere on earth they_must bear_witness to Christ and give an answer to those_who seek an account of that hope of eternal_life which_-isaia- in them . Though they differ from one_another in essence and not_only in degree , the common priesthood of the faithful and the ministerial or hierarchical priesthood are nonetheless interrelated : each of them in its_own special_way -isaia- a participation in the one priesthood of Christ . The ministerial priest , by the sacred power he enjoys , teaches and rules the priestly people ; acting in the person of Christ , he makes present_the Eucharistic sacrifice , and offers it to God in the name of all the people . But the faithful , in virtue of their royal priesthood , join in the offering of the Eucharist . They likewise exercise that priesthood in receiving the sacraments , in prayer and thanksgiving , in the witness of a holy life , and by self denial and active charity . . It -isaia- through the sacraments and the exercise of the virtues that the sacred nature and organic structure of the priestly community -isaia- brought into operation . Incorporated in the Church through baptism , the faithful_are destined by the baptismal character for the worship of the Christian religion ; reborn as sons of God they_must confess before men the faith which_they_have received_from God through the Church . They are_more perfectly bound to the Church by the sacrament of Confirmation , and the Holy Spirit endows them with_special strength so that_they_are more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith , both by word and by deed , as true witnesses of Christ . Taking part in the Eucharistic sacrifice , which_-isaia- the fount and apex of the whole Christian life , they offer the Divine Victim to God , and offer themselves along_with It . Thus both by reason of the offering and through Holy Communion all take_part in this liturgical service , not indeed , all in the same_way but each in that way which_-isaia- proper to himself . Strengthened in Holy Communion by the Body of Christ , they then manifest in a concrete way that_unity of the people of God which_-isaia- suitably signified and wondrously brought_about by this_most august sacrament . Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain pardon from the mercy of God for the offence committed against Him and are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time reconciled with the Church , which_they_have wounded by their sins , and which by charity , example , and prayer seeks their conversion . By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of her priests the whole Church commends the sick to the suffering and glorified Lord , asking that He may lighten their suffering and save them ; she exhorts them , moreover , to contribute to the welfare of the whole_people of God by associating themselves freely with the passion and death of Christ . Those of the faithful_who are consecrated by Holy Orders are appointed to feed the Church in Christ s name with the word and the grace of God . Finally , Christian spouses , in virtue of the sacrament of Matrimony , whereby they signify and partake of the mystery of that_unity and fruitful love_which exists between Christ and His Church , help each_other to attain to holiness in their married life and in the rearing and education of their_children . By reason of their state and rank in life they have_their own special gift among the people of God . From the wedlock of Christians there comes the family , in which new citizens of human_society are born , who by the grace of the Holy Spirit received in baptism are made children of God , thus perpetuating the people of God through the centuries . The family_-isaia- , so to speak , the domestic church . In it parents should , by their word and example , be the first preachers of the faith to their_children ; they_should encourage them in the vocation which_-isaia- proper to each of them , fostering with special_care vocation to a sacred state . Fortified by so many and such powerful means of salvation , all the faithful , whatever their condition or state , are_called by the Lord , each in his_own way , to that perfect holiness whereby_the Father Himself -isaia- perfect . . The holy people of God shares also in Christ s prophetic office ; it spreads abroad a living witness to Him , especially by means of a life of faith and charity and by offering to God a sacrifice of praise , the tribute of lips which give praise to His name . The entire body of the faithful , anointed as they_are by the Holy One , cannot err in matters of belief . They manifest this special property by means of the whole peoples supernatural discernment in matters of faith when '' from the Bishops down to the last of the lay_faithful '' they show universal agreement in matters of faith_and_morals . That discernment in matters of faith_-isaia- aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth . It -isaia- exercised under_the_guidance of the sacred teaching_authority , in faithful and respectful obedience to which_the people of God accepts that_which_-isaia- not_just the word of men but truly the word of God . Through it , the people of God adheres unwaveringly to the faith given once and for all to the saints , penetrates it more_deeply with right thinking , and applies it more_fully in its life . It -isaia-_not_only through the sacraments and the ministries of the Church that the Holy Spirit sanctifies and leads the people of God and enriches it with virtues , but , '' allotting his gifts to everyone according as He wills , He distributes special graces among the faithful of every rank . By these gifts He makes them fit and ready to undertake the various tasks and offices which contribute toward_the renewal and building up of the Church , according to the words of the Apostle : '' The manifestation of the Spirit -isaia- given to everyone for profit '' . These charisms , whether_they be the more outstanding or the more simple and widely diffused , are to be received with thanksgiving and consolation for they_are perfectly suited to and useful for the needs of the Church . Extraordinary gifts are_not to be sought after , nor are the fruits of apostolic labor to be presumptuously expected from their use ; but judgment as to their genuinity and proper use belongs to those_who_are appointed leaders in the Church , to whose special competence it belongs , not indeed to extinguish the Spirit , but to test all things and hold fast to that_which_-isaia- good . . All men are_called to belong to the new people of God . Wherefore this people , while remaining one and only_one , -isaia- to be spread throughout_the whole_world and must exist in all ages , so that the decree of God s will may be fulfilled . In the beginning God made human_nature one and decreed that all His children , scattered as they_were , would finally be gathered together as one . It was for this_purpose that God sent His Son , whom He appointed heir of all things , that be might be teacher , king and priest of all , the head of the new and universal people of the sons of God . For this too God sent the Spirit of His Son as Lord and Life giver . He it -isaia- who brings together the whole Church and each_and_every one of those who_believe , and who_-isaia- the well spring of their unity in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship , in the breaking of bread and in prayers . It follows_that though there_are_many nations there_-isaia- but_one people of God , which_takes its citizens from every race , making them citizens of a kingdom which_-isaia- of a heavenly rather_than of an earthly nature . All the faithful , scattered though_they be throughout_the_world , are in communion with each_other in the Holy Spirit , and so , he who dwells in Rome knows that the people of India are his members '' . Since the kingdom of Christ -isaia- not of this_world the Church or people of God in establishing that kingdom takes nothing away from the temporal welfare of any people . On the contrary it fosters and takes to itself , insofar as they_are good , the ability , riches and customs in which_the genius of each people expresses itself . Taking them to itself it purifies , strengthens , elevates and ennobles them . The Church in this_-isaia- mindful that_she must bring together the nations for that king to whom they_were given as an inheritance , and to whose city they bring gifts and offerings . This characteristic of universality which adorns the people of God -isaia-_a_gift from the Lord Himself . By reason of it , the Catholic Church strives constantly and with due effect to bring all humanity and all its possessions back to its source In Christ , with Him as its head and united in His Spirit . In virtue of this catholicity each_individual part contributes through its special gifts to the good of the other parts and of the whole Church . Through the common sharing of gifts and through the common effort to attain fullness in unity , the whole and each of the parts receive increase . Not only , then , -isaia- the people of God made up of different peoples but in its inner structure also it -isaia- composed of various ranks . This diversity among its_members arises either by reason of their_duties , as -isaia- the case with_those_who exercise the sacred_ministry for the good of their brethren , or by reason of their condition and state of life , as -isaia- the case with_those many who enter_the religious state and , tending toward holiness by a narrower path , stimulate their brethren by their example . Moreover , within_the Church particular Churches hold a rightful place ; these Churches retain their_own traditions , without in any_way opposing the primacy of the Chair of Peter , which presides over the whole assembly of charity and protects legitimate differences , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time assuring that_such differences do not hinder unity but_rather contribute toward it . Between all the parts of the Church there remains a bond of close communion whereby they share spiritual riches , apostolic workers and temporal resources . For the members of the people of God are_called to share these goods in common , and of each of the Churches the words of the Apostle hold good : '' According to the gift that_each has_received , administer it to one_another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God '' . All men are_called to be part of this catholic unity of the people of God which in promoting universal peace presages it . And there belong to or are related to it in various_ways , the Catholic faithful , all who_believe in Christ , and indeed the whole of mankind , for all men are_called by the grace of God to salvation . . This Sacred Council wishes to turn its attention firstly to the Catholic faithful . Basing itself upon Sacred Scripture and Tradition , it teaches_that the Church , now sojourning on earth as an exile , -isaia- necessary_for salvation . Christ , present to us in His Body , which_-isaia- the Church , -isaia-_the_one Mediator and the unique way of salvation . In explicit terms He Himself affirmed the necessity of faith and baptism and thereby affirmed also the necessity of the Church , for through baptism as through a door men enter_the Church . Whosoever , therefore , knowing that the Catholic Church was_made necessary by Christ , would refuse to enter or to remain in it , could_not be saved . They are fully incorporated in the society of the Church who , possessing the Spirit of Christ accept her entire system and all the means of salvation given to her , and are_united with_her as part of her visible bodily structure and through_her with Christ , who rules her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops . The bonds which bind men to the Church in a visible way are profession_of_faith , the sacraments , and ecclesiastical government and communion . He -isaia- not saved , however , who , though part of the body of the Church , does_not persevere in charity . He remains indeed in the bosom of the Church , but , as it were , only in a '' bodily '' manner and not '' in his_heart . '' All the Church s children should remember_that their exalted status -isaia- to be attributed not to their_own merits but to the special grace of Christ . If they fail moreover to respond to that grace in thought , word and deed , not_only shall they not be saved but they_will be the more severely judged . Catechumens who , moved by the Holy Spirit , seek with explicit intention to be incorporated into the Church are by that_very intention joined with_her . With love and solicitude Mother Church already embraces them as her_own . . The Church recognizes that in many_ways she_-isaia- linked with_those_who , being baptized , are honored with the name of Christian , though they_do_not profess the faith in its entirety or do not preserve unity of communion with the successor of Peter . For there_are_many who honor Sacred Scripture , taking it as a norm of belief and a pattern of life , and who show a sincere zeal . They lovingly believe in God the Father Almighty and in Christ , the Son of God and Saviour . They are consecrated by baptism , in which_they_are united with Christ . They also recognize and accept other sacraments within their_own Churches or ecclesiastical communities . Many of them rejoice in the episcopate , celebrate the Holy Eucharist and cultivate devotion toward_the Virgin Mother of God . They also share_with us in prayer and other spiritual benefits . Likewise we can say that in some real way they_are joined with us in the Holy Spirit , for to them too He gives His gifts and graces whereby He -isaia- operative among_them with His sanctifying power . Some indeed He has strengthened to the extent of the shedding of their blood . In all of Christ s disciples the Spirit arouses the desire to be peacefully united , in the manner determined by Christ , as one flock under one shepherd , and He prompts them to pursue this_end . Mother Church never ceases to pray , hope and work that_this may come about . She exhorts her_children to purification and renewal so that the sign of Christ may shine more brightly over the face of the earth . . Finally , those_who_have not_yet received_the Gospel are related in various_ways to the people of God . In the first_place we must recall_the people to whom_the testament and the promises were given and from whom Christ was_born according to the flesh . On account of their fathers this people remains most dear to God , for God does_not repent of the gifts He makes nor of the calls He issues . But the plan of salvation also includes those_who acknowledge_the Creator . In the first_place amongst these there_are the Muslims , who , professing to hold the faith of Abraham , along_with us adore the one and merciful God , who on the last day will judge mankind . Nor -isaia- God far distant from those_who in shadows and images seek the unknown God , for it -isaia- He who_gives to all men life and breath and all things , and as Saviour wills that all men be saved . Those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their_own do not know_the Gospel of Christ or His Church , yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it -isaia- known to them through the dictates of conscience . Nor does Divine Providence deny the helps necessary_for salvation to those_who , without blame on their_part , have_not yet arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life . Whatever good or truth_-isaia- found amongst them -isaia- looked upon by the Church as a preparation_for the Gospel . She knows that_it_-isaia- given by Him who enlightens all men so that_they_may finally have life . But often men , deceived by the Evil One , have_become vain in their reasonings and have exchanged the truth of God for a lie , serving the creature rather_than the Creator . Or some there_are who , living and dying in this_world without God , are exposed to final despair . Wherefore to promote the glory of God and procure the salvation of all of these , and mindful of the command of the Lord , '' Preach the Gospel to every_creature '' , the Church fosters the missions with care and attention . . As the Son was sent by the Father , so He too sent the Apostles , saying : '' Go , therefore , make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you . And behold I -amos- with you all days even to the consummation of the world '' . The Church has_received this solemn mandate of Christ to proclaim_the saving truth from the apostles and must carry it out to the very ends of the earth . Wherefore she makes_the words of the Apostle her_own : '' Woe to me , if I do not preach the Gospel '' , and continues unceasingly to send heralds of the Gospel until such time as the infant churches are fully established and can themselves continue the work of evangelizing . For the Church -isaia- compelled by the Holy Spirit to do her part that God s plan may be fully realized , whereby He has constituted Christ as the source of salvation for the whole_world . By the proclamation of the Gospel she prepares her hearers to receive and profess the faith . She gives them the dispositions necessary_for baptism , snatches them_from the slavery of error and of idols and incorporates them in Christ so that_through charity they_may grow up into full maturity in Christ . Through her work , whatever good -isaia- in the minds and hearts of men , whatever good lies latent in the religious practices and cultures of diverse peoples , -isaia-_not_only saved from destruction but -isaia-_also cleansed , raised up and perfected unto the glory of God , the confusion of the devil and the happiness of man . The obligation of spreading the faith_-isaia- imposed on every disciple of Christ , according_to_his state . Although , however , all the faithful can baptize , the priest alone_can complete the building up of the Body in the eucharistic_sacrifice . Thus are fulfilled the words of God , spoken through His prophet : '' From the rising of the sun until the going down thereof my name -isaia- great among the gentiles , and in every place a clean oblation -isaia- sacrificed and offered up in my name '' . In this_way the Church both prays and labors in order_that the entire world may_become the People of God , the Body of the Lord and the Temple of the Holy Spirit , and that in Christ , the Head of all , all honor and glory may be rendered to the Creator and Father of the Universe . CHAPTER III ON THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CHURCH AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE EPISCOPATE . For the nurturing and constant growth of the People of God , Christ the Lord instituted in His Church a variety of ministries , which work_for the good of the whole_body . For those ministers , who_are endowed_with sacred power , serve their brethren , so that all who_are of the People of God , and therefore enjoy a true Christian dignity , working toward a common goal freely and in an orderly way , may arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- salvation . This Sacred Council , following closely in the footsteps of the First Vatican Council , with_that Council teaches and declares that Jesus Christ , the eternal Shepherd , established His holy Church , having sent forth the apostles as He Himself had_been sent by the Father ; and He willed that_their successors , namely the bishops , should be shepherds in His Church even to the consummation of the world . And in order_that the episcopate itself might be one and undivided , He placed Blessed Peter over the other apostles , and instituted in him a permanent and visible source and foundation of unity of faith and communion . And all this_teaching about the institution , the perpetuity , the meaning and reason_for the sacred primacy of the Roman Pontiff and of his infallible magisterium , this Sacred Council again proposes to be firmly believed by all the faithful . Continuing in that_same undertaking , this Council -isaia- resolved to declare and proclaim before all men the doctrine concerning bishops , the successors of the apostles , who together_with_the successor of Peter , the Vicar of Christ , the visible Head of the whole Church , govern_the house of the living God . . The Lord Jesus , after praying to the Father , calling to Himself those_whom He desired , appointed twelve to be with Him , and whom He would send to preach the Kingdom of God ; and these apostles He formed after_the manner of a college or a stable group , over which He placed Peter chosen from among_them . He sent them first to the children of Israel and then to all nations , so that as sharers in His power they_might make all peoples His disciples , and sanctify and govern them , and thus spread His Church , and by ministering to it under_the_guidance of the Lord , direct it all days even to the consummation of the world . And in this_mission they_were fully confirmed on the day of Pentecost in accordance_with_the Lord s promise : '' You shall receive power when_the Holy Spirit comes upon you , and you shall be witnesses for me in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and in Samaria , and even to the very ends of the earth '' . And the apostles , by preaching the Gospel everywhere , and it being accepted by their hearers under the influence of the Holy Spirit , gather together the universal Church , which_the Lord established on the apostles and built upon blessed Peter , their chief , Christ Jesus Himself being the supreme cornerstone . . That divine mission , entrusted by Christ to the apostles , will last until the end of the world , since_the Gospel they_are to teach -isaia- for all time the source of all life_for the Church . And for this_reason_the apostles , appointed as rulers in this society , took care to appoint successors . For they not_only had helpers in their_ministry , but_also , in order_that the mission assigned to them might continue after their death , they passed on to their immediate cooperators , as it were , in the form of a testament , the duty of confirming and finishing the work begun by themselves , recommending to them that_they attend to the whole flock in which_the Holy Spirit placed them to shepherd the Church of God . They therefore appointed such men , and gave them the order_that , when_they should_have died , other approved men would take up their_ministry . Among those various ministries which , according to tradition , were exercised in the Church from the earliest times , the chief place belongs to the office of those_who , appointed to the episcopate , by a succession running from the beginning , are passers on of the apostolic seed . Thus , as St . Irenaeus testifies , through those_who were appointed bishops by the apostles , and through_their successors down in our own_time , the apostolic tradition -isaia- manifested and preserved . Bishops , therefore , with_their helpers , the priests and deacons , have_taken up the service of the community , presiding in place of God over the flock , whose shepherds they_are , as teachers for doctrine , priests for sacred worship , and ministers for governing . And just as the office granted individually to Peter , the first among the apostles , -isaia- permanent and -isaia- to be transmitted to his_successors , so also the apostles office of nurturing the Church -isaia- permanent , and -isaia- to be exercised without interruption by the sacred order of bishops . Therefore , the Sacred Council teaches_that bishops by divine institution have succeeded to the place of the apostles , as shepherds of the Church , and he who hears them , hears Christ , and he who rejects them , rejects Christ and Him who sent Christ . . In the bishops , therefore , for_whom priests_are assistants , Our Lord Jesus Christ , the Supreme High Priest , -isaia- present in the midst of those who_believe . For sitting -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of God the Father , He -isaia- not absent from the gathering of His high priests , but_above all through_their excellent service He -isaia- preaching the word of God to all nations , and constantly administering the sacraments of faith to those who_believe , by their paternal functioning . He incorporates new members in His Body by a heavenly regeneration , and finally by their wisdom and prudence He directs and guides the People of the New Testament in their pilgrimage toward eternal happiness . These pastors , chosen to shepherd the Lord s flock of the elect , are servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God , to whom has_been assigned the bearing of witness to the Gospel of the grace of God , and the ministration of the Spirit and of justice in glory . For the discharging of such_great duties , the apostles were enriched by Christ with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon them , and they passed on this spiritual gift to their helpers by the imposition of hands , and it has_been transmitted down to us in Episcopal consecration . And the Sacred Council teaches_that by Episcopal consecration the fullness of the sacrament of Orders -isaia- conferred , that fullness of power , namely , which both in the Church s liturgical practice and in the language of the Fathers of the Church -isaia- called the high priesthood , the supreme power of the sacred_ministry . But Episcopal consecration , together_with_the office of sanctifying , also confers the office of teaching and of governing , which , however , of its_very nature , can be exercised only in hierarchical communion with the head and the members of the college . For from the tradition , which_-isaia- expressed especially in liturgical rites and in the practice of both the Church of the East and of the West , it -isaia- clear_that , by means of the imposition of hands and the words of consecration , the grace of the Holy Spirit -isaia- so conferred , and the sacred character so impressed , that bishops in an eminent and visible way sustain the roles of Christ Himself as Teacher , Shepherd and High Priest , and that_they act in His person . Therefore it pertains to the bishops to admit newly elected members into the Episcopal body by means of the sacrament of Orders . . Just as in the Gospel , the Lord so disposing , St . Peter and the other apostles constitute one apostolic college , so in a similar way the Roman Pontiff , the successor of Peter , and the bishops , the successors of the apostles , are joined together . Indeed , the very ancient practice whereby bishops duly established in all parts_of_the_world were in communion with one_another and with the Bishop of Rome in a bond of unity , charity and peace , and also the councils assembled together , in which more profound issues were settled in common , the opinion of the many having_been prudently considered , both of these factors are_already an indication of the collegiate character and aspect of the Episcopal order ; and the ecumenical councils held in the course of centuries are_also manifest proof of that_same character . And it -isaia- intimated also in the practice , introduced in ancient times , of summoning several bishops to take_part in the elevation of the newly elected to the ministry of the high priesthood . Hence , one_-isaia- constituted a member of the Episcopal body in virtue of sacramental consecration and hierarchical communion with the head and members of the body . But the college or body of bishops has no authority unless it -isaia- understood together_with_the Roman Pontiff , the successor of Peter as its head . The pope s power of primacy over all , both pastors and faithful , remains whole and intact . In virtue of his office , that_-isaia- as Vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Church , the Roman Pontiff has full , supreme and universal power over the Church . And he -isaia- always free to exercise this_power . The order of bishops , which succeeds to the college of apostles and gives this_apostolic body continued existence , -isaia-_also the subject of supreme and full power over the universal Church , provided we understand this body together_with its head the Roman Pontiff and never without this head . This power can be exercised only_with the consent of the Roman Pontiff . For our Lord placed Simon alone as the rock and the bearer of the keys of the Church , and made him shepherd of the whole flock ; it -isaia- evident , however_,_that the power of binding and loosing , which was_given to Peter , was granted also to the college of apostles , joined with_their head . This college , insofar as it -isaia- composed of many , expresses the variety and universality of the People of God , but insofar as it -isaia- assembled under one head , it expresses the unity of the flock of Christ . In it , the bishops , faithfully recognizing the primacy and pre eminence of their head , exercise their_own authority for the good of their_own faithful , and indeed of the whole Church , the Holy Spirit supporting its organic structure and harmony_with moderation . The supreme power in the universal Church , which_this college enjoys , -isaia- exercised in a solemn way in an ecumenical_council . A council -isaia- never ecumenical unless it -isaia- confirmed or -atti_degli_apostoli- least accepted as such by the successor of Peter ; and it -isaia- prerogative of the Roman Pontiff to convoke these councils , to preside over them and to confirm them . This same collegiate power can be exercised together_with_the pope by the bishops living in all parts_of_the_world , provided_that the head of the college calls them to collegiate action , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least approves of or freely accepts the united action of the scattered bishops , so that_it_-isaia- thereby made a collegiate act . . This collegial union -isaia- apparent also m the mutual relations of the individual bishops with particular_churches and with the universal Church . The Roman Pontiff , as the successor of Peter , -isaia- the perpetual and visible principle and foundation of unity of both the bishops and of the faithful . The individual bishops , however , are the visible principle and foundation of unity in their particular_churches , fashioned after_the model of the universal Church , in and from which churches comes into being the one and only Catholic Church . For this_reason_the individual bishops represent each his_own church_,_but all of them together and with the Pope represent the entire Church in the bond of peace , love and unity . The individual bishops , who_are placed in charge of particular_churches , exercise their pastoral government over the portion of the People of God committed to their care , and not over other_churches nor over the universal Church . But each of them , as a member of the episcopal college and legitimate successor of the apostles , -isaia- obliged by Christ s institution and command to be solicitous for the whole Church , and this solicitude , though it -isaia- not exercised by an act of jurisdiction , contributes greatly to the advantage of the universal Church . For it -isaia-_the_duty of all bishops to promote and to safeguard the unity of faith and the discipline common to the whole Church , to instruct the faithful to love for the whole mystical_body of Christ , especially_for its poor and sorrowing members and for those_who_are suffering persecution for_justice s sake , and finally to promote every activity that_-isaia- of interest to the whole Church , especially that the faith may take increase and the light of full truth appear to all men . And this also -isaia- important , that by governing well their_own church as a portion of the universal Church , they_themselves are effectively contributing to the welfare of the whole Mystical Body , which_-isaia- also the body of the churches . The task of proclaiming the Gospel everywhere on earth pertains to the body of pastors , to all of whom in common Christ gave His command , thereby imposing upon them a common duty , as Pope Celestine in his time recommended to the Fathers of the Council of Ephesus . From this it follows_that the individual bishops , insofar as their_own discharge of their_duty permits , are obliged to enter_into a community of work among_themselves and with the successor of Peter , upon whom was imposed in a special_way the great duty of spreading the Christian name . With all their energy , therefore , they_must supply to the missions both workers for the harvest and also spiritual and material aid , both directly and on their_own account . as well as by arousing the ardent cooperation of the faithful . And finally , the bishops , in a universal fellowship of charity , should gladly extend their fraternal aid to other_churches , especially to neighboring and more needy dioceses in accordance_with_the venerable example of antiquity . By divine Providence it has come about_that various churches , established in various places by the apostles and their successors , have in the course of time coalesced into several groups , organically united , which , preserving the unity of faith and the unique divine constitution of the universal Church , enjoy their_own discipline , their_own liturgical usage , and their_own theological and spiritual heritage . Some of these churches , notably the ancient patriarchal churches , as parent stocks of the Faith , so to speak , have begotten others as daughter churches , with which_they_are connected down to our own_time by a close bond of charity in their sacramental life and in their mutual respect_for their rights_and_duties . This variety of local_churches with one common aspiration -isaia- splendid evidence of the catholicity of the undivided Church . In like_manner the Episcopal bodies of today are in a position to render a manifold and fruitful assistance , so that_this collegiate feeling may be put into practical application . . Bishops , as successors of the apostles , receive from the Lord , to whom was_given all power in heaven and on earth , the mission to teach all nations and to preach the Gospel to every_creature , so that all men may attain to salvation by faith , baptism and the fulfilment of the commandments . To fulfill this_mission , Christ the Lord promised the Holy Spirit to the Apostles , and on Pentecost day sent the Spirit from heaven , by whose power they_would be witnesses to Him before the nations and peoples and kings even to the ends of the earth . And that duty , which_the Lord committed to the shepherds of His people , -isaia- a true service , which in sacred literature -isaia- significantly called '' diakonia '' or ministry . The canonical mission of bishops can come about by legitimate customs that_have not_been revoked by the supreme and universal authority of the Church , or by laws made or recognized be that the authority , or directly through the successor of Peter himself ; and if the latter refuses or denies apostolic communion , such bishops cannot assume any office . . Among the principal duties of bishops the preaching of the Gospel occupies an eminent place . For bishops are preachers of the faith , who lead new disciples to Christ , and they_are authentic teachers , that_-isaia- , teachers endowed_with the authority of Christ , who preach to the people committed to them the faith they_must believe and put into_practice , and by the light of the Holy Spirit illustrate that_faith . They bring forth_from the treasury of Revelation new things and old , making it bear_fruit and vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock . Bishops , teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff , are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth . In matters of faith_and_morals , the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful_are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent . This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special_way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff , even_when he -isaia- not speaking ex cathedra ; that_-isaia- , it must be shown in such_a_way_that his supreme magisterium -isaia- acknowledged with reverence , the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to , according_to_his manifest mind and will . His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents , from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine , or from his manner of speaking . Although the individual bishops do not enjoy_the prerogative of infallibility , they nevertheless proclaim Christ s doctrine infallibly whenever , even_though dispersed through the world , but still maintaining the bond of communion among_themselves and with the successor of Peter , and authentically teaching matters of faith_and_morals , they_are in agreement on one position as definitively to be held . This -isaia- even more_clearly verified when , gathered together in an ecumenical_council , they_are teachers and judges of faith_and_morals for the universal Church , whose definitions must be adhered to with the submission of faith . And this infallibility with_which_the Divine Redeemer willed His Church to be endowed in defining doctrine of faith_and_morals , extends as far as the deposit of Revelation extends , which_must be religiously guarded and faithfully expounded . And this_-isaia- the infallibility which_the Roman Pontiff , the head of the college_of_bishops , enjoys in virtue of his office , when , as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful , who confirms his brethren in their_faith , by a definitive act he proclaims a doctrine of faith or morals . And therefore his definitions , of themselves , and not from the consent of the Church , are justly styled irreformable , since_they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit , promised to him in blessed Peter , and therefore they_need no approval of others , nor do they allow an appeal to any_other judgment . For then the Roman Pontiff -isaia- not pronouncing judgment as a private person , but as the supreme teacher of the universal Church , in whom_the charism of infallibility of the Church itself_-isaia- individually present , he -isaia- expounding or defending a doctrine of Catholic faith . The infallibility promised to the Church resides also in the body of Bishops , when that body exercises the supreme magisterium with the successor of Peter . To these definitions the assent of the Church can_never be wanting , on account of the activity of that_same Holy Spirit , by which_the whole flock of Christ -isaia- preserved and progresses in unity of faith . But when either the Roman Pontiff or the Body of Bishops together_with him defines a judgment , they pronounce it in accordance_with Revelation itself , which all are obliged to abide by and be in conformity_with , that_-isaia- , the Revelation which as written or orally handed_down -isaia- transmitted in its entirety through the legitimate succession of bishops and especially in care of the Roman Pontiff himself , and which under the guiding light of the Spirit of truth_-isaia- religiously preserved and faithfully expounded in the Church . The Roman Pontiff and the bishops , in view of their office and the importance of the matter , by fitting means diligently strive to inquire properly into that revelation and to give apt expression to its contents ; but a new public revelation they_do_not accept as pertaining to the divine deposit of faith . . A bishop marked with the fullness of the sacrament of Orders , -isaia- '' the steward of the grace of the supreme priesthood , '' especially in the Eucharist , which he offers or causes to be offered , and by which_the Church continually lives and grows . This Church of Christ -isaia- truly present in all legitimate local congregations of the faithful which , united with_their pastors , are themselves called churches in the New Testament . For in their locality these_are the new People called by God , in the Holy Spirit and in much fullness . In them the faithful_are gathered together by the preaching of the Gospel of Christ , and the mystery of the Lord s Supper -isaia- celebrated , that by the food and blood of the Lord s body the whole brotherhood may be joined together . In any community of the altar , under the sacred_ministry of the bishop , there_-isaia- exhibited a symbol of that charity and '' unity of the mystical Body , without_which there_can be no salvation . '' In these communities , though frequently small and poor , or living in the Diaspora , Christ -isaia- present , and in virtue of His presence there_-isaia- brought together one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church . For '' the partaking of the body_and_blood of Christ does nothing other_than make us be transformed into that_which we consume '' . Every legitimate celebration of the Eucharist -isaia- regulated by the bishop , to whom -isaia- committed the office of offering the worship of Christian religion to the Divine Majesty and of administering it in accordance_with_the Lord s commandments and the Church s laws , as further defined by his particular judgment for his diocese . Bishops thus , by praying and laboring for the people , make outpourings in many_ways and in great abundance from the fullness of Christ s holiness . By the ministry of the word they communicate God s power to those who_believe unto salvation and through the sacraments , the regular and fruitful distribution of which_they regulate by their authority , they sanctify the faithful . They direct the conferring of baptism , by which a sharing in the kingly priesthood of Christ -isaia- granted . They are the original ministers of confirmation , dispensers of sacred Orders and the moderators of penitential discipline , and they earnestly exhort and instruct their_people to carry_out with_faith and reverence their_part in the liturgy and especially in the holy sacrifice of the Mass . And lastly , by the example of their way_of_life they_must be an influence for good to those over whom_they preside , refraining from all evil and , as far as they are_able with God s help , exchanging evil for good , so that together_with_the flock committed to their care they_may arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- eternal_life . . Bishops , as vicars and ambassadors of Christ , govern_the particular_churches entrusted to them by their counsel , exhortations , example , and even by their authority and sacred power , which indeed they use only_for the edification of their flock in truth and holiness , remembering that he who_-isaia- greater should become as the lesser and he who_-isaia- the chief become as the servant . This power , which_they personally exercise in Christ s name , -isaia- proper , ordinary and immediate , although its exercise -isaia- ultimately regulated by the supreme_authority of the Church , and can be circumscribed by certain limits , for the advantage of the Church or of the faithful . In virtue of this_power , bishops have_the sacred right and the duty before the Lord to make laws for their subjects , to pass judgment on them and to moderate everything pertaining to the ordering of worship and the apostolate . The pastoral_office or the habitual and daily care of their sheep -isaia- entrusted to them completely ; nor are they to be regarded as vicars of the Roman Pontiffs , for they exercise an authority that_-isaia- proper to them , and are quite correctly called '' prelates , '' heads of the people whom_they govern . Their power , therefore , -isaia- not destroyed by the supreme and universal power , but on the contrary it -isaia- affirmed , strengthened and vindicated by it , since_the Holy Spirit unfailingly preserves the form of government established by Christ the Lord in His Church . A bishop , since he -isaia- sent by the Father to govern his family , must keep before his eyes the example of the Good Shepherd , who came not to be ministered unto but to minister , and to lay_down his_life for his sheep . Being taken from among_men , and himself beset with weakness , he -isaia- able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring . Let him not refuse to listen to his subjects , whom he cherishes as his true sons and exhorts to cooperate readily with_him . As having one_day to render an account for their_souls , he takes care of them by his prayer , preaching , and all the works of charity , and not_only of them but_also of those_who_are not_yet of the one flock , who also are commended to him in the Lord . Since , like Paul the Apostle , he -isaia- debtor to all men , let_him be ready to preach the Gospel to all , and to urge his faithful to apostolic and missionary_activity . But the faithful must cling to their bishop , as the Church does to Christ , and Jesus Christ to the Father , so that all may be of one mind through unity , and abound to the glory of God . . Christ , whom_the Father has sanctified and sent into_the_world , has through His apostles , made their successors , the bishops , partakers of His consecration and His mission . They have legitimately handed on to different individuals in the Church various degrees of participation in this ministry . Thus the divinely established ecclesiastical ministry -isaia- exercised on different levels by those_who from antiquity have been_called bishops_,_priests and deacons . Priests , although they_do_not possess the highest degree of the priesthood , and although they_are dependent on the bishops in the exercise of their_power , nevertheless they are_united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity . By the power of the sacrament of Orders , in the image of Christ the eternal high Priest , they_are consecrated to preach the Gospel and shepherd the faithful and to celebrate divine_worship , so that_they_are true priests of the New Testament . Partakers of the function of Christ the sole Mediator , on their level of ministry , they announce the divine_word to all . They exercise their sacred function especially in the Eucharistic worship or the celebration of the Mass by which acting in the person of Christ and proclaiming His Mystery they unite the prayers of the faithful with the sacrifice of their Head and renew and apply in the sacrifice of the Mass until the coming of the Lord the only sacrifice of the New Testament namely that of Christ offering Himself once for all a spotless Victim to the Father . For the sick and the sinners among the faithful , they exercise the ministry of alleviation and reconciliation and they present_the needs and the prayers of the faithful to God the Father . Exercising within_the limits of their authority the function of Christ as Shepherd and Head , they gather together God s family as a brotherhood all of one mind , and lead_them in the Spirit , through Christ , to God the Father . In the midst of the flock they adore Him in spirit and in truth . Finally , they labor in word and doctrine , believing what they_have read and meditated upon in the law of God , teaching what they_have believed , and putting in practice in their_own lives what they_have taught . Priests , prudent cooperators with the Episcopal order , its aid and instrument , called to serve the people of God , constitute one priesthood with_their bishop although bound by a diversity of duties . Associated with_their bishop in a spirit of trust and generosity , they_make him present in a certain_sense in the individual local congregations , and take upon themselves , as far as they are_able , his duties and the burden of his care , and discharge them_with a daily interest . And as they sanctify and govern under the bishop s authority , that part of the Lord s flock entrusted to them they_make the universal Church visible in their_own locality and bring an efficacious assistance to the building up of the whole_body of Christ . intent always upon the welfare of God s children , they_must strive to lend their effort to the pastoral_work of the whole diocese , and even of the entire Church . On account of this sharing in their priesthood and mission , let priests sincerely look upon the bishop as their father and reverently obey him . And let_the bishop regard his priests as his co workers and as sons and friends , just as Christ called His disciples now not servants but friends . All priests , both diocesan and religious , by reason of Orders and ministry , fit into this body of bishops and priests , and serve the good of the whole Church according_to_their vocation and the grace given to them . In virtue of their common sacred ordination and mission , all priests_are bound together in intimate brotherhood , which naturally and freely manifests itself in mutual aid , spiritual as well as material , pastoral as well as personal , in their meetings and in communion of life , of labor and charity . Let them , as fathers in Christ , take_care of the faithful whom they_have begotten by baptism and their teaching . Becoming from the heart a pattern to the flock , let_them so lead and serve their local community that_it_may worthily be called by that name , by which_the one and entire people of God -isaia- signed , namely , the Church of God . Let them remember_that by their_daily life and interests they_are showing the face of a truly sacerdotal and pastoral_ministry to the faithful and the infidel , to Catholics and non Catholics , and that to all they bear_witness to the truth and life , and as good shepherds go after those also , who though baptized in the Catholic Church have fallen away from the use of the sacraments , or even from the faith . Because the human_race today -isaia- joining more_and_more into a civic , economic_and_social unity , it -isaia- that much the more necessary_that priests , by combined effort and aid , under the leadership of the bishops and the Supreme Pontiff , wipe out every_kind of separateness , so that the whole_human_race may be brought into the unity of the family of God . . At a lower level of the hierarchy are deacons , upon whom hands are imposed '' not unto the priesthood , but unto a ministry of service . '' For strengthened by sacramental grace , in communion with the bishop and his group of priests they serve in the diaconate of the liturgy , of the word , and of charity to the people of God . It -isaia-_the_duty of the deacon , according as it shall_have been assigned to him by competent authority , to administer baptism solemnly , to be custodian and dispenser of the Eucharist , to assist -atti_degli_apostoli- and bless marriages in the name of the Church , to bring Viaticum to the dying , to read the Sacred Scripture to the faithful , to instruct and exhort the people , to preside over the worship and prayer of the faithful , to administer sacramentals , to officiate -atti_degli_apostoli- funeral and burial services . Dedicated to duties of charity and of administration , let deacons be mindful of the admonition of Blessed Polycarp : '' Be merciful , diligent , walking according to the truth of the Lord , who became the servant of all . '' Since these duties , so very necessary to the life of the Church , can be fulfilled only_with difficulty in many regions in accordance_with_the discipline of the Latin Church as it exists today , the diaconate can in the future be restored as a proper and permanent rank of the hierarchy . It pertains to the competent territorial bodies of bishops , of one kind or another , with the approval of the Supreme Pontiff , to decide whether and where it -isaia- opportune for_such deacons to be established for the care of souls . With the consent of the Roman Pontiff , this diaconate can , in the future , be conferred upon men of more mature age , even upon those living in the married state . It may also be conferred upon suitable young_men , for_whom the law of celibacy must remain intact . CHAPTER IV THE LAITY . Having set_forth the functions of the hierarchy , the Sacred Council gladly turns its attention . to the state of those faithful called the laity . Everything that_has_been said above concerning the People of God -isaia- intended for the laity , religious and clergy alike . But there_are certain things_which pertain in a special_way to the laity , both men_and_women , by reason of their condition and mission . Due to the special circumstances of our_time the foundations of this_doctrine must be more thoroughly examined . For their pastors know how_much the laity contribute to the welfare of the entire Church . They also know_that they_were not ordained by Christ to take upon themselves alone the entire salvific mission of the Church toward_the world . On the contrary they understand that_it_-isaia- their noble duty to shepherd the faithful and to recognize their ministries and charisms , so that all according_to_their proper roles may cooperate in this common undertaking with one mind . For we must all '' practice the truth in love , and so grow up in all things in Him who_-isaia- head , Christ . For from Him the whole_body , being closely joined and knit together through every joint of the system , according to the functioning in due measure of each single part , derives its increase to the building up of itself in love '' . . The term laity -isaia- here understood to mean all the faithful except those in holy_orders and those in the state of religious_life specially approved by the Church . These faithful_are by baptism made one_body with Christ and are constituted among the People of God ; they_are in their_own way made sharers in the priestly , prophetical , and kingly functions of Christ ; and they carry_out for their_own part the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the world . What specifically characterizes the laity -isaia- their secular nature . It -isaia- true that_those in holy_orders can -atti_degli_apostoli- times be engaged in secular activities , and even have a secular profession . But they_are by reason of their particular vocation especially and professedly ordained to the sacred_ministry . Similarly , by their state in life , religious give splendid and striking testimony that_the_world cannot be transformed and offered to God without_the spirit of the beatitudes . But the laity , by their_very vocation , seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God . They live in the world , that_-isaia- , in each and in all of the secular professions and occupations . They live in the ordinary circumstances of family and social_life , from which_the very web of their existence -isaia- woven . They are_called there by God that by exercising their_proper function and led by the spirit of the Gospel they_may work_for the sanctification of the world from within as a leaven . In this_way they_may make Christ known to others , especially by the testimony of a life resplendent in faith , hope and charity . Therefore , since_they are tightly bound up in all types of temporal affairs it -isaia- their special task to order and to throw light upon these affairs in such_a_way_that they_may come into being and then continually increase according to Christ to the praise of the Creator and the Redeemer . . By divine institution Holy Church -isaia- ordered and governed with a wonderful diversity . '' For just as in one_body we have many members , yet all the members have_not the same function , so we , the many , are one_body in Christ , but severally members one of another '' . Therefore , the chosen People of God -isaia- one : '' one Lord , one faith , one baptism '' ; sharing a common dignity as members from their regeneration in Christ , having the same filial grace and the same vocation to perfection ; possessing in common one salvation , one hope and one undivided charity . There -isaia- , therefore , in Christ and in the Church no inequality on the basis of race or nationality , social condition or sex , because '' there_-isaia- neither Jew nor Greek : there_-isaia- neither bond nor free : there_-isaia- neither male nor female . For you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' . If therefore in the Church everyone does_not proceed by the same path , nevertheless all are_called to sanctity and have_received an equal privilege of faith through the justice of God . And if by the will of Christ some are made teachers , pastors and dispensers of mysteries on behalf of others , yet all share a true equality with_regard to the dignity and to the activity common to all the faithful for the building up of the Body of Christ . For the distinction which_the Lord made between sacred ministers and the rest of the People of God bears within it a certain union , since pastors and the other faithful_are bound to each_other by a mutual need . Pastors of the Church , following_the_example of the Lord , should minister to one_another and to the other faithful . These in their turn should enthusiastically lend their joint assistance to their pastors and teachers . Thus in their diversity all bear_witness to the wonderful unity in the Body of Christ . This very diversity of graces , ministries and works gathers the children of God into one , because '' all these_things are the work of one_and_the_same Spirit '' . Therefore , from divine choice the laity have Christ for their_brothers who though He -isaia- the Lord of all , came not to be served but to serve . They also have for their_brothers those in the sacred_ministry who by teaching , by sanctifying and by ruling with the authority of Christ feed the family of God so that the new commandment of charity may be fulfilled by all . St . Augustine puts this_very beautifully when he says : '' What I -amos- for you terrifies me ; what I -amos- with you consoles me . For you I -amos- a bishop ; but_with you I -amos- a Christian . The former -isaia- a duty ; the latter a grace . The former -isaia- a danger ; the latter , salvation '' . . The laity are gathered together in the People of God and make up the Body of Christ under one head . Whoever they_are they_are_called upon , as living members , to expend all their energy for the growth of the Church and its continuous sanctification , since_this very energy -isaia-_a_gift of the Creator and a blessing of the Redeemer . The lay apostolate , however , -isaia- a participation in the salvific mission of the Church itself . Through their baptism and confirmation all are commissioned to that apostolate by the Lord Himself . Moreover , by the sacraments , especially holy Eucharist , that charity toward God and man which_-isaia- the soul of the apostolate -isaia- communicated and nourished . Now the laity are_called in a special_way to make_the Church present and operative in those places and circumstances where only through them can it become the salt of the earth . Thus every layman , in virtue of the very gifts bestowed upon him , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a witness and a living instrument of the mission of the Church itself '' according to the measure of Christ s bestowal '' . Besides this apostolate which certainly pertains to all Christians , the laity can_also be called in various_ways to a more direct form of cooperation in the apostolate of the Hierarchy . This was_the way certain men_and_women assisted Paul the Apostle in the Gospel , laboring much in the Lord . Further , they_have the capacity to assume from the Hierarchy certain ecclesiastical functions , which_are to be performed for a spiritual purpose . Upon all the laity , therefore , rests the noble duty of working to extend the divine plan of salvation to all men of each epoch and in every land . Consequently , may every opportunity be given them so that , according_to_their abilities and the needs of the times , they_may zealously participate in the saving work of the Church . . The supreme and eternal Priest , Christ Jesus , since he wills to continue his witness and service also through the laity , vivifies them in this Spirit and increasingly urges them on to every good and perfect work . For besides intimately linking them to His life and His mission , He also gives them a sharing in His priestly function of offering spiritual worship for the glory of God and the salvation of men . For this_reason_the laity , dedicated to Christ and anointed by the Holy Spirit , are marvelously called and wonderfully prepared so that ever_more abundant fruits of the Spirit may be produced in them . For all their works , prayers and apostolic endeavors , their ordinary married and family_life , their_daily occupations , their physical and mental relaxation , if carried_out in the Spirit , and even the hardships of life , if patiently borne all these become '' spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ '' . Together with the offering of the Lord s body , they are_most fittingly offered in the celebration of the Eucharist . Thus , as those everywhere who adore in holy activity , the laity consecrate the world itself to God . . Christ , the great Prophet , who proclaimed the Kingdom of His Father both by the testimony of His life and the power of His words , continually fulfills His prophetic office until the complete manifestation of glory . He does this not_only through the hierarchy who teach in His name and with His authority , but_also through the laity whom He made His witnesses and to whom He gave understanding of the faith sensu fidei and an attractiveness in speech so that the power of the Gospel might shine_forth in their_daily social and family_life . They conduct themselves as children of the promise , and thus strong in faith and in hope they_make the most of the present , and with patience await the glory that_-isaia- to come . Let them_not , then , hide this hope in the depths of their_hearts , but_even in the program of their secular life let_them express it by a continual conversion and by wrestling '' against the world rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of wickedness . Just as the sacraments of the New Law , by which_the life and the apostolate of the faithful_are nourished , prefigure a new heaven and a new earth , so too the laity go forth as powerful proclaimers of a faith in things to be hoped for , when_they courageously join to their profession_of_faith a life springing from faith . This evangelization , that_-isaia- , this announcing of Christ by a living testimony as well as by the spoken word , takes on a specific quality and a special force in that_it_-isaia- carried_out in the ordinary surroundings of the world . In connection_with the prophetic function -isaia- that state of life which_-isaia- sanctified by a special sacrament obviously of great_importance , namely , married and family_life . For where Christianity pervades the entire mode of family_life , and gradually transforms it , one will_find there both the practice and an excellent school of the lay apostolate . In such a home husbands and wives find their_proper vocation in being witnesses of the faith and love of Christ to one_another and to their_children . The Christian family loudly proclaims both the present virtues of the Kingdom of God and the hope of a blessed life to come . Thus by its example and its witness it accuses the world of sin and enlightens those_who seek the truth . Consequently , even_when preoccupied with temporal cares , the laity can and must perform a work of great value for the evangelization of the world . For even if some of them have to fulfill their religious duties on their_own , when there_are no sacred ministers or in times of persecution ; and even if many of them devote all their energies to apostolic work ; still it remains for each_one of them to cooperate in the external spread and the dynamic growth of the Kingdom of Christ in the world . Therefore , let_the laity devotedly strive to acquire a more profound grasp of revealed_truth , and let_them insistently beg of God the gift of wisdom . . Christ , becoming obedient even unto death and because of this exalted by the Father , entered into the glory of His kingdom . To Him all things_are made subject until He subjects Himself and all created things to the Father that God may be all in all . Now Christ has communicated this royal power to His disciples that they_might be constituted in royal freedom and that by true penance and a holy life they_might conquer the reign of sin in themselves . Further , He has shared this_power so that serving Christ in their fellow men they_might by humility and patience lead their brethren to that King for_whom to serve -isaia- to reign . But the Lord wishes to spread His kingdom also by means of the laity , namely , a kingdom of truth and life , a kingdom of holiness and grace , a kingdom of justice , love and peace . In this kingdom creation itself will be delivered from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God . Clearly then a great promise and a great trust -isaia- committed to the disciples : '' All things_are yours , and you_are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s '' . The faithful , therefore , must learn the deepest meaning and the value of all creation , as well as its role in the harmonious praise of God . They must assist each_other to live holier lives even in their_daily occupations . In this_way the world may be permeated by the spirit of Christ and it may more_effectively fulfill its purpose in justice , charity and peace . The laity have_the principal role in the overall fulfillment of this_duty . Therefore , by their competence in secular training and by their activity , elevated from within by the grace of Christ , let_them vigorously contribute their effort , so that created goods may be perfected by human labor , technical skill and civic culture for the benefit of all men according to the design of the Creator and the light of His Word . May the goods of this_world be more equitably distributed among all men , and may_they in their_own way be conducive to universal progress in human and Christian freedom . In this manner , through the members of the Church , will Christ progressively illumine the whole of human_society with His saving light . Moreover , let_the laity also by their combined efforts remedy the customs and conditions of the world , if they_are an inducement to sin , so that_they all may be conformed to the norms of justice and may favor the practice of virtue rather_than hinder it . By so doing they_will imbue culture and human activity with genuine moral values ; they_will better prepare the field of the world for the seed of the Word of God ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_will open wider the doors of the Church by which_the message of peace may enter_the world . Because of the very economy of salvation the faithful should learn how to distinguish carefully between those rights_and_duties which_are theirs as members of the Church , and those which_they_have as members of human_society . Let them strive to reconcile the two , remembering that in every temporal affair they_must be guided by a Christian conscience , since even in secular business there_-isaia- no human activity which_can be withdrawn from God s dominion . In our own_time , however , it -isaia- most urgent that_this distinction and also this harmony should shine_forth more_clearly than_ever in the lives of the faithful , so that the mission of the Church may correspond more_fully to the special conditions of the world today . For it must be admitted that the temporal sphere -isaia- governed by its_own principles , since_it_-isaia- rightly concerned_with the interests of this_world . But that ominous doctrine which attempts to build a society with no regard whatever for religion , and which attacks and destroys the religious liberty of its citizens , -isaia- rightly to be rejected . . The laity have_the right , as do all Christians , to receive in abundance from their_spiritual shepherds the spiritual goods of the Church , especially_the assistance of the word of God and of the sacraments . They should openly reveal to them their needs and desires with_that freedom and confidence which_-isaia- fitting for children of God and brothers in Christ . They are , by reason of the knowledge , competence or outstanding ability which_they may enjoy , permitted and sometimes even obliged to express their opinion on those things_which concern the good of the Church . When occasions arise , let this be done through the organs erected by the Church for this_purpose . Let it always be done in truth , in courage and in prudence , with reverence and charity toward those_who by reason of their sacred office represent the person of Christ . The laity should , as all Christians , promptly accept in Christian obedience decisions of their_spiritual shepherds , since_they are representatives of Christ as well as teachers and rulers in the Church . Let them follow_the example of Christ , who by His obedience even unto death , opened to all men the blessed way of the liberty of the children of God . Nor should they omit to pray_for those placed over them , for they keep watch as having to render an account of their_souls , so that_they_may do this with_joy and not_with grief . Let the spiritual shepherds recognize and promote the dignity as well as the responsibility of the laity in the Church . Let them willingly employ their prudent advice . Let them confidently assign duties to them in the service of the Church , allowing them freedom and room_for action . Further , let_them encourage lay_people so that_they_may undertake tasks on their_own initiative . Attentively in Christ , let_them consider with fatherly love the projects , suggestions and desires proposed by the laity . However , let_the shepherds respectfully acknowledge that just freedom which belongs to everyone in this earthly city A great many wonderful things_are to be hoped for from this familiar dialogue_between the laity and their_spiritual leaders : in the laity a strengthened sense of personal responsibility ; a renewed enthusiasm ; a more ready application of their talents to the projects of their_spiritual leaders . The latter , on the other_hand , aided by the experience of the laity , can more_clearly and more incisively come to decisions regarding both spiritual and temporal matters . In this_way , the whole Church , strengthened by each_one of its_members , may more_effectively fulfill -isaia- mission for the life of the world . . Each individual layman must stand before the world as a witness to the resurrection and life of the Lord Jesus and a symbol of the living God . All the laity as a community and each_one according_to_his ability must nourish the world with spiritual fruits . They must diffuse in the world_that spirit_which animates the poor , the meek , the peace makers whom_the Lord in the Gospel proclaimed as blessed . In a word , '' Christians must be to the world what_the soul -isaia- to the body . '' CHAPTER V THE UNIVERSAL CALL TO HOLINESS IN THE CHURCH . The Church , whose mystery -isaia- being set_forth by this Sacred Synod , -isaia- believed to be indefectibly holy . Indeed Christ , the Son of God , who with the Father and the Spirit -isaia- praised as '' uniquely holy , '' loved the Church as His bride , delivering Himself up for_her . He did this_that He might sanctify her . He united her to Himself as His own body and brought it to perfection by the gift of the Holy Spirit for God s glory . Therefore in the Church , everyone whether belonging to the hierarchy , or being cared for by it , -isaia- called to holiness , according to the saying of the Apostle : '' For this_-isaia- the will of God , your sanctification '' . However , this holiness of the Church -isaia- unceasingly manifested , and must be manifested , in the fruits of grace_which the Spirit produces in the faithful ; it -isaia- expressed in many_ways in individuals , who in their walk of life , tend toward_the perfection of charity , thus causing the edification of others ; in a very_special way this holiness appears in the practice of the counsels , customarily called '' evangelical . '' This practice of the counsels , under the impulsion of the Holy Spirit , undertaken by many Christians , either privately or in a Church approved condition or state of life , gives and must give in the world an outstanding witness and example of this_same holiness . . The Lord Jesus , the divine Teacher and Model of all perfection , preached holiness of life to each and everyone of His disciples of every condition . He Himself stands as the author and consumator of this holiness of life : '' Be you therefore perfect , even as your heavenly Father -isaia- perfect '' . Indeed He sent the Holy Spirit upon all men that He might move them inwardly to love God with_their whole heart and their whole soul , with all their mind and all their strength and that they_might love each_other as Christ loves them . The followers of Christ are_called by God , not because_of_their works , but according to His own purpose and grace . They are justified in the Lord Jesus , because in the baptism of faith they truly become sons of God and sharers in the divine nature . In this_way they_are really made holy . Then too , by God s gift , they_must hold on to and complete in their_lives this holiness they have_received . They are warned by the Apostle to live '' as becomes saints '' , and to put on '' as God s chosen ones , holy and beloved a heart of mercy , kindness , humility , meekness , patience '' , and to possess the fruit of the Spirit in holiness . Since truly we all offend in many things we all need God s mercies continually and we all must daily pray : '' Forgive us our debts '' Thus it -isaia- evident to everyone , that all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status , are_called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity ; by this holiness as such a more_human manner of living -isaia- promoted in this earthly society . In order that_the_faithful may reach this perfection , they_must use their strength accordingly as they have_received it , as a gift from Christ . They must follow in His footsteps and conform themselves to His image seeking the will of the Father in all things . They must devote_themselves with all their being to the glory of God and the service of their neighbor . In this_way , the holiness of the People of God will grow into an abundant harvest of good , as -isaia- admirably shown by the life of so many saints in Church history . . The classes and duties of life are_many , but holiness -isaia- one_that sanctity which_-isaia- cultivated by all who_are moved by the Spirit of God , and who obey the voice of the Father and worship God the Father in spirit and in truth . These people follow_the poor Christ , the humble and cross bearing Christ in order to be worthy of being sharers in His glory . Every person must walk unhesitatingly according_to_his own personal gifts and duties in the path of living faith_,_which arouses hope and works through charity . In the first_place , the shepherds of Christ s flock must holily and eagerly , humbly and courageously carry_out_their ministry , in imitation of the eternal high Priest , the Shepherd and Guardian of our souls . They ought to fulfill this_duty in such_a_way_that it will be the principal means also of their_own sanctification . Those chosen for the fullness of the priesthood are granted the ability of exercising the perfect duty of pastoral_charity by the grace of the sacrament of Orders . This perfect duty of pastoral_charity -isaia- exercised in every_form of episcopal care and service , prayer , sacrifice and preaching . By this_same sacramental grace , they_are given the courage necessary to lay_down their_lives for their sheep , and the ability of promoting greater holiness in the Church by their_daily example , having become a pattern for their flock . Priests , who resemble bishops to a certain degree in their participation of the sacrament of Orders , form the spiritual crown of the bishops . They participate in the grace of their office and they_should grow daily in their love of God and their neighbor by the exercise of their office through Christ , the eternal and unique Mediator . They should preserve the bond of priestly communion , and they_should abound in every spiritual good and thus present to all men a living witness to God . All this they_should do in emulation of those priests_who often , down through the course of the centuries , left an outstanding example of the holiness of humble and hidden service . Their praise lives on in the Church of God . By their_very office of praying and offering sacrifice for their_own people and the entire people of God , they_should rise to greater holiness . Keeping in mind what_they are doing and imitating what_they are handling , these priests , in their apostolic labors , rather_than being ensnared by perils and hardships , should rather rise to greater holiness through these perils and hardships . They should ever nourish and strengthen their action from an abundance of contemplation , doing all this for the comfort of the entire Church of God . All priests , and especially_those who are_called '' diocesan priests , '' due to the special title of their ordination , should keep continually before their_minds the fact that_their faithful loyalty toward and their generous cooperation_with their bishop_-isaia- of the greatest value in their growth in holiness . Ministers of lesser rank are_also sharers in the mission and grace of the Supreme Priest . In the first_place among_these ministers are deacons , who , in as much as they_are dispensers of Christ s mysteries and servants of the Church , should keep themselves free_from every vice and stand before men as personifications of goodness and friends of God . Clerics , who are_called by the Lord and are set_aside as His portion in order to prepare themselves for the various ministerial offices under the watchful eye of spiritual shepherds , are_bound to bring their_hearts and minds into accord with this special election which_-isaia- theirs . They will accomplish this by their constancy in prayer , by their burning love , and by their unremitting recollection of whatever_-isaia- true , just and of good repute . They will accomplish all this for the glory and honor of God . Besides these already named , there_are also laymen , chosen of God and called by the bishop . These laymen spend themselves completely in apostolic labors , working the Lord s field with much success . . Furthermore , married_couples and Christian parents should follow their_own proper path to holiness by faithful love . They should sustain one_another in grace throughout_the entire length of their_lives . They should embue their offspring , lovingly welcomed as God s gift , with Christian doctrine and the evangelical virtues . In this manner , they offer all men the example of unwearying and generous love ; in this_way they build up the brotherhood of charity ; in so doing , they stand as the witnesses and cooperators in the fruitfulness of Holy Mother Church ; by such lives , they_are a sign and a participation in that_very love , with_which Christ loved His Bride and for_which He delivered Himself up for_her . A like example , but_one given in a different way , -isaia- that offered by widows and single people , who are_able to make great contributions toward holiness and apostolic endeavor in the Church . Finally , those_who engage in labor and frequently it -isaia- of a heavy nature should better themselves by their human labors . They should be of aid to their fellow citizens . They should raise all of society , and even creation itself , to a better mode of existence . Indeed , they_should imitate by their lively charity , in their joyous hope and by their voluntary sharing of each others burdens , the very Christ who plied His hands with carpenter s tools and Who in union with His Father , -isaia- continually working for the salvation of all men . In this , then , their_daily work they_should climb to the heights of holiness and apostolic activity . May all those_who_are weighed down with poverty , infirmity and sickness , as well as those_who must bear various hardships or who_suffer persecution for_justice sake may_they all know they are_united with the suffering Christ in a special_way for the salvation of the world . The Lord called them blessed in His Gospel and they_are those_whom '' the God of all graces , who_has called us unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus , will Himself , after we have suffered a little while , perfect , strengthen and establish '' . Finally all Christ s faithful , whatever be the conditions , duties and circumstances of their_lives and indeed through all these , will daily increase in holiness , if they receive all things with_faith from the hand of their heavenly Father and if they cooperate with the divine will . In this temporal service , they_will manifest to all men the love with_which God loved the world . . '' God -isaia- love , and he who abides in love , abides in God and God in Him '' . But , God pours out his_love into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit , Who has_been_given to us ; thus_the first and most necessary gift -isaia- love , by which we love God above all things and our neighbor because of God . Indeed , in order_that love , as good seed may grow and bring forth fruit in the soul , each_one of the faithful must willingly hear_the Word of God and accept His Will , and must complete what God has begun by their_own actions with the help of God s grace . These actions consist in the use of the sacraments and in a special_way the Eucharist , frequent participation in the sacred action of the Liturgy , application of oneself to prayer , self abnegation , lively fraternal service and the constant exercise of all the virtues . For charity , as the bond of perfection and the fullness of the law , rules over all the means of attaining holiness and gives_life to these same means . It -isaia- charity_which guides us to our final end . It -isaia- the love of God and the love of one s neighbor which points_out the true disciple of Christ . Since Jesus , the Son of God , manifested His charity by laying down His life_for us , so too no one_has greater love than he who lays down his_life for Christ and His brothers . From the earliest times , then , some Christians have been_called upon and some will_always be called_upon to give the supreme testimony of this_love to all men , but especially to persecutors . The Church , then , considers martyrdom as an exceptional gift and as the fullest proof of love . By martyrdom a disciple -isaia- transformed into an image of his Master by freely accepting death for the salvation of the world as well as his conformity to Christ in the shedding of his_blood . Though few are presented such an opportunity , nevertheless all must be prepared to confess Christ before men . They must be prepared to make_this profession_of_faith even in the midst of persecutions , which_will never be lacking to the Church , in following the way of the cross . Likewise , the holiness of the Church -isaia- fostered in a special_way by the observance of the counsels proposed in the Gospel by Our Lord to His disciples . An eminent position among_these -isaia- held by virginity or the celibate state . This -isaia- a precious gift of divine_grace given by the Father to certain souls , whereby they_may devote_themselves to God alone the more_easily , due to an undivided heart . This perfect continency , out of desire_for the kingdom_of_heaven , has_always_been held in particular honor in the Church . The reason_for this_was and -isaia- that perfect continency for the love of God -isaia- an incentive to charity , and -isaia- certainly a particular source of spiritual fecundity in the world . The Church continually keeps before it the warning of the Apostle which moved the faithful to charity , exhorting them to experience personally what Christ Jesus had known within Himself . This was_the same Christ Jesus , who '' emptied Himself , taking the nature of a slave . . . becoming obedient to death '' , and because of us '' being rich , he became poor '' . Because the disciples must_always offer an imitation of and a testimony to the charity and humility of Christ , Mother Church rejoices -atti_degli_apostoli- finding within her bosom men_and_women_who very closely follow their Saviour who debased Himself to our comprehension . There are_some who , in their freedom as sons of God , renounce their_own wills and take upon themselves the state of poverty . Still further , some become subject of their_own accord to another man , in the matter of perfection for love of God . This -isaia- beyond_the measure of the commandments , but_-isaia- done in order to become more_fully like the obedient Christ . Therefore , all the faithful of Christ are invited to strive for the holiness and perfection of their_own proper state . Indeed they_have an obligation to so strive . Let all then have care that_they guide aright their_own deepest sentiments of soul . Let neither the use of the things of this_world nor attachment to riches , which_-isaia- against the spirit of evangelical poverty , hinder them in their quest for perfect love . Let them heed the admonition of the Apostle to those_who use this_world ; let_them not come to terms with this_world ; for this_world , as we see it , -isaia- passing away . CHAPTER VI RELIGIOUS . The evangelical_counsels of chastity dedicated to God , poverty and obedience are based upon the words and examples of the Lord . They were further commanded by the apostles and Fathers of the Church , as well as by the doctors and pastors of souls . The counsels are a divine gift , which_the Church received_from its Lord and which it always safeguards with the help of His grace . Church authority has the duty , under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , of interpreting these evangelical_counsels , of regulating their practice and finally to build on them stable forms of living . Thus it has come about , that , as if on a tree which_has grown in the field of the Lord , various_forms of solidarity and community life , as well as various religious families have branched out in a marvelous and multiple way from this divinely given seed . Such a multiple and miraculous growth augments both the progress of the members of these various religious families themselves and the welfare of the entire Body of Christ . These religious families give their members the support of a more firm stability in their way_of_life and a proven doctrine of acquiring perfection . They further offer their members the support of fraternal association in the militia of Christ and of liberty strengthened by obedience . Thus these religious are_able to tranquilly fulfill and faithfully observe their religious profession and so spiritually rejoicing make progress on the road of charity . From the point_of_view of the divine and hierarchical structure of the Church , the religious state of life_-isaia- not an intermediate state between_the clerical and lay states . But , rather , the faithful of Christ are_called by God from both these states of life so that they_might enjoy this particular gift in the life of the Church and thus each in one_s_own way , may be of some advantage to the salvific mission of the Church . . The faithful of Christ bind themselves to the three aforesaid counsels either by vows , or by other sacred bonds , which_are like vows in their purpose . By such a bond , a person_-isaia- totally dedicated to God , loved beyond all things . In this_way , that person_-isaia- ordained to the honor and service of God under a new and special title . Indeed through Baptism a person dies to sin and -isaia- consecrated to God . However , in order that_he_may be capable of deriving more abundant fruit from this baptismal grace , he intends , by the profession of the evangelical_counsels in the Church , to free himself from those obstacles , which might draw him away from the fervor of charity and the perfection of divine_worship . By his profession of the evangelical_counsels , then , he -isaia- more intimately consecrated to divine service . This consecration will be the more_perfect , in as much as the indissoluble bond of the union of Christ and His bride , the Church , -isaia- represented by firm and more stable bonds . The evangelical_counsels which lead to charity join their followers to the Church and its mystery in a special_way . Since this_-isaia- so , the spiritual_life of these_people should then be devoted to the welfare of the whole Church . From this arises their_duty of working to implant and strengthen the Kingdom of Christ in souls and to extend that Kingdom to every clime . This duty -isaia- to be undertaken to the extent of their capacities and in keeping_with_the proper type of their_own vocation . This can be realized through prayer or active works of the apostolate . It -isaia- for_this reason_that the Church preserves and fosters the special character of her various religious institutes . The profession of the evangelical_counsels , then , appears as a sign which_can and ought to attract all the members of the Church to an effective and prompt fulfillment of the duties of their Christian vocation . The people of God have no lasting city here below , but look forward to one that_-isaia- to come . Since this_-isaia- so , the religious state , whose purpose -isaia- to free its_members from earthly cares , more_fully manifests to all believers the presence of heavenly goods already possessed here below . Furthermore , it not_only witnesses to the fact of a new and eternal_life acquired by the redemption of Christ , but it foretells the future resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom . Christ proposed to His disciples this form of life_,_which He , as the Son of God , accepted in entering this_world to do the will of the Father . This same state of life_-isaia- accurately exemplified and perpetually made present in the Church . The religious state clearly manifests that the Kingdom of God and its needs , in a very_special way , are raised above all earthly considerations . Finally it clearly shows all men both the unsurpassed breadth of the strength of Christ the King and the infinite power of the Holy Spirit marvelously working in the Church . Thus , the state which_-isaia- constituted by the profession of the evangelical_counsels , though it -isaia- not the hierarchical structure of the Church , nevertheless , undeniably belongs to its life and holiness . . It -isaia-_the_duty of the ecclesiastical hierarchy to regulate the practice of the evangelical_counsels by law , since it -isaia-_the_duty of the same hierarchy to care_for the People of God and to lead_them to most fruitful pastures . The importance of the profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- seen in the fact_that it fosters the perfection of love of God and love of neighbor in an outstanding manner and that_this profession -isaia- strengthened by vows . Furthermore , the hierarchy , following with docility the prompting of the Holy Spirit , accepts the rules presented by outstanding men_and_women and authentically approves these rules after further adjustments . It also aids by its vigilant and safeguarding authority those institutes variously established for the building up of Christ s Body in order_that these same institutes may grow and flourish according to the spirit of the founders . Any institute of perfection and its individual members may be removed from the jurisdiction of the local Ordinaries by the Supreme Pontiff and subjected to himself alone . This -isaia- done in virtue of his primacy over the entire Church in order to more_fully provide_for the necessities of the entire flock of the Lord and in consideration of the common_good . In like_manner , these institutes may be left or committed to the charge of the proper patriarchical authority . The members of these institutes , in fulfilling their obligation to the Church due to their particular form of life , ought to show reverence and obedience to bishops according to the sacred canons . The bishops are owed this respect because_of_their pastoral authority in their_own churches and because of the need of unity and harmony in the apostolate . . The Church not_only raises the religious profession to the dignity of a canonical state by her approval , but_even manifests that_this profession -isaia- a state consecrated to God by the liturgical setting of that profession . The Church itself , by the authority given to it by God , accepts the vows of the newly professed . It begs aid and grace from God for them by its public prayer . It commends them to God , imparts a spiritual blessing on them and accompanies their self offering by the Eucharistic sacrifice . . Religious should carefully keep before their_minds the fact_that the Church presents Christ to believers and non believers alike in a striking manner daily through them . The Church thus portrays Christ in contemplation on the mountain , in His proclamation of the kingdom of God to the multitudes , in His healing of the sick and maimed , in His work of converting sinners to a better life , in His solicitude for youth and His goodness to all men , always obedient to the will of the Father who sent Him . All men should_take note that the profession of the evangelical_counsels , though entailing the renunciation of certain values_which are to be undoubtedly esteemed , does_not detract from a genuine development of the human persons , but_rather by its_very nature_-isaia- most beneficial to that development . Indeed the counsels , voluntarily undertaken according to each_one s personal vocation , contribute a great deal to the purification of heart and spiritual liberty . They continually stir up the fervor of charity . But especially they are_able to more_fully mold the Christian man to that type of chaste and detached life_,_which Christ the Lord chose for Himself and which His Mother also embraced . This -isaia- clearly proven by the example of so many holy founders . Let no one think_that religious have_become strangers to their fellowmen or useless citizens of this earthly city by their consecration . For even_though it sometimes happens_that religious do not directly mingle with_their contemporaries , yet in a more profound sense these same religious are_united with_them in the heart of Christ and spiritually cooperate with_them . In this_way the building up of the earthly city may_have its foundation in the Lord and may tend toward Him , lest perhaps those_who build this city shall_have labored in vain . Therefore , this Sacred Synod encourages and praises the men_and_women , Brothers and Sisters , who in monasteries , or in schools and hospitals , or in the missions , adorn the Bride of Christ by their unswerving and humble faithfulness in their chosen consecration and render generous services of all kinds to mankind . . Let each of the faithful called to the profession of the evangelical_counsels , therefore , carefully see_to_it_that he persevere and ever grow in that vocation God has_given him . Let him do this for the increased holiness of the Church , for the greater glory of the one and undivided Trinity , which in and through Christ -isaia- the fount and the source of all holiness . CHAPTER VII THE ESCHATOLOGICAL NATURE OF THE PILGRIM CHURCH AND ITS UNION WITH THE CHURCH IN HEAVEN . The Church , to which_we_are all called in Christ Jesus , and in which we acquire sanctity through the grace of God , will attain its_full perfection only in the glory of heaven , when there_will come the time of the restoration of all things . At that_time the human_race as well as the entire world , which_-isaia- intimately related to man and attains to its end through_him , will be perfectly reestablished in Christ . Christ , having_been lifted up from the earth has drawn all to Himself . Rising from the dead He sent His life_giving Spirit upon His disciples and through Him has established His Body which_-isaia- the Church as the universal sacrament of salvation . Sitting -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father , He -isaia- continually active in the world_that He might lead men to the Church and through it join them to Himself and that He might make_them partakers of His glorious life by nourishing them_with His own Body and Blood . Therefore the promised restoration which_we_are awaiting has_already begun in Christ , -isaia- carried forward in the mission of the Holy Spirit and through Him continues in the Church in which we learn the meaning of our terrestrial life through our_faith , while we perform with hope in the future the work committed to us in this_world by the Father , and thus work out our_salvation . Already the final age of the world has come upon us and the renovation of the world_-isaia- irrevocably decreed and -isaia-_already anticipated in some kind of a real way ; for the Church already on this earth -isaia- signed with a sanctity which_-isaia- real although imperfect . However , until there shall be new heavens and a new earth in which justice dwells , the pilgrim Church in her sacraments and institutions , which pertain to this present_time , has the appearance of this_world which_-isaia- passing and she herself dwells among creatures who groan and travail in pain until now and await the revelation of the sons of God . Joined with Christ in the Church and signed with the Holy Spirit '' who_-isaia- the pledge of our inheritance '' , truly we are_called and we are sons of God but we have_not yet appeared with Christ in glory , in which we shall be like to God , since we shall see Him as He -isaia- . And therefore '' while we are in the body , we are exiled from the Lord and having the first fruits of the Spirit we groan within ourselves and we desire to be with Christ '' . By that_same charity however , we are urged to live more for Him , who died for us and rose again . We strive therefore to please God in all things and we put on the armor of God , that we may_be_able to stand against the wiles of the devil and resist in the evil day . Since however we know not the day nor the hour , on Our Lord s advice we must be constantly vigilant so that , having finished the course of our earthly life , we may merit to enter_into the marriage feast with Him and to be numbered among the blessed and that_we_may not be ordered to go into eternal fire like the wicked and slothful servant , into the exterior darkness where '' there_will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth '' . For before we reign with Christ in glory , all of us will be made manifest '' before the tribunal of Christ , so that_each one may receive what he has won through the body , according_to_his works , whether good or evil '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the world '' they_who have_done good shall come forth unto resurrection of life ; but those_who_have done evil unto resurrection of judgment '' . Reckoning therefore that '' the sufferings of the present_time are_not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that_will be revealed in us '' , strong in faith we look for the '' blessed hope and the glorious coming of our great God and Saviour , Jesus Christ '' '' who_will refashion the body of our lowliness , conforming it to the body of His glory , and who_will come '' to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled -atti_degli_apostoli- in all those_who_have believed '' . . Until the Lord shall come in His majesty , and all the angels with Him and death being destroyed , all things_are subject to Him , some of His disciples are exiles on earth , some having died are purified , and others are in glory beholding '' clearly God Himself triune and one , as He -isaia- '' ; but all in various_ways and degrees are in communion in the same charity of God and neighbor and all sing the same hymn of glory to our God . For all who_are in Christ , having His Spirit , form one Church and cleave together in Him . Therefore the union of the wayfarers with the brethren who_have gone to sleep in the peace of Christ -isaia- not in the least weakened or interrupted , but on the contrary , according to the perpetual faith of the Church , -isaia- strengthened by communication of spiritual goods . For by reason of the fact that_those in heaven are more_closely united with Christ , they establish the whole Church more firmly in holiness , lend nobility to the worship which_the Church offers to God here on earth and in many_ways contribute to its greater edification . For after they_have_been received into_their heavenly home and are present to the Lord , through Him and with Him and in Him they_do_not cease to intercede with the Father for us , showing forth the merits which_they won on earth through the one Mediator between God and man , serving God in all things and filling up in their flesh those things_which are lacking of the sufferings of Christ for His Body which_-isaia- the Church . Thus by their brotherly interest our weakness -isaia- greatly strengthened . . Fully conscious of this communion of the whole Mystical Body of Jesus Christ , the pilgrim Church from the very first ages of the Christian religion has cultivated with_great piety the memory of the dead , and '' because_it_-isaia- a holy and wholesome thought to pray_for the dead that_they_may be loosed from their sins '' , also offers suffrages for them . The Church has_always believed that the apostles and Christ s martyrs who_had given the supreme witness of faith and charity by the shedding of their blood , are closely joined with us in Christ , and she has_always venerated them with_special devotion , together_with_the Blessed Virgin Mary and the holy angels . The Church has piously implored the aid of their intercession . To these were soon added also those_who had more_closely imitated Christ s virginity and poverty , and finally others whom_the outstanding practice of the Christian virtues and the divine charisms recommended to the pious devotion and imitation of the faithful . When we look -atti_degli_apostoli- the lives of those_who_have faithfully followed Christ , we are inspired with a new reason_for seeking the City that_-isaia- to come and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we are shown a most safe path by which among the vicissitudes of this_world , in keeping_with_the state in life and condition proper to each of us , we will_be_able to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- perfect union with Christ , that_-isaia- , perfect holiness . In the lives of those_who , sharing in our humanity , are however more perfectly transformed into the image of Christ , God vividly manifests His presence and His face to men . He speaks to us in them , and gives us a sign of His Kingdom , to which_we_are strongly drawn , having so great a cloud of witnesses over us and such a witness to the truth of the Gospel . Nor -isaia- it by the title of example only that we cherish the memory of those in heaven , but still_more in order_that the union of the whole Church may be strengthened in the Spirit by the practice of fraternal charity . For just as Christian communion among wayfarers brings us closer to Christ , so our companionship with the saints joins us to Christ , from Whom as from its Fountain and Head issues every grace and the very life of the people of God . It -isaia- supremely fitting , therefore_,_that we love those friends and coheirs of Jesus Christ , who are_also our_brothers and extraordinary benefactors , that we render due thanks to God for them and '' suppliantly invoke them and have_recourse to their prayers , their_power and help in obtaining benefits from God through His Son , Jesus Christ , who -isaia-_our Redeemer and Saviour . '' For every genuine testimony of love shown by us to those in heaven , by its_very nature tends toward and terminates in Christ who_-isaia- the '' crown of all saints , '' and through Him , in God Who -isaia- wonderful in his saints and -isaia- magnified in them . Our union with the Church in heaven -isaia- put into_effect in its noblest manner especially in the sacred Liturgy , wherein the power of the Holy Spirit acts upon us through sacramental signs . Then , with combined rejoicing we celebrate together the praise of the divine majesty ; then all those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation who_have_been redeemed by the blood of Christ and gathered together into one Church , with one song of praise magnify the one and triune God . Celebrating the Eucharistic sacrifice therefore , we are_most closely united to the Church in heaven in communion with and venerating the memory first of all of the glorious ever Virgin Mary , of Blessed Joseph and the blessed apostles and martyrs and of all the saints . . This Sacred Council accepts with_great devotion this venerable faith of our ancestors regarding this vital fellowship with_our brethren who_are in heavenly glory or who having died are_still being purified ; and it proposes again the decrees of the Second Council of Nicea , the Council of Florence and the Council of Trent . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , in conformity_with our_own pastoral interests , we urge all concerned , if any abuses , excesses or defects have crept in here or there , to do what_-isaia- in their_power to remove or correct them , and to restore all things to a fuller praise of Christ and of God . Let them therefore teach the faithful that the authentic cult of the saints consists not_so_much in the multiplying of external acts , but_rather in the greater intensity of our love , whereby , for our_own greater good and that of the whole Church , we seek from the saints '' example in their way_of_life , fellowship in their communion , and aid by their intercession . '' On the other_hand , let_them teach the faithful that_our communion with_those in heaven , provided that_it_-isaia- understood in the fuller light_of_faith according to its genuine nature , in no way weakens , but conversely , more thoroughly enriches the latreutic worship we give to God the Father , through Christ , in the Spirit . For all of us , who_are sons of God and constitute one family in Christ , as long as we remain in communion with one_another in mutual charity and in one praise of the most_holy Trinity , are corresponding with the intimate vocation of the Church and partaking in foretaste the liturgy of consummate glory . For when Christ shall appear and the glorious resurrection of the dead will take_place , the glory of God will light up the heavenly City and the Lamb will be the lamp thereof . Then the whole Church of the saints in the supreme happiness of charity will adore God and '' the Lamb who_was slain '' , proclaiming with one voice : '' To Him who sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb blessing , and honor , and glory , and dominion forever and ever '' . CHAPTER VIII THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY , MOTHER OF GOD IN THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH I . Introduction . Wishing in His supreme goodness and wisdom to effect the redemption of the world , '' when_the fullness_of_time came , God sent His Son , born of a woman . . . that we might receive the adoption of sons '' . '' He for us men , and for our_salvation , came down from heaven , and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary . '' This divine mystery of salvation -isaia-_revealed to us and continued in the Church , which_the Lord established as His body . Joined to Christ the Head and in the unity of fellowship with all His saints , the faithful must in the first_place reverence the memory '' of the glorious ever Virgin Mary , Mother of our God and Lord Jesus Christ '' . . The Virgin Mary , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the message of the angel received_the Word of God in her_heart and in her body and gave Life to the world , -isaia- acknowledged and honored as being truly the Mother of God and Mother of the Redeemer . Redeemed by reason of the merits of her Son and united to Him by a close and indissoluble tie , she_-isaia- endowed_with the high office and dignity of being the Mother of the Son of God , by which account she -isaia-_also the beloved daughter of the Father and the temple of the Holy Spirit . Because of this_gift of sublime grace she far surpasses all creatures , both in heaven and on earth . At the same_time , however , because_she belongs to the offspring of Adam she_-isaia- one_with all those_who_are to be saved . She -isaia- '' the mother of the members of Christ . . . having cooperated by charity that faithful might be born in the Church , who_are members of that Head . '' Wherefore she_-isaia- hailed as a pre eminent and singular member of the Church , and as its type and excellent exemplar in faith and charity . The Catholic Church , taught by the Holy Spirit , honors her with filial affection and piety as a most beloved mother . . Wherefore this Holy Synod , in expounding the doctrine on the Church , in which_the divine Redeemer works salvation , intends to describe with diligence both the role of the Blessed Virgin in the mystery of the Incarnate Word and the Mystical Body , and the duties of redeemed mankind toward_the Mother of God , who_-isaia- mother of Christ and mother of men , particularly of the faithful . It does_not , however , have it in mind to give a complete doctrine on Mary , nor_does it wish to decide those questions which_the work of theologians has not_yet fully clarified . Those opinions therefore may be lawfully retained which_are propounded in Catholic schools concerning her , who occupies a place in the Church which_-isaia- the highest after Christ and yet very close to us . II . The Role of the Blessed Mother in the Economy of Salvation . The Sacred Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament , as well as ancient Tradition show the role of the Mother of the Saviour in the economy of salvation in an ever clearer light and draw attention to it . The books of the Old Testament describe the history_of_salvation , by which_the coming of Christ into_the_world was slowly prepared . These earliest documents , as they_are read in the Church and are understood in the light of a further and full revelation , bring_the figure of the woman , Mother of the Redeemer , into a gradually clearer light . When it -isaia- looked -atti_degli_apostoli- in this_way , she -isaia-_already prophetically foreshadowed in the promise of victory over the serpent which was_given to our_first parents after their fall_into sin . Likewise she_-isaia- the Virgin who shall conceive and bear a son , whose name will be called Emmanuel . She stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord , who confidently hope_for and receive salvation from Him . With her the exalted Daughter of Sion , and after a long expectation of the promise , the times are fulfilled and the new Economy established , when_the Son of God took a human_nature from her , that He might in the mysteries of His flesh free man from sin . . The Father of mercies willed that the incarnation should be preceded by the acceptance of her who_was predestined to be the mother of His Son , so that just as a woman contributed to death , so also a woman should contribute to life . That -isaia- true in outstanding fashion of the mother of Jesus , who gave to the world Him who_-isaia- Life itself and who renews all things , and who_was enriched by God with the gifts which befit such a role . It -isaia- no wonder therefore that the usage prevailed among the Fathers whereby they called the mother of God entirely holy and free_from all stain of sin , as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature . Adorned from the first instant of her conception with the radiance of an entirely unique holiness , the Virgin of Nazareth -isaia- greeted , on God s command , by an angel messenger as '' full of grace '' , and to the heavenly messenger she replies : '' Behold the handmaid of the Lord , be it done unto me according to thy word '' . Thus Mary , a daughter of Adam , consenting to the divine Word , became the mother of Jesus , the one and only Mediator . Embracing God s salvific will with a full heart and impeded by no sin , she devoted herself totally as a handmaid of the Lord to the person and work of her Son , under Him and with Him , by the grace of almighty God , serving the mystery of redemption . Rightly therefore the holy Fathers see her as used by God not merely in a passive way , but as freely cooperating in the work of human salvation through_faith and obedience . For , as St . Irenaeus says , she '' being obedient , became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole_human_race . '' Hence not_a_few of the early Fathers gladly assert in their preaching , '' The knot of Eve s disobedience was untied by Mary s obedience ; what_the virgin Eve bound through_her unbelief , the Virgin Mary loosened by her faith . '' Comparing Mary with Eve , they call her '' the Mother of the living , '' and still_more often they_say : '' death through Eve , life through Mary . '' . This union of the Mother with the Son in the work of salvation -isaia- made manifest from the time of Christ s virginal conception up to His death it -isaia- shown first of all when Mary , arising in haste to go to visit Elizabeth , -isaia- greeted by her as blessed because of her belief in the promise of salvation and the precursor leaped with_joy in the womb of his_mother . This union -isaia- manifest also -atti_degli_apostoli- the birth of Our Lord , who did_not diminish His mother s virginal integrity but sanctified it , when_the Mother of God joyfully showed her firstborn Son to the shepherds and Magi . When she presented Him to the Lord in the temple , making the offering of the poor , she heard Simeon foretelling -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that her Son would be a sign of contradiction and that a sword would pierce the mother s soul , that out of many hearts thoughts might be revealed . When the Child Jesus was lost and they_had sought Him sorrowing , His parents found Him in the temple , taken up with the things_that were His Father s business ; and they did_not understand_the word of their Son . His Mother indeed kept these_things to be pondered over in her_heart . . In the public_life of Jesus , Mary makes significant appearances . This -isaia- so even -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning , when -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage feast of Cana , moved with pity , she brought_about by her intercession the beginning of miracles of Jesus the Messiah . In the course of her Son s preaching she received_the words whereby in extolling a kingdom beyond_the calculations and bonds of flesh and blood , He declared blessed those_who heard and kept the word of God , as she_was faithfully doing . After this manner the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , and faithfully persevered in her union with_her Son unto the cross , where she stood , in keeping_with_the divine plan , grieving exceedingly with_her only_begotten Son , uniting herself with a maternal heart with His sacrifice , and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this Victim which_she herself had brought forth . Finally , she was_given by the same Christ Jesus dying on the cross as a mother to His disciple with these_words : '' Woman , behold thy son '' . . But since it has pleased God not to manifest solemnly the mystery of the salvation of the human_race before He would pour forth the Spirit promised by Christ , we see the apostles before the day of Pentecost '' persevering with one mind in prayer with the women and Mary the Mother of Jesus , and with His brethren '' , and Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the Spirit , who had_already overshadowed her in the Annunciation . Finally , the Immaculate Virgin , preserved free_from all guilt of original_sin , on the completion of her earthly sojourn , was taken up body_and_soul into heavenly glory , and exalted by the Lord as Queen of the universe , that_she might be the more_fully conformed to her Son , the Lord of lords and the conqueror of sin and death . l III . On the Blessed Virgin and the Church . There -isaia- but_one Mediator as we know from the words_of_the_apostle , '' for there_-isaia-_one God and one mediator of God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself a redemption for all '' . The maternal duty of Mary toward men in no wise obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ , but_rather shows His power . For all the salvific influence of the Blessed Virgin on men originates , not from some inner necessity , but_from the divine pleasure . It flows forth_from the superabundance of the merits of Christ , rests on His mediation , depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it . In no way does it impede , but_rather does it foster the immediate union of the faithful with Christ . . Predestined from eternity by that decree of divine_providence which determined the incarnation of the Word to be the Mother of God , the Blessed Virgin was on this earth the virgin Mother of the Redeemer , and above all others and in a singular way the generous associate and humble handmaid of the Lord . She conceived , brought forth and nourished Christ . She presented Him to the Father in the temple , and was united with Him by compassion as He died on the Cross . In this singular way she cooperated by her obedience , faith , hope and burning charity in the work of the Saviour in giving back supernatural life to souls . Wherefore she -isaia-_our mother in the order of grace . . This maternity of Mary in the order of grace began with the consent which_she gave in faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and which_she sustained without wavering beneath the cross , and lasts until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect . Taken up to heaven she did_not lay aside this salvific duty , but by her constant intercession continued to bring us the gifts of eternal_salvation . By her_maternal charity , she cares for the brethren of her Son , who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and cultics , until they_are led into the happiness of their true home . Therefore the Blessed Virgin -isaia- invoked by the Church under the titles of Advocate , Auxiliatrix , Adjutrix , and Mediatrix . This , however , -isaia- to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator . For no creature could ever be counted as equal with the Incarnate Word and Redeemer . Just as the priesthood of Christ -isaia- shared in various_ways both by the ministers and by the faithful , and as the one goodness of God -isaia- really communicated in different_ways to His creatures , so also the unique mediation of the Redeemer does_not exclude but_rather gives_rise to a manifold cooperation which_-isaia- but a sharing in this one source . The Church does not_hesitate to profess this subordinate role of Mary . It knows it through unfailing experience of it and commends it to the hearts of the faithful , so that encouraged by this maternal help they_may the more intimately adhere to the Mediator and Redeemer . . By reason of the gift and role of divine maternity , by which she_-isaia- united with_her Son , the Redeemer , and with His singular graces and functions , the Blessed Virgin -isaia-_also intimately united with the Church . As St . Ambrose taught , the Mother of God -isaia- a type of the Church in the order of faith , charity and perfect union with Christ . For in the mystery of the Church , which_-isaia- itself rightly called mother and virgin , the Blessed Virgin stands out in eminent and singular fashion as exemplar both of virgin and mother . By her belief and obedience , not knowing man but overshadowed by the Holy Spirit , as the new Eve she brought forth on earth the very Son of the Father , showing an undefiled faith , not in the word of the ancient serpent , but in that of God s messenger . The Son whom she brought forth -isaia- He whom God placed as the first born among many brethren , namely the faithful , in whose birth and education she cooperates with a maternal love . . The Church indeed , contemplating her hidden sanctity , imitating her charity and faithfully fulfilling the Father s will , by receiving the word of God in faith becomes herself a mother . By her preaching she brings forth to a new and immortal life the sons who_are born to her in baptism , conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of God . She herself -isaia- a virgin , who keeps the faith given to her by her Spouse whole and entire . Imitating the mother of her Lord , and by the power of the Holy Spirit , she keeps with virginal purity an entire faith , a firm hope and a sincere charity . . But while in the most_holy Virgin the Church has_already reached that perfection whereby she_-isaia- without spot or wrinkle , the followers of Christ still strive to increase in holiness by conquering sin . And so they turn their_eyes to Mary who shines_forth to the whole community of the elect as the model of virtues . Piously meditating on her and contemplating her in the light of the Word made man , the Church with reverence enters more intimately into the great mystery of the Incarnation and becomes more_and_more like her Spouse . For Mary , who since her entry into salvation history unites in herself and re echoes the greatest teachings of the faith as she_-isaia- proclaimed and venerated , calls the faithful to her Son and His sacrifice and to the love of the Father . Seeking after_the glory of Christ , the Church becomes more like her exalted Type , and continually progresses in faith , hope and charity , seeking and doing the will of God in all things . Hence the Church , in her apostolic work also , justly looks to her , who , conceived of the Holy Spirit , brought forth Christ , who was_born of the Virgin that_through the Church He may be born and may increase in the hearts of the faithful also . The Virgin in her own_life lived an example of that maternal love , by which it behooves that all should be animated who cooperate in the apostolic mission of the Church for the regeneration of men . IV . The Cult of the Blessed Virgin in the Church . Placed by the grace of God , as God s Mother , next to her Son , and exalted above all angels and men , Mary intervened in the mysteries of Christ and -isaia- justly honored by a special cult in the Church . Clearly from earliest times the Blessed Virgin -isaia- honored under the title of Mother of God , under whose protection the faithful took refuge in all their dangers and necessities . Hence after_the Synod of Ephesus the cult of the people of God toward Mary wonderfully increased in veneration and love , in invocation and imitation , according to her_own prophetic words : '' All generations shall call me blessed , because He that_-isaia- mighty hath done great things to me '' . This cult , as it always existed , although it -isaia- altogether singular , differs essentially from the cult of adoration which_-isaia- offered to the Incarnate Word , as well to the Father and the Holy Spirit , and it -isaia- most favorable to it . The various_forms of piety toward_the Mother of God , which_the Church within_the limits of sound and orthodox doctrine , according to the conditions of time_and_place , and the nature and ingenuity of the faithful has approved , bring it about_that while the Mother -isaia- honored , the Son , through whom all things have_their being and in whom it has pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell , -isaia- rightly known , loved and glorified and that all His commands are observed . . This most Holy Synod deliberately teaches this Catholic doctrine and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time admonishes all the sons of the Church that the cult , especially_the liturgical cult , of the Blessed Virgin , be generously fostered , and the practices and exercises of piety , recommended by the magisterium of the Church toward her in the course of centuries be made of great moment , and those decrees , which_have_been given in the early days regarding the cult of images of Christ , the Blessed Virgin and the saints , be religiously observed . But it exhorts theologians and preachers of the divine_word to abstain zealously both from all gross exaggerations as well as from petty narrow mindedness in considering the singular dignity of the Mother of God . Following the study of Sacred Scripture , the Holy Fathers , the doctors and liturgy of the Church , and under_the_guidance of the Church s magisterium , let_them rightly illustrate the duties and privileges of the Blessed Virgin which always look to Christ , the source of all truth , sanctity and piety . Let them assiduously keep away from whatever , either by word or deed , could lead separated brethren or any_other into error regarding the true doctrine of the Church . Let the faithful remember moreover that true devotion consists neither in sterile or transitory affection , nor in a certain vain credulity , but proceeds from true faith , by which_we_are led to know_the excellence of the Mother of God , and we are moved to a filial love toward our_mother and to the imitation of her virtues . V . Mary the sign of created hope and solace to the wandering people of God . In the interim just as the Mother of Jesus , glorified in body_and_soul in heaven , -isaia- the image and beginning of the Church as it -isaia- to be perfected -isaia- the world to come , so too does she shine_forth on earth , until the day of the Lord shall come , as a sign of sure hope and solace to the people of God during its sojourn on earth . . It gives great joy and comfort to this_holy and general Synod that_even among the separated brethren there_are_some who give due honor to the Mother of our Lord and Saviour , especially among the Orientals , who with devout mind and fervent impulse give honor to the Mother of God , ever virgin . The entire body of the faithful pours forth instant supplications to the Mother of God and Mother of men that_she , who aided the beginnings of the Church by her prayers , may now , exalted as she_-isaia- above all the angels and saints , intercede before her Son in the fellowship of all the saints , until all families of people , whether_they are honored with the title of Christian or whether_they still do not know_the Saviour , may be happily gathered together in peace and harmony into one people of God , for the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity . Each and all these items which_are set_forth in this dogmatic Constitution have met with the approval of the Council Fathers . And We by the apostolic power given Us by Christ together_with_the Venerable Fathers in the Holy Spirit , approve , decree and establish it and command that_what has thus been decided in the Council be promulgated for the glory of God . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on November , . APPENDIX From the Acts of the Council NOTIFICATIONES GIVEN BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL AT THE rd GENERAL CONGREGATION , NOVEMBER , A question has arisen regarding the precise theological note which_should be attached to the doctrine that_-isaia- set_forth in the Schema de Ecclesia and -isaia- being put to a vote . The Theological Commission has_given the following response regarding the Modi that_have to do with Chapter III of the de Ecclesia Schema : '' As -isaia- self evident , the Council s text must_always be interpreted in accordance_with_the general rules that_are known to all . '' On this occasion the Theological Commission makes reference to its Declaration of March , , the text of which we transcribe here : '' Taking conciliar custom into consideration and also the pastoral purpose of the present Council , the sacred Council defines as binding on the Church only those_things in matters of faith_and_morals which it shall openly declare to be binding . The rest of the things_which the sacred Council sets forth , inasmuch as they_are the teaching of the Church s supreme magisterium , ought to be accepted and embraced by each_and_every one of Christ s faithful according to the mind of the sacred Council . The mind of the Council becomes known either from the matter treated or from its manner of speaking , in accordance_with_the norms of theological interpretation . '' The following was published as an appendix to the official Latin version of the Constitution on the Church . A preliminary note of explanation -isaia- being given to the Council Fathers from higher authority , regarding the Modi bearing on Chapter III of the Schema de Ecclesia ; the doctrine set_forth in Chapter III ought to be explained and understood in accordance_with_the meaning and intent of this explanatory note . Preliminary Note of Explanation The Commission has decided to preface the assessment of the Modi with the following general observations . . '' College '' -isaia- not understood in a strictly juridical sense , that_-isaia- as a group of equals who entrust their_power to their president , but as a stable group whose structure and authority must be learned from Revelation . For this_reason , in reply to Modus it -isaia- expressly said of the Twelve that the Lord set them up '' as a college or stable group . '' Cf . also Modus , c . For the same reason , the words '' Ordo '' or '' Corpus '' are used throughout with reference to the College of bishops . The parallel between Peter and the rest of the Apostles on the one_hand , and between_the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops on the other_hand , does_not imply the transmission of the Apostles extraordinary power to their successors ; nor_does it imply , as -isaia- obvious , equality between_the head of the College and its_members , but_only a proportionality between_the first relationship Peter Apostles and the second Pope bishops . Thus the Commission decided to write '' pari ratione , '' not '' eadem ratione , '' in n . . Cf . Modus . . A person becomes a member of the College by virtue of Episcopal consecration and by hierarchical communion with the head of the College and with its_members . Cf . n . , end of . In his consecration a person_-isaia- given an ontological participation in the sacred functions munera ; this_-isaia- absolutely clear from Tradition , liturgical tradition included . The word '' functions munera '' -isaia- used deliberately instead of the word '' powers potestates , '' because the latter word could be understood as a power fully ready to act . But for this_power to be fully ready to act , there_must be a further canonical or juridical determination through the hierarchical authority . This determination of power can consist in the granting of a particular office or in the allotment of subjects , and it -isaia- done according to the norms approved by the supreme_authority . An additional norm of this_sort -isaia- required by the very nature of the case , because it involves functions munera which_must be exercised by many subjects cooperating in a hierarchical manner in accordance_with Christ s will . It -isaia- evident_that this '' communion '' was applied in the Church s life according to the circumstances of the time , before it was codified as law . For this_reason it -isaia- clearly stated_that hierarchical communion with the head and members_of_the_church -isaia- required . Communion -isaia- a notion which_-isaia- held in high honor in the ancient Church and also today , especially in the East . However , it -isaia- not understood as some kind of vague disposition , but as an organic reality which requires a juridical form and -isaia- animated by charity . Hence the Commission , almost unanimously , decided that_this wording should be used : '' in hierarchical communion . '' Cf . Modus and the statements on canonical mission n . . The documents of recent Pontiffs regarding the jurisdiction of bishops must be interpreted in terms of this necessary determination of powers . . The College , which_does_not exist without_the head , -isaia- said '' to exist also as the subject of supreme and full power in the universal Church . '' This must be admitted of necessity so that the fullness of power belonging to the Roman Pontiff -isaia- not called into question . For the College , always and of necessity , includes its head , because in the college he preserves unhindered his function as Christ s Vicar and as Pastor of the universal Church . In other_words , it -isaia- not a distinction between_the Roman Pontiff and the bishops taken collectively , but a distinction between_the Roman Pontiff taken separately and the Roman Pontiff together_with_the bishops . Since the Supreme Pontiff -isaia- head of the College , he alone_-isaia- able to perform certain actions which_are not -atti_degli_apostoli- all within_the competence of the bishops , e . g . , convoking the College and directing it , approving norms of action , etc . Cf . Modus . It -isaia- up to the judgment of the Supreme Pontiff , to whose care Christ s whole flock has_been entrusted , to determine , according to the needs of the Church as they change over the course of centuries , the way_in_which this care may best be exercised whether in a personal or a collegial way . The Roman Pontiff , taking account of the Church s welfare , proceeds according_to_his own discretion in arranging , promoting and approving the exercise of collegial activity . . As Supreme Pastor of the Church , the Supreme Pontiff can always exercise his_power -atti_degli_apostoli- will , as his_very office demands . Though it -isaia- always in existence , the College -isaia- not as a result permanently engaged in strictly collegial activity ; the Church s Tradition makes this clear . In other_words , the College -isaia- not_always '' fully active in actu pleno '' ; rather , it acts as a college in the strict sense only from time to time and only_with the consent of its head . The phrase '' with the consent of its head '' -isaia- used to avoid the idea of dependence on some kind of outsider ; the term '' consent '' suggests rather communion_between the head and the members , and implies the need_for an act which belongs properly to the competence of the head . This -isaia- explicitly affirmed in n . , , and -isaia- explained -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of that section . The word '' only '' takes in all cases . It -isaia- evident from this_that the norms approved by the supreme_authority must_always be observed . Cf . Modus . It -isaia- clear throughout that it -isaia-_a_question of the bishops acting in conjunction with_their head , never of the bishops acting independently of the Pope . In the latter instance , without_the action of the head , the bishops are_not able to act as a College : this_-isaia- clear from the concept of '' College . '' This hierarchical communion of all the bishops with the Supreme Pontiff -isaia- certainly firmly established in Tradition . N . B . Without hierarchical communion the ontologico sacramental function munus , which_-isaia- to be distinguished from the juridico canonical aspect , cannot be exercised . However , the Commission has decided that it should_not enter_into question of liceity and validity . These questions are left to theologians to discuss specifically the question of the power exercised de facto among the separated Eastern Churches , about which_there are various explanations .

The hidden design of the divine wisdom , which Jesus Christ the Saviour of men came to carry_out on earth , had this_end in view , that , by Himself and in Himself , He should divinely renew the world , which_was sinking , as it were , with length of years into decline . The Apostle Paul summed this up in words of dignity and majesty when he wrote to the Ephesians , thus : '' That He might make known unto us the mystery of His will . to re establish all things in Christ that_are in heaven and on earth . In truth , Christ our Lord , setting Himself to fulfill the commandment which His Father had given Him , straightway imparted a new form and fresh beauty to all things , taking away the effects of their time worn age . For He healed the wounds which_the sin of our_first father had inflicted on the human_race ; He brought all men , by nature children of wrath , into favor with God ; He led to the light of truth men wearied out by longstanding errors ; He renewed to every virtue those_who were weakened by lawlessness of every_kind ; and , giving them again an inheritance of neverending bliss , He added a sure hope that_their mortal and perishable bodies should one_day be partakers of immortality and of the glory of heaven . In order_that these unparalleled benefits might last as long as men should be found on earth , He entrusted to His Church the continuance of His work ; and , looking to future times , He commanded her to set in order whatever might have_become deranged in human_society , and to restore whatever might have fallen into ruin . Although the divine renewal we have spoken of chiefly and directly affected men as constituted in the supernatural order of grace , nevertheless some of its precious and salutary fruits were also bestowed abundantly in the order of nature . Hence , not_only individual men , but_also the whole mass of the human_race , have in every respect received no small degree of worthiness . For , so soon as Christian order was once established in the world , it became possible_for all men , one by one , to learn what God s fatherly providence -isaia- , and to dwell in it habitually , thereby fostering that hope of heavenly help which never confoundeth . From all this outflowed fortitude , self control , constancy , and the evenness of a peaceful mind , together_with many high virtues and noble deeds . Wondrous , indeed , was_the extent of dignity , steadfastness , and goodness which thus accrued to the State as well as to the family . The authority of rulers became more just and revered ; the obedience of the people more ready and unforced ; the union of citizens closer ; the rights of dominion more secure . In very truth , the Christian religion thought of and provided for all things_which are held to be advantageous in a State ; so much so , indeed , that , according to St . Augustine , one_cannot see_how it could have offered greater help in the matter of living well and happily , had it been instituted for the single object of procuring or increasing those things_which contributed to the conveniences or advantages of this mortal life . Still , the purpose We have set before Us -isaia- not to recount , in detail , benefits of this_kind ; Our wish -isaia- rather to speak about_that family union of which marriage -isaia- the beginning and the foundation . The true origin of marriage , venerable_brothers , -isaia- well_known to all . Though revilers of the Christian faith refuse to acknowledge_the never interrupted doctrine of the Church on this_subject , and have long striven to destroy the testimony of all nations and of all times , they_have nevertheless failed not_only to quench the powerful light of truth , but_even to lessen it . We record what_-isaia- to all known , and cannot be doubted by any , that God , on the sixth day of creation , having made man from the slime of the earth , and having breathed into_his face the breath of life , gave him a companion , whom He miraculously took from the side of Adam when he was locked in sleep . God thus , in His most far reaching foresight , decreed that_this husband_and_wife should be the natural beginning of the human_race , from whom it might be propagated and preserved by an unfailing fruitfulness throughout all futurity of time . And this union of man_and_woman , that it might answer more fittingly to the infinite wise counsels of God , even from the beginning manifested chiefly two most excellent properties deeply sealed , as it were , and signed upon it namely , unity and perpetuity . From the Gospel we see clearly that this_doctrine was declared and openly confirmed by the divine authority of Jesus Christ . He bore witness to the Jews and to His Apostles that marriage , from its institution , should exist between two only , that_-isaia- , between one man and one woman ; that of two they_are made , so to say , one flesh ; and that the marriage bond -isaia- by the will of God so closely and strongly made fast that no man may dissolve it or render it asunder . '' For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife , and they two shall be in one flesh . Therefore now they_are_not two , but_one flesh . What , therefore , God bath joined together , let no man put asunder . This form of marriage , however , so excellent and so pre eminent , began to be corrupted by degrees , and to disappear among the heathen ; and became even among the Jewish race clouded in a measure and obscured . For in their midst a common custom was gradually introduced , by which it was accounted as lawful for a man to have more_than one wife ; and eventually when '' by reason of the hardness of their heart , '' Moses indulgently permitted them to put away their wives , the way was open to divorce . But the corruption and change which fell on marriage among the Gentiles seem almost incredible , inasmuch as it was exposed in every land to floods of error and of the most shameful lusts . All nations seem , more_or_less , to have forgotten the true notion and origin of marriage ; and thus everywhere laws were enacted with reference to marriage , prompted to all appearance by State reasons , but_not such as nature required . Solemn rites , invented -atti_degli_apostoli- will of the law givers , brought_about that women should , as might be , bear either the honorable name of wife or the disgraceful name of concubine ; and things came to such a pitch that permission to marry , or the refusal of the permission , depended on the will of the heads of the State , whose laws were greatly against equity or even to the highest degree unjust . Moreover , plurality of wives and husbands , as well as divorce , caused the nuptial bond to be relaxed exceedingly . Hence , too , sprang up the greatest confusion as to the mutual rights_and_duties of husbands and wives , inasmuch as a man assumed right of dominion over his wife , ordering her to go about her business , often without_any just cause ; while he was himself -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty '' to run headlong with impunity into lust , unbridled and unrestrained , in houses of ill fame and amongst his female slaves , as if the dignity of the persons sinned with , and not the will of the sinner , made the guilt . '' When the licentiousness of a husband thus showed itself , nothing could be more piteous than the wife , sunk so low as to be all but reckoned as a means_for the gratification of passion , or for the production of offspring . Without any feeling of shame , marriageable girls were bought and sold , tike so much merchandise , and power was sometimes given to the father and to the husband to inflict capital punishment on the wife . Of necessity , the offspring of such marriages as these were either reckoned among the stock in trade of the common wealth or held to be the property of the father of the family ; and the law permitted him to make and unmake the marriages of his_children -atti_degli_apostoli- his mere will , and even to exercise against them the monstrous power of life and death . So manifold being the vices and so great the ignominies with_which marriage was defiled , an alleviation and a remedy were -atti_degli_apostoli- length bestowed from on high . Jesus Christ , who restored our human_dignity and who perfected the Mosaic law , applied early in His ministry no little solicitude to the question of marriage . He ennobled the marriage in Cana of Galilee by His presence , and made it memorable by the first of the miracles which he wrought ; and for this_reason , even from that day forth , it seemed as if the beginning of new holiness had_been conferred on human marriages . Later on He brought back matrimony to the nobility of its primeval origin by condemning the customs of the Jews in their abuse of the plurality of wives and of the power of giving bills of divorce ; and still_more by commanding most strictly that_no_one should dare to dissolve that union which God Himself had sanctioned by a bond perpetual . Hence , having set_aside the difficulties which_were adduced from the law of Moses , He , in character of supreme Lawgiver , decreed as follows concerning husbands and wives , '' I say to you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery ; and he that shall marry her that_-isaia- put away committeth adultery . But what_was decreed and constituted in respect to marriage by the authority of God has_been more_fully and more_clearly handed_down to us , by tradition and the written Word , through the Apostles , those heralds of the laws of God . To the Apostles , indeed , as our masters , are to be referred the doctrines which '' our holy Fathers , the Councils , and the Tradition of the Universal Church have_always taught , '' namely_,_that Christ our Lord raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament ; that to husband_and_wife , guarded and strengthened by the heavenly grace_which His merits gained for them , He gave power to attain holiness in the married state ; and that , in a wondrous way , making marriage an example of the mystical union between Himself and His Church , He not_only perfected that_love which_-isaia- according to nature , but_also made the naturally indivisible union of one man with one woman far more_perfect through the bond of heavenly love . Paul says to the Ephesians : '' Husbands , love your wives , as Christ also loved the Church , and delivered Himself up for it , that He might sanctify it . So also ought men to love their wives as their_own bodies . For no man ever hated his_own flesh , but nourisheth and cherisheth it , as also Christ doth the Church ; because we are members of His body , of His flesh , and of His bones . For this cause shall a man leave his_father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife , and they_shall be two in one flesh . This -isaia- a great sacrament ; but I speak in Christ and in the Church . '' In like_manner from the teaching of the Apostles we learn that the unity of marriage and its perpetual indissolubility , the indispensable conditions of its_very origin , must , according to the command of Christ , be holy and inviolable without exception . Paul says again : '' To them that_are married , not I , but the Lord commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband ; and if she depart , that_she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband . '' And again : '' A woman -isaia- bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband die , she_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty . '' It -isaia- for these reasons that marriage -isaia- '' a great sacrament '' ; '' honorable in all , '' holy , pure , and to be reverenced as a type and symbol of most_high mysteries . Furthermore , the Christian perfection and completeness of marriage are_not comprised in those points only which_have_been mentioned . For , first , there_has been vouchsafed to the marriage union a higher and nobler purpose than was ever previously given to it . By the command of Christ , it not_only looks to the propagation of the human_race , but to the bringing forth of children for the Church , '' fellow citizens with the saints , and the domestics of God '' ; so that '' a people might be born and brought up for the worship and religion of the true God and our Saviour Jesus Christ . Secondly , the mutual duties of husband_and_wife have_been defined , and their several rights accurately established . They are_bound , namely , to have such feelings for one_another as to cherish always very great mutual love , to be ever faithful to their marriage vow , and to give one_another an unfailing and unselfish help . The husband -isaia- the chief of the family and the head of the wife . The woman , because_she -isaia- flesh of his flesh , and bone of his bone , must be subject to her husband and obey him ; not , indeed , as a servant , but as a companion , so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity . Since the husband represents Christ , and since_the wife represents the Church , let there always be , both in him_who commands and in her who obeys , a heaven born love guiding both in their_respective duties . For '' the husband -isaia- the head of the wife ; as Christ -isaia- the head of the Church . Therefore , as the Church -isaia- subject to Christ , so also let wives be to their husbands in all things . As regards children , they ought to submit to the parents and obey them , and give_them honor for conscience sake ; while , on the other_hand , parents are_bound to give all care and watchful thought to the education of their offspring and their virtuous bringing up : '' Fathers , . bring them up '' that_-isaia- , your children '' in the discipline and correction of the Lord . '' From this we see clearly that the duties of husbands and wives are neither few nor light ; although to married people_who_are good these burdens become not_only bearable but agreeable , owing to the strength which_they gain through the sacrament . Christ , therefore , having renewed marriage to such and so great excellence , commended and entrusted all the discipline bearing upon these_matters to His Church . The Church , always and everywhere , has so used her power with reference to the marriages of Christians that_men have_seen clearly how it belongs to her as of native right ; not being made hers by any human grant , but given divinely to her by the will of her Founder . Her constant and watchful care in guarding marriage , by the preservation of its sanctity , -isaia- so well understood as to not need proof . That the judgment of the Council of Jerusalem reprobated licentious and free love , we all know ; as also_that the incestuous Corinthian was condemned by the authority of blessed Paul . Again , in the very_beginning of the Christian Church were repulsed and defeated , with the like unremitting determination , the efforts of many who aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the destruction of Christian marriage , such as the Gnostics , Manichaeans , and Montanists ; and in our own_time Mormons , St . Simonians , phalansterians , and communists . In like_manner , moreover , a law of marriage just to all , and the same for all , was enacted by the abolition of the old distinction between slaves and free born men_and_women ; and thus_the rights of husbands and wives were made equal : for , as St . Jerome says , '' with us that_which_-isaia- unlawful for women -isaia- unlawful for men also , and the same restraint -isaia- imposed on equal conditions . '' The self same rights also were firmly established for reciprocal affection and for the interchange of duties ; the dignity of the woman was asserted and assured ; and it was forbidden to the man to inflict capital punishment for adultery , or lustfully and shamelessly to violate his plighted faith . It -isaia-_also a great blessing that the Church has limited , so far as -isaia- needful , the power of fathers of families , so that sons_and_daughters , wishing to marry , are_not in any_way deprived of their rightful freedom ; that , for the purpose of spreading more widely the supernatural love of husbands and wives , she_has decreed marriages within certain degrees of consanguinity or affinity to be null and void ; that_she has_taken the greatest pains to safeguard marriage , as much as -isaia- possible , from error and violence and deceit ; that_she has_always wished to preserve the holy chasteness of the marriage bed , the security of persons , the honor of husband_and_wife , and the sanctity of religion . Lastly , with_such foresight of legislation has the Church guarded its divine institution that_no_one who thinks rightfully of these_matters can fail to see_how , with_regard to marriage , she_-isaia- the best guardian and defender of the human_race ; and how , withal , her wisdom has come forth victorious from the lapse of years , from the assaults of men , and from the countless changes of public events . Yet , owing to the efforts of the archenemy of mankind , there_are persons_who , thanklessly casting away so many_other blessings of redemption , despise also or utterly ignore the restoration of marriage to its original perfection . It -isaia- a reproach to some of the ancients that_they showed themselves the enemies of marriage in many_ways ; but in our_own age , much_more pernicious -isaia- the sin of those_who would fain pervert utterly the nature of marriage , perfect though it -isaia- , and complete in all its details and parts . The chief reason_why they act in this_way -isaia- because very many , imbued_with the maxims of a false philosophy and corrupted in morals , judge nothing so unbearable as submission and obedience ; and strive with all their might to bring_about that not_only individual men , but families , also indeed , human_society itself may in haughty pride despise the sovereignty of God . Now , since_the family and human_society -atti_degli_apostoli- large spring from marriage , these_men will on no account allow matrimony to be the subject of the jurisdiction of the Church . Nay , they endeavor to deprive it of all holiness , and so bring it within_the contracted sphere of those rights which , having_been instituted by man , are ruled and administered by the civil jurisprudence of the community . Wherefore it necessarily follows_that they attribute all power over marriage to civil rulers , and allow none whatever to the Church ; and , when_the Church exercises any such power , they think_that she acts either by favor of the civil authority or to its injury . Now -isaia- the time , they_say , for the heads of the State to vindicate their_rights unflinchingly , and to do their best to settle all that relates to marriage according as to them seems good . Hence are owing civil marriages , commonly so called ; hence laws are framed which impose impediments to marriage ; hence arise judicial sentences affecting the marriage contract , as to whether or not it have_been rightly made . Lastly , all power of prescribing and passing judgment in this class of cases -isaia- , as we see , of set purpose denied to the Catholic Church , so that no regard -isaia- paid either to her_divine power or to her prudent laws . Yet , under these , for so many centuries , have_the nations lived on whom_the light of civilization shone bright with the wisdom of Christ Jesus . Nevertheless , the naturalists , as well as all who profess that_they worship above all things the divinity of the State , and strive to disturb whole communities with_such wicked doctrines , cannot escape the charge of delusion . Marriage has God for its Author , and was from the very_beginning a kind of foreshadowing of the Incarnation of His Son ; and therefore there abides in it a something holy and religious ; not extraneous , but innate ; not derived_from men , but implanted by nature . Innocent III , therefore , and Honorius III , our_predecessors , affirmed not falsely nor rashly that a sacrament of marriage existed ever amongst the faithful and unbelievers . We call to witness the monuments of antiquity , as also the manners and customs of those people_who , being the most civilized , had the greatest knowledge of law and equity . In the minds of all of them it was a fixed and foregone conclusion that , when marriage was thought of , it was thought of as conjoined with religion and holiness . Hence , among_those , marriages were commonly celebrated with religious ceremonies , under the authority of pontiffs , and with the ministry of priests . So mighty , even in the souls ignorant of heavenly doctrine , was_the force of nature , of the remembrance of their origin , and of the conscience of the human_race . As , then , marriage -isaia- holy by its_own power , in its_own nature , and of itself , it ought not to be regulated and administered by the will of civil rulers , but by the divine authority of the Church , which alone in sacred matters professes the office of teaching . Next , the dignity of the sacrament must be considered , for through addition of the sacrament the marriages of Christians have_become far the noblest of all matrimonial unions . But to decree and ordain concerning the sacrament -isaia- , by the will of Christ Himself , so much a part of the power and duty of the Church that_it_-isaia- plainly absurd to maintain that_even the very smallest fraction of such power has_been transferred to the civil ruler . Lastly should be borne in mind the great weight and crucial test of history , by which_it_-isaia- plainly proved that the legislative and judicial authority of which We are speaking has_been freely and constantly used by the Church , even in times when some foolishly suppose the head of the State either to have consented to it or connived -atti_degli_apostoli- it . It would , for instance , be incredible and altogether absurd to assume that Christ our Lord condemned the long standing practice of polygamy and divorce by authority delegated to Him by the procurator of the province , or the principal ruler of the Jews . And it would be equally extravagant to think_that , when_the Apostle Paul taught that divorces and incestuous marriages were_not lawful , it was because Tiberius , Caligula , and Nero agreed with_him or secretly commanded him so to teach . No man in his senses could ever be persuaded that the Church made so many laws about the holiness and indissolubility of marriage , and the marriages of slaves with the free born , by power received_from Roman emperors , most hostile to the Christian name , whose strongest desire was to destroy by violence and murder the rising Church of Christ . Still less could anyone believe this to be the case , when_the law of the Church was sometimes so divergent from the civil law that Ignatius the Martyr , Justin , Athenagoras , and Tertullian publicly denounced as unjust and adulterous certain marriages which_had_been sanctioned by imperial law . Furthermore , after all power had devolved upon the Christian emperors , the supreme pontiffs and bishops assembled in council persisted with the same independence and consciousness of their right in commanding or forbidding in regard to marriage whatever they judged to be profitable or expedient for the time being , however much it might seem to be -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the laws of the State . It -isaia- well_known that , with_respect to the impediments arising from the marriage bond , through vow , disparity of worship , blood relationship , certain forms of crime , and from previously plighted troth , many decrees were issued by the rulers of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the Councils of Granada , Arles , Chalcedon , the second of Milevum , and others , which_were often widely different from the decrees sanctioned by the laws of the empire . Furthermore , so far were Christian princes from arrogating any power in the matter of Christian marriage that_they on the contrary acknowledged and declared that it belonged exclusively in all its fullness to the Church . In fact , Honorius , the younger Theodosius , and Justinian , also , hesitated not to confess that the only power belonging to them in relation to marriage was that of acting as guardians and defenders of the holy canons . If -atti_degli_apostoli- any time they enacted anything by their edicts concerning impediments of marriage , they voluntarily explained the reason , affirming that_they took it upon themselves so to act , by leave and authority of the Church , whose judgment they_were wont to appeal to and reverently to accept in all questions that concerned legitimacy and divorce ; as also in all those points which in any_way have a necessary connection_with the marriage bond . The Council of Trent , therefore , had the clearest right to define that_it_-isaia- in the Church s power '' to establish diriment impediments of matrimony , '' and that '' matrimonial causes pertain to ecclesiastical judges . Let no one , then , be deceived by the distinction which some civil jurists have so strongly insisted upon the distinction , namely , by virtue of which_they sever the matrimonial contract from the sacrament , with intent to hand over the contract to the power and will of the rulers of the State , while reserving questions concerning the sacrament of the Church . A distinction , or rather severance , of this_kind cannot be approved ; for certain it -isaia- that in Christian marriage the contract -isaia- inseparable from the sacrament , and that , for this_reason , the contract cannot be true and legitimate without being a sacrament as well . For Christ our Lord added to marriage the dignity of a sacrament ; but marriage -isaia- the contract itself , whenever that contract -isaia- lawfully concluded . Marriage , moreover , -isaia- a sacrament , because_it_-isaia- a holy sign which_gives grace , showing forth an image of the mystical nuptials of Christ with the Church . But the form and image of these nuptials -isaia- shown precisely by the very bond of that_most close union in which man_and_woman are_bound together in one ; which bond -isaia- nothing else but the marriage itself . Hence it -isaia- clear_that among Christians every true marriage -isaia- , in itself and by itself , a sacrament ; and that_nothing can be further from the truth than to say that the sacrament -isaia- a certain added ornament , or outward endowment , which_can be separated and torn away from the contract -atti_degli_apostoli- the caprice of man . Neither , therefore , by reasoning can it be shown , nor by any testimony of history be proved , that power over the marriages of Christians has_ever lawfully been handed over to the rulers of the State . If , in this_matter , the right of anyone else has_ever been violated , no one_can truly say that it has_been violated by the Church . Would that the teaching of the naturalists , besides being full of falsehood and injustice , were_not also the fertile source of much detriment and calamity ! But it -isaia- easy to see -atti_degli_apostoli- a glance the greatness of the evil which unhallowed marriages have brought , and ever will_bring , on the whole of human_society . From the beginning of the world , indeed , it was divinely ordained that things instituted by God and by nature should be proved by us to be the more profitable and salutary the more they remain unchanged in their full integrity . For God , the Maker of all things , well knowing what_was good for the institution and preservation of each of His creatures , so ordered them by His will and mind_that each might adequately attain the end for_which it was_made . If the rashness or the wickedness of human agency venture to change or disturb that order of things which_has_been constituted with fullest foresight , then the designs of infinite wisdom and usefulness begin either to be hurtful or cease to be profitable , partly because through the change undergone they_have lost their_power of benefiting , and partly because God chooses to inflict punishment on the pride and audacity of man . Now , those_who deny that marriage -isaia- holy , and who relegate it , striped of all holiness , among the class of common secular things , uproot thereby the foundations of nature , not_only resisting the designs of Providence , but , so far as they_can , destroying the order_that God has ordained . No one , therefore , should wonder if from such insane and impious attempts there spring up a crop of evils pernicious in the highest degree both to the salvation_of_souls and to the safety of the commonwealth . If , then , we consider_the end of the divine institution of marriage , we shall see very clearly that God intended it to be a most fruitful source of individual benefit and of public welfare , Not only , in strict truth , was marriage instituted for the propagation of the human_race , but also_that the lives of husbands and wives might be made better and happier . This comes about in many_ways : by their lightening each_other s burdens through mutual help ; by constant and faithful love ; by having all their possessions in common ; and by the heavenly grace_which flows from the sacrament . Marriage also can do much for the good of families , for , so long as it -isaia- conformable to nature and in accordance_with_the counsels of God , it has power to strengthen union of heart in the parents ; to secure the holy education of children ; to temper the authority of the father by the example of the divine authority ; to render children obedient to their_parents and servants obedient to their masters . From such marriages as these the State may rightly expect a race of citizens animated by a good spirit and filled_with reverence and love for God , recognizing it their_duty to obey those_who rule justly and lawfully , to love all , and to injure no one . These many and glorious fruits were ever the product of marriage , so long as it retained those gifts of holiness , unity , and indissolubility from which proceeded all its fertile and saving power ; nor_can anyone doubt but_that it would always have brought forth such fruits , -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and in all places , had it been under the power and guardianship of the Church , the trustworthy preserver and protector of these gifts . But , now , there_-isaia- a spreading wish to supplant natural and divine_law by human law ; and hence has begun a gradual extinction of that_most excellent ideal of marriage which nature herself had impressed on the soul of man , and sealed , as it were , with_her own seal ; nay , more , even in Christian marriages this_power , productive of so great good , has_been weakened by the sinfulness of man . Of what advantage -isaia- it if a state can institute nuptials estranged from the Christian religion , which_-isaia- the mother of all good , cherishing all sublime virtues , quickening and urging us to everything_that -isaia- the glory of a lofty and generous soul ? When the Christian religion_-isaia- reflected and repudiated , marriage sinks of necessity into the slavery of man s vicious nature and vile passions , and finds but little protection in the help of natural goodness . A very torrent of evil has flowed from this source , not_only into private families , but_also into States . For , the salutary fear of God being removed , and there being no longer that refreshment in toil which_-isaia- nowhere more abounding than in the Christian religion , it very often happens , as indeed -isaia- natural , that the mutual services and duties of marriage seem almost unbearable ; and thus very many yearn for the loosening of the tie which_they believe to be woven by human law and of their_own will , whenever incompatibility of temper , or quarrels , or the violation of the marriage vow , or mutual consent , or other reasons induce them to think_that it would be well to be set free . Then , if they_are hindered by law from carrying_out this shameless desire , they contend that the laws are iniquitous , inhuman , and -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the rights of free citizens ; adding that every_effort should be made to repeal such enactments , and to introduce a more humane code sanctioning divorce . Now , however much the legislators of these our days may wish to guard themselves against the impiety of men such as we have_been speaking of , they_are unable to do so , seeing that_they profess to hold and defend the very same principles of jurisprudence ; and hence they_have to go with times , and render divorce easily obtainable . History itself shows this ; for , to pass over other instances , we find that , -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the last century , divorces were sanctioned by law in that upheaval or , rather , as it might be called , conflagration in France , when society was wholly degraded by the abandoning of God . Many -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time would fain have those laws reenacted , because_they wish God and His Church to be altogether exiled and excluded from the midst of human_society , madly thinking that in such laws a final remedy must be sought for that moral corruption which_-isaia- advancing with rapid strides . Truly , it -isaia- hardly possible to describe how_great are the evils that flow from divorce . Matrimonial contracts are by it made variable ; mutual kindness -isaia- weakened ; deplorable inducements to unfaithfulness are supplied ; harm -isaia- done to the education and training of children ; occasion -isaia- afforded for the breaking up of homes ; the seeds of dissension are sown among families ; the dignity of womanhood -isaia- lessened and brought low , and women run the risk of being deserted after_having ministered to the pleasures of men . Since , then , nothing has such power to lay waste families and destroy the mainstay of kingdoms as the corruption of morals , it -isaia- easily seen that divorces are in the highest degree hostile to the prosperity of families and States , springing as they do from the depraved morals of the people , and , as experience shows us , opening out a way to every_kind of evil doing in public and in private life . Further still , if the matter be duly pondered , we shall clearly see these evils to be the more especially dangerous , because , divorce once being tolerated , there_will be no restraint powerful enough to keep it within_the bounds marked out or presurmised . Great indeed -isaia- the force of example , and even greater still the might of passion . With such incitements it must needs follow that the eagerness for divorce , daily spreading by devious ways , will seize upon the minds of many like a virulent contagious disease , or like a flood of water bursting through every barrier . These are truths that doubtlessly are all clear in themselves , but_they will_become clearer yet if we call to mind the teachings of experience . So soon as the road to divorce began to be made smooth by law , -atti_degli_apostoli- once quarrels , jealousies , and judicial separations largely increased ; and such shamelessness of life followed that_men who had_been in favor of these divorces repented of what_they had done , and feared that , if they did_not carefully seek a remedy by repealing the law , the State itself might come to ruin . The Romans of old are said to have shrunk with horror from the first example of divorce , but ere long all sense of decency was blunted in their soul ; the meager restraint of passion died out , and the marriage vow was so often broken that_what some writers have affirmed would seem to be true namely , women used to reckon years not by the change of consuls , but of their husbands . In like_manner , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , Protestants allowed legalized divorces in certain although but few cases , and yet from the affinity of circumstances of like kind , the number of divorces increased to such extent in Germany , America , and elsewhere that all wise thinkers deplored the boundless corruption of morals , and judged the recklessness of the laws to be simply intolerable . Even in Catholic States the evil existed . For whenever -atti_degli_apostoli- any time divorce was introduced , the abundance of misery that followed far exceeded all that the framers of the law could have foreseen . In fact , many lent their_minds to contrive all kinds of fraud and device , and by accusations of cruelty , violence , and adultery to feign grounds for the dissolution of the matrimonial bond of which_they had grown weary ; and all this with so great havoc to morals that an amendment of the laws was deemed to be urgently needed . Can anyone , therefore , doubt_that laws in favor of divorce would_have a result equally baneful and calamitous were they to be passed in these our days ? There exists not , indeed , in the projects and enactments of men any power to change the character and tendency with things have_received from nature . Those men , therefore , show but little wisdom in the idea they_have formed of the well_being of the commonwealth who think_that the inherent character of marriage can be perverted with impunity ; and who , disregarding the sanctity of religion and of the sacrament , seem to wish to degrade and dishonor marriage more basely than was done even by heathen laws . Indeed , if they_do_not change their views , not_only private families , but all public society , will_have unceasing cause to fear lest they_should be miserably driven into that general confusion and overthrow of order which_-isaia- even_now the wicked aim of socialists and communists . Thus we see most clearly how foolish and senseless it -isaia- to expect any public good from divorce , when , on the contrary , it tends to the certain destruction of society . It must consequently be acknowledged that the Church has deserved exceedingly well of all nations by her ever watchful care in guarding the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage . Again , no small amount of gratitude -isaia- owing to her for having , during the last hundred years , openly denounced the wicked laws which_have grievously offended on this particular subject ; as well as for_her having branded with anathema the baneful heresy obtaining among Protestants touching divorce and separation ; also , for having in many_ways condemned the habitual dissolution of marriage among the Greeks ; for having declared invalid all marriages contracted upon the understanding that_they_may be -atti_degli_apostoli- some future time dissolved ; and , lastly , for having , from the earliest times , repudiated the imperial laws which disastrously favored divorce . As often , indeed , as the supreme pontiffs have resisted the most powerful among rulers , in their threatening demands_that divorces carried_out by them should be confirmed by the Church , so often must we account them to have_been contending for the safety , not_only of religion , but_also of the human_race . For this_reason all generations of men will admire the proofs of unbending courage which_are to be found in the decrees of Nicholas I against Lothair ; of Urban II and Paschal II against Philip I of France ; of Celestine III and Innocent III against Alphonsus of Leon and Philip II of France ; of Clement VII and Paul III against Henry VIII ; and , lastly , of Pius VII , that holy and courageous pontiff , against Napoleon I , when -atti_degli_apostoli- the height of his prosperity and in the fullness of his_power . This being so , all rulers and administrators of the State who_are desirous of following the dictates of reason and wisdom , and anxious for the good of their_people , ought to make up their_minds to keep the holy laws of marriage intact , and to make_use of the proffered aid of the Church for securing the safety of morals and the happiness of families , rather_than suspect her of hostile intention and falsely and wickedly accuse her of violating the civil law . They should do this_the more readily because the Catholic Church , though powerless in any_way to abandon the duties of her office or the defence of her authority , still very greatly inclines to kindness and indulgence whenever they_are consistent with the safety of her rights and the sanctity of her duties . Wherefore she makes no decrees in relation to marriage without having regard to the state of the body politic and the condition of the general public ; and has besides more_than_once mitigated , as far_as_possible , the enactments of her_own laws when there_were just and weighty reasons . Moreover , she_-isaia- not unaware , and never calls in doubt , that the sacrament of marriage , being instituted for the preservation and increase of the human_race , has a necessary relation to circumstances of life_which , though connected_with marriage , belong to the civil order , and about which_the State rightly makes strict inquiry and justly promulgates decrees . Yet , no one doubts that Jesus Christ , the Founder of the Church , willed her sacred power to be distinct from the civil_power , and each power to be free and unshackled in its_own sphere : with this condition , however a condition good for both , and of advantage to all men that union and concord should be maintained between_them ; and that on those questions which_are , though in different_ways , of common right and authority , the power to which secular matters have_been entrusted should happily and becomingly depend on the other power which_has in its charge the interests of heaven . In such arrangement and harmony -isaia- found not_only the best line of action for each power , but_also the most opportune and efficacious method of helping men in all that pertains to their_life here , and to their hope of salvation hereafter . For , as We have shown in former encyclical letters , the intellect of man_-isaia- greatly ennobled by the Christian faith , and made better able to shun and banish all error , while faith borrows in turn no little help from the intellect ; and in like_manner , when_the civil_power -isaia- on friendly terms with the sacred authority of the Church , there accrues to both a great increase of usefulness . The dignity of the one_-isaia- exalted , and so long as religion_-isaia- its guide it will_never rule unjustly ; while the other receives help of protection and defence for the public good of the faithful . Being moved , therefore , by these considerations , as We have exhorted rulers -atti_degli_apostoli- other times , so still_more earnestly We exhort them now , to concord and friendly feeling ; and we are the first to stretch out Our hand to them_with fatherly benevolence , and to offer to them the help of Our supreme_authority , a help which_-isaia- the more necessary -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time when , in public opinion , the authority of rulers -isaia- wounded and enfeebled . Now that the minds of so many are inflamed with a reckless spirit of liberty , and men_are wickedly endeavoring to get rid of every restraint of authority , however legitimate it may be , the public safety demands_that both powers should unite their strength to avert the evils which_are hanging , not_only over the Church , but_also over civil_society . But , while earnestly exhorting all to a friendly union of will , and beseeching God , the Prince of peace , to infuse a love of concord into all hearts , We cannot , venerable_brothers , refrain from urging you more_and_more to fresh earnestness , and zeal , and watchfulness , though we know that_these are_already very great . With every_effort and with all authority , strive , as much as you are_able , to preserve whole and undefiled among the people committed to your charge the doctrine which Christ our Lord taught us ; which_the Apostles , the interpreters of the will of God , have handed_down ; and which_the Catholic Church has herself scrupulously guarded , and commanded to be believed in all ages by the faithful of Christ . Let special_care be taken that the people be well instructed in the precepts of Christian wisdom , so that_they_may always remember_that marriage was_not instituted by the will of man , but , from the very_beginning , by the authority and command of God ; that it does_not admit of plurality of wives or husbands ; that Christ , the Author of the New Covenant , raised it from a rite of nature to be a sacrament , and gave to His Church legislative and judicial power with_regard to the bond of union . On this_point the very greatest care must_be_taken to instruct them , lest their_minds should be led into error by the unsound conclusions of adversaries who desire_that the Church should be deprived of that power . In like_manner , all ought to understand clearly that , if there be any union of a man and a woman among the faithful of Christ which_-isaia-_not a sacrament , such union has not the force and nature of a proper marriage ; that , although contracted in accordance_with_the laws of the State , it cannot be more_than a rite or custom introduced by the civil law . Further , the civil law can deal_with and decide those matters alone which in the civil order spring from marriage , and which_cannot possibly exist , as -isaia- evident , unless there be a true and lawful cause of them , that_-isaia- to say , the nuptial bond . It -isaia- of the greatest consequence to husband_and_wife that all these_things should be known and well understood by them , in order that_they_may conform to the laws of the State , if there be no objection on the part of the Church ; for the Church wishes the effects of marriage to be guarded in all possible ways , and that no harm may come to the children . In the great confusion of opinions , however , which day_by_day -isaia- spreading more_and_more widely , it should further be known that no power can dissolve the bond of Christian marriage whenever this has_been ratified and consummated ; and that , of a consequence , those husbands and wives are guilty of a manifest crime who plan , for whatever reason , to be united in a second marriage before the first one has_been ended by death . When , indeed , matters have come to such a pitch that it seems impossible for them to live together any longer , then the Church allows them to live apart , and strives -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to soften the evils of this separation by such remedies and helps as are suited to their condition ; yet she never ceases to endeavor to bring_about a reconciliation , and never despairs of doing so . But these_are extreme cases ; and they_would seldom exist if men_and_women entered into the married state with proper dispositions , not influenced by passion , but entertaining right ideas of the duties of marriage and of its noble purpose ; neither would they anticipate their marriage by a series of sins drawing down upon them the wrath of God . To sum up all in a few words , there_would be a calm and quiet constancy in marriage if married people would gather strength and life from the virtue of religion alone , which imparts to us resolution and fortitude ; for religion would enable them to bear tranquilly and even gladly the trials of their state , such as , for instance , the faults that_they discover in one_another , the difference of temper and character , the weight of a mother s cares , the wearing anxiety about the education of children , reverses of fortune , and the sorrows of life . Care also must_be_taken that they_do_not easily enter_into marriage with_those_who are_not Catholics ; for , when minds do not agree as to the observances of religion , it -isaia- scarcely possible to hope_for agreement in other_things . Other reasons also proving that persons should turn with dread from such marriages are chiefly these : that_they give occasion to forbidden association and communion in religious matters ; endanger the faith of the Catholic partner ; are a hindrance to the proper education of the children ; and often lead to a mixing up of truth and falsehood , and to the belief that all religions are equally good . Lastly , since We well know_that none should be excluded from Our charity , We commend , venerable_brothers , to your fidelity and piety those unhappy persons_who , carried away by the heat of passion , and being utterly indifferent to their salvation , live wickedly together without_the bond of lawful marriage . Let your utmost care be exercised in bringing such persons back to their_duty ; and , both by your_own efforts and by those of good men who_will consent to help you , strive by every_means that_they_may see_how wrongly they_have acted ; that_they_may do penance ; and that_they_may be induced to enter_into a lawful marriage according to the Catholic rite . You will -atti_degli_apostoli- once see , venerable_brothers , that the doctrine and precepts in relation to Christian marriage , which We have thought good to communicate to you in this_letter , tend no less to the preservation of civil_society than to the everlasting salvation_of_souls . May God grant that , by reason of their gravity and importance , minds may everywhere be found docile and ready to obey them ! For this_end let us all suppliantly , with humble prayer , implore the help of the Blessed and Immaculate Virgin Mary , that , our_hearts being quickened to the obedience of faith , she may show herself our_mother and our helper . With equal earnestness let us ask the princes of the Apostles , Peter and Paul , the destroyers of heresies , the sowers of the seed of truth , to save the human_race by their powerful patronage from the deluge of errors that_-isaia- surging afresh . In the meantime , as an earnest of heavenly_gifts , and a testimony of Our special benevolence , We grant to you all , venerable_brothers , and to the people confided to your charge , from the depths of Our heart , the apostolic_benediction .

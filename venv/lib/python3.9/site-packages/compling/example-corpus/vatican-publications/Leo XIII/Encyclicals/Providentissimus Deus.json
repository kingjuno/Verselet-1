Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The God of all Providence , Who in the adorable designs of His love -atti_degli_apostoli- first elevated the human_race to the participation of the Divine nature , and afterwards delivered it from universal guilt and ruin , restoring it to its primitive dignity , has in consequence bestowed upon man a splendid gift and safeguard making known to him , by supernatural means , the hidden mysteries of His Divinity , His wisdom and His mercy . For although in Divine revelation there_are contained some things_which are_not beyond_the reach of unassisted reason , and which_are made the objects of such revelation in order '' that all may come to know them_with facility , certainty , and safety from error , yet not on this account can supernatural Revelation be said to be absolutely necessary ; it -isaia- only necessary because God has ordinated man to a supernatural end . '' This supernatural revelation , according to the belief of the universal Church , -isaia- contained both in unwritten Tradition , and in written Books , which_are therefore called sacred and canonical because , '' being written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , they_have God for their author and as such have_been delivered to the Church . '' This belief has_been perpetually held and professed by the Church in regard to the Books of both Testaments ; and there_are well_known documents of the gravest kind , coming down to us from the earliest times , which proclaim that God , Who spoke first by the Prophets , then by His own mouth , and lastly by the Apostles , composed also the Canonical Scriptures , and that_these are His own oracles and words a Letter , written by our heavenly Father , and transmitted by the sacred writers to the human_race in its pilgrimage so far from its heavenly country . If , then , such and so great -isaia- the excellence and the dignity of the Scriptures , that God Himself has composed them , and that_they treat of God s marvellous mysteries , counsels and works , it follows_that the branch of sacred Theology which_-isaia- concerned_with the defence and elucidation of these divine Books must be excellent and useful in the highest degree . Now We , who by the help of God , and not_without fruit , have by frequent Letters and exhortation endeavoured to promote other branches of study which seemed capable of advancing the glory of God and contributing to the salvation_of_souls , have for a long time cherished the desire to give an impulse to the noble science of Holy Scripture , and to impart to Scripture study a direction suitable to the needs of the present_day . The solicitude of the Apostolic office naturally urges , and even compels us , not_only to desire_that this grand source of Catholic revelation should be made safely and abundantly accessible to the flock of Jesus Christ , but_also not to suffer any attempt to defile or corrupt it , either on the part of those_who impiously and openly assail the Scriptures , or of those_who_are led astray into fallacious and imprudent novelties . We are_not ignorant , indeed , Venerable Brethren , that_there are not_a_few Catholics , men of talent and learning , who do devote_themselves with ardour to the defence of the sacred writings and to making them better known and understood . But whilst giving to these the commendation they deserve , We cannot_but earnestly exhort others also , from whose skill and piety and learning we have a right to expect good results , to give themselves to the same most praiseworthy work . It -isaia- Our wish and fervent desire to see an increase in the number of the approved and persevering labourers in the cause of Holy Scripture ; and more especially that_those whom Divine Grace has called to Holy Orders , should , day_by_day , as their state demands , display greater diligence and industry in reading , meditating , and explaining it . Holy Scripture Most Profitable To Doctrine and Morality . Among the reasons for_which the Holy Scripture -isaia- so worthy of commendation in addition to its_own excellence and to the homage which we owe to God s Word the chief of all -isaia- , the innumerable benefits of which it -isaia-_the_source ; according to the infallible testimony of the Holy Ghost Himself , who says : '' All Scripture , inspired of God , -isaia- profitable to teach , to reprove , to correct , to instruct in justice , that the man of God may be perfect , furnished to every good work . '' That such was_the purpose of God in giving the Scripture of men -isaia- shown by the example of Christ our Lord and of His Apostles . For He Himself Who '' obtained authority by miracles , merited belief by authority , and by belief drew to Himself the multitude '' was accustomed in the exercise of His Divine Mission , to appeal to the Scriptures . He uses them -atti_degli_apostoli- times to prove that He -isaia- sent by God , and -isaia- God Himself . From them He cites instructions for His disciples and confirmation of His doctrine . He vindicates them_from the calumnies of objectors ; he quotes them against Sadducees and Pharisees , and retorts from them upon Satan himself when he dares to tempt Him . At the close of His life His utterances are from Holy Scripture , and it -isaia- the Scripture that He expounds to His disciples after His resurrection , until He ascends to the glory of His Father . Faithful to His precepts , the Apostles , although He Himself granted '' signs and wonders to be done by their hands '' nevertheless used with the greatest effect the sacred writings , in order to persuade the nations everywhere of the wisdom of Christianity , to conquer the obstinacy of the Jews , and to suppress the outbreak of heresy . This -isaia- plainly seen in their discourses , especially in those of St . Peter : these were often little less_than a series of citations from the Old Testament supporting in the strongest manner the new dispensation . We find the same thing in the Gospels of St . John and in the Catholic Epistles ; and most remarkably of all in the words of him_who '' boasts that he learned the law -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of Gamaliel , in order_that , being armed with spiritual weapons , he might afterwards say with confidence , The arms of our warfare are_not carnal but mighty unto God . '' Let all , therefore , especially_the novices of the ecclesiastical army , understand how deeply the sacred Books should be esteemed , and with what eagerness and reverence they_should approach this_great arsenal of heavenly arms . For those_whose duty it -isaia- to handle Catholic doctrine before the learned or the unlearned will nowhere find more ample matter or more abundant exhortation , whether on the subject of God , the supreme Good and the all perfect Being , or of the works which display His Glory and His love . Nowhere -isaia- there anything more full or more express on the subject of the Saviour of the world than -isaia- to be found in the whole range of the Bible . Jerome says , '' To be ignorant of the Scripture -isaia- not to know Christ . '' In its pages His Image stands out , living and breathing ; diffusing everywhere around consolation in trouble , encouragement to virtue and attraction to the love of God . And as to the Church , her institutions , her nature , her office , and her gifts , we find in Holy Scripture so many references and so many ready and convincing arguments , that as St . Jerome again most truly says : '' A man who_-isaia- well grounded in the testimonies of the Scripture -isaia- the bulwark of the Church . '' And if we come to morality and discipline , an apostolic man finds in the sacred writings abundant and excellent assistance ; most_holy precepts , gentle and strong exhortation , splendid examples of every virtue , and finally the promise of eternal reward and the threat of eternal punishment , uttered in terms of solemn import , in God s name and in God s own words . And it -isaia- this peculiar and singular power of Holy Scripture , arising from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , which_gives authority to the sacred orator , fills him_with apostolic liberty of speech , and communicates force and power to his eloquence . For those_who infuse into their_efforts the spirit and strength of the Word of God , speak '' not in word only but in power also , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much fulness . '' Hence those preachers are foolish and improvident who , in speaking of religion and proclaiming the things of God , use no words but those of human science and human prudence , trusting to their_own reasonings rather_than to those of God . Their discourses may be brilliant and fine , but they_must be feeble and they_must be cold , for they_are without_the fire of the utterance of God and they_must fall far short of that mighty power which_the speech of God possesses : '' for the Word of God -isaia- living and effectual , and more piercing than_any two edged sword ; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit . '' But , indeed , all those_who_have a right to speak are agreed that_there_-isaia- in the Holy Scripture an eloquence that_-isaia- wonderfully varied and rich , and worthy of great themes . Augustine thoroughly understood and has abundantly set_forth . This also -isaia- confirmed by the best preachers of all ages , who_have gratefully acknowledged that_they owed their repute chiefly to the assiduous use of the Bible , and to devout meditation on its pages . The Holy Fathers well knew all this by practical experience , and they never cease to extol the sacred Scripture and its fruits . In innumerable passages of their writings we find them applying to it such phrases as '' an inexhaustible treasury of heavenly doctrine , '' or '' an overflowing fountain of salvation , '' or putting it before us as fertile pastures and beautiful gardens in which_the flock of the Lord -isaia- marvellously refreshed and delighted . Let us listen to the words of St . Jerome , in his Epistle to Nepotian : '' Often read the divine Scriptures ; yea , let holy reading be always in thy hand ; study that_which thou thyself must preach . Let the speech of the priest be ever seasoned with Scriptural reading . Gregory the Great , than whom no one_has more admirably described the pastoral_office , writes in the same sense : '' Those , '' he says , '' who_are zealous in the work of preaching must_never cease the study of the written word of God . Augustine , however , warns us that '' vainly does the preacher utter the Word of God exteriorly unless he listens to it interiorly ; '' and St . Gregory instructs sacred orators '' first to find in Holy Scripture the knowledge of themselves , and then to carry it to others , lest in reproving others they forget themselves . '' Admonitions such as these had , indeed , been uttered long before by the Apostolic voice which_had learnt its lesson from Christ Himself , Who '' began to do and teach . '' It was_not to Timothy alone , but to the whole order of the clergy , that the command was addressed : '' Take heed to thyself and to doctrine ; be earnest in them . For in doing this thou shah both save thyself and them that hear thee . '' For the saving and for the perfection of ourselves and of others there_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand the very best of help in the Holy Scriptures , as the Book of Psalms , among others , so constantly insists ; but those only will_find it who bring to this_divine reading not_only docility and attention , but_also piety and an innocent life . For the Sacred Scripture -isaia- not like other books . Dictated by the Holy Ghost , it contains things of the deepest importance , which in many instances are_most difficult and obscure . To understand and explain such things there_-isaia- always required the '' coming '' of the same Holy Spirit ; that_-isaia- to say , His light and His grace ; and these , as the Royal Psalmist so frequently insists , are to be sought by humble prayer and guarded by holiness of life . What the Bible Owes to the Catholic Church . It -isaia- in this_that the watchful care of the Church shines_forth conspicuously . By admirable laws and regulations , she has_always shown herself solicitous that '' the celestial treasure of the Sacred Books , so bountifully bestowed upon man by the Holy Spirit , should_not lie neglected . '' She has prescribed that a considerable portion of them shall be read and piously reflected upon by all her ministers in the daily office of the sacred psalmody . She has ordered that in Cathedral Churches , in monasteries , and in other convents in which study can conveniently be pursued , they_shall be expounded and interpreted by capable men ; and she_has strictly commanded that her_children shall be fed with the saving words of the Gospel -atti_degli_apostoli- least on Sundays and solemn feasts . Moreover , it -isaia- owing to the wisdom and exertions of the Church that_there has_always_been continued from century to century that cultivation of Holy Scripture which_has_been so remarkable and has borne such ample fruit . And here , in order to strengthen Our teaching and Our exhortations , it -isaia- well to recall how , from the beginning of Christianity , all who_have_been renowned for holiness of life and sacred learning have_given their deep and constant attention to Holy Scripture . If we consider_the immediate disciples of the Apostles , St . Polycarp or the apologists , such as St . Irenaeus , we find that in their letters and their books , whether in defence of the Catholic Faith or in its commendation , they draw faith , strength , and unction from the Word of God . When there arose , in various Sees , Catechetical and Theological schools , of which_the most celebrated were those of Alexandria and of Antioch , there_was little taught in those schools but_what was contained in the reading , the interpretation and the defence of the divine written word . From them came forth numbers of Fathers and writers whose laborious studies and admirable writings have justly merited for the three following centuries the appellation of the golden age of biblical exegesis . In the Eastern Church , the greatest name of all -isaia- Origen a man remarkable alike for penetration of genius and for persevering labour ; from whose numerous works and his great Hexapla almost all have drawn that came after him . Others who_have widened the field of this science may also be named , as especially eminent ; thus , Alexandria could boast of St . Cyril ; Palestine , of Eusebius and the other St . Basil the Great and the two St . Gregories of Nazianzus and Nyssa ; Antioch , of St . John Chrysostom , in whom_the science of Scripture was rivalled by the splendour of his eloquence . In the Western Church there_were many names as great : Tertullian , St . Leo the Great , St . Gregory the Great ; most famous of all , St . Jerome , of whom_the former was so marvellously acute in penetrating the sense of God s Word and so fertile in the use that he made of it for the promotion of the Catholic truth , and the latter has received_from_the Church , by reason of his pre eminent knowledge of Scripture and his labours in promoting its use , the name of the '' great Doctor . '' From this period down to the eleventh century , although Biblical studies did_not flourish with the same vigour and the same fruitfulness as before , yet they did flourish , and principally by the instrumentality of the clergy . It was their care and solicitude that selected the best and most useful things_that the ancients had left , arranged them in order , and published them_with additions of their_own as did S . Isidore of Seville , Venerable Bede , and Alcuin , among the most prominent ; it was they_who illustrated the sacred pages with '' glosses '' or short commentaries , as we see in Walafrid Strabo and St . Anselm of Laon , or expended fresh labour in securing their integrity , as did St . Peter Damian and Blessed Lanfranc . In the twelfth century many took up with_great success the allegorical exposition of Scripture . Bernard -isaia- pre eminent ; and his writings , it may be said , are Scripture all through . With the age of the scholastics came fresh and welcome progress in the study of the Bible . That the scholastics were solicitous about the genuineness of the Latin version -isaia- evident from the Correctoria Biblica , or lists of emendations , which_they_have left . But they expended their labours and industry chiefly on interpretation and explanation . To them we owe the accurate and clear distinction , such as had not been_given before , of the various senses of the sacred words ; the assignment of the value of each '' sense '' in theology ; the division of books into parts , and the summaries of the various parts ; the investigation of the objects of the writers ; the demonstration of the connection of sentence with sentence , and clause with clause ; all of which_-isaia- calculated to throw much light on the more obscure passages of the sacred volume . The valuable work of the scholastics in Holy Scripture -isaia- seen in their theological treatises and in their Scripture commentaries ; and in this respect the greatest name among_them all -isaia- St . When our predecessor , Clement V . , established chairs of Oriental literature in the Roman College and in the principal Universities of Europe , Catholics began to make more accurate investigation on the original text of the Bible , as well as on the Latin version . The revival amongst us of Greek learning , and , much_more , the happy invention of the art of printing , gave a strong impetus to Biblical studies . In a brief space of time , innumerable editions , especially of the Vulgate , poured from the press and were diffused throughout_the Catholic world ; so honoured and loved was Holy Scripture during that_very period against which_the enemies of the Church direct their calumnies . Nor must we forget how_many learned men there_were , chiefly among the religious_orders , who did excellent work_for the Bible between_the Council of Vienne and that of Trent ; men_who , by the employment of modern means and appliances , and by the tribute of their_own genius and learning , not_only added to the rich stores of ancient times , but prepared the way_for the succeeding century , the century which followed the Council of Trent , when it almost seemed that the great age of the Fathers had returned . For it -isaia- well_known , and We recall it with pleasure , that Our predecessors from Pius IV . caused to be prepared the celebrated editions of the Vulgate and the Septuagint , which , having_been published by the command and authority of Sixtus V . and of the same Clement , are_now in common use . At this_time , moreover , were carefully brought out various other ancient versions of the Bible , and the Polyglots of Antwerp and of Paris , most important_for the investigation of the true meaning of the text ; nor_-isaia- there any_one Book of either Testament which did_not find more_than one expositor , nor any grave question which did_not profitably exercise the ability of many inquirers , among whom there_are not_a_few more especially of those_who made most use of the Fathers who_have acquired great reputation . From that_time downwards the labour and solicitude of Catholics has_never been wanting ; for , as time went on , eminent scholars have carried on Biblical study with success , and have defended Holy Scripture against rationalism with the same weapons of philology and kindred sciences with_which it had_been attacked . The calm and fair consideration of what_has_been said will clearly show that the Church has_never failed in taking due measures to bring_the Scriptures within reach of her_children , and that_she has_ever held fast and exercised profitably that guardianship conferred upon her by Almighty God for the protection and glory of His Holy Word ; so that_she has_never required , nor_does she now require , any stimulation from without . How to Study Holy Scripture . We must now , Venerable Brethren , as our purpose demands , impart to you such counsels as seem best suited for carrying on successfully the study of Biblical science . But first it must be clearly understood whom we have to oppose and contend against , and what_are their tactics and their arms . In earlier times the contest was chiefly with_those_who , relying on private judgment and repudiating the divine traditions and teaching office of the Church , held the Scriptures to be the one source of revelation and the final appeal in matters of Faith . Now , we have to meet_the Rationalists , true children and inheritors of the older heretics , who , trusting in their turn to their_own way of thinking , have rejected even the scraps and remnants of Christian belief which_had_been handed_down to them . They deny that_there_-isaia- any such thing as revelation or inspiration , or Holy Scripture -atti_degli_apostoli- all ; they see , instead , only the forgeries and the falsehoods of men ; they set down the Scripture narratives as stupid fables and lying stories : the prophecies and the oracles of God are to them either predictions made up after_the event or forecasts formed by the light of nature ; the miracles and the wonders of God s power are_not what_they are said to be , but the startling effects of natural_law , or else mere tricks and myths ; and the Apostolic Gospels and writings are_not the work of the Apostles -atti_degli_apostoli- all . These detestable errors , whereby they think they destroy the truth of the divine Books , are obtruded on the world as the peremptory pronouncements of a certain newly invented '' free science ; '' a science , however , which_-isaia- so far from final that_they_are perpetually modifying and supplementing it . And there_are_some of them who , notwithstanding their impious opinions and utterances about God , and Christ , the Gospels and the rest of Holy Scripture , would faro be considered both theologians and Christians and men of the Gospel , and who attempt to disguise by such honourable names their rashness and their pride . To them we must add not_a_few professors of other sciences who approve their views and give_them assistance , and are urged to attack the Bible by a similar intolerance of revelation . And it -isaia- deplorable to see these attacks growing every_day more numerous and more severe . It -isaia- sometimes men of learning and judgment who_are assailed ; but these have little difficulty in defending themselves from evil consequences . The efforts and the arts of the enemy are chiefly directed against the more ignorant masses of the people . They diffuse their deadly poison by means of books , pamphlets , and newspapers ; they spread it by addresses and by conversation ; they are_found everywhere ; and they_are in possession of numerous schools , taken by violence from the Church , in which , by ridicule and scurrilous jesting , they pervert the credulous and unformed minds of the young to the contempt of Holy Scripture . Should not these_things , Venerable Brethren , stir up and set on fire the heart of every Pastor , so that to this '' knowledge , falsely so called , '' may be opposed the ancient and true science which_the Church , through the Apostles , has received_from Christ , and that Holy Scripture may find the champions that_are needed in so momentous a battle ? . Let our_first care , then be to see_that in Seminaries and Academical institutions the study of Holy Scripture be placed on such a footing as its_own importance and the circumstances of the time demand . With this view , the first thing which requires attention -isaia- the wise choice of Professors . Teachers of Sacred Scripture are_not to be appointed -atti_degli_apostoli- hap hazard out of the crowd ; but they_must be men whose character and fitness are proved by their love of , and their long familiarity with , the Bible , and by suitable learning and study . It -isaia-_a_matter of equal importance to provide in time for a continuous succession of such teachers ; and it will be well , wherever this_can be done , to select young men_of_good promise who_have successfully accomplished their theological course , and to set them apart exclusively for Holy Scripture , affording them facilities for full and complete studies . Professors thus chosen and thus prepared may enter with confidence on the task that_-isaia- appointed for them ; and that_they_may carry_out_their work well and profitably , let_them take heed to the instructions We now proceed to give . At the commencement of a course of Holy Scripture let_the Professor strive earnestly to form the judgment of the young beginners so as to train them equally to defend the sacred writings and to penetrate their meaning . This -isaia- the object of the treatise which_-isaia- called '' Introduction . '' Here the student -isaia- taught how to prove the integrity and authority of the Bible , how to investigate and ascertain its true sense , and how to meet and refute objections . It -isaia- needless to insist upon the importance of making these preliminary studies in an orderly and thorough fashion , with the accompaniment and assistance of Theology ; for the whole subsequent course must rest on the foundation thus laid and make_use of the light thus acquired . Next , the teacher will turn his earnest attention to that more fruitful division of Scripture science which_has to do with Interpretation ; wherein -isaia- imparted the method of using the word of God for the advantage of religion and piety . We recognize without hesitation that neither the extent of the matter nor the time -atti_degli_apostoli- disposal allows each single Book of the Bible to be separately gone through . But the teaching should result in a definite and ascertained method of interpretation and therefore the Professor should equally avoid the mistake of giving a mere taste of every Book , and of dwelling -atti_degli_apostoli- too great length on a part of one Book . If most schools cannot do what_-isaia- done in the large institutions that_-isaia- , take the students through the whole of one or two Books continuously and with a certain development yet -atti_degli_apostoli- least those parts which_are selected should be treated with suitable fulness ; in such_a_way_that the students may learn from the sample that_-isaia- thus put before them to love and use the remainder of the sacred Book during the whole of their_lives . The Professor , following the tradition of antiquity , will_make use of the Vulgate as his text ; for the Council of Trent decreed that '' in public lectures , disputations , preaching , and exposition , '' the Vulgate -isaia- the '' authentic '' version ; and this_-isaia- the existing custom of the Church . At the same_time , the other versions which Christian antiquity has approved , should_not be neglected , more especially_the more ancient MSS . For although the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek -isaia- substantially rendered by the Vulgate , nevertheless wherever there_may be ambiguity or want of clearness , the '' examination of older tongues , '' to quote St . Augustine , will be useful and advantageous . But in this_matter we need hardly say that the greatest prudence -isaia- required , for the '' office of a commentator , '' as St . Jerome says , '' -isaia- to set_forth not what he himself would prefer , but_what his author says . '' The question of '' readings '' having_been , when necessary , carefully discussed , the next thing -isaia- to investigate and expound the meaning . And the first counsel to be given -isaia- this : That the more our adversaries contend to the contrary , so much the more solicitously should we adhere to the received and approved canons of interpretation . Hence , whilst weighing the meanings of words , the connection of ideas , the parallelism of passages , and the like , we should by all means make_use of such illustrations as can be drawn_from apposite erudition of an external sort ; but_this should be done with caution , so as not to bestow on questions of this_kind more labour and time than are spent on the Sacred Books themselves , and not to overload the minds of the students with a mass of information that_will be rather a hindrance than a help . Holy Scripture and Theology ; Interpretation ; the Fathers . The Professor may now safely pass on to the use of Scripture in matters of Theology . On this head it must be observed that in addition to the usual reasons which_make ancient writings more_or_less difficult to understand , there_are_some which_are peculiar to the Bible . For the language of the Bible -isaia- employed to express , under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , many things_which are beyond_the power and scope of the reason of man that_-isaia- to say , divine mysteries and all that_-isaia- related to them . There -isaia- sometimes in such passages a fullness and a hidden depth of meaning which_the letter hardly expresses and which_the laws of interpretation hardly warrant . Moreover , the literal sense itself frequently admits other senses , adapted to illustrate dogma or to confirm morality . Wherefore it must be recognized that the sacred writings are wrapt in a certain religious obscurity , and that_no_one can enter_into their interior without a guide ; God so disposing , as the Holy Fathers commonly teach , in order_that men may investigate them with_greater ardour and earnestness , and that what_-isaia- attained with difficulty may sink more_deeply into the mind_and_heart ; and , most of all , that_they_may understand_that God has delivered the Holy Scriptures to the Church , and that in reading and making use of His Word , they_must follow_the Church as their guide and their teacher . Irenaeus long since laid_down , that where_the charismata of God were , there the truth was to be learnt , and that Holy Scripture was safely interpreted by those_who had the Apostolic succession . His teaching , and that of other Holy Fathers , -isaia- taken up by the Council of the Vatican , which , in renewing the decree of Trent declares its '' mind '' to be this_that '' in things of faith_and_morals , belonging to the building up of Christian doctrine , that_-isaia- to be considered the true sense of Holy Scripture which_has_been held and -isaia- held by our Holy Mother the Church , whose place it -isaia- to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures ; and therefore that_it_-isaia- permitted to no one to interpret Holy Scripture against such sense or also against the unanimous agreement of the Fathers . '' By this_most wise decree the Church by no means prevents or restrains the pursuit of Biblical science , but_rather protects it from error , and largely assists its real progress . A wide field -isaia- still left open to the private student , in which his hermeneutical skill may display itself with signal effect and to the advantage of the Church . On the one_hand , in those passages of Holy Scripture which_have not as yet received a certain and definitive interpretation , such labours may , in the benignant providence of God , prepare for and bring to maturity the judgment of the Church ; on the other , in passages already defined , the private student may do work equally valuable , either by setting them forth more_clearly to the flock and more skilfully to scholars , or by defending them more powerfully from hostile attack . Wherefore the first and dearest object of the Catholic commentator should be to interpret those passages which have_received an authentic interpretation either from the sacred writers themselves , under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost as in many places of the New Testament , or from the Church , under the assistance of the same Holy Spirit , whether by her solemn judgment or her ordinary and universal magisterium to interpret these passages in that identical sense , and to prove , by all the resources of science , that sound hermeneutical laws admit of no other interpretation . In the other passages , the analogy of faith should be followed , and Catholic doctrine , as authoritatively proposed by the Church , should be held as the supreme law ; for , seeing that the same God -isaia- the author both of the Sacred Books and of the doctrine committed to the Church , it -isaia- clearly impossible that any teaching can by legitimate means be extracted from the former , which shall in any respect be -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the latter . Hence it follows_that all interpretation -isaia- foolish and false which either makes_the sacred writers disagree one_with another , or -isaia- opposed to the doctrine of the Church . The Professor of Holy Scripture , therefore , amongst other recommendations , must be well acquainted with the whole circle of Theology and deeply read in the commentaries of the Holy Fathers and Doctors , and other interpreters of mark . This -isaia- inculcated by St . Jerome , and still_more frequently by St . Augustine , who thus justly complains : '' If there_-isaia- no branch of teaching , however humble and easy to learn , which_does_not require a master , what can be a greater sign of rashness and pride than to refuse to study the Books of the divine mysteries by the help of those_who_have interpreted them ? '' The other Fathers have_said the same , and have confirmed it by their example , for they '' endeavoured to acquire the understanding of the Holy Scriptures not by their_own lights and ideas , but_from the writings and authority of the ancients , who in their turn , as we know , received_the rule of interpretation in direct line from the Apostles . '' The Holy Fathers '' to whom , after_the Apostles , the Church owes its growth who_have planted , watered , built , governed , and cherished it , '' the Holy Fathers , We say , are of supreme_authority , whenever they all interpret in one_and_the_same manner any text of the Bible , as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals ; for their unanimity clearly evinces that_such interpretation has come down from the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith . The opinion of the Fathers -isaia-_also of very great weight when_they treat of these_matters in their capacity of doctors , unofficially ; not_only because_they excel in their knowledge of revealed doctrine and in their acquaintance with many things_which are useful in understanding the apostolic Books , but because_they_are men of eminent sanctity and of ardent zeal for the truth , on whom God has bestowed a more ample measure of His light . Wherefore the expositor should make it his duty to follow their footsteps with all reverence , and to use their labours with intelligent appreciation . But he must_not on that account consider that_it_-isaia- forbidden , when just cause exists , to push inquiry and exposition beyond what_the Fathers have_done ; provided he carefully observes the rule so wisely laid_down by St . Augustine not to depart from the literal and obvious sense , except only where reason makes it untenable or necessity requires ; a rule to which_it_-isaia- the more necessary to adhere strictly in these times , when_the thirst_for novelty and unrestrained freedom of thought make_the danger of error most real and proximate . Neither should those passages be neglected which_the Fathers have understood in an allegorical or figurative sense , more especially_when such interpretation -isaia- justified by the literal , and when it rests on the authority of many . For this method of interpretation has_been received by the Church from the Apostles , and has_been approved by her_own practice , as the holy Liturgy attests ; although it -isaia- true that_the_holy Fathers did_not thereby pretend directly to demonstrate dogmas of faith , but used it as a means of promoting virtue and piety , such as , by their_own experience , they knew to be most valuable . The authority of other Catholic interpreters -isaia- not so great ; but the study of Scripture has_always continued to advance in the Church , and , therefore , these commentaries also have_their own honourable place , and are serviceable in many_ways for the refutation of assailants and the explanation of difficulties . But it -isaia- most unbecoming to pass by , in ignorance or contempt , the excellent work_which Catholics have left in abundance , and to have_recourse to the works of non Catholics and to seek in them , to the detriment of sound doctrine and often to the peril of faith , the explanation of passages on which Catholics long ago have successfully employed their talent and their labour . For although the studies of non Catholics , used with prudence , may sometimes be of use to the Catholic student , he should , nevertheless , bear well in mind as the Fathers also teach in numerous passages that the sense of Holy Scripture can nowhere be found incorrupt outside of the Church , and cannot be expected to be found in writers who , being without_the true faith , only gnaw the bark of the Sacred Scripture , and never attain its pith . Most desirable -isaia- it , and most essential , that_the_whole teaching of Theology should be pervaded and animated by the use of the divine Word of God . This -isaia- what_the Fathers and the greatest theologians of all ages have desired and reduced to practice . It was chiefly out of the Sacred Writings that_they endeavoured to proclaim and establish the Articles of Faith and the truths therewith connected , and it was in them , together_with divine Tradition , that_they found the refutation of heretical error , and the reasonableness , the true meaning , and the mutual relation of the truths of Catholicism . Nor will any_one wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- this who considers that the Sacred Books hold such an eminent position among the sources of revelation that without their assiduous study and use , Theology cannot be placed on its true footing , or treated as its dignity demands . For although it -isaia- right and proper that students in academies and schools should be chiefly exercised in acquiring a scientific knowledge of dogma , by means of reasoning from the Articles of Faith to their consequences , according to the rules of approved and sound philosophy nevertheless the judicious and instructed theologian will by no means pass by that method of doctrinal demonstration which draws its proof from the authority of the Bible ; '' for Theology does_not receive her first principles from any_other science , but immediately from God by revelation . And , therefore , she does_not receive of other sciences as from a superior , but uses them as her inferiors or handmaids . '' It -isaia- this view of doctrinal teaching which_-isaia- laid_down and recommended by the prince of theologians , St . Thomas of Aquin ; who , moreover , shows such being the essential character of Christian Theology how she_can defend her_own principles against attack : '' If the adversary , '' he says , '' do but grant any portion of the divine_revelation , we have an argument against him ; thus , against a heretic we can employ Scripture authority , and against those_who deny one article , we can use another . But if our opponent reject divine_revelation entirely , there_-isaia- then no way left to prove the Article of Faith by reasoning ; we can_only solve the difficulties which_are raised against them . '' Care must_be_taken , then_,_that beginners approach the study of the Bible well prepared and furnished ; otherwise , just hopes will be frustrated , or , perchance , what_-isaia- worse , they_will unthinkingly risk the danger of error , falling an easy prey to the sophisms and laboured erudition of the Rationalists . The best preparation will be a conscientious application to philosophy and theology under_the_guidance of St . Thomas of Aquin , and a thorough training therein as We ourselves have elsewhere pointed_out and directed . By this_means , both in Biblical studies and in that part of Theology which_-isaia- called positive , they_will pursue the right path and make satisfactory progress . The Authority of Holy Scripture ; Modern Criticism ; Physical Science . To prove , to expound , to illustrate Catholic Doctrine by the legitimate and skilful interpretation of the Bible , -isaia- much ; but there_-isaia- a second part of the subject of equal importance and equal difficulty the maintenance in the strongest possible way of its_full authority . This cannot be done completely or satisfactorily except by means of the living and proper magisterium of the Church . The Church , '' by reason of her wonderful propagation , her distinguished sanctity and inexhaustible fecundity in good , her Catholic unity , and her unshaken stability , -isaia- herself a great and perpetual motive of credibility , and an unassailable testimony to her_own Divine mission . '' But since_the divine and infallible magisterium of the Church rests also on the authority of Holy Scripture , the first thing to be done -isaia- to vindicate the trustworthiness of the sacred records -atti_degli_apostoli- least as human documents , from which_can be clearly proved , as from primitive and authentic testimony , the Divinity and the mission of Christ our Lord , the institution of a hierarchical Church and the primacy of Peter and his_successors . It -isaia- most desirable , therefore_,_that there_should be numerous members of the clergy well prepared to enter upon a contest of this nature , and to repulse hostile assaults , chiefly trusting in that armour of God recommended by the Apostle , but_also not unaccustomed to modern methods of attack . This -isaia- beautifully alluded to by St . John Chrysostom , when describing the duties of priests : '' We must use every endeavour that the Word of God may dwell in us abundantly and not merely for one kind of fight must we be prepared_for the contest -isaia- many sided and the enemy -isaia- of every sort ; and they_do_not all use the same weapons nor make_their onset in the same_way . Wherefore it -isaia- needful that the man_who has to contend against all should be acquainted with the engines and the arts of all that he should be -atti_degli_apostoli- once archer and slinger , commandant and officer , general and private soldier , foot soldier and horseman , skilled in sea fight and in siege ; for unless he knows every trick and turn of war , the devil -isaia- well able , if only a single door be left open , to get in his fierce bands and carry off the sheep . '' The sophisms of the enemy and his manifold arts of attack we have_already touched upon . Let us now say a word of advice on the means of defence . The first means -isaia- the study of the Oriental languages and of the art of criticism . These two acquirements are in these_days held in high estimation , and therefore the clergy , by making themselves more_or_less fully acquainted with_them as time_and_place may demand , will the better be able to discharge their office with becoming credit ; for they_must make themselves '' all to all , '' always '' ready to satisfy every_one that asketh them a reason_for the hope that_-isaia- in them . '' Hence it -isaia- most proper that Professors of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master those tongues in which_the sacred Books were originally written ; and it would be well that Church students also should cultivate them , more especially_those who aspire to academic_degrees . And endeavours should be made to establish in all academic institutions as has_already_been laudably done in many chairs of the other ancient languages , especially_the Semitic , and of subjects connected therewith , for the benefit principally of those_who_are intended to profess sacred literature . These latter , with a similar object in view , should make themselves well and thoroughly acquainted with the art of true criticism . There has arisen , to the great detriment of religion , an inept method , dignified by the name of the '' higher criticism , '' which pretends to judge of the origin , integrity and authority of each Book from internal indications alone . It -isaia- clear , on the other_hand , that in historical questions , such as the origin and the handing down of writings , the witness of history -isaia- of primary importance , and that historical investigation should be made with the utmost care ; and that in this_matter internal evidence -isaia- seldom of great value , except as confirmation . To look upon it in any_other light will be to open the door to many evil consequences . It will_make the enemies of religion much_more bold and confident in attacking and mangling the Sacred Books ; and this vaunted '' higher criticism '' will resolve itself into the reflection of the bias and the prejudice of the critics . It will_not throw on the Scripture the light which_-isaia- sought , or prove of any advantage to doctrine ; it will only give rise to disagreement and dissension , those sure notes of error , which_the critics in question so plentifully exhibit in their_own persons ; and seeing that_most of them are tainted with false philosophy and rationalism , it must lead to the elimination from the sacred writings of all prophecy and miracle , and of everything else that_-isaia- outside the natural order . In the second place , we have to contend against those_who , making an evil use of physical science , minutely scrutinize the Sacred Book in order to detect the writers in a mistake , and to take occasion to vilify its contents . Attacks of this_kind , bearing as they do on matters of sensible experience , are peculiarly dangerous to the masses , and also to the young who_are beginning their literary studies ; for the young , if they lose their reverence for the Holy Scripture on one or more points , are easily led to give up believing in it altogether . It need not be pointed_out how the nature of science , just as it -isaia- so admirably adapted to show forth the glory of the Great Creator , provided it be taught as it should be , so if it be perversely imparted to the youthful intelligence , it may prove most fatal in destroying the principles of true philosophy and in the corruption of morality . Hence to the Professor of Sacred Scripture a knowledge of natural science will be of very great assistance in detecting such attacks on the Sacred Books , and in refuting them . There can_never , indeed , be any real discrepancy between_the theologian and the physicist , as long as each confines himself within his_own lines , and both are careful , as St . Augustine warns us , '' not to make rash assertions , or to assert what_-isaia- not known as known . '' If dissension should arise between_them , here -isaia- the rule also laid_down by St . Augustine , for the theologian : '' Whatever they_can really demonstrate to be true of physical nature , we must show to be capable of reconciliation with_our Scriptures ; and whatever they assert in their treatises which_-isaia- contrary to these Scriptures of ours , that_-isaia- to Catholic faith , we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false , or -atti_degli_apostoli- all events we must , without_the smallest hesitation , believe it to be so . '' To understand how just -isaia- the rule here formulated we must remember , first , that the sacred writers , or to speak more accurately , the Holy Ghost '' Who spoke by them , did_not intend to teach men these_things that_-isaia- to say , the essential nature of the things of the visible universe , things in no way profitable unto salvation . '' Hence they did_not seek to penetrate the secrets of nature , but_rather described and dealt_with things in more_or_less figurative language , or in terms which_were commonly used -atti_degli_apostoli- the time , and which in many instances are in daily use -atti_degli_apostoli- this_day , even by the most eminent men of science . Ordinary speech primarily and properly describes what comes under the senses ; and somewhat in the same_way the sacred writers as the Angelic Doctor also reminds us went by what sensibly appeared , '' or put down what God , speaking to men , signified , in the way men could understand and were accustomed to . The unshrinking defence of the Holy Scripture , however , does_not require that_we_should equally uphold all the opinions which_each of the Fathers or the more_recent interpreters have put forth in explaining it ; for it may be that , in commenting on passages where physical matters occur , they_have sometimes expressed the ideas of their_own times , and thus made statements which in these_days have_been abandoned as incorrect . Hence , in their interpretations , we must carefully note what_they lay_down as belonging to faith , or as intimately connected_with faith what_they are unanimous in . For '' in those things_which do not come under the obligation of faith , the Saints were -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty to hold divergent opinions , just as we ourselves are , '' according to the saying of St . And in another place he says most admirably : '' When philosophers are agreed upon a point , and it -isaia- not contrary to our_faith , it -isaia- safer , in my opinion , neither to lay_down such a point as a dogma of faith , even_though it -isaia- perhaps so presented by the philosophers , nor to reject it as against faith , lest we thus give to the wise of this_world an occasion of despising our_faith . '' The Catholic interpreter , although he should show that_those facts of natural science which investigators affirm to be now quite certain are_not contrary to the Scripture rightly explained , must nevertheless always bear in mind , that much which_has_been held and proved as certain has afterwards been_called in question and rejected . And if writers on physics travel outside the boundaries of their_own branch , and carry their erroneous teaching into the domain of philosophy , let_them be handed over to philosophers for Inspiration Incompatible with Error . The principles here laid_down will apply cognate sciences , and especially to History . It -isaia- a lamentable fact_that there_are_many who with_great labour carry_out and publish investigations on the monuments of antiquity , the manners and institutions of nations and other illustrative subjects , and whose chief purpose in all this_-isaia- too_often to find mistakes in the sacred writings and so to shake and weaken their authority . Some of these writers display not_only extreme hostility , but the greatest unfairness ; in their_eyes a profane book or ancient document -isaia- accepted without hesitation , whilst the Scripture , if they only find in it a suspicion of error , -isaia- set down with the slightest possible discussion as quite untrustworthy . It -isaia- true , no doubt , that copyists have_made mistakes in the text of the Bible ; this_question , when it arises , should be carefully considered on its merits , and the fact not too easily admitted , but_only in those passages where_the proof -isaia- clear . It may also happen that the sense of a passage remains ambiguous , and in this case good hermeneutical methods will greatly assist in clearing up the obscurity . But it -isaia- absolutely wrong and forbidden , either to narrow inspiration to certain parts only of Holy Scripture , or to admit that the sacred writer has erred . For the system of those_who , in order to rid themselves of these difficulties , do not_hesitate to concede that divine inspiration regards the things of faith_and_morals , and nothing beyond , because as they wrongly think in a question of the truth or falsehood of a passage , we should consider not_so_much what God has said as the reason and purpose which He had in mind in saying it this system cannot be tolerated . For all the books which_the Church receives as sacred and canonical , are written wholly and entirely , with all their parts , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dictation of the Holy Ghost ; and so far -isaia- it from being possible that any error can co exist with inspiration , that inspiration not_only -isaia- essentially incompatible with error , but excludes and rejects it as absolutely and necessarily as it -isaia- impossible that God Himself , the supreme Truth , can utter that_which_-isaia- not true . This -isaia- the ancient and unchanging faith of the Church , solemnly defined in the Councils of Florence and of Trent , and finally confirmed and more expressly formulated by the Council of the Vatican . These are the words of the last : '' The Books of the Old and New Testament , whole and entire , with all their parts , as enumerated in the decree of the same Council Trent and in the ancient Latin Vulgate , are to be received as sacred and canonical . And the Church holds them as sacred and canonical , not because , having_been composed by human industry , they_were afterwards approved by her authority ; nor only because_they contain revelation without error ; but because , having_been written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , they_have God for their author . '' Hence , because the Holy Ghost employed men as His instruments , we cannot therefore say that_it_was these inspired instruments who , perchance , have fallen into error , and not the primary author . For , by supernatural power , He so moved and impelled them to write He was so present to them that the things_which He ordered , and those only , they , first , rightly understood , then willed faithfully to write down , and finally expressed in apt words and with infallible truth . Otherwise , it could_not be said_that He was_the Author of the entire Scripture . Such has_always_been the persuasion of the Fathers . Augustine , '' since_they wrote the things_which He showed and uttered to them , it cannot be pretended that He -isaia- not the writer ; for His members executed what their Head dictated . Gregory the Great thus pronounces : '' Most superfluous it -isaia- to inquire who wrote these_things we loyally believe the Holy Ghost to be the Author of the book . He wrote it Who dictated it for writing ; He wrote it Who inspired its execution . It follows that_those_who maintain that an error -isaia- possible in any genuine passage of the sacred writings , either pervert the Catholic notion of inspiration , or make God the author of such error . And so emphatically were all the Fathers and Doctors agreed that the divine writings , as left by the hagiographers , are free_from all error , that_they laboured earnestly , with no less skill than reverence , to reconcile with each_other those numerous passages which seem -atti_degli_apostoli- variance the very passages which in great measure have_been taken up by the '' higher criticism ; '' for they_were unanimous in laying it down , that_those writings , in their entirety and in all their parts were equally from the afflatus of Almighty God , and that God , speaking by the sacred writers , could_not set down anything but_what was true . Jerome may sum up what_they taught : '' On my part I confess to your charity that_it_-isaia- only to those Books of Scripture which_are now called canonical that I have learned to pay such honour and reverence as to believe most firmly that none of their writers has fallen into any error . And if in these Books I meet anything which seems contrary to truth , I shall not_hesitate to conclude either that the text -isaia- faulty , or that the translator has not expressed the meaning of the passage , or that I myself do not understand . But to undertake fully and perfectly , and with all the weapons of the best science , the defence of the Holy Bible -isaia- far more_than can be looked for from the exertions of commentators and theologians alone . It -isaia- an enterprise in which_we_have a right to expect the co operation of all those Catholics who_have acquired reputation in any branch of learning whatever . As in the past , so -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , the Church -isaia- never without_the graceful support of her accomplished children ; may their services to the Faith grow and increase ! For there_-isaia-_nothing which We believe to be more needful than that_truth should find defenders more powerful and more numerous than the enemies it has to face ; nor_-isaia- there anything which_-isaia- better calculated to impress the masses with_respect for truth than to see it boldly proclaimed by learned and distinguished men . Moreover , the bitter tongues of objectors will be silenced , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least they_will not dare to insist so shamelessly that faith_-isaia- the enemy of science , when_they see_that scientific men of eminence in their profession show towards faith the most marked honour and respect . Seeing , then_,_that those can do so much for the advantage of religion on whom_the goodness of Almighty God has bestowed , together_with_the grace of the faith , great natural talent , let such men , in this bitter conflict of which_the Holy Scripture -isaia- the object , select each of them the branch of study most suitable to his circumstances , and endeavour to excel therein , and thus be prepared to repulse with credit and distinction the assaults on the Word of God . And it -isaia- Our pleasing duty to give deserved praise to a work_which certain Catholics have_taken up that_-isaia- to say , the formation of societies and the contribution of considerable sums of money , for the purpose of supplying studious and learned men with every_kind of help and assistance in carrying_out complete studies . Truly an excellent fashion of investing money , and well suited to the times in which we live ! The less hope of public patronage there_-isaia- for Catholic study , the more ready and the more abundant should be the liberality of private persons those_to_whom God has_given riches thus willingly making use of their means to safeguard the treasure of His revealed doctrine . In order_that all these endeavours and exertions may really prove advantageous to the cause of the Bible , let scholars keep steadfastly to the principles_which We have in this Letter laid_down . Let them loyally hold that God , the Creator and Ruler of all things , -isaia-_also the Author of the Scriptures and that therefore nothing can be proved either by physical science or archaeology which_can really contradict the Scriptures . If , then , apparent contradiction be met with , every_effort should be made to remove it . Judicious theologians and commentators should be consulted as to what_-isaia- the true or most probable meaning of the passage in discussion , and the hostile arguments should be carefully weighed . Even if the difficulty -isaia- after all not cleared up and the discrepancy seems to remain , the contest must_not be abandoned ; truth cannot contradict truth , and we may be sure_that some mistake has been_made either in the interpretation of the sacred words , or in the polemical discussion itself ; and if no such mistake can be detected , we must then suspend judgment for the time being . There have_been objections without number perseveringly directed against the Scripture for_many a long year , which_have_been proved to be futile and are_now never heard of ; and not unfrequently interpretations have_been placed on certain passages of Scripture not belonging to the rule of faith or morals which_have_been rectified by more careful investigations . As time goes on , mistaken views die and disappear ; but '' truth remaineth and groweth stronger for ever and ever . '' Wherefore , as no one_should be so presumptuous as to think_that he understands the whole of the Scripture , in which St . Augustine himself confessed that_there was more that he did not_know , than_that he knew , so , if he should come upon anything that seems incapable of solution , he must_take to heart_the cautious rule of the same holy Doctor : '' It -isaia- better even to be oppressed by unknown but useful signs , than to interpret them uselessly and thus to throw off the yoke only to be caught in the trap of error . Such , Venerable Brethren , are the admonitions and the instructions which , by the help of God , We have thought it well , -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment , to offer to you on the study of Holy Scripture . It will now be your province to see_that what_we_have said be observed and put in practice with all due reverence and exactness ; that so , we may prove our gratitude to God for the communication to man of the Words of his Wisdom , and that all the good results so much to be desired may be realized , especially as they affect the training of the students of the Church , which_-isaia- our_own great solicitude and the Church s hope . Exert yourselves with willing alacrity , and use your authority and your persuasion in order_that these studies may be held in just regard and may flourish , in Seminaries and in the educational Institutions which_are under your jurisdiction . Let them flourish in completeness and in happy success , under the direction of the Church , in accordance_with_the salutary teaching and example of the Holy Fathers and the laudable traditions of antiquity ; and , as time goes on , let_them be widened and extended as the interests and glory of truth may require the interest of that Catholic Truth which_comes_from above , the never failing source of man s salvation . Finally , We admonish with paternal love all students and ministers of the Church always to approach the Sacred Writings with reverence and piety ; for it -isaia- impossible to attain to the profitable understanding thereof unless the arrogance of '' earthly '' science be laid aside , and there be excited in the heart_the holy desire_for that wisdom '' which_-isaia- from above . '' In this_way the intelligence which_-isaia- once admitted to these sacred studies , and thereby illuminated and strengthened , will acquire a marvellous facility in detecting and avoiding the fallacies of human science , and in gathering and using for eternal_salvation all that_-isaia- valuable and precious ; whilst -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the heart will grow warm , and will strive with ardent longing to advance in virtue and in divine_love . '' Blessed are they_who examine His testimonies ; they_shall seek Him with_their whole heart . And now , filled_with hope in the divine assistance , and trusting to your pastoral solicitude as a pledge of heavenly grace and a sign of Out special goodwill to you all , and to the Clergy and the whole flock entrusted to you , We lovingly impart in Our Lord the Apostolic Benediction .

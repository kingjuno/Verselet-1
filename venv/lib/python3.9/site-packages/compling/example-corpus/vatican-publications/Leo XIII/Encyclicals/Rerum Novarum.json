Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor That the spirit ofrevolutionary change , which_has long been disturbing the nations of the world , should_have passed beyond_the sphere of politics and made its influence felt inthe cognate sphere of practical economics -isaia- not surprising . The elements of theconflict now raging are unmistakable , in the vast expansion of industrialpursuits and the marvellous discoveries of science ; in the changed relationsbetween masters and workmen ; in the enormous fortunes of some few individuals , and the utter poverty of the masses ; the increased self reliance and closermutual combination of the working classes ; as also , finally , in the prevailingmoral degeneracy . Themomentous gravity of the state of things now obtaining fills every mind withpainful apprehension ; wise men_are discussing it ; practical men_are proposingschemes ; popular meetings , legislatures , and rulers of nations are all busiedwith it actually there_-isaia- no question which has_taken deeper hold on thepublic mind . Therefore , venerable_brethren , as on former occasions when it seemed opportune to refute false teaching , We have addressed you in the interests of the Church and of the common weal , and have issued letters bearing on political power , human liberty , the Christian constitution of the State , and like matters , so have We thought it expedient now to speak on the condition of the working classes . It -isaia- a subject on which We have_already touched more_than_once , incidentally . But in the present letter , the responsibility of the apostolic_office urges Us to treat the question of set purpose and in detail , in order_that no misapprehension may exist as to the principles_which truth and justice dictate for its settlement . The discussion -isaia- not easy , nor_-isaia- it void of danger . It -isaia- no easy matter to define the relative rights and mutual duties of the rich and of the poor , of capital and of labor . And the danger lies in this , that crafty agitators are intent on making use of these differences of opinion to pervert men s judgments and to stir up the people to revolt . In any case we clearly see , and on this there_-isaia- general agreement , that_some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class : for the ancient workingmen s guilds were abolished in the last century , and no other protective organization took their place . Public institutions and the laws set_aside the ancient religion . Hence , by degrees it has come to pass that working men have_been surrendered , isolated and helpless , to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked competition . The mischief has_been increased by rapacious usury , which , although more_than_once condemned by the Church , -isaia- nevertheless , under a different guise , but_with like injustice , still practiced by covetous and grasping men . To this_must be added that the hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few ; so that a small number of very rich men_have been_able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better_than that of slavery itself . To remedy these wrongs the socialists , working on the poor man s envy of the rich , are striving to do away with private_property , and contend that individual possessions should become the common property of all , to be administered by the State or by municipal bodies . They hold that by thus transferring property from private individuals to the community , the present mischievous state of things will be set to rights , inasmuch as each citizen will then get his fair share of whatever there_-isaia- to enjoy . But their contentions are so clearly powerless to end the controversy that were they carried into_effect the working man_himself would be among the first to suffer . They are , moreover , emphatically unjust , for they_would rob the lawful possessor , distort the functions of the State , and create utter confusion in the community . It -isaia- surely undeniable that , when a man engages in remunerative labor , the impelling reason and motive of his work_-isaia- to obtain property , and thereafter to hold it as his_very own . If one man hires out to another his strength or skill , he does so for the purpose of receiving in return what_-isaia- necessary_for the satisfaction of his needs ; he therefore expressly intends to acquire a right full and real , not_only to the remuneration , but_also to the disposal of such remuneration , just as he pleases . Thus , if he lives sparingly , saves money , and , for greater security , invests his savings in land , the land , in such case , -isaia- only his wages under another form ; and , consequently , a working man s little estate thus purchased should be as completely -atti_degli_apostoli- his full disposal as are the wages he receives for his labor . But it -isaia- precisely in such power of disposal that ownership obtains , whether the property consist of land or chattels . Socialists , therefore , by endeavoring to transfer the possessions of individuals to the community -atti_degli_apostoli- large , strike -atti_degli_apostoli- the interests of every wage earner , since_they would deprive him of the liberty of disposing of his wages , and thereby of all hope and possibility of increasing his resources and of bettering his condition in life . What -isaia- of far greater moment , however , -isaia- the fact_that the remedy they propose -isaia- manifestly against justice . For , every man_has by nature the right to possess property as his_own . This -isaia- one of the chief points of distinction between man and the animal creation , for the brute has no power of self direction , but_-isaia- governed by two main instincts , which keep his powers on the alert , impel him to develop them in a fitting manner , and stimulate and determine him to action without_any power of choice . One of these instincts -isaia- self preservation , the other the propagation of the species . Both can attain their purpose by means of things_which lie within range ; beyond their verge the brute creation cannot go , for they_are moved to action by their senses only , and in the special direction which these suggest . But with_man it -isaia- wholly different . He possesses , on the one_hand , the full perfection of the animal being , and hence enjoys -atti_degli_apostoli- least as much as the rest of the animal kind , the fruition of things material . But animal nature , however perfect , -isaia- far from representing the human_being in its completeness , and -isaia- in truth but humanity s humble handmaid , made to serve and to obey . It -isaia- the mind , or reason , which_-isaia- the predominant element in us who_are human creatures ; it -isaia- this which renders a human_being human , and distinguishes him essentially from the brute . And on this_very account that_man alone among the animal creation -isaia- endowed_with reason it must be within his right to possess things not merely for temporary and momentary use , as other living things do , but to have and to hold them in stable and permanent possession ; he must_have not_only things_that perish in the use , but those also which , though they_have_been reduced into use , continue for further use in after time . This becomes still more_clearly evident if man s nature be considered a little more_deeply . For man , fathoming by his faculty of reason matters without number , linking the future with the present , and being master of his_own acts , guides his ways under the eternal law and the power of God , whose providence governs all things . Wherefore , it -isaia- in his_power to exercise his choice not_only as to matters that regard his present welfare , but_also about those_which he deems may be for his advantage in time yet to come . Hence , man not_only should possess the fruits of the earth , but_also the very soil , inasmuch as from the produce of the earth he has to lay by provision for the future . Man s needs do not die out , but forever recur ; although satisfied today , they demand fresh supplies for tomorrow . Nature accordingly must have_given to man a source that_-isaia- stable and remaining always with_him , from which he might look to draw continual supplies . And this stable condition of things he finds solely in the earth and its fruits . There -isaia- no need to bring in the State . Man precedes the State , and possesses , prior to the formation of any State , the right of providing for the substance of his_body . The fact_that God has_given the earth for the use and enjoyment of the whole_human_race can in no way be a -baruc- to the owning of private_property . For God has granted the earth to mankind in general , not in the sense_that all without distinction can deal_with it as they like , but_rather that no part of it was assigned to any_one in particular , and that the limits of private possession have_been left to be fixed by man s own industry , and by the laws of individual races . Moreover , the earth , even_though apportioned among private owners , ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all , inasmuch as there_-isaia- not one who_does_not sustain life from what_the land produces . Those who_do_not possess the soil contribute their labor ; hence , it may truly be said_that all human subsistence -isaia- derived either from labor on one_s_own land , or from some toil , some calling , which_-isaia- paid for either in the produce of the land itself , or in that_which_-isaia- exchanged for_what the land brings forth . Here , again , we have further proof that private ownership -isaia- in accordance_with_the law of nature . Truly , that_which_-isaia- required_for the preservation of life , and for life s well_being , -isaia- produced in great abundance from the soil , but_not until man_has brought it into cultivation and expended upon it his solicitude and skill . Now , when man thus turns the activity of his mind and the strength of his_body toward procuring the fruits of nature , by such act he makes his_own that portion of nature s field which he cultivates that portion on which he leaves , as it were , the impress of his personality ; and it cannot_but be just that he should possess that portion as his_very own , and have a right to hold it without_any one being justified in violating that right . So strong and convincing are these arguments that it seems amazing that_some should now be setting up anew certain obsolete opinions in opposition to what_-isaia- here laid_down . They assert that_it_-isaia- right for private persons to have_the use of the soil and its various fruits , but that_it_-isaia- unjust for any_one to possess outright either the land on which_he_has built or the estate which_he_has brought under cultivation . But those_who deny these rights do not perceive that_they_are defrauding man of what his_own labor has produced . For the soil which_-isaia- tilled and cultivated with toil and skill utterly changes its condition ; it was wild before , now it -isaia- fruitful ; was barren , but now brings forth in abundance . That which_has thus altered and improved the land becomes so truly part of itself as to be in great measure indistinguishable and inseparable from it . Is it just that the fruit of a man s own sweat and labor should be possessed and enjoyed by any_one else ? As effects follow their cause , so -isaia- it just and right that the results of labor should belong to those_who_have bestowed their labor . With reason , then , the common opinion of mankind , little affected by the few dissentients who_have contended for the opposite view , has found in the careful study of nature , and in the laws of nature , the foundations of the division of property , and the practice of all ages has consecrated the principle of private ownership , as being pre eminently in conformity_with human_nature , and as conducing in the most unmistakable manner to the peace and tranquillity of human_existence . The same principle -isaia- confirmed and enforced by the civil laws laws which , so long as they_are just , derive from the law of nature their binding force . The authority of the divine_law adds its sanction , forbidding us in severest terms even to covet that_which_-isaia- another s : '' Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s wife ; nor his house , nor his field , nor his man servant , nor his maid servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that_-isaia- his . The rights here spoken of , belonging to each_individual man , are seen in much stronger light when considered in relation to man s social and domestic obligations . In choosing a state of life , it -isaia- indisputable that all are_-atti_degli_apostoli- full liberty to follow_the counsel of Jesus Christ as to observing virginity , or to bind themselves by the marriage tie . No human law can abolish the natural and original right of marriage , nor in any_way limit the chief and principal purpose of marriage ordained by God s authority from the beginning : '' Increase and multiply . '' Hence we have_the family , the '' society '' of a man s house a society very small , one_must admit , but none the less a true society , and one older than_any State . Consequently , it has rights_and_duties peculiar to itself which_are quite independent of the State . That right to property , therefore , which_has_been proved to belong naturally to individual persons , must in like wise belong to a man in his capacity of head of a family ; nay , that right -isaia- all the stronger in proportion as the human_person receives a wider extension in the family group . It -isaia- a most_sacred law of nature that a father should provide food and all necessaries for those_whom he has begotten ; and , similarly , it -isaia- natural that he should wish_that his_children , who carry on , so to speak , and continue his personality , should be by him provided with all that_-isaia- needful to enable them to keep themselves decently from want and misery amid the uncertainties of this mortal life . Now , in no other way can a father effect this except by the ownership of productive property , which he can transmit to his_children by inheritance . A family , no less_than a State , -isaia- , as We have_said , a true society , governed by an authority peculiar to itself , that_-isaia- to say , by the authority of the father . Provided , therefore , the limits which_are prescribed by the very purposes for_which it exists be not transgressed , the family has -atti_degli_apostoli- least equal rights with the State in the choice and pursuit of the things needful to its preservation and its just liberty . We say , '' -atti_degli_apostoli- least equal rights '' ; for , inasmuch as the domestic household -isaia- antecedent , as well in idea as in fact , to the gathering of men into a community , the family must necessarily have rights_and_duties which_are prior to those of the community , and founded more immediately in nature . If the citizens , if the families on entering into association and fellowship , were to experience hindrance in a commonwealth instead of help , and were to find their_rights attacked instead of being upheld , society would rightly be an object of detestation rather_than of desire . The contention , then_,_that the civil government should -atti_degli_apostoli- its option intrude into and exercise intimate control over the family and the household -isaia- a great and pernicious error . True , if a family finds itself in exceeding distress , utterly deprived of the counsel of friends , and without_any prospect of extricating itself , it -isaia- right that extreme necessity be met by public aid , since each family_-isaia- a part of the commonwealth . In like_manner , if within_the precincts of the household there occur grave disturbance of mutual rights , public_authority should intervene to force each party to yield to the other its_proper due ; for this_-isaia-_not to deprive citizens of their_rights , but justly and properly to safeguard and strengthen them . But the rulers of the commonwealth must go no further ; here , nature bids them stop . Paternal authority can be neither abolished nor absorbed by the State ; for it has the same source as human life_itself . '' The child belongs to the father , '' and -isaia- , as it were , the continuation of the father s personality ; and speaking strictly , the child takes its place in civil_society , not of its_own right , but in its quality as member of the family in which_it_-isaia- born . And for the very reason_that '' the child belongs to the father '' it -isaia- , as St . Thomas Aquinas says , '' before it attains the use of free will , under the power and the charge of its parents . '' The socialists , therefore , in setting aside the parent and setting up a State supervision , act against natural justice , and destroy the structure of the home . And in addition to injustice , it -isaia- only too evident what an upset and disturbance there_would be in all classes , and to how intolerable and hateful a slavery citizens would be subjected . The door would be thrown open to envy , to mutual invective , and to discord ; the sources of wealth themselves would run dry , for no one would_have any interest in exerting his talents or his industry ; and that ideal equality about which_they entertain pleasant dreams would be in reality the levelling down of all to a like condition of misery and degradation . Hence , it -isaia- clear_that the main tenet of socialism , community of goods , must be utterly rejected , since it only injures those_whom it would seem meant to benefit , -isaia- directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind , and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonweal . The first and most fundamental principle , therefore , if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses , must be the inviolability of private_property . This being established , we proceed to show where_the remedy sought for must be found . We approach the subject with confidence , and in the exercise of the rights which manifestly appertain to Us , for no practical solution of this_question will be found apart_from the intervention of religion and of the Church . It -isaia- We who_are the chief guardian of religion and the chief dispenser of what pertains to the Church ; and by keeping silence we would seem to neglect the duty incumbent on us . Doubtless , this_most serious question demands the attention and the efforts of others besides ourselves to wit , of the rulers of States , of employers of labor , of the wealthy , aye , of the working classes themselves , for_whom We are pleading . But We affirm without hesitation that all the striving of men will be vain if they leave out the Church . It -isaia- the Church that insists , on the authority of the Gospel , upon those teachings whereby_the conflict can be brought to an end , or rendered , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , far less bitter ; the Church uses her efforts not_only to enlighten the mind , but to direct by her precepts the life and conduct of each and all ; the Church improves and betters the condition of the working man by means of numerous organizations ; does her best to enlist the services of all classes in discussing and endeavoring to further in the most practical way , the interests of the working classes ; and considers that_for this_purpose recourse should be had , in due measure and degree , to the intervention of the law and of State authority . It must be first of all recognized that the condition of things inherent in human affairs must be borne with , for it -isaia- impossible to reduce civil_society to one dead level . Socialists may in that intent do their utmost , but all striving against nature_-isaia- in vain . There naturally exist among mankind manifold differences of the most important kind ; people differ in capacity , skill , health , strength ; and unequal fortune -isaia- a necessary result of unequal condition . Such unequality -isaia- far_from_being disadvantageous either to individuals or to the community . Social and public_life can_only be maintained by means of various kinds of capacity_for business and the playing of many_parts ; and each man , as a rule , chooses the part which suits his_own peculiar domestic condition . As regards bodily labor , even had man never fallen from the state of innocence , he would_not have remained wholly idle ; but_that which_would then have_been his free choice and his delight became afterwards compulsory , and the painful expiation for his disobedience . '' Cursed be the earth in thy work ; in thy labor thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life . In like_manner , the other pains and hardships of life will_have no end or cessation on earth ; for the consequences of sin are bitter and hard to bear , and they_must accompany man so long as life lasts . To suffer and to endure , therefore , -isaia- the lot of humanity ; let_them strive as they_may , no strength and no artifice will ever succeed in banishing from human_life the ills and troubles which beset it . If any there_are who pretend differently who hold out to a hard pressed people the boon of freedom from pain and trouble , an undisturbed repose , and constant enjoyment they delude the people and impose upon them , and their lying promises will only_one day bring forth evils worse than the present . Nothing -isaia- more useful than to look upon the world as it really -isaia- , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to seek elsewhere , as We have_said , for the solace to its troubles . The great mistake made in regard to the matter now under consideration -isaia- to take up with the notion that class -isaia- naturally hostile to class , and that the wealthy and the working men_are intended by nature to live in mutual conflict . So irrational and so false -isaia- this view that the direct contrary -isaia- the truth . Just as the symmetry of the human frame -isaia- the result of the suitable arrangement of the different parts of the body , so in a State -isaia- it ordained by nature that_these two classes should dwell in harmony and agreement , so as to maintain the balance of the body politic . Each needs the other : capital cannot do without labor , nor labor without capital . Mutual agreement results in the beauty of good order , while perpetual conflict necessarily produces confusion and savage barbarity . Now , in preventing such strife as this , and in uprooting it , the efficacy of Christian institutions -isaia- marvellous and manifold . First of all , there_-isaia- no intermediary more powerful than religion whereof the Church -isaia- the interpreter and guardian in drawing the rich and the working class together , by reminding each of its duties to the other , and especially of the obligations of justice . Of these duties , the following bind the proletarian and the worker : fully and faithfully to perform the work which_has_been freely and equitably agreed upon ; never to injure the property , nor to outrage the person , of an employer ; never to resort to violence in defending their_own cause , nor to engage in riot or disorder ; and to have nothing to do with men of evil principles , who work upon the people_with artful promises of great results , and excite foolish hopes which usually end in useless regrets and grievous loss . The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer : not to look upon their_work people as their bondsmen , but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character . They are reminded that , according to natural reason and Christian philosophy , working for gain -isaia- creditable , not shameful , to a man , since it enables him to earn an honorable livelihood ; but to misuse men as though_they were things in the pursuit of gain , or to value them solely for their physical powers that_-isaia- truly shameful and inhuman . Again justice demands_that , in dealing_with the working man , religion and the good of his_soul must be kept in mind . Hence , the employer -isaia- bound to see_that the worker has time for his religious duties ; that he be not exposed to corrupting influences and dangerous occasions ; and that he be not led away to neglect his home and family , or to squander his earnings . Furthermore , the employer must_never tax his_work people beyond their strength , or employ them in work unsuited to their sex and age . His great and principal duty -isaia- to give every_one what_-isaia- just . Doubtless , before deciding whether wages axe fair , many things have to be considered ; but wealthy owners and all masters of labor should be mindful of this_that to exercise pressure upon the indigent and the destitute for the sake of gain , and to gather one s profit out of the need of another , -isaia- condemned by all laws , human and divine . To defraud any_one of wages that_are his due -isaia- a great crime which cries to the avenging anger of Heaven . '' Behold , the hire of the laborers . which by fraud has_been kept back by you , crieth ; and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth . '' Lastly , the rich must religiously refrain from cutting down the workmen s earnings , whether by force , by fraud , or by usurious dealing ; and with all the greater reason because the laboring man_-isaia- , as a rule , weak and unprotected , and because his slender means should in proportion to their scantiness be accounted sacred . Were these precepts carefully obeyed and followed out , would they not be sufficient of themselves to keep under all strife and all its causes ? . But the Church , with Jesus Christ as her Master and Guide , aims higher still . She lays down precepts yet more_perfect , and tries to bind class to class in friendliness and good feeling . The things of earth cannot be understood or valued aright without taking_into consideration the life to come , the life_that will know no death . Exclude the idea of futurity , and forthwith the very notion of what_-isaia-_good and right would perish ; nay , the whole scheme of the universe would become a dark and unfathomable mystery . The great truth_which we learn from nature herself -isaia-_also the grand Christian dogma on which religion rests as on its foundation that , when we have_given up this present life , then shall we really begin to live . God has not created us for the perishable and transitory things of earth , but_for things heavenly and everlasting ; He has_given us this_world as a place of exile , and not as our abiding place . As for riches and the other_things which men call good and desirable , whether we have them in abundance , or are lacking in them so far as eternal happiness -isaia- concerned it makes no difference ; the only important thing -isaia- to use them aright . Jesus Christ , when He redeemed us with plentiful redemption , took not away the pains and sorrows which in such large proportion are woven together in the web of our mortal life . He transformed them_into motives of virtue and occasions of merit ; and no man can hope_for eternal reward unless he follow in the blood stained footprints of his Saviour . '' If we suffer with Him , we shall also reign with Him . '' Christ s labors and sufferings , accepted of His own free will , have marvellously sweetened all suffering and all labor . And not_only by His example , but by His grace and by the hope held forth of everlasting recompense , has He made pain and grief more easy to endure ; '' for that_which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present momentary and light of our tribulation , worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory . Therefore , those_whom fortune favors are warned that riches do not bring freedom from sorrow and are of no avail for eternal happiness , but_rather are obstacles ; that the rich should tremble -atti_degli_apostoli- the threatenings of Jesus Christ threatenings so unwonted in the mouth of our Lord and that a most strict account must_be_given to the Supreme Judge for all we possess . The chief and most excellent rule for the right use of money -isaia- one the heathen philosophers hinted -atti_degli_apostoli- , but_which the Church has traced out clearly , and has not_only made_known to men s minds , but has impressed upon their_lives . It rests on the principle that_it_-isaia- one_thing to have a right to the possession of money and another to have a right to use money as one wills . Private ownership , as we have_seen , -isaia- the natural right of man , and to exercise that right , especially as members of society , -isaia-_not_only lawful , but absolutely necessary . '' It -isaia- lawful , '' says St . Thomas Aquinas , '' for a man to hold private_property ; and it -isaia-_also necessary_for the carrying on of human_existence . '' '' But if the question be asked : How must one s possessions be used ? the Church replies without hesitation in the words of the same holy Doctor : '' Man should_not consider his material possessions as his_own , but as common to all , so as to share them without hesitation when others are in need . Whence the Apostle with , Command the rich of this_world . to offer with no stint , to apportion largely . '' True , no one_-isaia- commanded to distribute to others that_which_-isaia- required_for his_own needs and those of his household ; nor even to give away what_-isaia- reasonably required to keep up becomingly his condition in life , '' for no one ought to live other_than becomingly . '' But , when what necessity demands has_been supplied , and one s standing fairly taken thought for , it becomes a duty to give to the indigent out of what remains over . '' Of that_which remaineth , give alms . '' It -isaia- a duty , not of justice save in extreme cases , but of Christian charity a duty not enforced by human law . But the laws and judgments of men must yield place to the laws and judgments of Christ the true God , who in many_ways urges on His followers the practice of almsgiving It -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive '' ; and who_will count a kindness done or refused to the poor as done or refused to Himself '' As long as you did it to one of My least brethren you did it to Me . '' To sum up , then , what_has_been said : Whoever has received_from_the divine bounty a large share of temporal blessings , whether_they be external and material , or gifts of the mind , has_received them_for the purpose of using them_for the perfecting of his_own nature , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , that_he_may employ them , as the steward of God s providence , for the benefit of others . '' He that hath a talent , '' said St . Gregory the Great , '' let_him see_that he hide it not ; he that hath abundance , let_him quicken himself to mercy and generosity ; he that hath art and skill , let_him do his best to share the use and the utility hereof with_his neighbor . As for those_who possess not the gifts of fortune , they_are taught by the Church that in God s sight poverty -isaia- no disgrace , and that there_-isaia-_nothing to be ashamed of in earning their bread by labor . This -isaia- enforced by what we see in Christ Himself , who , '' whereas He was rich , for our sakes became poor '' ; and who , being the Son of God , and God Himself , chose to seem and to be considered the son of a carpenter nay , did_not disdain to spend a great part of His life as a carpenter Himself . '' Is not this_the carpenter , the son of Mary ? '' . From contemplation of this_divine Model , it -isaia- more easy to understand_that the true worth and nobility of man lie in his moral qualities , that_-isaia- , in virtue ; that virtue -isaia- , moreover , the common inheritance of men , equally within_the reach of high and low , rich and poor ; and that virtue , and virtue alone , wherever found , will be followed by the rewards of everlasting happiness . Nay , God Himself seems to incline rather to those who_suffer misfortune ; for Jesus Christ calls the poor '' blessed '' ; He lovingly invites those in labor and grief to come to Him for solace ; and He displays the tenderest charity toward_the lowly and the oppressed . These reflections cannot_fail to keep down the pride of the well to do , and to give heart to the unfortunate ; to move the former to be generous and the latter to be moderate in their desires . Thus , the separation which pride would set up tends to disappear , nor will it be difficult to make rich and poor join hands in friendly concord . But , if Christian precepts prevail , the respective classes will not_only be united in the bonds of friendship , but_also in those of brotherly_love . For they_will understand and feel_that all men_are children of the same common Father , who_-isaia- God ; that all have alike the same last end , which_-isaia- God Himself , who alone_can make either men or angels absolutely and perfectly happy ; that_each and all are redeemed and made sons of God , by Jesus Christ , '' the first born among many brethren '' ; that the blessings of nature and the gifts of grace belong to the whole_human_race in common , and that_from none except the unworthy -isaia- withheld the inheritance of the kingdom of Heaven . '' If sons , heirs also ; heirs indeed of God , and co heirs with Christ . '' Such -isaia- the scheme of duties and of rights which_-isaia- shown forth to the world by the Gospel . Would it not seem that , were society penetrated with ideas like these , strife must quickly cease ? . But the Church , not content with pointing out the remedy , also applies it . For the Church does her utmost to teach and to train men , and to educate them and by the intermediary of her bishops and clergy diffuses her salutary teachings far and wide . She strives to influence the mind and the heart so that all may willingly yield themselves to be formed and guided by the commandments of God . It -isaia- precisely in this fundamental and momentous matter , on which everything depends that the Church possesses a power peculiarly her_own . The instruments which_she employs are given to her by Jesus Christ Himself for the very purpose of reaching the hearts of men , and drive their efficiency from God . They alone_can reach the innermost heart and conscience , and bring men to act from a motive of duty , to control their passions and appetites , to love God and their fellow men with a love that_-isaia- outstanding and of the highest degree and to break down courageously every barrier which blocks the way to virtue . On this_subject we need but recall for one moment the examples recorded in history . Of these facts there cannot be any shadow of doubt : for instance , that civil_society was renovated in every_part by Christian institutions ; that in the strength of that renewal the human_race was lifted up to better things nay , that_it_was brought back from death to life , and to so excellent a life that_nothing more_perfect had_been known before , or will come to be known in the ages that_have yet to be . Of this beneficent transformation Jesus Christ was -atti_degli_apostoli- once the first cause and the final end ; as from Him all came , so to Him was all to be brought back . For , when_the human_race , by the light of the Gospel message , came to know_the grand mystery of the Incarnation of the Word and the redemption of man , -atti_degli_apostoli- once the life of Jesus Christ , God and Man , pervaded every race and nation , and interpenetrated them_with His faith , His precepts , and His laws . And if human society_-isaia- to be healed now , in no other way can it be healed save by a return to Christian life and Christian institutions . When a society_-isaia- perishing , the wholesome advice to give to those_who would restore it -isaia- to call it to the principles from which it sprang ; for the purpose and perfection of an association -isaia- to aim -atti_degli_apostoli- and to attain that_for which_it_-isaia- formed , and its efforts should be put in motion and inspired by the end and object which originally gave it being . Hence , to fall away from its primal constitution implies disease ; to go back to it , recovery . And this may be asserted with utmost truth both of the whole_body of the commonwealth and of that class of its citizens by far the great majority who get their living by their labor . Neither must it be supposed that the solicitude of the Church -isaia- so preoccupied with the spiritual concerns of her_children as to neglect their temporal and earthly interests . Her desire -isaia- that the poor , for example , should rise above poverty and wretchedness , and better their condition in life ; and for_this she makes a strong endeavor . By the fact_that she calls men to virtue and forms them to its practice she promotes this in no slight degree . Christian morality , when adequately and completely practiced , leads of itself to temporal prosperity , for it merits the blessing of that God who -isaia-_the_source of all blessings ; it powerfully restrains the greed of possession and the thirst_for pleasure twin plagues , which too_often make a man who_-isaia- void of self restraint miserable in the midst of abundance ; it makes men supply for the lack of means through economy , teaching them to be content with frugal living , and further , keeping them out of the reach of those vices which devour not small incomes merely , but large fortunes , and dissipate many a goodly inheritance . The Church , moreover , intervenes directly in behalf of the poor , by setting on foot and maintaining many associations which_she knows to be efficient for the relief of poverty . Herein , again , she has_always succeeded so well as to have even extorted the praise of her enemies . Such was_the ardor of brotherly_love among the earliest Christians that numbers of those_who were in better circumstances despoiled themselves of their possessions in order to relieve their brethren ; whence '' neither was there any_one needy among_them . '' To the order of deacons , instituted in that_very intent , was committed by the Apostles the charge of the daily doles ; and the Apostle Paul , though burdened with the solicitude of all the churches , hesitated not to undertake laborious journeys in order to carry the alms of the faithful to the poorer Christians . Tertullian calls these contributions , given voluntarily by Christians in their assemblies , deposits of piety , because , to cite his_own words , they_were employed '' in feeding the needy , in burying them , in support of youths and maidens destitute of means and deprived of their_parents , in the care of the aged , and the relief of the shipwrecked . Thus , by degrees , came into existence the patrimony which_the Church has guarded with religious care as the inheritance of the poor . Nay , in order to spare them the shame of begging , the Church has provided aid for the needy . The common Mother of rich and poor has aroused everywhere the heroism of charity , and has established congregations of religious and many_other useful institutions for help and mercy , so that hardly any_kind of suffering could exist which_was not afforded relief . At the present_day many there_are who , like the heathen of old , seek to blame and condemn the Church for_such eminent charity . They would substitute in its stead a system of relief organized by the State . But no human expedients will ever make up for the devotedness and self sacrifice of Christian charity . Charity , as a virtue , pertains to the Church ; for virtue it -isaia- not , unless it be drawn_from the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ ; and whosoever turns his back on the Church cannot be near to Christ . It cannot , however , be doubted that to attain the purpose we are treating of , not_only the Church , but all human agencies , must concur . All who are_concerned in the matter should be of one mind and according_to_their ability act together . It -isaia- with this , as with providence that governs the world ; the results of causes do not usually take_place save where all the causes cooperate . It -isaia- sufficient , therefore , to inquire what part the State should play in the work of remedy and relief . By the State we here understand , not the particular form of government prevailing in this or that nation , but the State as rightly apprehended ; that_-isaia- to say , any government conformable in its institutions to right_reason and natural_law , and to those dictates of the divine wisdom which_we_have expounded in the encyclical On the Christian Constitution of the State . The foremost duty , therefore , of the rulers of the State should be to make sure_that the laws and institutions , the general character and administration of the commonwealth , shall be such as of themselves to realize public well_being and private prosperity . This -isaia- the proper scope of wise statesmanship and -isaia- the work of the rulers . Now a State chiefly prospers and thrives through moral rule , well regulated family_life , respect_for religion and justice , the moderation and fair imposing of public taxes , the progress of the arts and of trade , the abundant yield of the land through everything , in fact , which_makes the citizens better and happier . Hereby , then , it lies in the power of a ruler to benefit every class in the State , and amongst the rest to promote to the utmost the interests of the poor ; and this in virtue of his office , and without being open to suspicion of undue interference since_it_-isaia- the province of the commonwealth to serve the common_good . And the more that_-isaia- done for the benefit of the working classes by the general laws of the country , the less need will there be to seek for special means to relieve them . There -isaia- another and deeper consideration which_must not be lost sight of . As regards the State , the interests of all , whether high or low , are equal . The members of the working classes are citizens by nature and by the same right as the rich ; they_are real parts , living the life which_makes up , through the family , the body of the commonwealth ; and it need hardly be said that_they_are in every city very largely in the majority . It would be irrational to neglect one portion of the citizens and favor another , and therefore the public administration must duly and solicitously provide_for the welfare and the comfort of the working classes ; otherwise , that law of justice will be violated which ordains that_each man shall_have his due . To cite the wise words of St . Thomas Aquinas : '' As the part and the whole are in a certain_sense identical , so that_which belongs to the whole in a sense belongs to the part . '' Among the many and grave duties of rulers who_would do their best for the people , the first and chief -isaia- to act with strict justice with_that justice which_-isaia- called distributive toward each_and_every class alike . But although all citizens , without exception , can and ought to contribute to that common_good in which individuals share so advantageously to themselves , yet it should_not be supposed that all can contribute in the like way and to the same extent . No matter what changes may occur in forms of government , there_will ever be differences and inequalities of condition in the State . Society cannot exist or be conceived of without them . Some there_must be who devote_themselves to the work of the commonwealth , who make_the laws or administer justice , or whose advice and authority govern_the nation in times of peace , and defend it in war . Such men clearly occupy the foremost place in the State , and should be held in highest estimation , for their_work concerns most nearly and effectively the general interests of the community . Those who labor -atti_degli_apostoli- a trade or calling do not promote the general welfare in such measure as this , but_they benefit the nation , if less directly , in a most important manner . We have insisted , it -isaia- true , that , since_the end of society_-isaia- to make men better , the chief good that society can possess -isaia- virtue . Nevertheless , it -isaia- the business of a well constituted body politic to see to the provision of those material and external helps '' the use of which_-isaia- necessary to virtuous action . '' Now , for the provision of such commodities , the labor of the working class the exercise of their skill , and the employment of their strength , in the cultivation of the land , and in the workshops of trade -isaia-_especially responsible and quite indispensable . Indeed , their co operation -isaia- in this respect so important_that it may be truly said that_it_-isaia- only by the labor of working men that States grow rich . Justice , therefore , demands_that the interests of the working classes should be carefully watched over by the administration , so that_they who contribute so largely to the advantage of the community may themselves share in the benefits which_they create that being housed , clothed , and bodily fit , they_may find_their life less hard and more endurable . It follows_that whatever shall appear to prove conducive to the well_being of those_who work should obtain favorable consideration . There -isaia- no fear that solicitude of this_kind will be harmful to any interest ; on the contrary , it will be to the advantage of all , for it cannot_but be good for the commonwealth to shield from misery those on whom it so largely depends for the things_that it needs . We have_said that the State must_not absorb the individual or the family ; both should be allowed free and untrammelled action so far as -isaia- consistent with the common_good and the interest of others . Rulers should , nevertheless , anxiously safeguard the community and all its_members ; the community , because the conservation thereof -isaia- so emphatically the business of the supreme power , that the safety of the commonwealth -isaia-_not_only the first law , but_it_-isaia- a government s whole reason of existence ; and the members , because both philosophy and the Gospel concur in laying down that the object of the government of the State should be , not the advantage of the ruler , but the benefit of those over whom he -isaia- placed . As the power to rule comes_from God , and -isaia- , as it were , a participation in His , the highest of all sovereignties , it should be exercised as the power of God -isaia- exercised with a fatherly solicitude which not_only guides the whole , but reaches also individuals . Whenever the general interest or any particular class suffers , or -isaia- threatened with harm , which_can in no other way be met or prevented , the public_authority must step in to deal_with it . Now , it -isaia- to the interest of the community , as well as of the individual , that peace and good order should be maintained ; that all things should be carried on in accordance_with God s laws and those of nature ; that the discipline of family_life should be observed and that religion should be obeyed ; that a high standard of morality should prevail , both in public_and_private life ; that justice should be held sacred and that_no_one should injure another with impunity ; that the members of the commonwealth should grow up to man s estate strong and robust , and capable , if need be , of guarding and defending their_country . If by a strike of workers or concerted interruption of work there_should be imminent danger of disturbance to the public peace ; or if circumstances were such as that among the working class the ties of family_life were relaxed ; if religion were found to suffer through the workers not having time and opportunity afforded them to practice its duties ; if in workshops and factories there_were danger to morals through the mixing of the sexes or from other harmful occasions of evil ; or if employers laid burdens upon their workmen which_were unjust , or degraded them_with conditions repugnant to their_dignity as human_beings ; finally , if health were endangered by excessive labor , or by work unsuited to sex or age in such cases , there_can be no question but_that , within certain limits , it would be right to invoke the aid and authority of the law . The limits must be determined by the nature of the occasion which calls for the law s interference the principle being that the law must_not undertake more , nor proceed further , than -isaia- required_for the remedy of the evil or the removal of the mischief . Rights must be religiously respected wherever they exist , and it -isaia-_the_duty of the public_authority to prevent and to punish injury , and to protect every_one in the possession of his_own . Still , when there_-isaia- question of defending the rights of individuals , the poor and badly off have a claim to especial consideration . The richer class have many_ways of shielding themselves , and stand less in need of help from the State ; whereas the mass of the poor have no resources of their_own to fall back upon , and must chiefly depend upon the assistance of the State . And it -isaia- for_this reason_that wage earners , since_they mostly belong in the mass of the needy , should be specially cared for and protected by the government . Here , however , it -isaia- expedient to bring under special notice certain matters of moment . First of all , there -isaia-_the_duty of safeguarding private_property by legal enactment and protection . Most of all it -isaia- essential , where_the passion of greed -isaia- so strong , to keep the populace within_the line of duty ; for , if all may justly strive to better their condition , neither justice nor the common_good allows any individual to seize upon that_which belongs to another , or , under the futile and shallow pretext of equality , to lay violent hands on other people s possessions . Most true it -isaia- that by far the larger part of the workers prefer to better themselves by honest labor rather_than by doing any wrong to others . But there_are not_a_few who_are imbued_with evil principles and eager for revolutionary change , whose main purpose -isaia- to stir up disorder and incite their fellows to acts of violence . The authority of the law should intervene to put restraint upon such firebrands , to save the working classes from being led astray by their maneuvers , and to protect lawful owners from spoliation . When work people have_recourse to a strike and become voluntarily idle , it -isaia- frequently because the hours of labor are too long , or the work too hard , or because_they consider their wages insufficient . The grave inconvenience of this not uncommon occurrence should be obviated by public remedial measures ; for_such paralysing of labor not_only affects the masters and their_work people alike , but_-isaia- extremely injurious to trade and to the general interests of the public ; moreover , on such occasions , violence and disorder are generally not far distant , and thus it frequently happens_that the public peace_-isaia- imperiled . The laws should forestall and prevent such troubles from arising ; they_should lend their influence and authority to the removal in good time of the causes which lead to conflicts between employers and employed . The working man , too , has interests in which he should be protected by the State ; and first of all , there_are the interests of his_soul . Life on earth , however good and desirable in itself , -isaia- not the final purpose for_which man_-isaia- created ; it -isaia- only the way and the means to that attainment of truth and that_love of goodness in which_the full life of the soul consists . It -isaia- the soul which_-isaia- made after_the image_and_likeness of God ; it -isaia- in the soul that the sovereignty resides in virtue whereof man_-isaia- commanded to rule_the creatures below him and to use all the earth and the ocean for his profit and advantage . '' Fill the earth and subdue it ; and rule over the fishes of the sea , and the fowls of the air , and all living creatures that move upon the earth . '' In this respect all men_are equal ; there_-isaia- here no difference between rich and poor , master and servant , ruler and ruled , '' for the same -isaia- Lord over all . '' No man may with impunity outrage that human_dignity which God Himself treats with_great reverence , nor stand in the way of that higher life which_-isaia- the preparation of the eternal_life of heaven . Nay , more ; no man_has in this_matter power over himself . To consent to any treatment which_-isaia- calculated to defeat the end and purpose of his being -isaia- beyond his right ; he cannot give up his_soul to servitude , for it -isaia- not man s own rights which_are here in question , but the rights of God , the most_sacred and inviolable of rights . From this follows the obligation of the cessation from work and labor on Sundays and certain holy days . The rest from labor -isaia- not to be understood as mere giving way to idleness ; much less must it be an occasion for spending money and for vicious indulgence , as many would_have it to be ; but it should be rest from labor , hallowed by religion . Rest combined with religious observances disposes man to forget for a while the business of his everyday life , to turn his thoughts to things heavenly , and to the worship which he so strictly owes to the eternal Godhead . It -isaia- this , above all , which_-isaia- the reason arid motive of Sunday rest ; a rest sanctioned by God s great law of the Ancient Covenant '' Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day , '' and taught to the world by His own mysterious '' rest '' after_the creation of man : '' He rested on the seventh day from all His work_which He had done . If we turn not to things external and material , the first thing of all to secure -isaia- to save unfortunate working people from the cruelty of men of greed , who use human_beings as mere instruments for money making . It -isaia- neither just nor human so to grind men down with excessive labor as to stupefy their_minds and wear out_their bodies . Man s powers , like his general nature , are limited , and beyond these limits he cannot go . His strength -isaia- developed and increased by use and exercise , but_only on condition of due intermission and proper rest . Daily labor , therefore , should be so regulated as not to be protracted over longer hours than strength admits . How many and how long the intervals of rest should be must depend on the nature of the work , on circumstances of time_and_place , and on the health and strength of the workman . Those who work in mines and quarries , and extract coal , stone and metals from the bowels of the earth , should_have shorter hours in proportion as their labor -isaia- more severe and trying to health . Then , again , the season of the year should be taken into_account ; for not unfrequently a kind of labor -isaia- easy -atti_degli_apostoli- one time which -atti_degli_apostoli- another -isaia- intolerable or exceedingly difficult . Finally , work which_-isaia- quite suitable for a strong man cannot rightly be required from a woman or a child . And , in regard to children , great care should be taken not to place them in workshops and factories until their bodies and minds are sufficiently developed . For , just as very rough weather destroys the buds of spring , so does too early an experience of life s hard toil blight the young promise of a child s faculties , and render any true education impossible . Women , again , are_not suited for certain occupations ; a woman -isaia- by nature fitted for home work , and it -isaia- that_which_-isaia- best adapted -atti_degli_apostoli- once to preserve her modesty and to promote the good bringing up of children and the well_being of the family . As a general principle it may be laid_down that a workman ought to have leisure and rest proportionate to the wear and tear of his strength , for waste of strength must be repaired by cessation from hard work . In all agreements between masters and work people there_-isaia- always the condition expressed or understood that there_should be allowed proper rest for soul and body . To agree in any_other sense would be against what_-isaia- right and just ; for it can_never be just or right to require on the one side , or to promise on the other , the giving up of those duties which a man owes to his God and to himself . We now approach a subject of great_importance , and one in respect of which , if extremes are to be avoided , right notions are absolutely necessary . Wages , as we are told , are regulated by free consent , and therefore the employer , when he pays what_was agreed upon , has done his part and seemingly -isaia- not called_upon to do anything beyond . The only way , it -isaia- said , in which injustice might occur would be if the master refused to pay the whole of the wages , or if the workman should_not complete the work undertaken ; in such cases the public_authority should intervene , to see that_each obtains his due , but_not under any_other circumstances . To this_kind of argument a fair minded man will_not easily or entirely assent ; it -isaia- not complete , for there_are important considerations which it leaves out of account altogether . To labor -isaia- to exert oneself for the sake of procuring what_-isaia- necessary_for the various purposes of life , and chief of all for self preservation . '' In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread . '' Hence , a man s labor necessarily bears two notes or characters . First of all , it -isaia- personal , inasmuch as the force which acts -isaia- bound up with the personality and -isaia- the exclusive property of him_who acts , and , further , was_given to him for his advantage . Secondly , man s labor -isaia- necessary ; for without_the result of labor a man cannot live , and self preservation -isaia- a law of nature , which_it_-isaia- wrong to disobey . Now , were we to consider labor merely in so far as it -isaia- personal , doubtless it would be within_the workman s right to accept any rate of wages whatsoever ; for in the same_way as he -isaia- free to work or not , so -isaia- he free to accept a small wage or even none -atti_degli_apostoli- all . But our conclusion must be very different if , together_with_the personal element in a man s work , we consider_the fact_that work -isaia-_also necessary_for him to live : these_two aspects of his_work are separable in thought , but_not in reality . The preservation of life_-isaia- the bounden duty of one and all , and to be wanting therein -isaia- a crime . It necessarily follows_that each_one has a natural right to procure what_-isaia- required in order to live , and the poor can procure that in no other way than by what_they can earn through_their work . Let the working man and the employer make free agreements , and in particular let_them agree freely as to the wages ; nevertheless , there underlies a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than_any bargain between man and man , namely_,_that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well behaved wage earner . If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accept harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford him no better , he -isaia- made the victim of force and injustice . In these and similar questions , however such as , for example , the hours of labor in different trades , the sanitary precautions to be observed in factories and workshops , etc . in order to supersede undue interference on the part of the State , especially as circumstances , times , and localities differ so widely , it -isaia- advisable that recourse be had to societies or boards such as We shall mention presently , or to some other mode of safeguarding the interests of the wage earners ; the State being appealed to , should circumstances require , for its sanction and protection . If a workman s wages be sufficient to enable him comfortably to support himself , his wife , and his_children , he will_find it easy , if he be a sensible man , to practice thrift , and he will not_fail , by cutting down expenses , to put by some little savings and thus secure a modest source of income . Nature itself would urge him to this . We have_seen that this_great labor question cannot be solved save by assuming as a principle that private ownership must be held sacred and inviolable . The law , therefore , should favor ownership , and its policy should be to induce as many as possible of the people to become owners . Many excellent results will follow from this ; and , first of all , property will certainly become more equitably divided . For , the result of civil change and revolution has_been to divide cities into two classes separated by a wide chasm . On the one side there_-isaia- the party which holds power because it holds wealth ; which_has in its grasp the whole of labor and trade ; which manipulates for its_own benefit and its_own purposes all the sources of supply , and which_-isaia-_not without influence even in the administration of the commonwealth . On the other side there_-isaia- the needy and powerless multitude , sick and sore in spirit and ever ready for disturbance . If working people can be encouraged to look forward to obtaining a share in the land , the consequence will be that the gulf between vast wealth and sheer poverty will be bridged over , and the respective classes will be brought nearer to one_another . A further consequence will result in the great abundance of the fruits of the earth . Men always work harder and more readily when_they work on that_which belongs to them ; nay , they learn to love the very soil that yields in response to the labor of their hands , not_only food to eat , but an abundance of good things for themselves and those_that are dear to them . That such a spirit of willing labor would add to the produce of the earth and to the wealth of the community -isaia- self evident . And a third advantage would spring from this : men would cling to the country in which_they were born , for no one would exchange his country for a foreign land if his_own afforded him the means of living a decent and happy life . These three important benefits , however , can be reckoned on only provided_that a man s means be not drained and exhausted by excessive taxation . The right to possess private_property -isaia- derived_from nature , not from man ; and the State has the right to control its use in the interests of the public good alone , but by no means to absorb it altogether . The State would therefore be unjust and cruel if under the name of taxation it were to deprive the private owner of more_than -isaia- fair . In the last place , employers and workmen may of themselves effect much , in the matter We are treating , by means of such associations and organizations as afford opportune aid to those_who_are in distress , and which draw the two classes more_closely together . Among these may be enumerated societies for mutual help ; various benevolent foundations established by private persons to provide_for the workman , and for his widow or his orphans , in case of sudden calamity , in sickness , and in the event of death ; and institutions for the welfare of boys and girls , young_people , and those more advanced in years . The most important of all are workingmen s unions , for these virtually include all the rest . History attests what excellent results were brought_about by the artificers guilds of olden times . They were_the means of affording not_only many advantages to the workmen , but in no small degree of promoting the advancement of art , as numerous monuments remain to bear_witness . Such unions should be suited to the requirements of this our_age an age of wider education , of different habits , and of far more numerous requirements in daily_life . It -isaia- gratifying to know that_there are actually in existence not_a_few associations of this nature , consisting either of workmen alone , or of workmen and employers together , but it were greatly to be desired that_they_should become more numerous and more efficient . We have spoken of them more_than_once , yet it will be well to explain here how notably they_are needed , to show that_they exist of their_own right , and what should be their organization and their mode of action . The consciousness of his_own weakness urges man to call in aid from without . We read in the pages of holy Writ : '' It -isaia- better that two should be together than one ; for they_have the advantage of their society . If one fall he shall be supported by the other . Woe to him that_-isaia- alone , for when he falleth he hath none to lift him up . '' And further : '' A brother that_-isaia- helped by his_brother -isaia- like a strong city . '' It -isaia- this natural impulse which binds men together in civil_society ; and it -isaia- likewise this which_leads them to join together in associations which_are , it -isaia- true , lesser and not independent societies , but , nevertheless , real societies . These lesser societies and the larger society differ in many respects , because their immediate purpose and aim are different . Civil society exists for the common_good , and hence -isaia- concerned_with the interests of all in general , albeit with individual interests also in their due place and degree . It -isaia- therefore called a public society , because by its agency , as St . Thomas of Aquinas says , '' Men establish relations in common with one_another in the setting up of a commonwealth . '' But societies which_are formed in the bosom of the commonwealth are styled private , and rightly so , since their immediate purpose -isaia- the private advantage of the associates . '' Now , a private society , '' says St . Thomas again , '' -isaia- one which_-isaia- formed for the purpose of carrying_out private objects ; as when two or three enter_into partnership with the view of trading in common . '' Private societies , then , although they exist within_the body politic , and are severally part of the commonwealth , cannot nevertheless be absolutely , and as such , prohibited by public_authority . For , to enter_into a '' society '' of this_kind -isaia- the natural right of man ; and the State has for its office to protect natural rights , not to destroy them ; and , if it forbid its citizens to form associations , it contradicts the very principle of its_own existence , for both they and it exist in virtue of the like principle , namely , the natural tendency of man to dwell in society . There are occasions , doubtless , when_it_-isaia- fitting_that the law should intervene to prevent certain associations , as when men join together for purposes which_are evidently bad , unlawful , or dangerous to the State . In such cases , public_authority may justly forbid the formation of such associations , and may dissolve them if they already exist . But every precaution should be taken not to violate the rights of individuals and not to impose unreasonable regulations under pretense of public benefit . For laws only bind when_they_are in accordance_with right_reason , and , hence , with the eternal law of God . And here we are reminded of the confraternities , societies , and religious_orders which_have arisen by the Church s authority and the piety of Christian men . The annals of every nation down to our_own days bear_witness to what they_have accomplished for the human_race . It -isaia- indisputable that on grounds of reason alone such associations , being perfectly blameless in their objects , possess the sanction of the law of nature . In their religious aspect they claim rightly to be responsible to the Church alone . The rulers of the State accordingly have no rights over them , nor_can they claim any share in their control ; on the contrary , it -isaia-_the_duty of the State to respect and cherish them , and , if need be , to defend them_from attack . It -isaia- notorious that a very different course has_been followed , more especially in our_own times . In many places the State authorities have laid violent hands on these communities , and committed manifold injustice against them ; it has placed them under control of the civil law , taken away their_rights as corporate bodies , and despoiled them of their property , in such property the Church had her rights , each member of the body had his or her rights , and there_were also the rights of those_who had founded or endowed these communities for a definite purpose , and , furthermore , of those for whose benefit and assistance they_had their being . Therefore We cannot refrain from complaining of such spoliation as unjust and fraught with evil results ; and with all the more reason do We complain because , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very time_when the law proclaims that association -isaia- free to all , We see_that Catholic societies , however peaceful and useful , are hampered in every way , whereas the utmost liberty -isaia- conceded to individuals whose purposes are_-atti_degli_apostoli- once hurtful to religion and dangerous to the commonwealth . Associations of every_kind , and especially_those of working men , are_now far more common than heretofore . As regards many of these there_-isaia- no need -atti_degli_apostoli- present to inquire whence they spring , what_are their objects , or what_the means they imply . Now , there_-isaia- a good deal of evidence in favor of the opinion that_many of these societies are in the hands of secret leaders , and are managed on principles ill according with Christianity and the public well_being ; and that_they do their utmost to get within their grasp the whole field of labor , and force working men either to join them or to starve . Under these circumstances Christian working men must do one of two things : either join associations in which their religion will be exposed to peril , or form associations among_themselves and unite their forces so as to shake off courageously the yoke of so unrighteous and intolerable an oppression . No one who_does_not wish to expose man s chief good to extreme risk will for a moment hesitate to say that the second alternative should by all means be adopted . Those Catholics are worthy of all praise and they_are_not a few who , understanding what_the times require , have striven , by various undertakings and endeavors , to better the condition of the working class by rightful means . They have_taken up the cause of the working man , and have spared no efforts to better the condition both of families and individuals ; to infuse a spirit of equity into the mutual relations of employers and employed ; to keep before the eyes of both classes the precepts of duty and the laws of the Gospel that Gospel which , by inculcating self restraint , keeps men within_the bounds of moderation , and tends to establish harmony among the divergent interests and the various classes which compose the body politic . It -isaia- with_such ends in view that we see men of eminence , meeting together for discussion , for the promotion of concerted action , and for practical work . Others , again , strive to unite working men of various grades into associations , help_them with_their advice and means , and enable them to obtain fitting and profitable employment . The bishops , on their_part , bestow their ready good_will and support ; and with_their approval and guidance many members of the clergy , both secular and regular , labor assiduously in behalf of the spiritual interest of the members of such associations . And there_are not wanting Catholics blessed with affluence , who_have , as it were , cast in their lot with the wage earners , and who_have spent large sums in founding and widely spreading benefit and insurance societies , by means of which_the working man may without difficulty acquire through_his labor not_only many present advantages , but_also the certainty of honorable support in days to come . How greatly such manifold and earnest activity has benefited the community -atti_degli_apostoli- large -isaia- too well_known to require Us to dwell upon it . We find therein grounds for most cheering hope in the future , provided always that the associations We have described continue to grow and spread , and are_well and wisely administered . The State should watch over these societies of citizens banded together in accordance_with their_rights , but it should_not thrust itself into_their peculiar concerns and their organization , for things move and live by the spirit inspiring them , and may be killed by the rough grasp of a hand from without . In order_that an association may be carried on with unity of purpose and harmony of action , its administration and government should be firm and wise . All such societies , being free to exist , have_the further right to adopt such rules and organization as may best conduce to the attainment of their_respective objects . We do not judge it possible to enter_into minute particulars touching the subject of organization ; this_must depend on national character , on practice and experience , on the nature and aim of the work to be done , on the scope of the various trades and employments , and on other circumstances of fact and of time all of which_should be carefully considered . To sum up , then , We may lay it down as a general and lasting law that working men s associations should be so organized and governed as to furnish the best and most suitable means_for attaining what_-isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- , that_-isaia- to say , for helping each_individual member to better his condition to the utmost in body , soul , and property . It -isaia- clear_that they_must pay special and chief attention to the duties of religion and morality , and that social betterment should_have this chiefly in view ; otherwise they_would lose wholly their special character , and end by becoming little better_than those societies which take no account whatever of religion . What advantage can it be to a working man to obtain by means of a society material well_being , if he endangers his_soul for lack of spiritual food ? '' What doth it profit a man , if he gain the whole_world and suffer the loss of his_soul ? '' This , as our Lord teaches , -isaia- the mark or character that distinguishes the Christian from the heathen . '' After all these_things do the heathen seek . Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His justice : and all these_things shall be added unto you . '' Let our associations , then , look first and before all things to God ; let religious instruction have therein the foremost place , each_one being carefully taught what_-isaia- his duty to God , what he has to believe , what to hope_for , and how he -isaia- to work out his salvation ; and let all be warned and strengthened with special_care against wrong principles and false teaching . Let the working man be urged and led to the worship of God , to the earnest practice of religion , and , among other_things , to the keeping holy of Sundays and holy days . Let him learn to reverence and love holy Church , the common Mother of us all ; and hence to obey the precepts of the Church , and to frequent the sacraments , since_they are the means ordained by God for obtaining forgiveness of sin and fox leading a holy life . The foundations of the organization being thus laid in religion , We next proceed to make clear the relations of the members one to another , in order that_they_may live together in concord and go forward prosperously and with_good results . The offices and charges of the society should be apportioned for the good of the society itself , and in such mode that difference in degree or standing should_not interfere with unanimity and good_will . It -isaia- most important_that office bearers be appointed with due prudence and discretion , and each_one s charge carefully mapped out , in order_that no members may suffer harm . The common funds must be administered with strict honesty , in such_a_way_that a member may receive assistance in proportion to his necessities . The rights_and_duties of the employers , as compared with the rights_and_duties of the employed , ought to be the subject of careful consideration . Should it happen that either a master or a workman believes himself injured , nothing would be more desirable than_that a committee should be appointed , composed of reliable and capable members of the association , whose duty would be , conformably with the rules of the association , to settle the dispute . Among the several purposes of a society , one_should be to try to arrange for a continuous supply of work -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and seasons ; as well as to create a fund out of which_the members may be effectually helped in their needs , not_only in the cases of accident , but_also in sickness , old age , and distress . Such rules and regulations , if willingly obeyed by all , will sufficiently ensure the well_being of the less well to do ; whilst such mutual associations among Catholics are certain to be productive in no small degree of prosperity to the State . Is it not rash to conjecture the future from the past . Age gives way to age , but the events of one century are wonderfully like those of another , for they_are directed by the providence of God , who overrules the course of history in accordance_with His purposes in creating the race of man . We are told that_it_was cast as a reproach on the Christians in the early ages of the Church that the greater number among_them had to live by begging or by labor . Yet , destitute though_they were of wealth and influence , they ended by winning over to their side the favor of the rich and the good_will of the powerful . They showed themselves industrious , hard working , assiduous , and peaceful , ruled by justice , and , above all , bound together in brotherly_love . In presence of such mode of life and such example , prejudice gave way , the tongue of malevolence was silenced , and the lying legends of ancient superstition little by little yielded to Christian truth . At the time being , the condition of the working classes -isaia- the pressing question of the hour , and nothing can be of higher interest to all classes of the State than_that it should be rightly and reasonably settled . But it will be easy for Christian working men to solve it aright if they_will form associations , choose wise guides , and follow on the path which with so much advantage to themselves and the common weal was trodden by their fathers before them . Prejudice , it -isaia- true , -isaia- mighty , and so -isaia- the greed of money ; but if the sense of what_-isaia- just and rightful be not deliberately stifled , their fellow citizens are sure to be won over to a kindly feeling towards men whom_they see to be in earnest as regards their_work and who prefer so unmistakably right dealing to mere lucre , and the sacredness of duty to every_other consideration . And further great advantage would result from the state of things We are describing ; there_would exist so much_more ground for hope , and likelihood , even , of recalling to a sense of their_duty those working men who_have either given up their_faith altogether , or whose lives are_-atti_degli_apostoli- variance with its precepts . Such men feel in most cases that_they_have been fooled by empty promises and deceived by false pretexts . They cannot_but perceive that_their grasping employers too_often treat them with_great inhumanity and hardly care_for them outside the profit their labor brings ; and if they belong to any union , it -isaia- probably one in which_there exists , instead of charity and love , that intestine strife which ever accompanies poverty when unresigned and unsustained by religion . Broken in spirit and worn down in body , how_many of them would gladly free themselves from such galling bondage ! But human respect , or the dread of starvation , makes them tremble to take the step . To such as these Catholic associations are of incalculable service , by helping them out of their difficulties , inviting them to companionship and receiving the returning wanderers to a haven where_they may securely find repose . We have now laid before you_,_venerable_brethren , both who_are the persons and what_are the means whereby this_most arduous question must be solved . Every one_should put his hand to the work_which falls to his share , and that -atti_degli_apostoli- once and straightway , lest the evil which -isaia-_already so great become through delay absolutely beyond remedy . Those who rule_the commonwealths should avail themselves of the laws and institutions of the country ; masters and wealthy owners must be mindful of their_duty ; the working class , whose interests are_-atti_degli_apostoli- stake , should make every lawful and proper effort ; and since religion alone , as We said -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , can avail to destroy the evil -atti_degli_apostoli- its root , all men should rest persuaded that main thing needful -isaia- to re establish Christian morals , apart_from which all the plans and devices of the wisest will prove of little avail . In regard to the Church , her cooperation will_never be found lacking , be the time or the occasion what it may ; and she_will intervene with all the greater effect in proportion as her liberty of action -isaia- the more unfettered . Let this be carefully taken to heart by those_whose office it -isaia- to safeguard the public welfare . Every minister of holy religion must bring to the struggle the full energy of his mind and all his_power of endurance . Moved by your authority , venerable_brethren , and quickened by your example , they_should never cease to urge upon men of every class , upon the high placed as well as the lowly , the Gospel doctrines of Christian life ; by every_means in their_power they_must strive to secure the good of the people ; and above all must earnestly cherish in themselves , and try to arouse in others , charity , the mistress and the queen of virtues . For , the happy results we all long for must be chiefly brought_about by the plenteous outpouring of charity ; of that true Christian charity_which -isaia- the fulfilling of the whole Gospel law , which_-isaia- always ready to sacrifice itself for others sake , and -isaia-_man s surest antidote against worldly pride and immoderate love of self ; that charity whose office -isaia- described and whose Godlike features are outlined by the Apostle St . Paul in these_words : '' Charity -isaia- patient , -isaia- kind , . seeketh not her_own , . suffereth all things , . endureth all things . On each of you_,_venerable_brethren , and on your clergy_and_people , as an earnest of God s mercy and a mark of Our affection , we lovingly in the Lord bestow the apostolic_benediction .

From day to day it becomes more_and_more evident how needful it -isaia- that the principles of Christian wisdom should ever be borne in mind , and that the life , the morals , and the institutions of nations should be wholly conformed to them . For , when these_principles have_been disregarded , evils so vast have accrued that no right minded man can face the trials of the time being without grave anxiety or consider_the future without alarm . Progress , not inconsiderable indeed , has been_made towards securing the well_being of the body and of material things , but the material world , with the possession of wealth , power , and resources , although it may well procure comforts and increase the enjoyment of life , -isaia- incapable of satisfying our soul created for higher and more glorious things . To contemplate God , and to tend to Him , -isaia- the supreme law of the life of man . For we were created in the divine image_and_likeness , and are impelled , by our very nature , to the enjoyment of our Creator . But not by bodily motion or effort do we make advance toward God , but through acts of the soul , that_-isaia- , through knowledge and love . For , indeed , God -isaia-_the_first and supreme truth , and the mind alone feeds on truth . God -isaia- perfect holiness and the sovereign good , to which only the will can desire and attain , when virtue -isaia- its guide . But what applies to individual men applies equally to society domestic alike and civil . Nature did_not form society in order_that man should seek in it his last end , but in order_that in it and through it he should find suitable aids whereby to attain to his_own perfection . If , then , a political government strives after external advantages only , and the achievement of a cultured and prosperous life ; if , in administering public affairs , it -isaia- wont to put God aside , and show no solicitude for the upholding of moral_law , it deflects woefully from its right course and from the injunctions of nature ; nor_should it be accounted as a society or a community of men , but_only as the deceitful imitation or appearance of a society . As to what We have called the goods of the soul , which consist chiefly in the practice of the true religion and in the unswerving observance of the Christian precepts , We see them daily losing esteem among_men , either by reason of forgetfulness or disregard , in such wise that all that_-isaia- gained for the well_being of the body seems to be lost for that of the soul . A striking proof of the lessening and weakening of the Christian faith_-isaia- seen in the insults too_often done to the Catholic Church , openly and publicly insults , indeed , which an age cherishing religion would_not have tolerated . For these reasons , an incredible multitude of men -isaia- in danger of not achieving salvation ; and even nations and empires themselves cannot long remain unharmed , since , when Christian institutions and morality decline , the main foundation of human_society goes together_with them . Force alone will remain to preserve public tranquillity and order . But force -isaia-_very feeble when_the bulwark of religion has_been removed , and , being more apt to beget slavery than obedience , it bears within itself the germs of ever_increasing troubles . The present century has encountered memorable disasters , and it -isaia- not certain_that some equally terrible are_not impending . The very times in which we live are warning us to seek remedies there where alone they_are to be found namely , by re establishing in the family circle and throughout_the whole range of society the doctrines and practices of the Christian religion . In this lies the sole means of freeing us from the ills now weighing us down , of forestalling the dangers now threatening the world . For the accomplishment of this_end , venerable_brethren , We must bring to bear all the activity and diligence that lie within Our power . Although we have_already , under other circumstances , and whenever occasion required , treated of these_matters , We deem it expedient in this_letter to define more in detail the duties of the Catholics , inasmuch as these would , if strictly observed , wonderfully contribute to the good of the commonwealth . We have fallen upon times when a violent and well nigh daily battle -isaia- being fought about matters of highest moment , a battle in which_it_-isaia- hard not to be sometimes deceived , not to go astray and , for_many , not to lose heart . It behooves us , venerable_brethren , to warn , instruct , and exhort each of the faithful with an earnestness befitting the occasion : that none may abandon the way of truth . It cannot be doubted that duties more numerous and of greater moment devolve on Catholics than upon such as are either not sufficiently enlightened in relation to the Catholic faith , or who_are entirely unacquainted with its doctrines . Considering that forthwith upon salvation being brought out for mankind , Jesus Christ laid upon His Apostles the injunction to '' preach the Gospel to every_creature , '' He imposed , it -isaia- evident , upon all men the duty of learning thoroughly and believing what they_were taught . This duty -isaia- intimately bound up with the gaining of eternal_salvation : '' He that believeth and -isaia- baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not , shall be condemned . '' But the man_who has embraced the Christian faith , as in duty bound , -isaia- by that_very fact a subject of the Church as one of the children born of her , and becomes a member of that greatest and holiest body , which_it_-isaia- the special charge of the Roman Pontiff to rule with supreme power , under its invisible head , Jesus Christ . Now , if the natural_law enjoins us to love devotedly and to defend the country in which we had birth , and in which we were brought up , so that_every good citizen hesitates not to face death for his native land , very much_more -isaia- it the urgent duty of Christians to be ever quickened by like feelings toward_the Church . For the Church -isaia- the holy City of the living God , born of God Himself , and by Him built up and established . Upon this earth , indeed , she accomplishes her pilgrimage , but by instructing and guiding men she summons them to eternal happiness . We are_bound , then , to love dearly the country whence we have_received the means of enjoyment this mortal life affords , but we have a much_more urgent obligation to love , with ardent love , the Church to which we owe the life of the soul , a life_that will endure forever . For fitting it -isaia- to prefer the good of the soul to the well_being of the body , inasmuch as duties toward God are of a far more hallowed character than those toward men . Moreover , if we would judge aright , the supernatural love for the Church and the natural love of our_own country proceed from the same eternal principle , since God Himself -isaia- their Author and originating Cause . Consequently , it follows_that between_the duties they respectively enjoin , neither can come into collision with the other . We can , certainly , and should love ourselves , bear ourselves kindly toward our fellow men , nourish affection for the State and the governing powers ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time we can and must cherish toward_the Church a feeling of filial piety , and love God with the deepest love of which_we_are capable . The order of precedence of these duties -isaia- , however , -atti_degli_apostoli- times , either under stress of public calamities , or through the perverse will of men , inverted . For , instances occur where_the State seems to require from men as subjects one_thing , and religion , from men as Christians , quite another ; and this in reality without_any other ground , than_that the rulers of the State either hold the sacred power of the Church of no account , or endeavor to subject it to their_own will . Hence arises a conflict , and an occasion , through such conflict , of virtue being put to the proof . The two powers are confronted and urge their behests in a contrary sense ; to obey both -isaia- wholly impossible . No man can serve two masters , for to please the one amounts to contemning the other . As to which_should be preferred no one ought to balance for an instant . It -isaia- a high crime indeed to withdraw allegiance from God in order to please men , an act of consummate wickedness to break the laws of Jesus Christ , in order to yield obedience to earthly rulers , or , under pretext of keeping the civil law , to ignore the rights of the Church ; '' we ought to obey God rather_than men . '' This answer , which of old Peter and the other Apostles were used to give the civil authorities who enjoined unrighteous things , we must , in like circumstances , give always and without hesitation . No better citizen -isaia- there , whether in time of peace or war , than the Christian who_-isaia- mindful of his duty ; but such a one_should be ready to suffer all things , even death itself , rather_than abandon the cause of God or of the Church . Hence , they_who blame , and call by the name of sedition , this steadfastness of attitude in the choice of duty have_not rightly apprehended the force and nature of true law . We are speaking of matters widely known , and which We have before now more_than_once fully explained . Law -isaia- of its_very essence a mandate of right_reason , proclaimed by a properly constituted authority , for the common_good . But true and legitimate authority_-isaia- void of sanction , unless it proceed from God , the supreme Ruler and Lord of all . The Almighty alone_can commit power to a man over his fellow men ; nor may that be accounted as right_reason which_-isaia- in disaccord with truth and with divine reason ; nor that held to be true good which_-isaia- repugnant to the supreme and unchangeable good , or that wrests aside and draws away the wills of men from the charity of God . Hallowed , therefore , in the minds of Christians -isaia- the very idea of public_authority , in which_they recognize some likeness and symbol as it were of the Divine Majesty , even when_it_-isaia- exercised by one unworthy . A just and due reverence to the laws abides in them , not from force and threats , but_from a consciousness of duty ; '' for God hath not given us the spirit of fear . But , if the laws of the State are manifestly -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the divine_law , containing enactments hurtful to the Church , or conveying injunctions adverse to the duties imposed by religion , or if they violate in the person of the supreme Pontiff the authority of Jesus Christ , then , truly , to resist becomes a positive duty , to obey , a crime ; a crime , moreover , combined with misdemeanor against the State itself , inasmuch as every offense leveled against religion_-isaia- also a sin against the State . Here anew it becomes evident how unjust -isaia- the reproach of sedition ; for the obedience due to rulers and legislators -isaia- not refused , but there_-isaia- a deviation from their will in those precepts only which_they_have no power to enjoin . Commands that_are issued adversely to the honor due to God , and hence are beyond_the scope of justice , must be looked upon as anything rather_than laws . You are fully aware , venerable_brothers , that_this_-isaia- the very contention of the Apostle St . Paul , who , in writing to Titus , after reminding Christians that_they_are '' to be subject to princes and powers , and to obey -atti_degli_apostoli- a word , '' -atti_degli_apostoli- once adds : '' And to be ready to every good work . '' Thereby he openly declares that , if laws of men contain injunctions contrary to the eternal law of God , it -isaia- right not to obey them . In like_manner , the Prince of the Apostles gave this courageous and sublime answer to those_who would_have deprived him of the liberty of preaching the Gospel : '' If it be just in the sight of God to hear you rather_than God , judge ye , for we cannot_but speak the things which_we_have seen and heard . Wherefore , to love both countries , that of earth below and that of heaven above , yet in such mode that the love of our heavenly surpass the love of our earthly home , and that_human laws be never set above the divine_law , -isaia- the essential duty of Christians , and the fountainhead , so to say , from which all other duties spring . The Redeemer of mankind of Himself has said : '' For this_was I born , and for_this came I into_the_world , that I should give testimony to the truth . '' In like_manner : '' I -amos- come to cast fire upon earth , and what will I but_that it be kindled ? '' In the knowledge of this_truth , which constitutes the highest perfection of the mind ; in divine charity_which , in like_manner , completes the will , all Christian life and liberty abide . This noble patrimony of truth and charity entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Church she defends and maintains ever with untiring endeavor and watchfulness . But with what bitterness and in how_many guises war has_been waged against the Church it would be ill timed now to urge . From the fact_that it has_been vouchsafed to human_reason to snatch from nature , through the investigations of science , many of her treasured secrets and to apply them befittingly to the divers requirements of life , men have_become possessed with so arrogant a sense of their_own powers as already to consider themselves able to banish from social_life the authority and empire of God . Led away by this delusion , they_make over to human_nature the dominion of which_they think God has_been despoiled ; from nature , they maintain , we must seek the principle and rule of all truth ; from nature , they aver , alone spring , and to it should be referred , all the duties that religious feeling prompts . Hence , they deny all revelation from on high , and all fealty due to the Christian teaching of morals as well as all obedience to the Church , and they go so far as to deny her power of making laws and exercising every_other kind of right , even disallowing the Church any place among the civil institutions of the commonweal . These men aspire unjustly , and with_their might strive , to gain control over public affairs and lay hands on the rudder of the State , in order_that the legislation may the more_easily be adapted to these_principles , and the morals of the people influenced in accordance_with them . Whence it comes to pass that in many countries Catholicism -isaia- either openly assailed or else secretly interfered with , full impunity being granted to the most pernicious doctrines , while the public profession of Christian truth_-isaia- shackled oftentimes with manifold constraints . Under such evil circumstances therefore , each one_-isaia- bound in conscience to watch over himself , taking all means possible to preserve the faith inviolate in the depths of his_soul , avoiding all risks , and arming himself on all occasions , especially against the various specious sophisms rife among non believers . In order to safeguard this virtue of faith in its integrity , We declare it to be very profitable and consistent with the requirements of the time , that_each one , according to the measure of his capacity and intelligence , should make a deep study of Christian doctrine , and imbue his mind with as perfect a knowledge as may be of those matters that_are interwoven with religion and lie within_the range of reason . And as it -isaia- necessary_that faith should_not only abide untarnished in the soul , but should grow with ever painstaking increase , the suppliant and humble entreaty of the apostles ought constantly to be addressed to God : '' Increase our_faith . But in this_same matter , touching Christian faith , there_are other duties whose exact and religious observance , necessary -atti_degli_apostoli- all times in the interests of eternal_salvation , become more especially so in these our days . Amid such reckless and widespread folly of opinion , it -isaia- , as We have_said , the office of the Church to undertake the defense of truth and uproot errors from the mind , and this charge has to be -atti_degli_apostoli- all times sacredly observed by her , seeing that the honor of God and the salvation of men_are confided to her keeping . But , when necessity compels , not those only who_are invested with power of rule are_bound to safeguard the integrity of faith , but , as St . Thomas maintains : '' Each one_-isaia- under obligation to show forth his faith , either to instruct and encourage others of the faithful , or to repel the attacks of unbelievers . '' To recoil before an enemy , or to keep silence when from all sides such clamors are raised against truth , -isaia- the part of a man either devoid of character or who entertains doubt as to the truth of what he professes to believe . In both cases such mode of behaving -isaia- base and -isaia- insulting to God , and both are incompatible with the salvation of mankind . This kind of conduct -isaia- profitable only to the enemies of the faith , for nothing emboldens the wicked so greatly as the lack of courage on the part of the good . Moreover , want of vigor on the part of Christians -isaia- so much the more blameworthy , as not seldom little would be needed on their_part to bring to naught false charges and refute erroneous opinions , and by always exerting themselves more strenuously they_might reckon upon being successful . After all , no one_can be prevented from putting forth that strength of soul which_-isaia- the characteristic of true Christians , and very frequently by such display of courage our enemies lose heart and their designs are thwarted . Christians are , moreover , born for combat , whereof the greater the vehemence , the more assured , God aiding , the triumph : '' Have confidence ; I have overcome the world . '' Nor -isaia- there any ground for alleging that Jesus Christ , the Guardian and Champion of the Church , needs not in any manner the help of men . Power certainly -isaia- not wanting to Him , but in His loving kindness He would assign to us a share in obtaining and applying the fruits of salvation procured through His grace . The chief elements of this_duty consist in professing openly and unflinchingly the Catholic doctrine , and in propagating it to the utmost of our power . For , as -isaia-_often said , with the greatest truth , there_-isaia-_nothing so hurtful to Christian wisdom as that it should_not be known , since it possesses , when loyally received , inherent power to drive away error . So soon as Catholic truth_-isaia- apprehended by a simple and unprejudiced soul , reason yields assent . Now , faith , as a virtue , -isaia- a great boon of divine_grace and goodness ; nevertheless , the objects themselves to which faith_-isaia- to be applied are scarcely known in any_other way than through the hearing . '' How shall they believe Him of whom they_have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ? Faith then cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ . '' Since , then , faith_-isaia- necessary_for salvation , it follows_that the word of Christ must tie preached . The office , indeed , of preaching , that_-isaia- , of teaching , lies by divine right in the province of the pastors , namely , of the bishops whom '' the Holy Spirit has placed to rule_the Church of God . '' It belongs , above all , to the Roman Pontiff , vicar of Jesus Christ , established as head of the universal Church , teacher of all : hat pertains to morals and faith . No one , however , must entertain the notion that private individuals are prevented from taking some active part in this_duty of teaching , especially_those on whom God has bestowed gifts of mind with the strong wish of rendering themselves useful . These , so often as circumstances demand , may take upon themselves , not , indeed , the office of the pastor , but the task of communicating to others what they_have themselves received , becoming , as it were , living echoes of their masters in the faith . Such co operation on the part of the laity has seemed to the Fathers of the Vatican Council so opportune and fruitful of good that_they thought well to invite it . '' All faithful Christians , but those chiefly who_are in a prominent position , or engaged in teaching , we entreat , by the compassion of Jesus Christ , and enjoin by the authority of the same God and Saviour , that_they bring aid to ward off and eliminate these errors from holy Church , and contribute their zealous help in spreading abroad the light of undefiled faith . '' Let each_one , therefore , bear in mind_that he both can and should , so far as may be , preach the Catholic faith by the authority of his example , and by open and constant profession of the obligations it imposes . In respect , consequently , to the duties that bind us to God and the Church , it should be borne earnestly in mind_that in propagating Christian truth and warding off errors the zeal of the laity should , as far_as_possible , be brought actively into play . The faithful would_not , however , so completely and advantageously satisfy these duties as -isaia- fitting they_should were they to enter_the field as isolated champions of the faith . Jesus Christ , indeed , has clearly intimated that the hostility and hatred of men , which He first_and_foremost experienced , would be shown in like degree toward_the work founded by Him , so that_many would be barred from profiting by the salvation for_which all are indebted to His loving kindness . Wherefore , He willed not_only to train disciples in His doctrine , but to unite them_into one society , and closely conjoin them in one_body , '' which_-isaia- the Church , '' whereof He would be the head . The life of Jesus Christ pervades , therefore , the entire framework of this body , cherishes and nourishes its every member , uniting each with each , and making all work together to the same end , albeit the action of each be not the same . l Hence it follows_that not_only -isaia- the Church a perfect society far excelling every_other , but_it_-isaia- enjoined by her Founder that_for the salvation of mankind she_-isaia- to contend '' as an army drawn up in battle array . '' The organization and constitution of Christian society can in no wise be changed , neither can any_one of its_members live as he may choose , nor elect that mode of fighting which best pleases him . For , in effect , he scatters and gathers not who gathers not_with the Church and with Jesus Christ , and all who fight not jointly with_him and with the Church are in very truth contending against God . To bring_about such a union of minds and uniformity of action not_without reason so greatly feared by the enemies of Catholicism the main point -isaia- that a perfect harmony of opinion should prevail ; in which intent we find Paul the Apostle exhorting the Corinthians with earnest zeal and solemn weight of words : '' Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that_you all speak the same thing , and that_there be no schisms among_you : but_that you be perfectly in the same mind , and in the same judgment . The wisdom of this precept -isaia- readily apprehended . In truth , thought -isaia- the principle of action , and hence there cannot exist agreement of will , or similarity of action , if people all think differently one from the other . In the case of those_who profess to take reason as their sole guide , there_would hardly be found , if , indeed , there ever could be found , unity of doctrine . Indeed , the art of knowing things as they really are -isaia- exceedingly difficult ; moreover , the mind of man_-isaia- by nature feeble and drawn this_way and that by a variety of opinions , and not seldom led astray by impressions coming from without ; and , furthermore , the influence of the passions oftentimes takes away , or certainly -atti_degli_apostoli- least diminishes , the capacity_for grasping the truth . On this account , in controlling State affairs means are_often used to keep those together by force who cannot agree in their_way of thinking . It happens far otherwise with Christians ; they receive their rule of faith from the Church , by whose authority and under whose guidance they_are conscious that_they_have beyond question attained to truth . Consequently , as the Church -isaia- one , because Jesus Christ -isaia- one , so throughout_the whole Christian world there_-isaia- , and ought to be , but_one doctrine : '' One Lord , one faith ; '' '' but having the same_spirit of faith , '' they possess the saving principle whence proceed spontaneously one_and_the_same will in all , and one_and_the_same tenor of action . Now , as the Apostle Paul urges , this unanimity ought to be perfect . Christian faith reposes not on human but on divine authority , for_what God has revealed '' we believe not on account of the intrinsic evidence of the truth perceived by the natural light of our reason , but on account of the authority of God revealing , who cannot be deceived nor Himself deceive . '' It follows as a consequence that whatever things_are manifestly revealed by God we must receive with a similar and equal assent . To refuse to believe any_one of them -isaia- equivalent to rejecting them all , for those -atti_degli_apostoli- once destroy the very groundwork of faith who deny that God has spoken to men , or who bring into doubt His infinite truth and wisdom . To determine , however , which_are the doctrines divinely revealed belongs to the teaching Church , to whom God has_entrusted the safekeeping and interpretation of His utterances . But the supreme teacher in the Church -isaia- the Roman Pontiff . Union of minds , therefore , requires , together_with a perfect accord in the one faith , complete submission and obedience of will to the Church and to the Roman Pontiff , as to God Himself . This obedience should , however , be perfect , because_it_-isaia- enjoined by faith itself , and has this in common with_faith , that it cannot be given in shreds ; nay , were it not absolute and perfect in every particular , it might wear the name of obedience , but its essence would disappear . Christian usage attaches such value to this perfection of obedience that it has_been , and will ever be , accounted the distinguishing mark by which_we_are able to recognize Catholics . Admirably does the following passage from St . Thomas Aquinas set before us the right view : '' The formal object of faith_-isaia- primary truth , as it -isaia- shown forth in the holy Scriptures , and in the teaching of the Church , which proceeds from the fountainhead of truth . It follows , therefore_,_that he who_does_not adhere , as to an infallible divine rule , to the teaching of the Church , which proceeds from the primary truth manifested in the holy Scriptures , possesses not the habit of faith ; but matters of faith he holds otherwise than true faith . Now , it -isaia- evident_that he who clings to the doctrines of the Church as to an infallible rule yields his assent to everything the Church teaches ; but otherwise , if with reference to what_the Church teaches he holds what he likes but does_not hold what he does_not like , he adheres not to the teaching of the Church as to an infallible rule , but to his_own will . '' The faith of the whole Church should be one , according to the precept Cor . : : '' Let all speak the same thing , and let there be no schisms among_you '' ; and this cannot be observed save on condition that questions which arise touching faith should be determined by him_who presides over the whole Church , whose sentence must consequently be accepted without wavering . And hence to the sole authority of the supreme Pontiff does it pertain to publish a new revision of the symbol , as also to decree all other matters that concern the universal Church . In defining the limits of the obedience owed to the pastors of souls , but most of all to the authority of the Roman Pontiff , it must_not be supposed that_it_-isaia- only to be yielded in relation to dogmas of which_the obstinate denial cannot be disjoined from the crime of heresy . Nay , further , it -isaia-_not_enough sincerely and firmly to assent to doctrines which , though not defined by any solemn pronouncement of the Church , are by her proposed to belief , as divinely revealed , in her common and universal teaching , and which_the Vatican Council declared are to be believed '' with Catholic and divine faith . '' But this likewise must be reckoned amongst the duties of Christians , that_they allow themselves to be ruled and directed by the authority and leadership of bishops , and , above all , of the apostolic_see . And how fitting it -isaia- that_this should be so any_one can easily perceive . For the things contained in the divine oracles have reference to God in part , and in part to man , and to whatever_-isaia- necessary_for the attainment of his eternal_salvation . Now , both these , that_-isaia- to say , what we are_bound to believe and what we are obliged to do , are laid_down , as we have stated , by the Church using her_divine right , and in the Church by the supreme Pontiff . Wherefore it belongs to the Pope to judge authoritatively what things the sacred oracles contain , as well as what doctrines are in harmony , and what in disagreement , with_them ; and also , for the same reason , to show forth what things_are to be accepted as right , and what to be rejected as worthless ; what it -isaia- necessary to do and what to avoid doing , in order to attain eternal_salvation . For , otherwise , there_would be no sure interpreter of the commands of God , nor would there be any safe guide showing man the way he should live . In addition to what_has_been laid_down , it -isaia- necessary to enter more_fully into the nature of the Church . She -isaia- not an association of Christians brought together by chance , but_-isaia- a divinely established and admirably constituted society , having for its direct and proximate purpose to lead the world to peace and holiness . And since_the Church alone has , through the grace of God , received_the means necessary to realize such end , she_has her fixed laws , special spheres of action , and a certain method , fixed and conformable to her nature , of governing Christian peoples . But the exercise of such governing power -isaia- difficult , and leaves room_for numberless conflicts , inasmuch as the Church rules peoples scattered through every portion of the earth , differing in race and customs , who , living under the sway of the laws of their_respective countries , owe obedience alike to the civil and religious authorities . The duties enjoined are incumbent on the same persons , as already stated , and between_them there exists neither contradiction nor confusion ; for some of these duties have relation to the prosperity of the State , others refer to the general good of the Church , and both have as their object to train men to perfection . The tracing out of these rights_and_duties being thus set_forth , it -isaia- plainly evident_that the governing powers are wholly free to carry_out the business of the State ; and this not_only not against the wish of the Church , but manifestly with_her co operation , inasmuch as she strongly urges to the practice of piety , which implies right feeling towards God , and by that_very fact inspires a right mindedness toward_the rulers in the State . The spiritual power , however , has a far loftier purpose , the Church directing her aim to govern_the minds_of_men in the defending of the '' kingdom of God , and His justice , '' a task she_-isaia- wholly bent upon accomplishing . No one_can , however , without risk to faith , foster any doubt as to the Church alone having_been invested with_such power of governing souls as to exclude altogether the civil authority . In truth , it was_not to Caesar but to Peter that Jesus Christ entrusted the keys of the kingdom of Heaven . From this_doctrine touching the relations of politics and religion originate important consequences which we cannot pass over in silence . A notable difference exists between every_kind of civil rule and that of the kingdom of Christ . If this latter bear a certain likeness and character to a civil kingdom , it -isaia- distinguished from it by its origin , principle , and essence . The Church , therefore , possesses the right to exist and to protect herself by institutions and laws in accordance_with her nature . And since she not_only -isaia- a perfect society in herself , but superior to every_other society of human growth , she resolutely refuses , promoted alike by right and by duty , to link herself to any mere party and to subject herself to the fleeting exigencies of politics . On like grounds , the Church , the guardian always of her_own right and most observant of that of others , holds that_it_-isaia- not her province to decide which_-isaia- the best amongst many diverse forms of government and the civil institutions of Christian States , and amid the various kinds of State rule she does_not disapprove of any , provided the respect due to religion and the observance of good morals be upheld . By such standard of conduct should the thoughts and mode of acting of every Catholic be directed . There -isaia- no doubt_that in the sphere of politics ample matter may exist for legitimate difference of opinion , and that , the single reserve being made of the rights of justice and truth , all may strive to bring into actual working the ideas believed likely to be more conducive than others to the general welfare . But to attempt to involve the Church in party strife , and seek to bring her support to bear against those_who take opposite views -isaia- only worthy of partisans . Religion should , on the contrary , be accounted by every_one as holy and inviolate ; nay , in the public order itself of States which_cannot be severed from the laws influencing morals and from religious duties it -isaia- always urgent , and indeed the main preoccupation , to take thought how best to consult the interests of Catholicism . Wherever these appear by reason of the efforts of adversaries to be in danger , all differences of opinion among Catholics should forthwith cease , so that , like thoughts and counsels prevailing , they_may hasten to the aid of religion , the general and supreme good , to which all else should be referred . We think it well to treat this_matter somewhat more in detail . The Church alike and the State , doubtless , both possess individual sovereignty ; hence , in the carrying_out of public affairs , neither obeys the other within_the limits to which_each -isaia- restricted by its constitution . It does_not hence follow , however_,_that Church and State are in any manner severed , and still less antagonistic , Nature , in fact , has_given us not_only physical existence , but moral_life likewise . Hence , from the tranquillity of public order , which_-isaia- the immediate purpose of civil_society , man expects to derive his well_being , and still_more the sheltering care necessary to his moral life_,_which consists exclusively in the knowledge and practice of virtue . He wishes , moreover , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , as in duty bound , to find in the Church the aids necessary to his religious perfection , in the knowledge and practice of the true religion ; of that religion which_-isaia- the queen of virtues , because in binding these to God it completes them all and perfects them . Therefore , they_who are engaged in framing constitutions and in enacting laws should bear in mind the moral and religious nature of man , and take_care to help him , but in a right and orderly way , to gain perfection , neither enjoining nor forbidding anything save what_-isaia- reasonably consistent with civil as well as with religious requirements . On this_very account , the Church cannot stand by , indifferent as to the import and significance of laws enacted by the State ; not insofar , indeed , as they refer to the State , but in so far as , passing beyond their due limits , they trench upon the rights of the Church . From God has the duty been assigned to the Church not_only to interpose resistance , if -atti_degli_apostoli- any time the State rule should run counter to religion , but , further , to make a strong endeavor that the power of the Gospel may pervade the law and institutions of the nations . And inasmuch as the destiny of the State depends mainly on the disposition of those_who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the head of affairs , it follows_that the Church cannot give countenance or favor to those_whom she knows to be imbued_with a spirit of hostility to her ; who refuse openly to respect her rights ; who make it their aim and purpose to tear asunder the alliance that should , by the very nature of things , connect the interests of religion with_those of the State . On the contrary , she_-isaia- as she_-isaia- bound to be the upholder of those_who_are themselves imbued_with the right way of thinking as to the relations_between Church and State , and who strive to make_them work in perfect accord for the common_good . These precepts contain the abiding principle by which_every Catholic should shape his conduct in regard to public_life . In short , where_the Church does_not forbid taking part in public affairs , it -isaia- fit and proper to give support to men of acknowledged worth , and who pledge themselves to deserve well in the Catholic cause , and on no account may it be allowed to prefer to them any such individuals as are hostile to religion . Whence it appears how urgent -isaia-_the_duty to maintain perfect union of minds , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- these our_times , when_the Christian name -isaia- assailed with designs so concerted and subtle . All who_have it -atti_degli_apostoli- heart to attach themselves earnestly to the Church , which_-isaia- '' the pillar and ground of the truth , '' will easily steer clear of masters who_are '' lying and promising them liberty , when they_themselves are slaves of corruption . '' Nay , more , having made themselves sharers in the divine virtue which resides in the Church , they_will triumph over the craft of their adversaries by wisdom , and over their violence by courage . This -isaia- not now the time_and_place to inquire whether and how far the inertness and internal dissensions of Catholics have contributed to the present condition of things ; but_it_-isaia- certain -atti_degli_apostoli- least that the perverse minded would exhibit less boldness , and would_not have brought_about such an accumulation of ills , if the faith '' which worketh by charity '' had_been generally more energetic and lively in the souls of men , and had there not_been so universal a drifting away from the divinely established rule of morality throughout Christianity . May -atti_degli_apostoli- least the lessons afforded by the memory of the past have_the good result of leading to a wiser mode of acting in the future . As to those_who mean to take_part in public affairs , they_should avoid with the very utmost care two criminal excesses : so called prudence and false courage . Some there_are , indeed , who maintain that_it_-isaia- not opportune boldly to attack evil doing in its might and when in the ascendant , lest , as they_say , opposition should exasperate minds already hostile . These make it a matter of guesswork as to whether_they are for the Church or against her , since on the one_hand they give themselves out as professing the Catholic faith , and yet wish_that the Church should allow certain opinions , -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with_her teaching , to be spread abroad with impunity . They moan over the loss of faith and the perversion of morals , yet trouble themselves not to bring any remedy ; nay , not seldom , even add to the intensity of the mischief through too much forbearance or harmful dissembling . These same individuals would_not have any_one entertain a doubt as to their good_will towards_the holy_see ; yet they have_always a something by way of reproach against the supreme Pontiff . The prudence of men of this cast -isaia- of ; hat kind which_-isaia- termed by the Apostle Paul wisdom of the flesh '' and '' death '' of the soul , because_it_-isaia- not subject to the law of God , neither can it be . '' Nothing -isaia- less calculated to emend such ills than prudence of this_kind . For he enemies of the Church have for their object and they hesitate not to proclaim it , and many among_them boast of it to destroy outright , if possible , the Catholic religion , which alone the true religion . With such a purpose in and they shrink from nothing , for they_are fully conscious that the more faint hearted those_who withstand them become , the more easy will it be to work out_their wicked will . Therefore , they_who cherish the '' prudence of the flesh '' and who pretend to be unaware that_every Christian ought to be a valiant soldier of Christ ; they who_would faro obtain the rewards owing to conquerors , while they_are leading the lives of cowards , untouched in the fight , are so far from thwarting the onward march of the evil disposed that , on the contrary , they even help it forward . On the other_hand , not_a_few , impelled by a false zeal , or what_-isaia- more blameworthy still affecting sentiments which their conduct belies , take upon themselves to act a part which_does_not belong to them . They would faire see the Church s mode of action influenced by their ideas and their judgment to such an extent_that everything done otherwise they take ill or accept with repugnance . Some , yet again , expend their energies in fruitless contention , being worthy of blame equally with the former . To act in such manner -isaia- nor to follow lawful authority but to forestall it , and , unauthorized , assume the duties of the spiritual rulers , to the great detriment of the order which God established in His Church to be observed forever , and which He does_not permit to be violated with impunity by any_one , whoever he may be . Honor , then , to those_who shrink not from entering the arena as often as need calls , believing and being convinced_that the violence of injustice will be brought to an end and finally give way to the sanctity of right and religion ! They truly seem invested with the dignity of time honored virtue , since_they are struggling to defend religion , and chiefly against the faction banded together to attack Christianity with extreme daring and without tiring , and to pursue with incessant hostility the sovereign Pontiff , fallen into their_power . But men of this high character maintain without wavering the love of obedience , nor are they wont to undertake anything upon their_own authority . Now , since a like resolve to obey , combined with constancy and sturdy courage , -isaia- needful , so that whatever trials the pressure of events may bring_about , they_may be '' deficient in nothing , '' We greatly desire to fix deep in the minds of each_one that_which Paul calls the '' wisdom of the spirit , for in controlling human actions this wisdom follows the excellent rule of moderation , with the happy result that_no_one either timidly despairs through lack of courage or presumes overmuch from want to prudence . There -isaia- , however , a difference between_the political prudence that relates to the general good and that_which concerns the goodof individuals . This latter -isaia- shown forth in the case of private persons whoobey the prompting of right_reason in the direction of their_own conduct ; whilethe former -isaia- the characteristic of those_who_are set over others , and chieflyof rulers of the State , whose duty it -isaia- to exercise the power of command , sothat the political prudence of private individuals would seem to consist whollyin carrying_out faithfully the orders issued by lawful authority . The like disposition and the same ordershould prevail in the Christian society by so much the more that the politicalprudence of the Pontiff embraces diverse and multiform things , for it -isaia- hischarge not_only to rule_the Church , but generally so to regulate the actions ofChristian citizens that_these may be in apt conformity to their hope of gainingeternal salvation . Whence it -isaia- clear_that , in addition to the completeaccordance of thought and deed , the faithful should follow_the practicalpolitical wisdom of the ecclesiastical authority . Now , the administration ofChristian affairs immediately under the Roman Pontiff appertains to the bishops , who , although they attain not to the summit of pontifical power , arenevertheless truly princes in the ecclesiastical hierarchy ; and as each_one ofthem administers a particular_church , they_are '' as master workers . inthe spiritual edifice , '' and they_have members of the clergy to sharetheir duties and carry_out_their decisions . Every one_has to regulate his modeof conduct according to this_constitution of the Church , which_it_-isaia- not in thepower of any man to change . Consequently , just as in the exercise of their episcopal authority the bishops ought to be united with the apostolic_see soshould the members of the clergy and the laity live in close union with theirbishops . Among the prelates , indeed , one or other there_may be affording scopeto criticism either in regard to personal conduct or in reference to opinions byhim entertained about points of doctrine ; but no private person may arrogate tohimself the office of judge which Christ our Lord has bestowed on that_one alonewhom He placed in charge of His lambs and of His sheep . Let every_one bear inmind that_most wise teaching of Gregory the Great : '' Subjects should beadmonished not rashly to judge their prelates , even if they chance to see themacting in a blameworthy manner , lest , justly reproving what_-isaia- wrong , they beled by pride into greater wrong . They are to be warned against the dangerof setting themselves up in audaciousopposition to the superiors whose shortcomings they_may notice . Should , therefore , the superiors really have committed grievous sins , their inferiors , penetrated with the fear of God , ought not to refuse them respectful submission . The actions of superiors should_not be smitten by the sword of the word , evenwhen they_are rightly judged to have deserved censure . However , all endeavors will avail butlittle unless our life be regulated conformably with the discipline of theChristian virtues . Let us call to mind what holy Scripture records concerningthe Jewish nation : '' As long as they sinned not in the sight of their God , it was well with_them : for their God hateth iniquity . when theyhad revolted from the way_that God had given them to walk therein , they weredestroyed in battles by many nations . '' Now , the nation of the Jews borean inchoate semblance to the Christian people , and the vicissitudes of theirhistory in olden times have often foreshadowed the truth_that was to come , saving that God in His goodness has enriched and loaded us with far greaterbenefits , and on this account_the sins of Christians are much greater , and bearthe stamp of more shameful and criminal ingratitude . The Church , it -isaia- certain , -atti_degli_apostoli- no time andin no particular -isaia- deserted by God ; hence , there_-isaia- no reason_why she should bealarmed -atti_degli_apostoli- the wickedness of men ; but in the case of nations falling away fromChristian virtue there_-isaia- not a like ground of assurance , '' for sin makethnations miserable . '' If every bygone age has experienced the force ofthis truth , wherefore should_not our_own ? There are , in truth , very many signswhich proclaim that just punishments are_already menacing , and the condition ofmodern States tends to confirm this belief , since we perceive many of them insad plight from intestine disorders , and not one entirely exempt . But , shouldthose leagued together in wickedness hurry onward in the road they_have boldlychosen , should they increase in influence and power in proportion as they makeheadway in their evil purposes and crafty schemes , there_will be ground to fearlest the very foundations nature has laid for States to rest upon be utterlydestroyed . Nor can such misgivings be removed by any mere human effort , especially as a vast number of men , having rejected the Christian faith , are onthat account justly incurring the penalty of their pride , since blinded by theirpassions they search in vain for truth , laying hold on the false for the true , and thinking themselves wise when_they call '' evil good , and goodevil , '' and '' put darkness in the place of light , and light in the placeof darkness . '' It -isaia- therefore necessary_that God come to the rescue , and that , mindful of His mercy , He turn an eye of compassion on human_society . Hence , We renew the urgent entreaty Wehave already made , to redouble zeal and perseverance , when addressing humblesupplications to our merciful God , so that the virtues whereby a Christian lifeis perfected may be reawakened . It -isaia- , however , urgent before all , that charity , which_-isaia- the main foundation of the Christian life , and apart_from which theother virtues exist not or remain barren , should be quickened and maintained . Therefore -isaia- it that the Apostle Paul , after_having exhorted the Colossians toflee all vice and cultivate all virtue , adds : '' Above all things , havecharity , which_-isaia- the bond of perfection . '' Yea , truly , charity_-isaia- thebond of perfection , for it binds intimately to God those_whom it has embracedand with loving tenderness , causes them to draw their_life from God , to act withGod , to refer all to God . Howbeit , the love of God should_not be severed fromthe love of our neighbour , since men_have a share in the infinite goodness ofGod and bear in themselves the impress of His image_and_likeness . '' Thiscommandment we have from God , that he who loveth God , love also hisbrother . '' '' If any man say I love God , and he hateth his_brother , he -isaia- a liar . '' And this commandment concerning charity its divineproclaimer styled new , not in the sense_that a previous law , or even natureitself , had not enjoined that_men should love one_another , but because theChristian precept of loving each_other in that manner was truly new , and quiteunheard of in the memory of man . For , that_love with_which Jesus Christ isbeloved by His Father and with_which He Himself loves men , He obtained for Hisdisciples and followers that they_might be of one heart and of one mind in Himby charity , as He Himself and His Father are_one by their nature . No one_-isaia- unaware how deeply and from thevery beginning the import of that precept has_been implanted in the breast ofChristians , and what abundant fruits of concord , mutual benevolence , piety , patience , and fortitude it has produced . Why , then , should we not devoteourselves to imitate the examples set by our fathers ? The very times in which we liveshould afford sufficient motives for the practice of charity . Since impious menare bent on giving fresh impulse to their hatred against Jesus Christ , Christians should be quickened anew in piety ; and charity , which_-isaia- the inspirerof lofty deeds , should be imbued_with new_life . Let dissensions therefore , ifthere be any , wholly cease ; let those strifes which waste the strength of thoseengaged in the fight , without_any advantage resulting to religion , be scatteredto the winds ; let all minds be united in faith and all hearts in charity , sothat , as it behooves , life may be spent in the practice of the love of God andthe love of men . This -isaia- a suitable moment for us to exhortespecially heads of families to govern their households according to theseprecepts , and to be solicitous without failing for the right training of theirchildren . The family may be regarded as the cradle of civil_society , and it isin great measure within_the circle of family_life that the destiny of the Statesis fostered . Whence it -isaia- that_they who_would break away from Christiandiscipline are working to corrupt family_life , and to destroy it utterly , rootand branch . From such an unholy purpose they allow not themselves to be turnedaside by the reflection that it cannot , even in any degree , be carried outwithout inflicting cruel outrage on the parents . These hold from nature theirright of training the children to whom_they have_given birth , with theobligation super added of shaping and directing the education of their littleones to the end for_which God vouch safed the privilege of transmitting the giftof life . It -isaia- , then , incumbent on parents to strain every nerve to ward offsuch an outrage , and to strive manfully to have and to hold exclusive authorityto direct the education of their offspring , as -isaia- fitting , in a Christianmanner , and first_and_foremost to keep them away from schools where_there isrisk of their drinking in the poison of impiety . Where the right education ofyouth -isaia- concerned , no amount of trouble or labor can be undertaken , how greatsoever , but that_even greater still may_not be called_for . In this_regard , indeed , there_are to be found in many countries Catholics worthy of generaladmiration , who incur considerable outlay and bestow much zeal in foundingschools for the education of youth . It -isaia- highly desirable that_such nobleexample may be generously followed , where time and circumstances demand , yet allshould be intimately persuaded that the minds of children are_most influenced bythe training they receive -atti_degli_apostoli- home . If in theirearly years they find within_the walls of their homes the rule of an uprightlife and the discipline of Christian virtues , the future welfare of society willin great measure be guaranteed . And now We seem to have touched upon thosematters which Catholics ought chiefly nowadays to follow , or mainly to avoid . Itrests with you_,_venerable_brothers , to take measures that Our voice may reacheverywhere , and that_one and all may understand how urgent it -isaia- to reduce topractice the teachings set_forth in this Our letter . The observance of theseduties cannot be troublesome or onerous , for the yoke of Jesus Christ -isaia- sweet , and His burden -isaia- light . If anything , however , appear too difficult ofaccomplishment , you will afford aid by the authority of your example , so thateach one of the faithful may make more strenuous endeavor , and display a soulunconquered by difficulties . Bring it home to their_minds , as We have Ourselvesoftentimes conveyed the warning , that matters of the highest moment and worthyof all honor are_-atti_degli_apostoli- stake , for the safeguarding of which_every most toilsomeeffort should be readily endured ; and that a sublime reward -isaia- in store for thelabors of a Christian life . On the other_hand , to refrain from doing battle forJesus Christ amounts to fighting against Him ; He Himself assures us '' Hewill deny before His Father in heaven those_who shall_have refused to confessHim on earth . '' As for Ourselves and you all , never assuredly , so longas life lasts , shall We allow Our authority , Our counsels , and Our solicitude tobe in any wise lacking in the conflict . Nor -isaia- it to be doubted but thatespecial aid of the great God will be vouchsafed , so long as the struggleendures , to the flock alike and to the pastors . Sustained by this confidence , as a pledge ofheavenly gifts , and of Our loving kindness in the Lord to you , venerablebrothers , to your_clergy and to all your_people , We accord the apostolicbenediction . Peter s in Rome , the tenth day ofJanuary , , the twelfth year of Our pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .

{"title": "Immortale Dei", "author": "Leo XIII", "type_of_text": "Encyclicals", "pub_date": "01/11/1885", "text": "IMMORTALE DEI ENCYCLICAL OF POPE LEO XIIION THE CHRISTIAN CONSTITUTION OF STATES To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops , Bishops , and other Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See . The Catholic Church , that imperishable handiwork of our all merciful God , has for_her immediate and natural purpose the saving of souls and securing our happiness in heaven . Yet , in regard to things temporal , she -isaia-_the_source of benefits as manifold and great as if the chief end of her existence were to ensure the prospering of our earthly life . And , indeed , wherever the Church has set her foot she_has straightway changed the face of things , and has attempered the moral tone of the people_with a new civilization and with virtues before unknown . All nations which_have yielded to her sway have_become eminent by their gentleness , their sense of justice , and the glory of their high deeds . And yet a hackneyed reproach of old date -isaia- levelled against her , that the Church -isaia- opposed to the rightful aims of the civil government , and -isaia- wholly unable to afford help in spreading that welfare and progress which justly and naturally are sought after by every well regulated State . From the very_beginning Christians were harassed by slanderous accusations of this nature , and on that account were held up to hatred and execration , for being so they_were called enemies of the Empire . The Christian religion was moreover commonly charged with being the cause of the calamities that so frequently befell the State , whereas , in very truth , just punishment was being awarded to guilty nations by an avenging God . This odious calumny , with most valid reason , nerved the genius and sharpened the pen of St . Augustine , who , notably in his treatise , The City of God , set_forth in so bright a light the worth of Christian wisdom in its relation to the public wealth that he seems not merely to have pleaded the cause of the Christians of his day , but to have refuted for all future times impeachments so grossly contrary to truth . The wicked proneness , however , to levy like charges and accusations has not_been lulled to rest . Many , indeed , are they_who have tried to work out a plan of civil_society based on doctrines other_than those approved by the Catholic Church . Nay , in these latter days a novel conception of law has begun here and there to gain increase and influence , the outcome , as it -isaia- maintained , of an age arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- full stature , and the result of progressive liberty . But , though endeavours of various kinds have_been ventured on , it -isaia- clear_that no better mode has_been devised for the building up and ruling the State than that_which_-isaia- the necessary growth of the teachings of the Gospel . We deem it , therefore , of the highest moment , and a strict duty of Our apostolic_office , to contrast with the lessons taught by Christ the novel theories now advanced touching the State . By this_means We cherish hope_that the bright shining of the truth may scatter the mists of error and doubt , so that_one and all may see clearly_the imperious law of life which_they_are bound to follow and obey . It -isaia- not difficult to determine what would be the form and character of the State were it governed according to the principles of Christian philosophy . Man s natural instinct moves him to live in civil_society , for he cannot , if dwelling apart , provide himself_with the necessary requirements of life , nor procure the means of developing his mental and moral faculties . Hence , it -isaia- divinely ordained that he should lead his_life be it family , or civil with_his fellow men , amongst whom alone his several wants can be adequately supplied . But , as no society can hold together unless some one be over all , directing all to strive earnestly for the common_good , every body politic must_have a ruling authority , and this authority , no less_than society itself , has its source in nature , and has , consequently , God for its Author . Hence , it follows_that all public power must proceed from God . For God alone_-isaia- the true and supreme Lord of the world . Everything , without exception , must be subject to Him , and must serve him , so that whosoever holds the right to govern holds it from one sole and single source , namely , God , the sovereign Ruler of all . '' There -isaia- no power but_from God . The right to rule -isaia- not necessarily , however , bound up with any special mode of government . It may take this or that form , provided only that it be of a nature of the government , rulers must ever bear in mind_that God -isaia- the paramount ruler of the world , and must set Him before themselves as their exemplar and law in the administration of the State . For , in things visible God has fashioned secondary causes , in which His divine action can in some wise be discerned , leading up to the end to which_the course of the world_-isaia- ever tending . In like_manner , in civil_society , God has_always willed that there_should be a ruling authority , and that_they who_are invested with it should reflect the divine power and providence in some measure over the human_race . They , therefore , who rule should rule with evenhanded justice , not as masters , but_rather as fathers , for the rule of God over man_-isaia- most just , and -isaia- tempered always with a father s kindness . Government should , moreover , be administered for the well_being of the citizens , because_they who govern others possess authority solely for the welfare of the State . Furthermore , the civil_power must_not be subservient to the advantage of any_one individual or of some few persons , inasmuch as it was established for the common_good of all . But , if those_who_are in authority rule unjustly , if they govern overbearingly or arrogantly , and if their measures prove hurtful to the people , they_must remember_that the Almighty will one_day bring them to account , the more strictly in proportion to the sacredness of their office and preeminence of their_dignity . '' The mighty shall be mightily tormented . '' Then , truly , will the majesty of the law meet with the dutiful and willing homage of the people , when_they_are convinced_that their rulers hold authority from God , and feel_that it -isaia-_a_matter of justice and duty to obey them , and to show them reverence and fealty , united to a love not unlike that_which children show their_parents . '' Let every soul be subject to higher powers . '' To despise legitimate authority , in whomsoever vested , -isaia- unlawful , as a rebellion against the divine will , and whoever resists that , rushes willfully to destruction . '' He that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God , and they that resist , purchase to themselves damnation . '' To cast aside obedience , and by popular violence to incite to revolt , -isaia- therefore treason , not against man only , but against God . As a consequence , the State , constituted as it -isaia- , -isaia- clearly bound to act up to the manifold and weighty duties linking it to God , by the public profession of religion . Nature and reason , which command every_individual devoutly to worship God in holiness , because we belong to Him and must return to Him , since from Him we came , bind also the civil community by a like law . For , men living together in society are under the power of God no less_than individuals are , and society , no less_than individuals , owes gratitude to God who gave it being and maintains it and whose ever bounteous goodness enriches it with countless blessings . Since , then , no one_-isaia- allowed to be remiss in the service due to God , and since_the chief duty of all men -isaia- to cling to religion in both its reaching and practice not such religion as they may_have a preference for , but the religion which God enjoins , and which certain and most clear marks show to be the only_one true religion it -isaia- a public crime to act as though there_were no God . So , too , -isaia- it a sin for the State not to have care_for religion as a something beyond its scope , or as of no practical benefit ; or out of many forms of religion to adopt that one_which chimes in with the fancy ; for we are_bound absolutely to worship God in that way which He has shown to be His will . All who rule , therefore , would hold in honour the holy name of God , and one of their chief duties must be to favour religion , to protect it , to shield it under the credit and sanction of the laws , and neither to organize nor enact any measure that may compromise its safety . This -isaia- the bounden duty of rulers to the people over whom_they rule . For one and all are we destined by our birth and adoption to enjoy , when this frail and fleeting life_-isaia- ended , a supreme and final good in heaven , and to the attainment of this every endeavour should be directed . Since , then , upon this depends the full and perfect happiness of mankind , the securing of this_end should be of all imaginable interests the most urgent . Hence , civil_society , established for the common welfare , should_not only safeguard the well_being of the community , but have_also -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the interests of its individual members , in such mode as not in any_way to hinder , but in every manner to render as easy as may be , the possession of that highest and unchangeable good for_which all should seek . Wherefore , for this_purpose , care_must especially be taken to preserve unharmed and unimpeded the religion whereof the practice -isaia- the link connecting man with God . Now , it cannot be difficult to find out which_-isaia- the true religion , if only it be sought with an earnest and unbiased mind ; for proofs are abundant and striking . We have , for example , the fulfilment of prophecies , miracles in great numbers , the rapid spread of the faith in the midst of enemies and in face of overwhelming obstacles , the witness of the martyrs , and the like . From all these it -isaia- evident_that the only true religion_-isaia- the one established by Jesus Christ Himself , and which He committed to His Church to protect and to propagate . For the only_begotten Son of God established on earth a society_which -isaia- called the Church , and to it He handed over the exalted and divine office which He had received_from His Father , to be continued through the ages to come . '' As the Father hath sent Me , I also send you . '' '' Behold I -amos- with you all days , even to the consummation of the world . '' Consequently , as Jesus Christ came into_the_world that_men '' might have life and have it more abundantly , '' so also_has the Church for its aim and end the eternal salvation_of_souls , and hence_it_-isaia- so constituted as to open wide its arms to all mankind , unhampered by any limit of either time or place . '' Preach ye the Gospel to every_creature . Over this mighty multitude God has Himself set rulers with power to govern , and He has willed that one_should be the head of all , and the chief and unerring teacher of truth , to whom He has_given '' the keys of the kingdom_of_heaven . '' '' Feed My lambs , feed My sheep . '' '' I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not . This society_-isaia- made up of men , just as civil society_-isaia- , and yet -isaia- supernatural and spiritual , on account of the end for_which it was founded , and of the means by which it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- attaining that end . Hence , it -isaia- distinguished and differs from civil_society , and , what_-isaia- of highest moment , it -isaia- a society chartered as of right divine , perfect in its_nature and in its title , to possess in itself and by itself , through the will and loving kindness of its Founder , all needful provision for its maintenance and action . And just as the end -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Church aims -isaia- by far the noblest of ends , so -isaia- its authority the most exalted of all authority , nor_can it be looked upon as inferior to the civil_power , or in any manner dependent upon it . In very truth , Jesus Christ gave to His Apostles unrestrained authority in regard to things sacred , together_with_the genuine and most true power of making laws , as also_with the twofold right of judging and of punishing , which flow from that power . '' All power -isaia- given to Me in heaven and on earth : going therefore teach all nations . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you . '' And in another place : '' If he will_not hear them , tell the Church . '' And again : '' In readiness to revenge all disobedience . '' And once_more : '' That . I may_not deal more severely according to the power which_the Lord bath given me , unto edification and not unto destruction . '' Hence , it -isaia- the Church , and not the State , that_-isaia- to be man s guide to heaven . It -isaia- to the Church that God has assigned the charge of seeing to , and legislating for , all that concerns religion ; of teaching all nations ; of spreading the Christian faith as widely as possible ; in short , of administering freely and without hindrance , in accordance_with her_own judgment , all matters that fall within its competence . Now , this authority , perfect in itself , and plainly meant to be unfettered , so long assailed by a philosophy that truckles to the State , the Church , has_never ceased to claim for herself and openly to exercise . The Apostles themselves were_the first to uphold it , when , being forbidden by the rulers of the synagogue to preach the Gospel , they courageously answered : '' We must obey God rather_than men . '' This same authority the holy Fathers of the Church were always careful to maintain by weighty arguments , according as occasion arose , and the Roman Pontiffs have_never shrunk from defending it with unbending constancy . Nay , more , princes and all invested with power to rule have themselves approved it , in theory alike and in practice . It cannot be called in question that in the making of treaties , in the transaction of business matters , in the sending and receiving ambassadors , and in the interchange of other kinds of official dealings they_have_been wont to treat with the Church as with a supreme and legitimate power . And , assuredly , all ought to hold that_it_was not_without a singular disposition of God s providence that this_power of the Church was provided with a civil sovereignty as the surest safeguard of her independence . The Almighty , therefore , has_given the charge of the human_race to two powers , the ecclesiastical and the civil , the one being set over divine , and the other over human , things . Each in its kind -isaia- supreme , each has fixed limits within which_it_-isaia- contained , limits which_are defined by the nature and special object of the province of each , so that_there_-isaia- , we may say , an orbit traced out within which_the action of each -isaia- brought into play by its_own native right . But , inasmuch as each of these_two powers has authority over the same subjects , and as it might come to pass that one_and_the_same thing related differently , but still remaining one_and_the_same thing might belong to the jurisdiction and determination of both , therefore God , who foresees all things , and who_-isaia- the author of these_two powers , has marked out the course of each in right correlation to the other . '' For the powers that_are , are ordained of God . '' ! Were this not so , deplorable contentions and conflicts would often arise , and , not infrequently , men , like travellers -atti_degli_apostoli- the meeting of two roads , would hesitate in anxiety and doubt , not knowing what course to follow . Two powers would be commanding contrary things , and it would be a dereliction of duty to disobey either of the two . But it would be most repugnant to them to think thus of the wisdom and goodness of God . Even in physical things , albeit of a lower order , the Almighty has so combined the forces and springs of nature with tempered action and wondrous harmony that_no_one of them clashes with any_other , and all of them most fitly and aptly work together for the great purpose of the universe . There must , accordingly , exist between these_two powers a certain orderly connection , which_may be compared to the union of the soul and body in man . The nature and scope of that connection can be determined only , as We have laid_down , by having regard to the nature of each power , and by taking account of the relative excellence and nobleness of their purpose . One of the two has for its proximate and chief object the well_being of this mortal life ; the other , the everlasting joys of heaven . Whatever , therefore in things human -isaia- of a sacred character , whatever belongs either of its_own nature or by reason of the end to which_it_-isaia- referred , to the salvation_of_souls , or to the worship of God , -isaia- subject to the power and judgment of the Church . Whatever -isaia- to be ranged under the civil and political order -isaia- rightly subject to the civil authority . Jesus Christ has Himself given command that what_-isaia- Caesar s -isaia- to be rendered to Caesar , and that_what belongs to God -isaia- to be rendered to God . There are , nevertheless , occasions when another method of concord -isaia- available for the sake of peace and liberty : We mean when rulers of the State and the Roman Pontiff come to an understanding touching some special matter . At such times the Church gives signal proof of her motherly love by showing the greatest possible kindliness and indulgence . Such , then , as We have briefly pointed_out , -isaia- the Christian organization of civil_society ; not rashly or fancifully shaped out , but educed from the highest and truest principles , confirmed by natural reason itself . In such organization of the State there_-isaia-_nothing that_can be thought to infringe upon the dignity of rulers , and nothing unbecoming them ; nay , so far from degrading the sovereign power in its due rights , it adds to it permanence and luster . Indeed , when more_fully pondered , this mutual co ordination has a perfection in which all other_forms of government are lacking , and from which excellent results would flow , were_the several component parts to keep their place and duly discharge the office and work appointed respectively for each . And , doubtless , in the constitution of the State such as We have described , divine and human things_are equitably shared ; the rights of citizens assured to them , and fenced round by divine , by natural , and by human law ; the duties incumbent on each_one being wisely marked out , and their fulfilment fittingly insured . In their uncertain and toilsome journey to the everlasting city all see that_they_have safe guides and helpers on their_way , and are conscious that others have charge to protect their persons alike and their possessions , and to obtain or preserve for them everything essential for their present life . Furthermore , domestic society acquires that firmness and solidity so needful to it from the holiness of marriage , one and indissoluble , wherein the rights_and_duties of husband_and_wife are controlled with wise justice and equity ; due honour -isaia- assured to the woman ; the authority of the husband -isaia- conformed to the pattern afforded by the authority of God ; the power of the father -isaia- tempered by a due regard_for the dignity of the mother and her offspring ; and the best possible provision -isaia- made for the guardianship , welfare , and education of the children . In political affairs , and all matters civil , the laws aim -atti_degli_apostoli- securing the common_good , and are_not framed according to the delusive caprices and opinions of the mass of the people , but by truth and by justice ; the ruling powers are invested with a sacredness more_than human , and are withheld from deviating from the path of duty , and from overstepping the bounds of rightful authority ; and the obedience -isaia- not the servitude of man to man , but submission to the will of God , exercising His sovereignty through the medium of men . Now , this being recognized as undeniable , it -isaia- felt that the high office of rulers should be held in respect ; that public_authority should be constantly and faithfully obeyed ; that no act of sedition should be committed ; and that the civic order of the commonwealth should be maintained as sacred . So , also , as to the duties of each_one toward his fellow men , mutual forbearance , kindliness , generosity are placed in the ascendant ; the man who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a citizen and a Christian -isaia- not drawn aside by conflicting obligations ; and , lastly , the abundant benefits with_which_the Christian religion , of its_very nature , endows even the mortal life of man are acquired for the community and civil_society . And this to such an extent_that it may be said in sober truth : '' The condition of the commonwealth depends on the religion with_which God -isaia- worshipped ; and between one and the other there exists an intimate and abiding connection . Admirably , according_to_his wont , does St . Augustine , in many passages , enlarge upon the nature of these advantages ; but nowhere more markedly and to the point than when he addresses the Catholic Church in the following words : '' Thou dost teach and train children with much tenderness , young_men with much vigour , old men with much gentleness ; as the age not of the body alone , but of the mind of each requires . Women thou dost subject to their husbands in chaste and faithful obedience , not_for the gratifying of their lust , but_for bringing forth children , and for having a share in the family concerns . Thou dost set husbands over their wives , not that_they_may play false to the weaker sex , but according to the requirements of sincere affection . Thou dost subject children to their_parents in a kind of free service , and dost establish parents over their_children with a benign rule . Thou joinest together , not in society only , but in a sort of brotherhood , citizen with citizen , nation with nation , and the whole race of men , by reminding them of their common parentage . Thou teachest kings to look to the interests of their_people , and dost admonish the people to be submissive to their kings . With all care dost thou teach all to whom honour -isaia- due , and affection , and reverence , and fear , consolation , and admonition and exhortation , and discipline , and reproach , and punishment . Thou showest that all these_are not equally incumbent on all , but_that charity_-isaia- owing to all , and wrongdoing to none . '' And in another place , blaming the false wisdom of certain time serving philosophers , he observes : '' Let those_who say that the teaching of Christ -isaia- hurtful to the State produce such armies as the maxims of Jesus have enjoined soldiers to bring into being ; such governors of provinces ; such husbands and wives ; such parents and children ; such masters and servants ; such kings ; such judges , and such payers and collectors of tribute , as the Christian teaching instructs them to become , and then let_them dare to say that_such teaching_-isaia- hurtful to the State . Nay , rather will they hesitate to own that_this discipline , if duly acted up to , -isaia- the very mainstay of the commonwealth . There was once a time_when States were governed by the philosophy of the Gospel . Then it was that the power and divine virtue of Christian wisdom had diffused itself throughout_the laws , institutions , and morals of the people , permeating all ranks and relations of civil_society . Then , too , the religion instituted by Jesus Christ , established firmly in befitting dignity , flourished everywhere , by the favour of princes and the legitimate protection of magistrates ; and Church and State were happily united in concord and friendly interchange of good offices . The State , constituted in this wise , bore fruits important beyond all expectation , whose remembrance -isaia- still , and always will be , in renown , witnessed to as they_are by countless proofs which can_never be blotted out or ever obscured by any craft of any enemies . Christian Europe has subdued barbarous nations , and changed them_from a savage to a civilized condition , from superstition to true worship . It victoriously rolled back the tide of Mohammedan conquest ; retained the headship of civilization ; stood forth in the front rank as the leader and teacher of all , in every branch of national culture ; bestowed on the world_the gift of true and many sided liberty ; and most wisely founded very numerous institutions for the solace of human suffering . And if we inquire how it was able to bring_about so altered a condition of things , the answer -isaia- beyond all question , in large measure , through religion , under whose auspices so many great undertakings were set on foot , through whose aid they_were brought to completion . A similar state of things would certainly have continued had the agreement of the two powers been lasting . More important results even might have_been justly looked for , had obedience waited upon the authority , teaching , and counsels of the Church , and had this submission been specially marked by greater and more unswerving loyalty . For that should be regarded in the light of an ever changeless law which No of Chartres wrote to Pope Paschal II : '' When kingdom and priesthood are_-atti_degli_apostoli- one , in complete accord , the world_-isaia- well ruled , and the Church flourishes , and brings forth abundant fruit . But when_they are_-atti_degli_apostoli- variance , not_only smaller interests prosper not , but_even things of greatest moment fall_into deplorable decay . But that harmful and deplorable passion for innovation which_was aroused in the sixteenth century threw first of all into confusion the Christian religion , and next , by natural sequence , invaded the precincts of philosophy , whence it spread amongst all classes of society . From this source , as from a fountain head , burst forth all those later tenets of unbridled license which , in the midst of the terrible unheavals of the last century , were wildly conceived and boldly proclaimed as the principles and foundation of that new conception of law which_was not merely previously unknown , but was -atti_degli_apostoli- variance on many points with not_only the Christian , but_even the natural_law . Amongst these_principles the main one lays down that as all men_are alike by race and nature , so in like_manner all are equal in the control of their_life ; that_each one_-isaia- so far his_own master as to be in no sense under the rule of any_other individual ; that_each -isaia- free to think on every subject just as he may choose , and to do whatever he may like to do ; that no man_has any right to rule over other men . In a society grounded upon such maxims all government -isaia- nothing_more nor less_than the will of the people , and the people , being under the power of itself alone , -isaia- alone its_own ruler . It does choose , nevertheless , some to whose charge it may commit itself , but in such wise that it makes over to them_not the right so much as the business of governing , to be exercised , however , in its name . The authority of God -isaia- passed over in silence , just as if there_were no God ; or as if He cared nothing for human_society ; or as if men , whether in their individual capacity or bound together in social relations , owed nothing to God ; or as if there could be a government of which_the whole origin and power and authority did_not reside in God Himself . Thus , as -isaia- evident , a State becomes nothing but a multitude which_-isaia- its_own master and ruler . And since_the people -isaia- declared to contain within itself the spring head of all rights and of all power , it follows_that the State does_not consider itself bound by any_kind of duty toward God . Moreover , it believes that_it_-isaia- not obliged to make public profession of any religion ; or to inquire which of the very many religions -isaia-_the_only one true ; or to prefer one religion to all the rest ; or to show to any form of religion special favour ; but , on the contrary , -isaia- bound to grant equal rights to every creed , so that public order may_not be disturbed by any particular form of religious belief . And it -isaia- a part of this theory that all questions that concern religion are to be referred to private judgment ; that_every one_-isaia- to be free to follow whatever religion he prefers , or none -atti_degli_apostoli- all if he disapprove of all . From this_the following consequences logically flow : that the judgment of each_one s conscience -isaia- independent of all law ; that the most unrestrained opinions may be openly expressed as to the practice or omission of divine_worship ; and that_every one_has unbounded license to think whatever he chooses and to publish abroad whatever he thinks . Now , when_the State rests on foundations like those just named and for the time being they_are greatly in favor it readily appears into what and how unrightful a position the Church -isaia- driven . For , when_the management of public business -isaia- in harmony_with doctrines of such a kind , the Catholic religion_-isaia- allowed a standing in civil_society equal only , or inferior , to societies alien from it ; no regard -isaia- paid to the laws of the Church , and she_who , by the order and commission of Jesus Christ , has the duty of teaching all nations , finds herself forbidden to take any part in the instruction of the people . With reference to matters that_are of twofold jurisdiction , they_who administer the civil_power lay_down the law -atti_degli_apostoli- their_own will , and in matters that appertain to religion defiantly put aside the most_sacred decrees of the Church . They claim jurisdiction over the marriages of Catholics , even over the bond as well as the unity and the indissolubility of matrimony . They lay hands on the goods of the clergy , contending that the Church cannot possess property . Lastly , they treat the Church with_such arrogance that , rejecting entirely her title to the nature and rights of a perfect society , they hold that_she differs in no respect from other societies in the State , and for this_reason possesses no right nor any legal power of action , save that_which she holds by the concession and favor of the government . If in any State the Church retains her_own agreement publicly entered into by the two powers , men forthwith begin to cry out that matters affecting the Church must be separated_from those of the State . Their object in uttering this cry -isaia- to be able to violate unpunished their plighted faith , and in all things to have unchecked control . And as the Church , unable to abandon her chiefest and most_sacred duties , cannot patiently put up with this , and asks that the pledge given to her be fully and scrupulously acted up to , contentions frequently arise between_the ecclesiastical and the civil_power , of which_the issue commonly -isaia- that the weaker power yields to the one which_-isaia- stronger in human resources . Accordingly , it has become the practice and determination under this condition of public polity now so much admired by many either to forbid the action of the Church altogether , or to keep her in check and bondage to the State . Public enactments are in great measure framed with this design . The drawing up of laws , the administration of State affairs , the godless education of youth , the spoliation and suppression of religious_orders , the overthrow of the temporal power of the Roman Pontiff , all alike aim to this one end to paralyse the action of Christian institutions , to cramp to the utmost the freedom of the Catholic Church , and to curtail her ever single prerogative . Now , natural reason itself proves convincingly that_such concepts of the government of a State are wholly -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the truth . Nature itself bears_witness that all power , of every_kind , has its origin from God , who_-isaia- its chief and most august source . The sovereignty of the people , however , and this without_any reference to God , -isaia- held to reside in the multitude ; which_-isaia- doubtless a doctrine exceedingly well calculated to flatter and to inflame many passions , but_which lacks all reasonable proof , and all power of insuring public safety and preserving order . Indeed , from the prevalence of this_teaching , things have come to such a pass that may hold as an axiom of civil jurisprudence that seditions may be rightfully fostered . For the opinion prevails that princes are nothing_more than delegates chosen to carry_out the will of the people ; whence it necessarily follows_that all things_are as changeable as the will of the people , so that risk of public disturbance -isaia- ever hanging over our heads . To hold , therefore , that_there_-isaia- no difference in matters of religion between forms that_are unlike each_other , and even contrary to each_other , most clearly leads in the end to the rejection of all religion in both theory and practice . And this -isaia-_the_same thing as atheism , however it may differ from it in name . Men who really believe in the existence of God must , in order to be consistent with themselves and to avoid absurd conclusions , understand_that differing modes of divine_worship involving dissimilarity and conflict even on most important points cannot all be equally probable , equally good , and equally acceptable to God . So , too , the liberty of thinking , and of publishing , whatsoever each_one likes , without_any hindrance , -isaia- not in itself an advantage over which society can wisely rejoice . On the contrary , it -isaia- the fountain head and origin of many evils . Liberty -isaia- a power perfecting man , and hence should_have truth and goodness for its object . But the character of goodness and truth cannot be changed -atti_degli_apostoli- option . These remain ever one_and_the_same , and are no less unchangeable than nature itself . If the mind assents to false opinions , and the will chooses and follows after what_-isaia- wrong , neither can attain its native fullness , but both must fall from their native dignity into an abyss of corruption . Whatever , therefore , -isaia- opposed to virtue and truth may_not rightly be brought temptingly before the eye of man , much less sanctioned by the favor and protection of the law . A well spent life -isaia-_the_only way to heaven , whither all are_bound , and on this account_the State -isaia- acting against the laws and dictates of nature whenever it permits the license of opinion and of action to lead minds astray from truth and souls away from the practice of virtue . To exclude the Church , founded by God Himself , from life , from laws , from the education of youth , from domestic society_-isaia- a grave and fatal error . A State from which religion_-isaia- banished can_never be well regulated ; and already perhaps more_than -isaia- desirable -isaia- known of the nature and tendency of the so called civil philosophy of life and morals . The Church of Christ -isaia- the true and sole teacher of virtue and guardian of morals . She it -isaia- who preserves in their purity the principles from which duties flow , and , by setting forth most urgent reasons for virtuous life , bids us not_only to turn away from wicked deeds , but_even to curb all movements of the mind_that are opposed to reason , even_though they be not carried_out in action . To wish the Church to be subject to the civil_power in the exercise of her duty -isaia- a great folly and a sheer injustice . Whenever this_-isaia- the case , order -isaia- disturbed , for things natural are put above things supernatural ; the many benefits which_the Church , if free to act , would confer on society are either prevented or -atti_degli_apostoli- least lessened in number ; and a way -isaia- prepared_for enmities and contentions between_the two powers , with how evil result to both the issue of events has taught us only too frequently . Doctrines such as these , which_cannot be approved by human_reason , and most seriously affect the whole civil order , Our predecessors the Roman Pontiffs well_aware of what their apostolic_office required of them have_never allowed to pass uncondemned . Thus , Gregory XVI in his encyclical_letter Mirari Vos , dated August , , inveighed with weighty words against the sophisms which even -atti_degli_apostoli- his time were being publicly inculcated namely_,_that no preference should be shown for_any particular form of worship ; that_it_-isaia- right for individuals to form their_own personal judgments about religion ; that_each man s conscience -isaia-_his sole and all sufficing guide ; and that_it_-isaia- lawful for_every man to publish his_own views , whatever they_may be , and even to conspire against the State . On the question of the separation of Church and State the same Pontiff writes as follows : '' Nor can We hope_for happier results either for religion or for the civil government from the wishes of those_who desire_that the Church be separated_from the State , and the concord between_the secular and ecclesiastical authority be dissolved . It -isaia- clear_that these_men , who yearn for a shameless liberty , live in dread of an agreement which has_always_been fraught with_good , and advantageous alike to sacred and civil interests . '' To the like effect , also , as occasion presented itself , did Pius IX brand publicly many false opinions which_were gaining ground , and afterwards ordered them to be condensed in summary form in order_that in this sea of error Catholics might have a light_which they_might safely follow . From these pronouncements of the Popes it -isaia- evident_that the origin of public power -isaia- to be sought for in God Himself , and not in the multitude , and that_it_-isaia- repugnant to reason to allow free scope for sedition . Again , that_it_-isaia- not lawful for the State , any more_than for the individual , either to disregard all religious duties or to hold in equal favour different kinds of religion ; that the unrestrained freedom of thinking and of openly making known one s thoughts -isaia- not inherent in the rights of citizens , and -isaia- by no means to be reckoned worthy of favour and support . In like_manner it -isaia- to be understood that the Church no less_than the State itself_-isaia- a society perfect in its_own nature and its_own right , and that_those_who exercise sovereignty ought not so to act as to compel the Church to become subservient or subject to them , or to hamper her liberty in the management of her_own affairs , or to despoil her in any_way of the other privileges conferred upon her by Jesus Christ . In matters , however , of mixed jurisdiction , it -isaia- in the highest degree consonant to nature , as also to the designs of God , that so far from one of the powers separating itself from the other , or still less coming into conflict with it , complete harmony , such as -isaia- suited to the end for which_each power exists , should be preserved between_them . This , then , -isaia- the teaching of the Catholic Church concerning the constitution and government of the State . By the words and decrees just cited , if judged dispassionately , no one of the several forms of government -isaia- in itself condemned , inasmuch as none of them contains anything contrary to Catholic doctrine , and all of them are capable , if wisely and justly managed , to insure the welfare of the State . Neither -isaia- it blameworthy in itself , in any manner , for the people to have a share greater or less , in the government : for -atti_degli_apostoli- certain times , and under certain laws , such participation may not_only be of benefit to the citizens , but may even be of obligation . Nor -isaia- there any reason_why any one_should accuse the Church of being wanting in gentleness of action or largeness of view , or of being opposed to real and lawful liberty . The Church , indeed , deems it unlawful to place the various_forms of divine_worship on the same footing as the true religion , but does_not , on that account , condemn those rulers who , for the sake of securing some great good or of hindering some great evil , allow patiently custom or usage to be a kind of sanction for each kind of religion having its place in the State . And , in fact , the Church -isaia- wont to take earnest heed that_no_one shall be forced to embrace the Catholic faith against his_will , for , as St . Augustine wisely reminds us , '' Man cannot believe otherwise than of his_own will . In the same_way the Church cannot approve of that liberty which begets a contempt of the most_sacred laws of God , and casts off the obedience due to lawful authority , for this_-isaia-_not liberty so much as license , and -isaia- most correctly styled by St . Augustine the '' liberty of self ruin , '' and by the Apostle St . Peter the '' cloak of malice . '' Indeed , since_it_-isaia- opposed to reason , it -isaia- a true slavery , '' for whosoever committeth sin_-isaia- the slave of sin . '' On the other_hand , that liberty -isaia- truly genuine , and to be sought after , which in regard to the individual does not_allow men to be the slaves of error and of passion , the worst of all masters ; which , too , in public administration guides the citizens in wisdom and provides for them increased means of well_being ; and which , further , protects the State from foreign interference . This honourable liberty , alone worthy of human_beings , the Church approves most highly and has_never slackened her endeavour to preserve , strong and unchanged , among nations . And , in truth , whatever in the State -isaia- of chief avail for the common welfare ; whatever has_been usefully established to curb the license of rulers who_are opposed to the true interests of the people , or to keep in check the leading authorities from unwarrantably interfering in municipal or family affairs ; whatever tends to uphold the honour , manhood , and equal rights of individual citizens of all these_things , as the monuments of past ages bear_witness , the Catholic Church has_always_been the originator , the promoter , or the guardian . Ever , therefore , consistent with herself , while on the one_hand she rejects that exorbitant liberty which in individuals and in nations ends in license or in thraldom , on the other_hand , she willingly and most gladly welcomes whatever improvements the age brings forth , if these really secure the prosperity of life here below , which_-isaia- , as it were , a stage in the journey to the life_that will know no ending . Therefore , when_it_-isaia- said_that the Church -isaia- hostile to modern political regimes and that_she repudiates the discoveries of modern research , the charge -isaia- a ridiculous and groundless calumny . Wild opinions she_does repudiate , wicked and seditious projects she_does condemn , together_with that attitude of mind which points to the beginning of a willful departure from God . But , as all truth must necessarily proceed from God , the Church recognizes in all truth that_-isaia- reached by research a trace of the divine intelligence . And as all truth in the natural order -isaia- powerless to destroy belief in the teachings of revelation , but can do much to confirm it , and as every newly discovered truth may serve to further the knowledge or the praise of God , it follows_that whatsoever spreads the range of knowledge will_always be willingly and even joyfully welcomed by the Church . She will_always encourage and promote , as she_does in other branches of knowledge , all study occupied with the investigation of nature . In these pursuits , should the human intellect discover anything not known before , the Church makes no opposition . She never objects to search being made for things_that minister to the refinements and comforts of life . So far , indeed , from opposing these she -isaia-_now , as she ever has_been , hostile alone to indolence and sloth , and earnestly wishes that the talents of men may bear more_and_more abundant fruit by cultivation and exercise . Moreover , she gives encouragement to every_kind of art and handicraft , and through_her influence , directing all strivings after progress toward virtue and salvation , she labours to prevent man s intellect and industry from turning him away from God and from heavenly things . All this , though so reasonable and full of counsel , finds little favour nowadays when States not_only refuse to conform to the rules of Christian wisdom , but seem even anxious to recede from them further and further on each successive day . Nevertheless , since truth when brought to light -isaia- wont , of its_own nature , to spread itself far and wide , and gradually take possession of the minds_of_men , We , moved by the great and holy duty of Our apostolic mission to all nations , speak , as We are_bound to do , with freedom . Our eyes are_not closed to the spirit of the times . We repudiate not the assured and useful improvements of our_age , but devoutly wish affairs of State to take a safer course than they_are now taking , and to rest on a more firm foundation without injury to the true freedom of the people ; for the best parent and guardian of liberty amongst men -isaia- truth . '' The truth shall make you free . If in the difficult times in which Our lot -isaia- cast , Catholics will_give ear to Us , as it behoves them to do , they_will readily see what_are the duties of each_one in matters of opinion as well as action . As regards opinion , whatever the Roman Pontiffs have hitherto taught , or shall hereafter teach , must be held with a firm grasp of mind , and , so often as occasion requires , must be openly professed . Especially with reference to the so called '' liberties '' which_are so greatly coveted in these_days , all must stand by the judgment of the apostolic_see , and have_the same mind . Let no man be deceived by the honest outward appearance of these liberties , but let each_one reflect whence these have_had their origin , and by what efforts they_are everywhere upheld and promoted . Experience has made Us well acquainted with_their results to the State , since everywhere they_have borne fruits which_the good and wise bitterly deplore . If there really exist anywhere , or if we in imagination conceive , a State , waging wanton and tyrannical war against Christianity , and if we compare with it the modern form of government just described , this latter may seem the more endurable of the two . Yet , undoubtedly , the principles on which such a government -isaia- grounded are , as We have_said , of a nature which no one_can approve . Secondly , action may relate to private and domestic matters , or to matters public . As to private affairs , the first duty -isaia- to conform life and conduct to the gospel precepts , and to refuse to shrink from this_duty when Christian virtue demands some sacrifice slightly more difficult to make . All , moreover , are_bound to love the Church as their common mother , to obey her laws , promote her honour , defend her rights , and to endeavour to make her respected and loved by those over whom they_have authority . It -isaia-_also of great moment to the public welfare to take a prudent part in the business of municipal administration , and to endeavour above all to introduce effectual measures , so that , as becomes a Christian people , public provision may be made for the instruction of youth in religion and true morality . Upon these_things the well_being of every State greatly depends . Furthermore , it -isaia- in general fitting and salutary that Catholics should extend their_efforts beyond this restricted sphere , and give their attention to national politics . We say '' in general '' because these Our precepts are addressed to all nations . However , it may in some places be true_that , for most urgent and just reasons , it -isaia- by no means expedient for Catholics to engage in public affairs or to take an active part in politics . Nevertheless , as We have laid_down , to take no share in public matters would be as wrong as to have no concern_for , or to bestow no labour upon , the common_good , and the more so because Catholics are admonished , by the very doctrines which_they profess , to be upright and faithful in the discharge of duty , while , if they hold aloof , men whose principles offer but small guarantee for the welfare of the State will the more readily seize the reins of government . This would tend also to the injury of the Christian religion , forasmuch as those would come into power who_are badly disposed toward_the Church , and those_who_are willing to befriend her would be deprived of all influence . It follows clearly , therefore_,_that Catholics have just reasons for taking part in the conduct of public affairs . For in so doing they assume not nor_should they assume the responsibility of approving what_-isaia- blameworthy in the actual methods of government , but seek to turn these very methods , so far as -isaia- possible , to the genuine and true public good , and to use their best endeavours -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to infuse , as it were , into all the veins of the State the healthy -sapienza- and blood of Christian wisdom and virtue . The morals and ambitions of the heathens differed widely from those of the Gospel , yet Christians were to be seen living undefiled everywhere in the midst of pagan superstition , and , while always true to themselves , coming to the front boldly wherever an opening was presented . Models of loyalty to their rulers , submissive , so far as was permitted , to the sovereign power , they shed around them on every side a halo of sanctity ; they strove to be helpful to their brethren , and to attract others to the wisdom of Jesus Christ , yet were bravely ready to withdraw from public_life , nay , even to lay_down their_life , if they could not_without loss of virtue retain honours , dignities , and offices . For this_reason , Christian ways and manners speedily found their_way not_only into private houses but into the camp , the senate , and even into the imperial palaces . '' We are but of yesterday , '' wrote Tertullian , '' yet we swarm in all your institutions , we crowd your cities , islands , villages , towns , assemblies , the army itself , your wards and corporations , the palace , the senate , and the law courts . '' So that the Christian faith , when once it became lawful to make public profession of the Gospel , appeared in most of the cities of Europe , not like an infant crying in its cradle , but already grown up and full of vigour . In these Our days it -isaia- well to revive these examples of Our forefathers . First and foremost , it -isaia-_the_duty of all Catholics worthy of the name and wishful to be known as most loving children of the Church , to reject without swerving whatever_-isaia- inconsistent with so fair a title ; to make_use of popular institutions , so far as can honestly be done , for the advancement of truth and righteousness ; to strive that liberty of action shall_not transgress the bounds marked out by nature and the law of God ; to endeavour to bring back all civil_society to the pattern and form of Christianity which We have described . It -isaia- barely possible to lay_down any fixed method by which such purposes are to be attained , because the means adopted must suit places and times widely differing from one_another . Nevertheless , above all things , unity of aim must be preserved , and similarity must be sought after in all plans of action . Both these objects will be carried into_effect without fail if all will follow_the guidance of the apostolic_see as their rule of life and obey the bishops whom_the Holy Spirit has placed to rule_the Church of God . The defense of Catholicism , indeed , necessarily demands_that in the profession of doctrines taught by the Church all shall be of one mind and all steadfast in believing ; and care must_be_taken never to connive , in any_way , -atti_degli_apostoli- false opinions , never to withstand them less strenuously than truth allows . In mere matters of opinion it -isaia- permissible to discuss things with moderation , with a desire of searching into the truth , without unjust suspicion or angry recriminations . Hence , lest concord be broken by rash charges , let this be understood by all , that the integrity of Catholic faith cannot be reconciled with opinions verging on naturalism or rationalism , the essence of which_-isaia- utterly to do away with Christian institutions and to install in society the supremacy of man to the exclusion of God . Further , it -isaia- unlawful to follow one line of conduct in private life and another in public , respecting privately the authority of the Church , but publicly rejecting it ; for this_would amount to joining together good_and_evil , and to putting man in conflict with himself ; whereas he ought always to be consistent , and never in the least point nor in any condition of life to swerve from Christian virtue . But in matters merely political , as , for instance , the best form of government , and this or that system of administration , a difference of opinion -isaia- lawful . Those , therefore , whose piety -isaia- in other respects known , and whose minds are ready to accept in all obedience the decrees of the apostolic_see , cannot in justice be accounted as bad men because_they disagree as to subjects We have mentioned ; and still graver wrong will be done them , if as We have more_than_once perceived with regret they_are accused of violating , or of wavering in , the Catholic faith . Let this be well borne in mind by all who_are in the habit of publishing their opinions , and above all by journalists . In the endeavour to secure interests of the highest order there_-isaia- no room_for intestine strife or party rivalries ; since all should aim with one mind and purpose to make safe that_which_-isaia- the common object of all the maintenance of religion and of the State . If , therefore , they_have hitherto been dissensions , let_them henceforth be gladly buried in oblivion . If rash or injurious acts have_been committed , whoever may have_been -atti_degli_apostoli- fault , let mutual charity make amends , and let_the past be redeemed by a special submission of all to the apostolic_see . In this_way Catholics will attain two most excellent results : they will_become helpers to the Church in preserving and propagating Christian wisdom , and they_will confer the greatest benefit on civil_society , the safety of which_-isaia- exceedingly imperiled by evil teachings and bad passions . This , venerable_brethren , -isaia- what We have thought it Our duty to expound to all nations of the Catholic world touching the Christian constitution of States and the duties of individual citizens . It behoves Us now with earnest prayer to implore the protection of heaven , beseeching God , who alone_can enlighten the minds_of_men and move their will , to bring_about those happy ends for_which We yearn and strive , for His greater glory and the general salvation of mankind . As a happy augury of the divine benefits , and in token of Our paternal benevolence , to you_,_venerable_brothers , and to the clergy and to the whole_people committed to your charge and vigilance , We grant lovingly in the Lord the apostolic_benediction .

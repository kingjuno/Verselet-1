Venerable Brethren , Health , and Benediction . It -isaia- sufficiently well_known unto you that no small share of Our thoughts and of Our care -isaia- devoted to Our endeavour to bring back to the fold , placed under the guardianship of Jesus Christ , the Chief Pastor of souls , sheep that_have strayed . Bent upon this , We have thought it most conducive to this salutary end and purpose to describe the exemplar and , as it were , the lineaments of the Church . Amongst these the most worthy of Our chief consideration -isaia- Unity . This the Divine Author impressed on it as a lasting sign of truth and of unconquerable strength . The essential beauty and comeliness of the Church ought greatly to influence the minds of those_who consider it . Nor -isaia- it improbable that ignorance may be dispelled by the consideration ; that false ideas and prejudices may be dissipated from the minds chiefly of those_who find_themselves in error without fault of theirs ; and that_even a love for the Church may be stirred up in the souls of men , like unto that charity wherewith Christ loved and united himself to that spouse redeemed by His precious blood . '' Christ loved the Church , and delivered Himself up for it '' Eph . If those about to come back to their most loving Mother not_yet fully known , or culpably abandoned should perceive that_their return involves , not indeed the shedding of their blood -atti_degli_apostoli- which price nevertheless the Church was bought by Jesus Christ , but some lesser trouble and labour , let_them clearly understand_that this burden has_been laid on them_not by the will of man but by the will and command of God . They may thus , by the help of heavenly grace , realize and feel the truth of the divine saying , '' My yoke -isaia- sweet and my burden light '' Matt . Wherefore , having put all Our hope in the '' Father of lights , '' from whom '' cometh every best gift and every perfect gift '' Ep . , from Him , namely , who alone '' gives the increase '' I Cor . , We earnestly pray that He will graciously grant Us the power of bringing conviction home to the minds_of_men . Although God can do by His own power all that_-isaia- effected by created natures , nevertheless in the counsels of His loving Providence He has preferred to help men by the instrumentality of men . And , as in the natural order He does_not usually give full perfection except by means of man s work and action , so also He makes use of human aid for that_which lies beyond_the limits of nature , that_-isaia- to say , for the sanctification and salvation_of_souls . But it -isaia- obvious that_nothing can be communicated amongst men save by means of external things_which the senses can perceive . For this_reason_the Son of God assumed human_nature '' who being in the form of God . emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of man '' Philipp . , , and thus living on earth He taught his doctrine and gave His laws , conversing with men . The Church Always Visible . And , since it was necessary_that His divine mission should be perpetuated to the end of rime , He took to Himself Disciples , trained by himself , and made them partakers of His own authority . And , when He had invoked upon them_from Heaven the Spirit of Truth , He bade them go through the whole_world and faithfully preach to all nations , what He had taught and what He had commanded , so that by the profession of His doctrine , and the observance of His laws , the human_race might attain to holiness on earth and never ending happiness in Heaven . In this wise , and on this principle , the Church was begotten . If we consider_the chief end of His Church and the proximate efficient causes of salvation , it -isaia- undoubtedly spiritual ; but in regard to those_who constitute it , and to the things_which lead to these spiritual gifts , it -isaia- external and necessarily visible . The Apostles received a mission to teach by visible and audible signs , and they discharged their_mission only by words and acts which certainly appealed to the senses . So that_their voices falling upon the ears of those_who heard them begot faith in souls '' Faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the words of Christ '' Rom . And faith itself that_-isaia- assent given to the first and supreme truth though residing essentially in the intellect , must be manifested by outward profession '' For with the heart we believe unto justice , but_with the mouth confession -isaia- made unto salvation '' Rom . In the same_way in man , nothing_-isaia- more internal than heavenly grace_which begets sanctity , but the ordinary and chief means of obtaining grace are external : that_-isaia- to say , the sacraments which_are administered by men specially chosen for that purpose , by means of certain ordinances . Jesus Christ commanded His Apostles and their successors to the end of time to teach and rule_the nations . He ordered the nations to accept their teaching and obey their authority . But his correlation of rights_and_duties in the Christian commonwealth not_only could_not have been_made permanent , but could_not even have_been initiated except through the senses , which_are of all things the messengers and interpreters . For this_reason_the Church -isaia- so often called in Holy Writ a body , and even the body of Christ '' Now you_are the body of Christ '' I Cor . , and precisely because_it_-isaia- a body -isaia- the Church visible : and because_it_-isaia- the body of Christ -isaia- it living and energizing , because by the infusion of His power Christ guards and sustains it , just as the vine gives nourishment and renders fruitful the branches united to it . And as in animals the vital principle -isaia- unseen and invisible , and -isaia- evidenced and manifested by the movements and action of the members , so the principle of supernatural life in the Church -isaia- clearly shown in that_which_-isaia- done by it . From this it follows that_those_who arbitrarily conjure up and picture to themselves a hidden and invisible Church are in grievous and pernicious error : as also are_those_who regard the Church as a human institution which claims a certain obedience in discipline and external duties , but which_-isaia- without_the perennial communication of the gifts of divine_grace , and without all that_which testifies by constant and undoubted signs to the existence of that life which_-isaia- drawn_from God . It -isaia- assuredly as impossible that the Church of Jesus Christ can be the one or the other , as that_man should be a body alone or a soul alone . The connection and union of both elements -isaia- as absolutely necessary to the true Church as the intimate_union of the soul and body -isaia- to human_nature . The Church -isaia- not something dead : it -isaia- the body of Christ endowed_with supernatural life . As Christ , the Head and Exemplar , -isaia- not wholly in His visible human_nature , which Photinians and Nestorians assert , nor wholly in the invisible divine nature , as the Monophysites hold , but_-isaia- one , from and in both natures , visible and invisible ; so the mystical_body of Christ -isaia- the true Church , only_because its visible parts draw life and power from the supernatural gifts and other_things whence spring their_very nature and essence . But since_the Church -isaia- such by divine will and constitution , such it must uniformly remain to the end of time . If it did nor , then it would_not have_been founded as perpetual , and the end set before it would_have been limited to some certain place and to some certain period of time ; both of which_are contrary to the truth . The union consequently of visible and invisible elements because it harmonizes with the natural order and by God s will belongs to the very essence of the Church , must necessarily remain so long as the Church itself shall endure . Wherefore Chrysostom writes : '' Secede not from the Church : for nothing_-isaia- stronger than the Church . Thy hope -isaia- the Church ; thy salvation -isaia- the Church ; thy refuge -isaia- the Church . It -isaia- higher than the heavens and wider than the earth . It never grows old , but_-isaia- ever full of vigour . Wherefore Holy Writ pointing to its strength and stability calls it a mountain '' Hom . Also Augustine says : '' Unbelievers think_that the Christian religion will last for a certain period in the world and will then disappear . But it will remain as long as the sun as long as the sun rises and sets : that_-isaia- , as long as the ages of time shall roll , the Church of God the true body of Christ on earth will_not disappear '' In Psalm . And in another place : '' The Church will totter if its foundation shakes ; but how_can Christ be moved ? . Christ remaining immovable , it the Church , shall never be shaken . Where are they that say that the Church has disappeared from the world , when it cannot even be shaken ? '' Enarratio in Psalm . He who seeks the truth must be guided by these fundamental principles . That -isaia- to say , that Christ the Lord instituted and formed the Church : wherefore when we are asked what its nature_-isaia- , the main thing -isaia- to see what Christ wished and what in fact He did . Judged by such a criterion it -isaia- the unity of the Church which_must be principally considered ; and of this , for the general good , it has seemed useful to speak in this Encyclical . , How Christ Made His Church . It -isaia- so evident from the clear and frequent testimonies of Holy Writ that the true Church of Jesus Christ -isaia- one , that no Christian can dare to deny it . But in judging and determining the nature of this_unity many have erred in various_ways . Not the foundation of the Church alone , but its whole constitution , belongs to the class of things effected by Christ s free choice . For this_reason_the entire case must be judged by what_was actually done . We must consequently investigate not how the Church may possibly be one , but how He , who founded it , willed that it should be one . But when we consider what_was actually done we find that Jesus Christ did_not , in point of fact , institute a Church to embrace several communities similar in nature , but in themselves distinct , and lacking those bonds which render the Church unique and indivisible after that manner in which in the symbol of our_faith we profess : '' I believe in one Church . '' '' The Church in respect of its unity belongs to the category of things indivisible by nature , though heretics try to divide it into many_parts . We say , therefore_,_that the Catholic Church -isaia- unique in its essence , in its doctrine , in its origin , and in its excellence . Furthermore , the eminence of the Church arises from its unity , as the principle of its constitution a unity surpassing all else , and having nothing like unto it or equal to it '' S . Clemens Alexandrinus , Stronmatum lib . For this_reason Christ , speaking of the mystical edifice , mentions only_one Church , which he calls His own '' I will build my church ; '' any_other Church except this one , since it has not_been founded by Christ , cannot be the true Church . This becomes even_more evident when_the purpose of the Divine Founder -isaia- considered . For what did Christ , the Lord , ask ? What did He wish in regard to the Church founded , or about to be founded ? This : to transmit to it the same mission and the same mandate which He had received_from_the Father , that_they_should be perpetuated . This He clearly resolved to do : this He actually did . '' As the Father bath sent me , I also send you '' John xx . '' Ad thou bast sent Me into_the_world I also have sent them into_the_world '' John xvii . But the mission of Christ -isaia- to save that_which had perished : that_-isaia- to say , not some nations or peoples , but the whole_human_race , without distinction of time or place . '' The Son of Man came that_the_world might be saved by Him '' John iii . '' For there_-isaia- no other name under Heaven given to men whereby we must be saved '' Acts iv . The Church , therefore , -isaia- bound to communicate without stint to all men , and to transmit through all ages , the salvation effected by Jesus Christ , and the blessings flowing there from . Wherefore , by the will of its Founder , it -isaia- necessary_that this Church should be one in all lands and -atti_degli_apostoli- all times . to justify the existence of more_than one Church it would be necessary to go outside this_world , and to create a new and unheard of race of men . That the one Church should embrace all men everywhere and -atti_degli_apostoli- all times was seen and foretold by Isaiah , when looking into the future he saw the appearance of a mountain conspicuous by its all surpassing altitude , which set_forth the image of '' The House of the Lord '' that_-isaia- , of the Church , '' And in the last days the mountain of the House of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of the mountains '' Isa . But this mountain which towers over all other mountains -isaia- one ; and the House of the Lord to which all nations shall come to seek the rule of living -isaia-_also one . '' And all nations shall flow into it . And many_people shall go , and say : Come , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , and to the House of the God of Jacob , and He will teach us His ways , and we will walk in His paths '' Ibid . Explaining this passage , Optatus of Milevis says : '' It -isaia- written in the prophet Isaiah : from Sion the law shall go forth and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem . For it -isaia- not on Mount Sion that Isaiah sees the valley , but on the holy mountain , that_-isaia- , the Church , which_has raised itself conspicuously throughout_the entire Roman world under the whole heavens . The Church -isaia- , therefore , the spiritual Sion in which Christ has_been constituted King by God the Father , and which exists throughout_the entire earth , on which there_-isaia- but_one Catholic Church '' De Schism . And Augustine says : '' What can be so manifest as a mountain , or so well_known ? There are , it -isaia- true , mountains which_are unknown because_they_are situated in some remote part of the earth . But this mountain -isaia- not unknown ; for it has filled the whole face of the world , and about_this it -isaia- said that_it_-isaia- prepared on the summit of the mountains '' In Ep . Christ the Head of the Church . Furthermore , the Son of God decreed that the Church should be His mystical_body , with_which He should be united as the Head , after_the manner of the human body which He assumed , to which_the natural head -isaia- physiologically united . As He took to Himself a mortal body , which He gave to suffering and death in order to pay the price of man s redemption , so also He has one mystical_body in which and through_which He renders men partakers of holiness and of eternal_salvation . God '' hath made Him Christ head over all the Church , which_-isaia- His body '' Eph . Scattered and separated members cannot possibly cohere with the head so as to make one_body . Paul says : '' All members of the body , whereas they are_many , yet are one_body , so also -isaia- Christ '' I Cor . Wherefore this mystical_body , he declares , -isaia- '' compacted and fitly jointed together . The head , Christ : from whom_the whole_body , being compacted and fitly jointed together , by what every joint supplieth according to the operation in the measure of every_part '' Eph . And so dispersed members , separated one from the other , cannot be united with one_and_the_same head . '' There -isaia- one God , and one Christ ; and His Church -isaia- one and the faith_-isaia- one ; and one the people , joined together in the solid unity of the body in the bond of concord . This unity cannot be broken , nor the one_body divided by the separation of its constituent parts '' S . And to set_forth more_clearly the unity of the Church , he makes use of the illustration of a living body , the members of which_cannot possibly live unless united to the head and drawing from it their vital force . Separated from the head they_must of necessity die . '' The Church , '' he says , '' cannot be divided into parts by the separation and cutting asunder of its_members . What -isaia- cut away from the mother cannot live or breathe apart '' Ibid . What similarity -isaia- there between a dead and a living body ? '' For no man ever hated his_own flesh , but nourisheth and cherisheth it , as also Christ doth the Church : because we are members of His body , of His flesh , and of His bones '' Eph . Another head like to Christ must be invented that_-isaia- , another Christ if besides the one Church , which_-isaia- His body , men wish to set up another . '' See what_you must beware of see what_you must avoid see what_you must dread . It happens_that , as in the human body , some member may be cut off a hand , a finger , a foot . Does the soul follow_the amputated member ? As long as it was in the body , it lived ; separated , it forfeits its life . So the Christian -isaia- a Catholic as long as he lives in the body : cut off from it he becomes a heretic the life of the spirit follows not the amputated member '' S . Augustinus , Sermo cclxvii . The Church of Christ , therefore , -isaia- one_and_the_same for ever ; those_who leave it depart from the will and command of Christ , the Lord leaving the path of salvation they enter on that of perdition . '' Whosoever -isaia- separated_from the Church -isaia- united to an adulteress . He has cut himself off from the promises of the Church , and he who leaves the Church of Christ cannot arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the rewards of Christ . He who observes not this_unity observes not the law of God , holds not the faith of the Father and the Son , clings not to life and salvation '' S . But He , indeed , Who made this one Church , also gave it unity , that_-isaia- , He made it such that all who_are to belong to it must be united by the closest bonds , so as to form one society , one kingdom , one_body '' one_body and one spirit as you are_called in one hope of your calling Eph . Jesus Christ , when His death was nigh -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , declared His will in this_matter , and solemnly offered it up , thus addressing His Father : '' Not for them only do I pray , but_for them also who through_their word shall believe in Me . that_they also may be one in Us . that_they_may be made perfect in one '' John xvii . Yea , He commanded that this_unity should be so closely knit and so perfect amongst His followers that it might , in some measure , shadow forth the union between Himself and His Father : '' I pray that_they all may be one as Thou Father in Me and I in Thee '' Ibid . Agreement and union of minds -isaia- the necessary foundation of this perfect concord amongst men , from which concurrence of wills and similarity of action are the natural results . Wherefore , in His divine wisdom , He ordained in His Church Unity of Faith ; a virtue which -isaia-_the_first of those bonds which unite man to God , and whence we receive the name of the faithful '' one Lord , one faith , one baptism '' Eph . That -isaia- , as there_-isaia-_one Lord and one baptism , so should all Christians , without exception , have but_one faith . And so the Apostle St . Paul not merely begs , but entreats and implores Christians to be all of the same mind , and to avoid difference of opinions : '' I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that_you all speak the same thing , and that_there be no schisms amongst you , and that_you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment '' I Cor . Such passages certainly need no interpreter ; they speak clearly enough for themselves . Besides , all who profess Christianity allow that_there can be but_one faith . It -isaia- of the greatest importance and indeed of absolute necessity , as to which many are deceived , that the nature and character of this_unity should be recognized . And , as We have_already stated , this_-isaia-_not to be ascertained by conjecture , but by the certain knowledge of what_was done ; that_-isaia- by seeking for and ascertaining what kind of unity in faith_has been commanded by Jesus Christ . The Kind of Unity in Faith Commanded by Christ . The heavenly doctrine of Christ , although for the most part committed to writing by divine inspiration , could_not unite the minds_of_men if left to the human intellect alone . It would , for this_very reason , be subject to various and contradictory interpretations . This -isaia- so , not only_because of the nature of the doctrine itself and of the mysteries it involves , but also_because of the divergencies of the human mind and of the disturbing element of conflicting passions . From a variety of interpretations a variety of beliefs -isaia- necessarily begotten ; hence come controversies , dissensions and wranglings such as have arisen in the past , even in the first ages of the Church . Irenaeus writes of heretics as follows : '' Admitting the sacred Scriptures they distort the interpretations '' Lib . And Augustine : '' Heresies have arisen , and certain perverse views ensnaring souls and precipitating them_into the abyss only_when the Scriptures , good in themselves , are_not properly understood '' In Evang . Besides Holy Writ it was absolutely necessary to insure this union of men s minds to effect and preserve unity of ideas that there_should be another principle . This the wisdom of God requires : for He could_not have willed that the faith should be one if He did_not provide means sufficient for the preservation of this_unity ; and this Holy Writ clearly sets forth as We shall presently point_out . Assuredly the infinite power of God -isaia- not bound by anything , all things obey it as so many passive instruments . In regard to this external principle , therefore , we must inquire which one of all the means in His power Christ did actually adopt . For this_purpose it -isaia- necessary to recall in thought the institution of Christianity . The Magisterium or Teaching Authority of the Church to be Perpetual . We are mindful only of what_-isaia- witnessed to by Holy Writ and what_-isaia- otherwise well_known . Christ proves His own divinity and the divine origin of His mission by miracles ; He teaches the multitudes heavenly doctrine by word of mouth ; and He absolutely commands that the assent of faith should be given to His teaching , promising eternal rewards to those who_believe and eternal punishment to those who_do_not . '' If I do not the works of my Father , believe Me not '' John x . '' If I had not done among_them the works than no other man had done , they_would not_have sin '' Ibid . '' But if I do the works though you will_not believe Me , believe the works '' Ibid . Whatsoever He commands , He commands by the same authority . He requires the assent of the mind to all truths without exception . It was thus_the duty of all who heard Jesus Christ , if they wished for eternal_salvation , not merely to accept His doctrine as a whole , but to assent with_their entire mind to all and every point of it , since_it_-isaia- unlawful to withhold faith from God even in regard to one single point . When about to ascend into_heaven He sends His Apostles in virtue of the same power by which He had_been sent from the Father ; and he charges them to spread abroad and propagate His teaching . '' All power -isaia- given to Me in Heaven and in earth . Going therefore teach all nations . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you '' Matt . So that_those obeying the Apostles might be saved , and those disobeying should perish . '' He that believeth and -isaia- baptized shall be saved , but he that believed not shall be condemned '' Mark xvi . But since_it_-isaia- obviously most in harmony_with God s providence that_no_one should_have confided to him a great and important mission unless he were furnished with the means of properly carrying it out , for this_reason Christ promised that He would send the Spirit of Truth to His Disciples to remain with_them for ever . '' But if I go I will send Him the Paraclete to you . But when He , the Spirit of Truth -isaia- come , He will teach you all truth '' John xvi . '' And I will ask the Father , and He shall give_you another Paraclete , that_he_may abide with you for ever , the Spirit of Truth '' Ibid . '' He shall give testimony of Me , and you shall give testimony '' Ibid . Hence He commands that the teaching of the Apostles should be religiously accepted and piously kept as if it were His own '' He who hears you hears Me , he who despises you despises Me '' Luke x . Wherefore the Apostles are ambassadors of Christ as He -isaia- the ambassador of the Father . '' As the Father sent Me so also I send you '' John xx . Hence as the Apostles and Disciples were bound to obey Christ , so also those_whom the Apostles taught were , by God s command , bound to obey them . And , therefore , it was no more allowable to repudiate one iota of the Apostles teaching than it was to reject any point of the doctrine of Christ Himself . Truly the voice of the Apostles , when_the Holy Ghost had come down upon them , resounded throughout_the_world . Wherever they went they proclaimed themselves the ambassadors of Christ Himself . '' By whom Jesus Christ we have_received grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith in all nations for His name '' Rom . And God makes known their divine mission by numerous miracles . '' But they going forth preached everywhere : the Lord working withal , and confirming the word with signs that followed '' Mark xvi . But what_-isaia- this word ? That which comprehends all things , that_which they_had learnt from their Master ; because_they openly and publicly declare that they_cannot help speaking of what_they had seen and heard . But , as we have_already said , the Apostolic mission was_not destined to die with the Apostles themselves , or to come to an end in the course of time , since it was intended for the people -atti_degli_apostoli- large and instituted for the salvation of the human_race . For Christ commanded His Apostles to preach the '' Gospel to every_creature , to carry His name to nations and kings , and to be witnesses to him to the ends of the earth . '' He further promised to assist them in the fulfilment of their high mission , and that , not_for a few years or centuries only , but_for all time '' even to the consummation of the world . Jerome says : '' He who promises to remain with His Disciples to the end of the world declares that_they_will be for ever victorious , and that He will_never depart from those who_believe in Him '' In Matt . But how could all this be realized in the Apostles alone , placed as they_were under the universal law of dissolution by death ? It was consequently provided by God that the Magisterium instituted by Jesus Christ should_not end with the life of the Apostles , but_that it should be perpetuated . We see it in truth propagated , and , as it were , delivered from hand to hand . For the Apostles consecrated bishops , and each_one appointed those_who were to succeed them immediately '' in the ministry of the word . '' Nay more : they likewise required their successors to choose fitting men , to endow them_with like authority , and to confide to them the office and mission of teaching . '' Thou , therefore , my son , be strong in the grace which_-isaia- in Christ Jesus : and the things_which thou bast heard of me by many witnesses , the same command to faithful men , who shall be fit to teach others also '' Tim . Wherefore , as Christ was sent by God and the Apostles by Christ , so the Bishops and those_who succeeded them were sent by the Apostles . '' The Apostles were appointed by Christ to preach the Gospel to us . Jesus Christ was sent by God . Christ -isaia- therefore from God , and the Apostles from Christ , and both according to the will of God . Preaching therefore the word through the countries and cities , when_they had proved in the Spirit the first fruits of their teaching they appointed bishops and deacons for the faithful . They appointed them and then ordained them , so that_when they_themselves had passed away other tried men should carry on their_ministry '' S . On the one_hand , therefore , it -isaia- necessary_that the mission of teaching whatever Christ had taught should remain perpetual and immutable , and on the other that the duty of accepting and professing all their doctrine should likewise be perpetual and immutable . '' Our Lord Jesus Christ , when in His Gospel He testifies that_those_who not are with Him are His enemies , does_not designate any special form of heresy , but declares that all heretics who_are_not with Him and do not gather with Him , scatter His flock and are His adversaries : He that_-isaia-_not with Me -isaia- against Me , and he that gathereth not_with Me scattereth '' S . Every Revealed Truth , without Exception , Must be Accepted . The Church , founded on these_principles and mindful of her office , has done nothing with_greater zeal and endeavour than she_has displayed in guarding the integrity of the faith . Hence she regarded as rebels and expelled from the ranks of her_children all who held beliefs on any point of doctrine different from her_own . The Arians , the Montanists , the Novatians , the Quartodecimans , the Eutychians , did_not certainly reject all Catholic doctrine : they abandoned only a tertian portion of it . Still who_does_not know_that they_were declared heretics and banished from the bosom of the Church ? In like_manner were condemned all authors of heretical tenets who followed them in subsequent ages . '' There can be nothing_more dangerous than those heretics who admit nearly the whole cycle of doctrine , and yet by one word , as with a drop of poison , infect the real and simple faith taught by our Lord and handed_down by Apostolic tradition '' Auctor Tract . de Fide Orthodoxa contra Arianos . The practice of the Church has_always_been the same , as -isaia- shown by the unanimous teaching of the Fathers , who_were wont to hold as outside Catholic communion , and alien to the Church , whoever would recede in the least degree from any point of doctrine proposed by her authoritative Magisterium . Epiphanius , Augustine , Theodoret , drew up a long list of the heresies of their times . Augustine notes that other heresies may spring up , to a single one of which , should any_one give his assent , he -isaia- by the very_fact cut off from Catholic unity . '' No one_who merely disbelieves in all these heresies can for that_reason regard himself as a Catholic or call himself one . For there_may be or may arise some other heresies , which_are not set_out in this_work of ours , and , if any_one holds to one single one of these he -isaia- not a Catholic '' S . The need of this divinely instituted means_for the preservation of unity , about which we speak -isaia- urged by St . Paul in his epistle to the Ephesians . In this he first admonishes them to preserve with every care concord of minds : '' Solicitous to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace '' Eph . And as souls cannot be perfectly united in charity unless minds agree in faith , he wishes all to hold the same faith : '' One Lord , one faith , '' and this so perfectly one as to prevent all danger of error : '' that henceforth we be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men , by cunning craftiness , by which_they lie in wait to deceive '' Eph . , : and this he teaches -isaia- to be observed , not_for a time only '' but until we all meet in the unity of faith . unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ '' . But , in what_has Christ placed the primary principle , and the means of preserving this_unity ? In that '' He gave some Apostles and other some pastors and doctors , for the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ '' . Wherefore , from the very earliest times the fathers and doctors of the Church have_been accustomed to follow and , with one accord to defend this rule . Origen writes : '' As often as the heretics allege the possession of the canonical scriptures , to which all Christians give unanimous assent , they seem to say : Behold the word of truth_-isaia- in the houses . But we should believe them_not and abandon not the primary and ecclesiastical tradition . We should believe not otherwise than has_been handed_down by the tradition of the Church of God '' Vetus Interpretatio Commentariorum in Matt . Irenaeus too says : '' The doctrine of the Apostles -isaia- the true faith . which_-isaia- known to us through the Episcopal succession . which_has reached even unto our_age by the very fact_that the Scriptures have_been zealously guarded and fully interpreted '' Contra Haereses , lib . And Tertullian : '' It -isaia- therefore clear_that all doctrine which agrees with_that of the Apostolic churches the matrices and original centres of the faith , must be looked upon as the truth , holding without hesitation that the Church received it from the Apostles , the Apostles from Christ and Christ from God . We are in communion with the Apostolic churches , and by the very fact_that they agree amongst themselves we have a testimony of the truth '' De Praescrip . And so Hilary : '' Christ teaching from the ship signifies that_those_who are outside the Church can_never grasp the divine teaching ; for the ship typifies the Church where_the word of life_-isaia- deposited and preached . Those who_are outside are like sterile and worthless sand : they_cannot comprehend '' Comment . Rufinus praises Gregory of Nazianzum and Basil because '' they studied the text of Holy Scripture alone , and took the interpretation of its meaning not from their_own inner consciousness , but_from the writings and on the authority of the ancients , who in their turn , as it -isaia- clear , took their rule for understanding the meaning from the Apostolic succession '' Hist . Wherefore , as appears from what_has_been said , Christ instituted in the Church a living , authoritative and permanent Magisterium , which by His own power He strengthened , by the Spirit of truth He taught , and by miracles confirmed . He willed and ordered , under the gravest penalties , that_its teachings should be received as if they_were His own . As often , therefore , as it -isaia- declared on the authority of this_teaching that_this or that_-isaia- contained in the deposit of divine_revelation , it must be believed by every_one as true . If it could in any_way be false , an evident contradiction follows ; for then God Himself would be the author of error in man . '' Lord , if we be in error , we are_being deceived by Thee '' Richardus de S . In this wise , all cause for doubting being removed , can it be lawful for anyone to reject any_one of those truths without by the very_fact falling into heresy ? without separating himself from the Church ? without repudiating in one sweeping act the whole of Christian teaching ? For such_-isaia- the nature of faith that_nothing can be more absurd than to accept some things and reject others . Faith , as the Church teaches , -isaia- '' that supernatural virtue by which , through the help of God and through the assistance of His grace , we believe what he has revealed to be true , not on account of the intrinsic truth perceived by the natural light of reason , but because of the authority of God Himself , the Revealer , who_can neither deceive nor be deceived '' Conc . If then it be certain_that anything -isaia-_revealed by God , and this_-isaia-_not believed , then nothing whatever_-isaia- believed by divine Faith : for_what the Apostle St . James judges to be the effect of a moral deliquency , the same -isaia- to be said of an erroneous opinion in the matter of faith . '' Whosoever shall offend in one point , -isaia- become guilty of all '' Ep . Nay , it applies with_greater force to an erroneous opinion . For it can_be_said with less truth that_every law_-isaia- violated by one_who commits a single sin , since it may be that he only virtually despises the majesty of God the Legislator . But he who dissents even in one point from divinely revealed_truth absolutely rejects all faith , since he thereby refuses to honour God as the supreme truth and the formal motive of faith . '' In many things they_are with me , in a few things not_with me ; but in those few things in which_they_are not_with me the many things in which_they_are will_not profit them '' S . And this indeed most deservedly ; for they , who take from Christian doctrine what_they please , lean on their_own judgments , not on faith ; and not '' bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ '' Cor . , , they more truly obey themselves than God . '' You , who_believe what_you like , believe yourselves rather_than the gospel '' S . , Contra Faustum Manichaeum , cap . For this_reason_the Fathers of the Vatican Council laid_down nothing new , but followed divine_revelation and the acknowledged and invariable teaching of the Church as to the very nature of faith , when_they decreed as follows : '' All those_things are to be believed by divine and Catholic faith_which are contained in the written or unwritten word of God , and which_are proposed by the Church as divinely revealed , either by a solemn definition or in the exercise of its ordinary and universal Magisterium '' Sess . Hence , as it -isaia- clear_that God absolutely willed that there_should be unity in His Church , and as it -isaia- evident what kind of unity He willed , and by means of what principle He ordained that this_unity should be maintained , we may address the following words of St . Augustine to all who have_not deliberately closed their_minds to the truth : '' When we see the great help of God , such manifest progress and such abundant fruit , shall we hesitate to take refuge in the bosom of that Church , which , as -isaia- evident to all , possesses the supreme_authority of the Apostolic See through the Episcopal succession ? In vain do heretics rage round it ; they_are condemned partly by the judgment of the people themselves , partly by the weight of councils , partly by the splendid evidence of miracles . To refuse to the Church the primacy -isaia- most impious and above measure arrogant . And if all learning , no matter how easy and common it may be , in order to be fully understood requires a teacher and master , what can be greater evidence of pride and rashness than to be unwilling to learn about the books of the divine mysteries from the proper interpreter , and to wish to condemn them unknown ? '' De Unitate Credendi , cap . It -isaia- then undoubtedly the office of the church to guard Christian doctrine and to propagate it in its integrity and purity . But this_-isaia-_not all : the object for_which the Church has_been instituted -isaia- not wholly attained by the performance of this_duty . For , since Jesus Christ delivered Himself up for the salvation of the human_race , and to this_end directed all His teaching and commands , so He ordered the Church to strive , by the truth of its doctrine , to sanctify and to save mankind . But faith alone cannot compass so great , excellent , and important an end . There must needs be also the fitting and devout worship of God , which_-isaia- to be found chiefly in the divine Sacrifice and in the dispensation of the Sacraments , as well as salutary laws and discipline . All these must be found in the Church , since it continues the mission of the Saviour for ever . The Church alone offers to the human_race that religion that state of absolute perfection which He wished , as it were , to be incorporated in it . And it alone supplies those means of salvation which accord with the ordinary counsels of Providence . The Church a Divine Society . But as this heavenly doctrine was never left to the arbitrary judgment of private individuals , but , in the beginning delivered by Jesus Christ , was afterwards committed by Him exclusively to the Magisterium already named , so the power of performing and administering the divine mysteries , together_with_the authority of ruling and governing , was_not bestowed by God on all Christians indiscriminately , but on certain chosen persons . For to the Apostles and their legitimate successors alone these_words have reference : '' Going into the whole_world preach the Gospel . '' '' Whose sins you shall forgive they_are forgiven them . '' And in like_manner He ordered the Apostles only and those_who should lawfully succeed them to feed that_-isaia- to govern with authority all Christian souls . Whence it also follows that_it_-isaia- necessarily the duty of Christians to be subject and to obey . And these duties of the Apostolic office are , in general , all included in the words of St . Paul : '' Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ , and the dispensers of the mysteries of God '' I Cor . Wherefore Jesus Christ bade all men , present and future , follow Him as their leader and Saviour ; and this , not merely as individuals , but as forming a society , organized and united in mind . In this_way a duly constituted society should exist , formed out of the divided multitude of peoples , one in faith , one in end , one in the participation of the means adapted to the attainment of the end , and one as subject to one_and_the_same authority . To this_end He established in the Church all principles_which necessarily tend to make organized human societies , and through_which they attain the perfection proper to each . That -isaia- , in it the Church , all who wished to be the sons of God by adoption might attain to the perfection demanded by their high calling , and might obtain salvation . The Church , therefore , as we have_said , -isaia-_man s guide to whatever pertains to Heaven . This -isaia- the office appointed unto it by God : that_it_may watch over and may order all that concerns religion , and may , without let or hindrance , exercise , according to its judgment , its charge over Christianity . Wherefore they_who pretend that the Church has any wish to interfere in Civil matters , or to infringe upon the rights of the State , know it not , or wickedly calumniate it . God indeed even made the Church a society far more_perfect than any_other . For the end for_which the Church exists -isaia- as much higher than the end of other societies as divine_grace -isaia- above nature , as immortal blessings are above the transitory things on the earth . Therefore the Church -isaia- a society divine in its origin , supernatural in its end and in means proximately adapted to the attainment of that end ; but_it_-isaia- a human community inasmuch as it -isaia- composed of men . For this_reason we find it called in Holy Writ by names indicating a perfect society . It -isaia- spoken of as the House of God , the city placed upon the mountain to which all nations must come . But it -isaia-_also the fold presided over by one Shepherd , and into which all Christ s sheep must betake themselves . Yea , it -isaia- called the kingdom which God has raised up and which_will stand for ever . Finally it -isaia- the body of Christ that_-isaia- , of course , His mystical_body , but a body living and duly organized and composed of many members ; members indeed which_have not all the same functions , but_which , united one to the other , are kept bound together by the guidance and authority of the head . Indeed no true and perfect human_society can be conceived which_-isaia-_not governed by some supreme_authority . Christ therefore must have_given to His Church a supreme_authority to which all Christians must render obedience . For this_reason , as the unity of the faith_-isaia- of necessity required_for the unity_of_the_church , inasmuch as it -isaia- the body of the faithful , so also_for this_same unity , inasmuch as the Church -isaia- a divinely constituted society , unity of government , which effects and involves unity of communion , -isaia- necessary jure divino . '' The unity of the Church -isaia- manifested in the mutual connection or communication of its_members , and likewise in the relation of all the members of the Church to one head '' St . From this it -isaia- easy to see_that men can fall away from the unity of the Church by schism , as well as by heresy . '' We think_that this difference exists between heresy and schism '' writes St . Jerome : '' heresy has no perfect dogmatic teaching , whereas schism , through some Episcopal dissent , also separates from the Church '' S . John Chrysostom concurs : '' I say and protest he writes that_it_-isaia- as wrong to divide the Church as to fall_into heresy '' Hom . Wherefore as no heresy can ever be justifiable , so in like_manner there_can be no justification for schism . '' There -isaia- nothing_more grievous than the sacrilege of schism . there_can be no just necessity for destroying the unity of the Church '' S . Augustinus , Contra Epistolam Parmeniani , lib . The Supreme Authority Founded by Christ . The nature of this supreme_authority , which all Christians are_bound to obey , can be ascertained only by finding out what_was the evident and positive will of Christ . Certainly Christ -isaia- a King for ever ; and though invisible , He continues unto the end of time to govern and guard His church from Heaven . But since He willed that His kingdom should be visible He was obliged , when He ascended into Heaven , to designate a vice gerent on earth . '' Should anyone say that Christ -isaia-_the_one head and the one shepherd , the one spouse of the one Church , he does_not give an adequate reply . It -isaia- clear , indeed , that Christ -isaia- the author of grace in the Sacraments of the Church ; it -isaia- Christ Himself who baptizes ; it -isaia- He who forgives sins ; it -isaia- He who_-isaia- the true priest who bath offered Himself upon the altar of the cross , and it -isaia- by His power that His body -isaia- daily consecrated upon the altar ; and still , because He was_not to be visibly present to all the faithful , He made choice of ministers through whom_the aforesaid Sacraments should be dispensed to the faithful as said above '' cap . '' For the same reason , therefore , because He was about to withdraw His visible presence from the Church , it was necessary_that He should appoint someone in His place , to have_the charge of the Universal Church . Hence before His Ascension He said to Peter : Feed my sheep '' St . Thomas , Contra Gentiles , lib . Jesus Christ , therefore , appointed Peter to be that head of the Church ; and He also determined that the authority instituted in perpetuity for the salvation of all should be inherited by His successors , in whom_the same permanent authority of Peter himself should continue . And so He made that remarkable promise to Peter and to no one else : '' Thou are Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church '' Matt . '' To Peter the Lord spoke : to one , therefore_,_that He might establish unity upon one '' S . '' Without any prelude He mentions St . Peter s name and that of his_father Blessed art thou Simon , son of John and He does_not wish Him to be called any more Simon ; claiming him for Himself according to His divine authority He aptly names him Peter , from petra the rock , since upon him He was about to found His Church '' S . Cyrillus Alexandrinus , In Evang . The Universal Jurisdiction of St . From this text it -isaia- clear_that by the will and command of God the Church rests upon St . Peter , just as a building rests on its foundation . Now the proper nature of a foundation -isaia- to be a principle of cohesion for the various parts of the building . It must be the necessary condition of stability and strength . Remove it and the whole building falls . It -isaia- consequently the office of St . Peter to support the Church , and to guard it in all its strength and indestructible unity . How could he fulfil this office without_the power of commanding , forbidding , and judging , which_-isaia- properly called jurisdiction ? It -isaia- only by this_power of jurisdiction that nations and commonwealths are held together . A primacy of honour and the shadowy right of giving advice and admonition , which_-isaia- called direction , could never secure to any society of men unity or strength . The words and the gates of Hell shall_not prevail against it proclaim and establish the authority of which we speak . '' What -isaia- the it ? '' writes Origen . '' Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the Church or the Church ? The expression indeed -isaia- ambiguous , as if the rock and the Church were one_and_the_same . I indeed think that_this_-isaia- so , and that neither against the rock upon which Christ builds His Church nor against the Church shall the gates of Hell prevail '' Origenes , Comment . The meaning of this_divine utterance -isaia- , that , notwithstanding the wiles and intrigues which_they bring to bear against the Church , it can_never be that_the_church committed to the care of Peter shall succumb or in any wise fail . '' For the Church , as the edifice of Christ who_has wisely built His house upon a rock , cannot be conquered by the gates of Hell , which_may prevail over any man_who shall be off the rock and outside the Church , but shall be powerless against it '' Ibid . Therefore God confided His Church to Peter so that_he_might safely guard it with_his unconquerable power . He invested him , therefore , with the needful authority ; since_the right to rule -isaia- absolutely required by him_who has to guard human_society really and effectively . This , furthermore , Christ gave : '' To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven . '' And He -isaia- clearly still speaking of the Church , which a short time before He had called His own , and which He declared He wished to build on Peter as a foundation . The Church -isaia- typified not_only as an edifice but as a Kingdom , and every_one knows that the keys constitute the usual sign of governing authority . Wherefore when Christ promised to give to Peter the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , he promised to give him power and authority over the Church . '' The Son committed to Peter the office of spreading the knowledge of His Father and Himself over the whole_world . He who increased the Church in all the earth , and proclaimed it to be stronger than the heavens , gave to a mortal man all power in Heaven when He handed him the Keys '' S . Johannes Chrysostomus , Hom . In this_same sense He says : '' Whatsoever thou shall bind upon earth it shall be bound also in Heaven , and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth it shall be loosed also in Heaven . '' This metaphorical expression of binding and loosing indicates the power of making laws , of judging and of punishing ; and the power -isaia- said to be of such amplitude and force that God will ratify whatever_-isaia- decreed by it . Thus it -isaia- supreme and absolutely independent , so that , having no other power on earth as its superior , it embraces the whole Church and all things committed to the Church . The promise -isaia- carried_out when Christ the Lord after His Resurrection , having thrice asked Peter whether he loved Him more_than the rest , lays on him the injunction : '' Feed my lambs feed my sheep . '' That -isaia- He confides to him , without exception , all those_who were to belong to His fold . '' The Lord does not_hesitate . He interrogates , not to learn but to teach . When He was about to ascend into Heaven He left us , as it were , a vice gerent of His love . and so because Peter alone of all others professes his_love he -isaia- preferred to all that being the most perfect he should govern_the more_perfect '' S . secundum Lucam , lib . These , then , are the duties of a shepherd : to place himself as leader -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of his flock , to provide proper food for it , to ward off dangers , to guard against insidious foes , to defend it against violence : in a word to rule and govern it . Since therefore Peter has_been placed as shepherd of the Christian flock he has_received the power of governing all men for whose salvation Jesus Christ shed His blood . '' Why has He shed His blood ? To buy the sheep which He handed over to Peter and his_successors '' S . Joannes Chrysostomus , De Sacerdotio , lib . And since all Christians must be closely united in the communion of one immutable faith , Christ the Lord , in virtue of His prayers , obtained for Peter that in the fulfilment of his office he should never fall away from the faith . '' But I have asked for thee that thy faith fail not '' Luke xxii . , , and He furthermore commanded him to impart light and strength to his brethren as often as the need should arise : '' Confirm thy brethren '' Ibid . He willed then that he whom He had designated as the foundation of the Church should be the defence of its faith . '' Could not Christ who confided to him the Kingdom by His own authority have strengthened the faith of one whom He designated a rock to show the foundation of the Church ? '' S . Ambrosius , De Fide , lib . For this_reason Jesus Christ willed that Peter should participate in certain names , signs of great things_which properly belong to Himself alone : in order_that identity of titles should show identity of power . So He who_-isaia- Himself '' the chief corner stone in whom all the building being framed together , groweth up in a holy temple in the Lord '' Eph . , , placed Peter as it were a stone to support the Church . '' When he heard thou art a rock , he was ennobled by the announcement . Although he -isaia- a rock , not as Christ -isaia- a rock , but as Peter -isaia- a rock . For Christ -isaia- by His very being an immovable rock ; Peter only through_this rock . Christ imparts His gifts , and -isaia- not exhausted . He -isaia- a priest , and makes priests . He -isaia- a rock , and constitutes a rock '' Hom . He who_-isaia- the King of His Church , '' Who bath the key of David , who openeth and no man shutteth , who shutteth and no man openeth Apoc . , , having delivered the keys to Peter declared him Prince of the Christian commonwealth . So , too , He , the Great Shepherd , who calls Himself '' the Good Shepherd , '' constitued Peter the pastor '' of His lambs and sheep . Feed My lambs , feed My Sheep . '' Wherefore Chrysostom says : '' He was preeminent among the Apostles : He was_the mouthpiece of the Apostles and the head of the Apostolic College . -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time showing him_that henceforth he ought to have confidence , and as it were blotting out his denial , He commits to him the government of his brethren . He saith to him : If thou lovest Me , be over my brethren . Finally He who confirms in '' every good work and word '' Thess . , commands Peter '' to confirm his brethren . '' Rightly , therefore , does St . Leo the Great say : '' From the whole_world Peter alone_-isaia- chosen to take the lead in calling all nations , to be the head of all the Apostles and of all the Fathers of the Church . So that , although in the people of God there_are_many priests and many pastors Peter should by right rule all of those over whom Christ Himself -isaia- the chief ruler '' Sermo iv . Gregory the great , writing to the Emperor Maurice Augustus , says : '' It -isaia- evident to all who know_the gospel that the charge of the whole Church was committed to St . Peter , the Apostle and Prince of all the Apostles , by the word of the Lord . Behold ! he hath received_the keys of the heavenly kingdom the power of binding and loosing -isaia- conferred upon him : the care of the whole government of the Church -isaia- confided to him '' Epist . The Roman Pontiffs Possess Supreme Power in the Church Jure Divino . It was necessary_that a government of this_kind , since it belongs to the constitution and formation of the Church , as its principal element that_-isaia- as the principle of unity and the foundation of lasting stability should in no wise come to an end with St . Peter , but should pass to his_successors from one to another . '' There remains , therefore , the ordinance of truth , and St . Peter , persevering in the strength of the rock which_he_had received , hath not abandoned the government of the Church which_had_been confided to him '' S . For this_reason_the Pontiffs who succeed Peter in the Roman Episcopate receive the supreme power in the church , jure divino . '' We define '' declare the Fathers of the Council of Florence '' that the Holy and Apostolic See and the Roman Pontiff hold the primacy of the Church throughout_the whole_world : and that the same Roman Pontiff -isaia- the successor of St . Peter , the Prince of the Apostles , and the true Vicar of Christ , the head of the whole Church , and the father and teacher of all Christians ; and that full power was_given to him , in Blessed Peter , by our Lord Jesus Christ to feed , to rule , and to govern_the universal Church , as -isaia-_also contained in the acts of oecumenical councils and in the sacred canons '' Conc . Similarly the Fourth Council of Lateran declares : '' The Roman Church , as the mother and mistress of all the faithful , by the will of Christ obtains primacy of jurisdiction over all other Churches . '' These declarations were preceded by the consent of antiquity which ever acknowledged , without_the slightest doubt or hesitation , the Bishops of Rome , and revered them , as the legitimate successors of St . Who -isaia- unaware of the many and evident testimonies of the holy Fathers which exist to this effect ? Most remarkable -isaia- that of St . Irenaeus who , referring to the Roman Church , says : '' With this Church , on account of its preeminent authority , it -isaia- necessary_that every Church should be in concord '' Contra Haereses , lib . Cyprian also says of the Roman Church , that '' it -isaia- the root and mother of the Catholic Church , the chair of Peter , and the principal Church whence sacerdotal unity has its source '' Ep . He calls it the chair of Peter because_it_-isaia- occupied by the successor of Peter : he calls it the principal Church , on account of the primacy conferred on Peter himself and his legitimate successors ; and the source of unity , because the Roman Church -isaia- the efficient cause of unity in the Christian commonwealth . For this_reason Jerome addresses Damasus thus : '' My words are spoken to the successor of the Fisherman , to the disciple of the Cross . I communicate with none save your Blessedness , that_-isaia- with the chair of Peter . For this I know -isaia- the rock on which_the Church -isaia- built '' Ep . Union with the Roman See of Peter -isaia- to him always the public criterion of a Catholic . '' I acknowledge everyone who_-isaia- united with the See of Peter '' Ep . And for a like reason St . Augustine publicly attests that , '' the primacy of the Apostolic chair always existed in the Roman Church '' Ep . ; and he denies that anyone_who dissents from the Roman faith can be a Catholic . '' You are_not to be looked upon as holding the true Catholic faith if you do not teach that the faith of Rome -isaia- to be held '' Sermo cxx . Cyprian : '' To be in communion with Cornelius -isaia- to be in communion with the Catholic Church '' Ep . In the same_way Maximus the Abbot teaches_that obedience to the Roman Pontiff -isaia- the proof of the true faith and of legitimate communion . Therefore if a man does_not want to be , or to be called , a heretic , let_him not strive to please this or that_man . but let_him hasten before all things to be in communion with the Roman See . If he be in communion with it , he should be acknowledged by all and everywhere as faithful and orthodox . He speaks in vain who tries to persuade me of the orthodoxy of those_who , like himself , refuse obedience to his Holiness the Pope of the most_holy Church of Rome : that_-isaia- to the Apostolic See . '' The reason and motive of this he explains to be that '' the Apostolic See has_received and hath government , authority , and power of binding and loosing from the Incarnate Word Himself ; and , according to all holy synods , sacred canons and decrees , in all things and through all things , in respect of all the holy churches of God throughout_the whole_world , since_the Word in Heaven who rules the Heavenly powers binds and loosens there '' Defloratio ex Epistola ad Petrum illustrem . Wherefore what_was acknowledged and observed as Christian faith , not by one nation only nor in one age , but by the East and by the West , and through all ages , this Philip , the priest , the Pontifical legate -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council of Ephesus , no voice being raised in dissent , recalls : '' No one_can doubt , yea , it -isaia- known unto all ages , that St . Peter , the Prince of the Apostles , the pillar of the faith and the ground of the Catholic Church , received_the keys of the Kingdom from Our Lord Jesus Christ . That -isaia- : the power of forgiving and retaining sins was_given to him_who , up to the present_time , lives and exercises judgment in the persons of his_successors '' Actio iii . The pronouncement of the Council of Chalcedon on the same matter -isaia- present to the minds of all : '' Peter has spoken through Leo '' Actio ii . , to which_the voice of the Third Council of Constantinople responds as an echo : '' The chief Prince of the Apostles was fighting on our side : for we have_had as our ally his follower and the successor to his see : and the paper and the ink were seen , and Peter spoke through Agatho '' Actio xviii . In the formula of Catholic faith drawn up and proposed by Hormisdas , which_was subscribed -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the sixth century in the great Eighth Council by the Emperor Justinian , by Epiphanius , John and Menna , the Patriarchs , this_same -isaia- declared with_great weight and solemnity . '' For the pronouncement of Our Lord Jesus Christ saying : Thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my Church , c . , cannot be passed over . What -isaia- said -isaia- proved by the result , because Catholic faith has_always_been preserved without stain in the Apostolic See '' Post Epistolam , xxvi . We have no wish to quote every available declaration ; but_it_-isaia- well to recall_the formula of faith_which Michael Paleologus professed in the Second Council of Lyons : '' The same holy Roman Church possesses the sovereign and plenary primacy and authority over the whole Catholic Church , which , truly and humbly , it acknowledges to have_received together_with_the plenitude of power from the Lord Himself , in the person of St . Peter , the Prince or Head of the Apostles , of whom_the Roman Pontiff -isaia- the successor . And as it -isaia- bound to defend the truth of faith beyond all others , so also if any question should arise concerning the faith it must be determined by its judgment '' Actin iv . Bishops Belong to the Essential Constitution of the Church . But if the authority of Peter and his_successors -isaia- plenary and supreme , it -isaia- not to be regarded as the sole authority . For He who made Peter the foundation of the Church also '' chose , twelve , whom He called apostles '' Luke vi . , ; and just as it -isaia- necessary_that the authority of Peter should be perpetuated in the Roman Pontiff , so , by the fact_that the bishops succeed the Apostles , they inherit their ordinary power , and thus_the episcopal order necessarily belongs to the essential constitution of the Church . Although they_do_not receive plenary , or universal , or supreme_authority , they_are_not to be looked as vicars of the Roman Pontiffs ; because_they exercise a power really their_own , and are_most truly called the ordinary pastors of the peoples over whom_they rule . But since_the successor of Peter -isaia- one , and those of the Apostles are_many , it -isaia- necessary to examine into the relations which exist between him and them according to the divine constitution of the Church . Above all things the need of union between_the bishops and the successors of Peter -isaia- clear and undeniable . This bond once broken , Christians would be separated and scattered , and would in no wise form one_body and one flock . '' The safety of the Church depends on the dignity of the chief priest , to whom if an extraordinary and supreme power -isaia- not given , there_are as many schisms to be expected in the Church as there_are priests '' S . Hieronymus , Dialog , contra Luciferianos , n . It -isaia- necessary , therefore , to bear this in mind , viz . , that_nothing was conferred on the apostles apart_from Peter , but_that several things were conferred upon Peter apart_from the Apostles . John Chrysostom in explaining the words of Christ asks : '' Why , passing over the others , does He speak to Peter about these_things ? '' And he replies unhesitatingly and -atti_degli_apostoli- once , '' Because he was pre eminent among the Apostles , the mouthpiece of the Disciples , and the head of the college '' Hom . He alone was designated as the foundation of the Church . To him He gave the power of binding and loosing ; to him alone was_given the power of feeding . On the other_hand , whatever authority and office the Apostles received , they received in conjunction with Peter . '' If the divine benignity willed anything to be in common between him and the other princes , whatever He did_not deny to the others He gave only through_him . So that whereas Peter alone received many things , He conferred nothing on any of the rest without Peter participating in it '' S . Bishops Separated from Peter and His Successors , Lose All Jurisdiction . From this it must be clearly understood that Bishops are deprived of the right and power of ruling , if they deliberately secede from Peter and his_successors ; because , by this secession , they_are separated_from the foundation on which_the whole edifice must rest . They are therefore outside the edifice itself ; and for this_very reason they_are separated_from the fold , whose leader -isaia- the Chief Pastor ; they_are exiled from the Kingdom , the keys of which_were given by Christ to Peter alone . These things enable us to see the heavenly ideal , and the divine exemplar , of the constitution of the Christian commonwealth , namely : When the Divine founder decreed that the Church should be one in faith , in government , and in communion , He chose Peter and his_successors as the principle and centre , as it were , of this_unity . Cyprian says : '' The following -isaia- a short and easy proof of the faith . The Lord saith to Peter : I say to thee thou art Peter ; on him alone He buildeth His Church ; and although after His Resurrection He gives a similar power to all the Apostles and says : As the Father hath sent me , c . , still in order to make_the necessary unity clear , by His own authority He laid_down the source of that_unity as beginning from one '' De Unit . And Optatus of Milevis says : '' You cannot deny that_you know_that in the city of Rome the Episcopal chair was first conferred on Peter . In this Peter , the head of all the Apostles hence his_name Cephas , has sat ; in which chair alone unity was to be preserved for all , lest any of the other apostles should claim anything as exclusively his_own . So much so , that he who_would place another chair against that_one chair , would be a schismatic and a sinner '' De Schism . Hence the teaching of Cyprian , that heresy and schism arise and are begotten from the fact_that due obedience -isaia- refused to the supreme_authority . '' Heresies and schisms have no other origin than_that obedience -isaia- refused to the priest of God , and that_men lose sight of the fact that_there_-isaia- one judge in the place of Christ in this_world '' Epist . No one , therefore , unless in communion with Peter can share in his authority , since_it_-isaia- absurd to imagine that he who_-isaia- outside can command in the Church . Wherefore Optatus of Milevis blamed the Donatists for this_reason : '' Against which ages of hell we read that Peter received_the saving keys , that_-isaia- to say , our prince , to whom it was said by Christ : To thee will I give the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and the gates of Hell shall_not conquer them . Whence -isaia- it therefore that_you strive to obtain for yourselves the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven you_who fight against the chair of Peter ? '' Lib . But the Epsicopal order -isaia- rightly judged to be in communion with Peter , as Christ commanded , if it be subject to and obeys Peter ; otherwise it necessarily becomes a lawless and disorderly crowd . It -isaia- not sufficient for the due preservation of the unity of the faith_that the head should merely have_been charged with the office of superintendent , or should_have been invested solely with a power of direction . But it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that he should have_received real and sovereign authority which_the whole community -isaia- bound to obey . What had the Son of God in view when he promised the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to Peter alone ? Biblical usage and the unanimous teaching of the Fathers clearly show that supreme authority_-isaia- designated in the passage by the word keys . Nor -isaia- it lawful to interpret in a different sense what was_given to Peter alone , and what was_given to the other Apostles conjointly with_him . If the power of binding , loosening , and feeding confers upon each_and_every one of the Bishops the successors of the Apostles a real authority to rule_the people committed to him , certainly the same power must_have the same effect in his case to whom_the duty of feeding the lambs and sheep has_been assigned by God . '' Christ constituted Peter not_only pastor , but pastor of pastors ; Peter therefore feeds the lambs and feeds the sheep , feeds the children and feeds the mothers , governs the subjects and rules the prelates , because the lambs and the sheep form the whole of the Church '' S . Brunonis Episcopi Signiensis Comment . Hence those remarkable expressions of the ancients concerning St . Peter , which most clearly set_forth the fact_that he was placed in the highest degree of dignity and authority . They frequently call him '' the Prince of the College of the Disciples ; the Prince of the holy Apostles ; the leader of that choir ; the mouthpiece of all the Apostles ; the head of that family ; the ruler of the whole_world ; the first of the Apostles ; the safeguard of the Church . Bernard writes as follows to Pope Eugenius : '' Who art thou ? The great priest the high_priest . Thou art the Prince of Bishops and the heir of the Apostles . Thou art he to whom_the keys were given . There are , it -isaia- true , other gatekeepers of heaven and to pastors of flocks , but thou are so much the more glorious as thou bast inherited a different and more glorious name than all the rest . They have flocks consigned to them , one to each ; to thee all the flocks are confided as one flock to one shepherd , and not alone the sheep , but the shepherds . You ask how I prove this ? From the words of the Lord . To which I do not say of the Bishops , but_even of the Apostles have all the sheep been so absolutely and unreservedly committed ? If thou lovest me , Peter , feed my sheep . Which sheep ? Of this or that country , or kingdom ? My sheep , He says : to whom therefore -isaia- it not evident_that he does_not designate some , but all ? We can_make no exception where no distinction -isaia- made '' De Consideratione , lib . But it -isaia- opposed to the truth , and in evident contradiction with the divine constitution of the Church , to hold that while each Bishop -isaia- individually bound to obey the authority of the Roman Pontiffs , taken collectively the Bishops are_not so bound . For it -isaia- the nature and object of a foundation to support the unity of the whole edifice and to give stability to it , rather_than to each component part ; and in the present case this_-isaia- much_more applicable , since Christ the Lord wished that by the strength and solidity of the foundation the gates of hell should be prevented from prevailing against the Church . All are agreed that the divine promise must be understood of the Church as a whole , and not of any certain portions of it . These can indeed be overcome by the assaults of the powers of hell , as in point of fact has befallen some of them . Moreover , he who_-isaia- set over the whole flock must_have authority , not_only over the sheep dispersed throughout_the Church , but_also when_they_are assembled together . Do the sheep when_they_are all assembled together rule and guide the shepherd ? Do the successors of the Apostles assembled together constitute the foundation on which_the successor of St . Peter rests in order to derive therefrom strength and stability ? Surely jurisdicton and authority belong to him in whose power have_been placed the keys of the Kingdom taken collectively . And as the Bishops , each in his_own district , command with real power not_only individuals but the whole community , so the Roman pontiffs , whose jurisdiction extends to the whole Christian commonwealth , must_have all its parts , even taken collectively , subject and obedient to their authority . Christ the Lord , as we have quite sufficiently shown , made Peter and his_successors His vicars , to exercise for ever in the Church the power which He exercised during His mortal life . Can the Apostolic College be said to have_been above its master in authority ? This power over the Episcopal College to which we refer , and which_-isaia- clearly set_forth in Holy Writ , has_ever been acknowledged and attested by the Church , as -isaia- clear from the teaching of General Councils . '' We read that the Roman Pontiff has pronounced judgments on the prelates of all the churches ; we do not read that anybody has pronounced sentence on him '' Hadrianus ii . The reason_for which_-isaia- stated thus : '' there_-isaia- no authority greater_than that of the Apostolic See '' Nicholaus in Epist . wherefore Gelasius on the decrees of Councils says : '' That which_the First See has not approved of cannot stand ; but_what it has thought well to decree has_been received by the whole Church '' Epist . It has_ever been unquestionably the office of the Roman Pontiffs to ratify or to reject the decrees of Councils . Leo the great rescinded the acts of the Conciliabulum of Ephesus . Damasus rejected those of Rimini , and Hadrian I . The th Canon of the Council of Chalcedon , by the very fact_that it lacks the assent and approval of the Apostolic See , -isaia- admitted by all to be worthless . Rightly , therefore , has Leo X . laid_down in the th council of Lateran '' that the Roman Pontiff alone , as having authority over all Councils , has full jurisdiction and power to summon , to transfer , to dissolve Councils , as -isaia- clear , not_only from the testimony of Holy Writ , from the teaching of the Fathers and of the Roman Pontiffs , and from the decrees of the sacred canons , but_from the teaching of the very Councils themselves . '' Indeed , Holy Writ attests that the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to Peter alone , and that the power of binding and loosening was granted to the Apostles and to Peter ; but there_-isaia-_nothing to show that the Apostles received supreme power without Peter , and against Peter . Such power they certainly did_not receive from Jesus Christ . Wherefore , in the decree of the Vatican Council as to the nature and authority of the primacy of the Roman Pontiff , no newly conceived opinion -isaia- set_forth , but the venerable and constant belief of every_age Sess . Nor does it beget any confusion in the administration that Christians are_bound to obey a twofold authority . We are prohibited in the first_place by Divine Wisdom from entertaining any such thought , since_this form of government was constituted by the counsel of God Himself . In the second place we must note that the due order of things and their mutual relations are disturbed if there be a twofold magistracy of the same rank set over a people , neither of which_-isaia- amenable to the other . But the authority of the Roman Pontiff -isaia- supreme , universal , independent ; that of the bishops limited , and dependent . '' It -isaia- not congruous that two superiors with equal authority should be placed over the same flock ; but_that two , one of whom -isaia- higher than the other , should be placed over the same people -isaia- not incongruous . Thus the parish priest , the bishop , and the Pope , are placed immediately over the same people '' St . Thomas in iv Sent , dist . So the Roman Pontiffs , mindful of their_duty , wish above all things , that the divine constitution of the Church should be preserved . Therefore , as they defend with all necessary care and vigilance their_own authority , so they have_always laboured , and will_continue to labour , that the authority of the bishops may be upheld . Yea , they look up whatever honour or obedience -isaia- given to the bishops as paid to themselves . '' My honour -isaia- the honour of the Universal Church . My honour -isaia- the strength and stability of my brethren . Then -amos- I honoured when due honour -isaia- given to everyone '' S . Epistolarum , lib viii . Appeal to Sheep Not of the Fold . In what_has_been said we have faithfully described the exemplar and form of the Church as divinely constituted . We have treated -atti_degli_apostoli- length of its unity : we have explained sufficiently its_nature , and pointed_out the way_in_which the Divine Founder of the Church willed that it should be preserved . There -isaia- no reason to doubt_that all those , who by Divine Grace and mercy have_had the happiness to have_been born , as it were , in the bosom of the Catholic Church , and to have lived in it , will listen to Our Apostolic Voice : '' My sheep hear my voice '' John x . , , and that_they_will derive from Our words fuller instruction and a more_perfect disposition to keep united with their_respective pastors , and through them_with_the Supreme Pastor , so that_they_may remain more securely within_the one fold , and may derive therefrom a greater abundance of salutary fruit . But We , who , notwithstanding our unfitness for this_great dignity and office , govern by virtue of the authority conferred on us by Jesus Christ , as we '' look on Jesus , the author and finisher of our_faith '' Heb . , feel Our heart fired by His charity . What Christ has said of Himself We may truly repeat of Ourselves : '' Other sheep I have that_are not of this fold : them also I must bring and they_shall hear my voice '' John x . Let all those , therefore , who detest the wide spread irreligion of our_times , and acknowledge and confess Jesus Christ to be the Son of God and the Saviour of the human_race , but who_have wandered away from the Spouse , listen to Our voice . Let them_not refuse to obey Our paternal charity . Those who acknowledge Christ must acknowledge Him wholly and entirely . '' The Head and the body are Christ wholly and entirely . The Head -isaia- the only_begotten_son of God , the body -isaia- His Church ; the bridegroom and the bride , two in one flesh . All who dissent from the Scriptures concerning Christ , although they_may be found in all places in which_the Church -isaia- found , are_not in the Church ; and again all those_who agree with the Scriptures concerning the Head , and do not communicate in the unity of the Church , are_not in the Church '' S . Augustinus , Contra Donatistas Epistola , sive De Unit . And with the same yearning Our soul goes out to those_whom the foul breath of irreligion has not entirely corrupted , and who -atti_degli_apostoli- least seek to have_the true God , the Creator of Heaven and earth , as their Father . Let such as these take counsel with themselves , and realize that_they_can in no wise be counted among the children of God , unless they take Christ Jesus as their Brother , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Church as their mother . We lovingly address to all the words of St . Augustine : '' Let us love the Lord our God ; let us love His Church ; the Lord as our Father , the Church as our Mother . Let no one say , I go indeed to idols , I consult fortune tellers and soothsayers ; but I leave not the Church of God : I -amos- a Catholic . Clinging to thy Mother , thou offendest thy Father . Another , too , says : Far be it from me ; I do not consult fortune telling , I seek not soothsaying , I seek not profane divinations , I go not to the worship of devils , I serve not stones : but I -amos- on the side of Donatus . What doth it profit thee not to offend the Father , who avenges an offence against the Mother ? What doth it profit to confess the Lord , to honour God , to preach Him , to acknowledge His Son , and to confess that He sits on the right hand of the Father , if you blaspheme His Church ? . If you had a beneficent friend , whom_you honoured daily and even once calumniated his spouse , would you ever enter his house ? Hold fast , therefore , O dearly beloved , hold fast altogether God as your Father , and the Church as your Mother '' Enarratio in Psal . Above all things , trusting in the mercy of God , who_-isaia- able to move the hearts of men and to incline them as and when He pleases , We most earnestly commend to His loving kindness all those of whom We have spoken . As a pledge of Divine grace , and as a token of Our affection , We lovingly impart to you , in the Lord , Venerable Brethren , to your clergy_and_people , Our Apostolic Blessing . Peter s , Rome , the th day of June , in the year , and the nineteenth of our Pontificate .

Liberty , the highest of natural endowments , being the portion only of intellectual or rational natures , confers on man this dignity that_he_-isaia- '' in the hand of his counsel '' and has power over his actions . But the manner in which such dignity -isaia- exercised -isaia- of the greatest moment , inasmuch as on the use that_-isaia- made of liberty the highest good and the greatest evil alike depend . Man , indeed , -isaia- free to obey his reason , to seek moral good , and to strive unswervingly after_his last end . Yet he -isaia- free also to turn aside to all other_things ; and , in pursuing the empty semblance of good , to disturb rightful order and to fall headlong into the destruction which_he_has voluntarily chosen . The Redeemer of mankind , Jesus Christ , having restored and exalted the original dignity of nature , vouchsafed special assistance to the will of man ; and by the gifts of His grace here , and the promise of heavenly bliss hereafter , He raised it to a nobler state . In like_manner , this_great gift of nature has_ever been , and always will be , deservingly cherished by the Catholic Church , for to her alone has_been committed the charge of handing down to all ages the benefits purchased for us by Jesus Christ . Yet there_are_many who imagine that the Church -isaia- hostile to human liberty . Having a false and absurd notion as to what liberty -isaia- , either they pervert the very idea of freedom , or they extend it -atti_degli_apostoli- their pleasure to many things in respect of which_man cannot rightly be regarded as free . We have on other occasions , and especially in Our encyclical_letter Immortale Dei , in treating of the so called modern liberties , distinguished between their good_and_evil elements ; and We have shown that whatsoever -isaia- good in those liberties -isaia- as ancient as truth itself , and that the Church has_always most willingly approved and practiced that good : but whatsoever has_been added as new -isaia- , to tell the plain truth , of a vitiated kind , the fruit of the disorders of the age , and of an insatiate longing after novelties . Seeing , however_,_that many cling so obstinately to their_own opinion in this_matter as to imagine these modern liberties , cankered as they_are , to be the greatest glory of our_age , and the very basis of civil life , without_which no perfect government can be conceived , We feel it a pressing duty , for the sake of the common_good , to treat separately of this_subject . It -isaia- with moral liberty , whether in individuals or in communities , that We proceed -atti_degli_apostoli- once to deal . But , first of all , it will be well to speak briefly of natural liberty ; for , though it -isaia- distinct and separate from moral liberty , natural freedom_-isaia- the fountainhead from which liberty of whatsoever kind flows , sua vi suaque sponte . The unanimous consent and judgment of men , which_-isaia- the trusty voice of nature , recognizes this natural liberty in those only who_are endowed_with intelligence or reason ; and it -isaia- by his use of this_that man_-isaia- rightly regarded as responsible_for his actions . For , while other animate creatures follow their senses , seeking good and avoiding evil only by instinct , man_has reason to guide him in each_and_every act of his_life . Reason sees that whatever things_that_are held to be good upon earth may exist or may_not , and discerning that none of them are of necessity for us , it leaves the will free to choose what it pleases . But man can judge of this contingency , as We say , only_because he has a soul that_-isaia- simple , spiritual , and intellectual a soul , therefore , which_-isaia-_not produced by matter , and does_not depend on matter for its existence ; but which_-isaia- created immediately by God , and , far surpassing the condition of things material , has a life and action of its_own so that , knowing the unchangeable and necessary reasons of what_-isaia- true and good , it sees that no particular kind of good -isaia- necessary to us . When , therefore , it -isaia- established that_man s soul -isaia- immortal and endowed_with reason and not bound up with things material , the foundation of natural liberty -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once most firmly laid . As the Catholic Church declares in the strongest terms the simplicity , spirituality , and immortality of the soul , so with unequalled constancy and publicity she ever also asserts its freedom . These truths she has_always taught , and has sustained them as a dogma of faith , and whensoever heretics or innovators have attacked the liberty of man , the Church has defended it and protected this noble possession from destruction . History bears_witness to the energy with_which she met the fury of the Manichaeans and others like them ; and the earnestness with_which in later years she defended human liberty -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council of Trent , and against the followers of Jansenius , -isaia- known to all . At no time , and in no place , has she held truce with fatalism . Liberty , then , as We have_said , belongs only to those_who_have the gift of reason or intelligence . Considered as to its_nature , it -isaia- the faculty of choosing means fitted for the end proposed , for he -isaia- master of his actions who_can choose one_thing out of many . Now , since everything chosen as a means -isaia- viewed as good or useful , and since good , as such , -isaia- the proper object of our desire , it follows_that freedom of choice -isaia- a property of the will , or , rather , -isaia- identical with the will in so far as it has in its action the faculty of choice . But the will cannot proceed to act until it -isaia- enlightened by the knowledge possessed by the intellect . In other_words , the good wished by the will -isaia- necessarily good in so far as it -isaia- known by the intellect ; and this_the more , because in all voluntary acts choice -isaia- subsequent to a judgment upon the truth of the good presented , declaring to which good preference should be given . No sensible man can doubt_that judgment -isaia- an act of reason , not of the will . The end , or object , both of the rational will and of its liberty -isaia- that good only which_-isaia- in conformity_with reason . Since , however , both these faculties are imperfect , it -isaia- possible , as -isaia-_often seen , that the reason should propose something which_-isaia-_not really good , but_which has the appearance of good , and that the will should choose accordingly . For , as the possibility of error , and actual error , are defects of the mind and attest its imperfection , so the pursuit of what_has a false appearance of good , though a proof of our freedom , just as a disease -isaia- a proof of our vitality , implies defect in human liberty . The will_also , simply because of its dependence on the reason , no sooner desires anything contrary thereto than it abuses its freedom of choice and corrupts its_very essence . Thus it -isaia- that the infinitely perfect God , although supremely free , because of the supremacy of His intellect and of His essential goodness , nevertheless cannot choose evil ; neither can the angels and saints , who enjoy_the beatific vision . Augustine and others urged most admirably against the Pelagians that , if the possibility of deflection from good belonged to the essence or perfection of liberty , then God , Jesus Christ , and the angels and saints , who have_not this_power , would_have no liberty -atti_degli_apostoli- all , or would_have less liberty than man_has in his state of pilgrimage and imperfection . This subject -isaia-_often discussed by the Angelic Doctor in his demonstration that the possibility of sinning -isaia- not freedom , but slavery . It will suffice to quote his subtle commentary on the words of our Lord : '' Whosoever committeth sin_-isaia- the slave of sin . '' '' Everything , '' he says , '' -isaia- that_which belongs to it a naturally . When , therefore , it acts through a power outside itself , it does_not act of itself , but through another , that_-isaia- , as a slave . But man_-isaia- by nature rational . When , therefore , he acts according to reason , he acts of himself and according_to_his free will ; and this_-isaia- liberty . Whereas , when he sins , he acts in opposition to reason , -isaia- moved by another , and -isaia- the victim of foreign misapprehensions . Therefore , Whosoever committeth sin_-isaia- the slave of sin . '' Even the heathen philosophers clearly recognized this_truth , especially they_who held that the wise man alone_-isaia- free ; and by the term '' wise man '' was meant , as -isaia- well_known , the man trained to live in accordance_with his nature , that_-isaia- , in justice and virtue . Such , then , being the condition of human liberty , it necessarily stands in need of light and strength to direct its actions to good and to restrain them_from evil . Without this , the freedom of our will would be our ruin . First of all , there_must be law ; that_-isaia- , a fixed rule of teaching what_-isaia- to be done and what_-isaia- to be left undone . This rule cannot affect the lower animals in any true sense , since_they act of necessity , following their natural instinct , and cannot of themselves act in any_other way . On the other_hand , as was said above , he who_-isaia- free can either act or not act , can do this or do that , as he pleases , because his judgment precedes his choice . And his judgment not_only decides what_-isaia- right or wrong of its_own nature , but_also what_-isaia- practically good and therefore to be chosen , and what_-isaia- practically evil and therefore to be avoided . In other_words , the reason prescribes to the will what it should seek after or shun , in order to the eventual attainment of man s last end , for the sake of which all his actions ought to be performed . This ordination of reason -isaia- called law . In man s free will , therefore , or in the moral necessity of our voluntary acts being in accordance_with reason , lies the very root of the necessity of law . Nothing more foolish can be uttered or conceived than the notion that , because man_-isaia- free by nature , he -isaia- therefore exempt from law . Were this_the case , it would follow that to become free we must be deprived of reason ; whereas the truth_-isaia- that_we_are bound to submit to law precisely_because we are free by our very nature . For , law_-isaia- the guide of man s actions ; it turns him toward good by its rewards , and deters him from evil by its punishments . Foremost in this office comes the natural_law , which_-isaia- written and engraved in the mind of every man ; and this_-isaia- nothing but our reason , commanding us to do right and forbidding sin . Nevertheless , all prescriptions of human_reason can have force of law only inasmuch as they_are the voice and the interpreters of some higher power on which_our reason and liberty necessarily depend . For , since_the force of law consists in the imposing of obligations and the granting of rights , authority_-isaia- the one and only foundation of all law the power , that_-isaia- , of fixing duties and defining rights , as also of assigning the necessary sanctions of reward and chastisement to each and all of its commands . But all this , clearly , cannot be found in man , if , as his_own supreme legislator , he -isaia- to be the rule of his_own actions . It follows , therefore_,_that the law of nature -isaia-_the_same thing as the eternal law , implanted in rational creatures , and inclining them to their right action and end ; and can be nothing else but the eternal reason of God , the Creator and Ruler of all the world . To this rule of action and restraint of evil God has vouchsafed to give special and most suitable aids for strengthening and ordering the human will . The first and most excellent of these -isaia- the power of His divine_grace , whereby_the mind can be enlightened and the will wholesomely invigorated and moved to the constant pursuit of moral good , so that the use of our inborn liberty becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- once less difficult and less dangerous . Not that the divine assistance hinders in any_way the free movement of our will ; just the contrary , for grace works inwardly in man and in harmony_with his natural inclinations , since it flows from the very Creator of his mind and will , by whom all things_are moved in conformity_with their nature . As the Angelic Doctor points_out , it -isaia- because divine_grace comes_from_the Author of nature that_it_-isaia- so admirably adapted to be the safeguard of all natures , and to maintain the character , efficiency , and operations of each . What has been_said of the liberty of individuals -isaia- no less applicable to them when considered as bound together in civil_society . For , what reason and the natural_law do for individuals , that_human law , promulgated for their good , does for the citizens of States . Of the laws enacted by men , some are concerned_with what_-isaia-_good or bad by its_very nature ; and they command men to follow after what_-isaia- right and to shun what_-isaia- wrong , adding -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a suitable sanction . But such laws by no means derive their origin from civil_society , because , just as civil_society did_not create human_nature , so neither can it be said to be the author of the good which befits human_nature , or of the evil which_-isaia- contrary to it . Laws come before men live together in society , and have_their origin in the natural , and consequently in the eternal , law . The precepts , therefore , of the natural_law , contained bodily in the laws of men , have_not merely the force of human law , but_they possess that higher and more august sanction which belongs to the law of nature and the eternal law . And within_the sphere of this_kind of laws the duty of the civil legislator -isaia- , mainly , to keep the community in obedience by the adoption of a common discipline and by putting restraint upon refractory and viciously inclined men , so that , deterred from evil , they_may turn to what_-isaia-_good , or -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate may avoid causing trouble and disturbance to the State . Now , there_are other enactments of the civil authority , which do not follow directly , but somewhat remotely , from the natural_law , and decide many points which_the law of nature treats only in a general and indefinite way . For instance , though nature commands all to contribute to the public peace and prosperity , whatever belongs to the manner , and circumstances , and conditions under which such service -isaia- to be rendered must be determined by the wisdom of men and not by nature herself . It -isaia- in the constitution of these particular rules of life , suggested by reason and prudence , and put forth by competent authority , that_human law , properly so called , consists , binding all citizens to work together for the attainment of the common end proposed to the community , and forbidding them to depart from this_end , and , in so far as human law_-isaia- in conformity_with_the dictates of nature , leading to what_-isaia-_good , and deterring from evil . From this it -isaia- manifest that the eternal law of God -isaia- the sole standard and rule of human liberty , not_only in each_individual man , but_also in the community and civil_society which men constitute when united . Therefore , the true liberty of human_society does_not consist in every man doing what he pleases , for this_would simply end in turmoil and confusion , and bring on the overthrow of the State ; but_rather in this , that_through the injunctions of the civil law all may more_easily conform to the prescriptions of the eternal law . Likewise , the liberty of those_who_are in authority does_not consist in the power to lay unreasonable and capricious commands upon their subjects , which_would equally be criminal and would lead to the ruin of the commonwealth ; but the binding force of human laws -isaia- in this , that_they_are to be regarded as applications of the eternal law , and incapable of sanctioning anything which_-isaia-_not contained in the eternal law , as in the principle of all law . Augustine most wisely says : '' I think_that you can_see , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , that there_-isaia-_nothing just and lawful in that temporal law , unless what men_have gathered from this eternal law . '' If , then , by anyone in authority , something be sanctioned out of conformity_with_the principles of right_reason , and consequently hurtful to the commonwealth , such an enactment can have no binding force of law , as being no rule of justice , but certain to lead men away from that good which_-isaia- the very end of civil_society . Therefore , the nature of human liberty , however it be considered , whether in individuals or in society , whether in those_who command or in those_who obey , supposes the necessity of obedience to some supreme and eternal law , which_-isaia- no other_than the authority of God , commanding good and forbidding evil . And , so far from this_most just authority of God over men diminishing , or even destroying their liberty , it protects and perfects it , for the real perfection of all creatures -isaia- found in the prosecution and attainment of their_respective ends ; but the supreme end to which human liberty must aspire -isaia- God . These precepts of the truest and highest teaching , made_known to us by the light of reason itself , the Church , instructed by the example and doctrine of her_divine Author , has_ever propagated and asserted ; for she has_ever made them the measure of her office and of her teaching to the Christian nations . As to morals , the laws of the Gospel not_only immeasurably surpass the wisdom of the heathen , but are an invitation and an introduction to a state of holiness unknown to the ancients ; and , bringing man nearer to God , they_make him -atti_degli_apostoli- once the possessor of a more_perfect liberty . Thus , the powerful influence of the Church has_ever been manifested in the custody and protection of the civil and political liberty of the people . The enumeration of its merits in this respect does_not belong to our present purpose . It -isaia- sufficient to recall_the fact_that slavery , that old reproach of the heathen nations , was mainly abolished by the beneficent efforts of the Church . The impartiality of law and the true brotherhood of man were first asserted by Jesus Christ ; and His apostles re echoed His voice when_they declared that in future there_was to be neither Jew , nor Gentile , nor barbarian , nor Scythian , but all were brothers in Christ . So powerful , so conspicuous , in this respect -isaia- the influence of the Church that experience abundantly testifies how savage customs are no longer possible in any land where she_has once set her foot ; but_that gentleness speedily takes the place of cruelty , and the light of truth quickly dispels the darkness of barbarism . Nor has the Church been less lavish in the benefits she_has conferred on civilized nations in every_age , either by resisting the tyranny of the wicked , or by protecting the innocent and helpless from injury , or , finally , by using her influence in the support of any form of government which commended itself to the citizens -atti_degli_apostoli- home , because of its justice , or was feared by their enemies without , because of its power . Moreover , the highest duty -isaia- to respect authority , and obediently to submit to just law ; and by this_the members of a community are effectually protected from the wrong doing of evil men . Lawful power -isaia- from God , '' and whosoever resisteth authority resisteth the ordinance of God ; wherefore , obedience -isaia- greatly ennobled when subjected to an authority which -isaia-_the_most just and supreme of all . But where_the power to command -isaia- wanting , or where a law_-isaia- enacted contrary to reason , or to the eternal law , or to some ordinance of God , obedience -isaia- unlawful , lest , while obeying man , we become disobedient to God . Thus , an effectual barrier being opposed to tyranny , the authority in the State will not_have all its_own way , but the interests and rights of all will be safeguarded the rights of individuals , of domestic society , and of all the members of the commonwealth ; all being free to live according to law and right_reason ; and in this , as We have shown , true liberty really consists . If when men discuss the question of liberty they_were careful to grasp its true and legitimate meaning , such as reason and reasoning have just explained , they_would never venture to affix such a calumny on the Church as to assert that she_-isaia- the foe of individual and public liberty . But many there_are who follow in the footsteps of Lucifer , and adopt as their_own his rebellious cry , '' I will_not serve '' ; and consequently substitute for true liberty what_-isaia- sheer and most foolish license . Such , for instance , are the men belonging to that widely spread and powerful organization , who , usurping the name of liberty , style themselves liberals . What naturalists or rationalists aim -atti_degli_apostoli- in philosophy , that the supporters of liberalism , carrying_out the principles laid_down by naturalism , are attempting in the domain of morality and politics . The fundamental doctrine of rationalism -isaia- the supremacy of the human_reason , which , refusing due submission to the divine and eternal reason , proclaims its_own independence , and constitutes itself the supreme principle and source and judge of truth . Hence , these followers of liberalism deny the existence of any divine authority to which obedience -isaia- due , and proclaim that_every man_-isaia- the law to himself ; from which arises that ethical system which_they style independent morality , and which , under the guise of liberty , exonerates man from any obedience to the commands of God , and substitutes a boundless license . The end of all this it -isaia- not difficult to foresee , especially_when society_-isaia- in question . For , when once man_-isaia- firmly persuaded that_he_-isaia- subject to no one , it follows_that the efficient cause of the unity of civil society_-isaia- not to be sought in any principle external to man , or superior to him , but simply in the free will of individuals ; that the authority in the State comes_from_the people only ; and that , just as every man s individual reason -isaia-_his only rule of life , so the collective reason of the community should be the supreme guide in the management of all public affairs . Hence the doctrine of the supremacy of the greater number , and that all right and all duty reside in the majority . But , from what_has_been said , it -isaia- clear_that all this_-isaia- in contradiction to reason . To refuse any bond of union between man and civil_society , on the one_hand , and God the Creator and consequently the supreme Law giver , on the other , -isaia- plainly repugnant to the nature , not_only of man , but of all created things ; for , of necessity , all effects must in some proper way be connected_with their cause ; and it belongs to the perfection of every nature to contain itself within that sphere and grade which_the order of nature has assigned to it , namely_,_that the lower should be subject and obedient to the higher . Moreover , besides this , a doctrine of such character -isaia- most hurtful both to individuals and to the State . For , once ascribe to human_reason the only authority to decide what_-isaia- true and what_-isaia-_good , and the real distinction between good_and_evil -isaia- destroyed ; honor and dishonor differ not in their nature , but in the opinion and judgment of each_one ; pleasure -isaia- the measure of what_-isaia- lawful ; and , given a code of morality which_can have little or no power to restrain or quiet the unruly propensities of man , a way -isaia- naturally opened to universal corruption . With reference also to public affairs : authority_-isaia- severed from the true and natural principle whence it derives all its efficacy for the common_good ; and the law determining what it -isaia- right to do and avoid doing -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of a majority . Now , this_-isaia- simply a road leading straight to tyranny . The empire of God over man and civil_society once repudiated , it follows_that religion , as a public institution , can have no claim to exist , and that everything_that belongs to religion will be treated with complete indifference . Furthermore , with ambitious designs on sovereignty , tumult and sedition will be common amongst the people ; and when duty and conscience cease to appeal to them , there_will be nothing to hold them back but force , which of itself alone_-isaia- powerless to keep their covetousness in check . Of this we have almost daily evidence in the conflict with socialists and members of other seditious societies , who labor unceasingly to bring_about revolution . It -isaia- for those , then , who_are capable of forming a just estimate of things to decide whether such doctrines promote that true liberty which alone_-isaia- worthy of man , or rather , pervert and destroy it . There are , indeed , some adherents of liberalism who_do_not subscribe to these opinions , which_we_have seen to be fearful in their enormity , openly opposed to the truth , and the cause of most terrible evils . Indeed , very many amongst them , compelled by the force of truth , do not_hesitate to admit that_such liberty -isaia- vicious , nay , -isaia- simple license , whenever intemperate in its claims , to the neglect of truth and justice ; and therefore they_would have liberty ruled and directed by right_reason , and consequently subject to the natural_law and to the divine eternal law . But here they think they_may stop , holding that_man as a free being -isaia- bound by no law of God except such as He makes known to us through our natural reason . In this they_are plainly inconsistent . For if as they_must admit , and no one_can rightly deny the will of the Divine Law giver -isaia- to be obeyed , because every man_-isaia- under the power of God , and tends toward Him as his end , it follows_that no one_can assign limits to His legislative authority without failing in the obedience which_-isaia- due . Indeed , if the human mind be so presumptuous as to define the nature and extent of God s rights and its_own duties , reverence for the divine_law will be apparent rather_than real , and arbitrary judgment will prevail over the authority and providence of God . Man must , therefore , take his standard of a loyal and religious_life from the eternal law ; and from all and every_one of those laws which God , in His infinite wisdom and power , has_been pleased to enact , and to make known to us by such clear and unmistakable signs as to leave no room_for doubt . And the more so because laws of this_kind have_the same origin , the same author , as the eternal law , are absolutely in accordance_with right_reason , and perfect the natural_law . These laws it -isaia- that embody the government of God , who graciously guides and directs the intellect and the will of man lest these fall_into error . Let , then_,_that continue to remain in a holy and inviolable union which neither can nor_should be separated ; and in all things for this_-isaia- the dictate of right_reason itself let God be dutifully and obediently served . There are others , somewhat more moderate though not more consistent , who affirm that the morality of individuals -isaia- to be guided by the divine_law , but_not the morality of the State , for that in public affairs the commands of God may be passed over , and may be entirely disregarded in the framing of laws . Hence follows the fatal theory of the need of separation between Church and State . But the absurdity of such a position -isaia- manifest . Nature herself proclaims_the necessity of the State providing means and opportunities whereby_the community may be enabled to live properly , that_-isaia- to say , according to the laws of God . For , since God -isaia-_the_source of all goodness and justice , it -isaia- absolutely ridiculous that the State should pay no attention to these laws or render them abortive by contrary enact menu . Besides , those_who_are in authority owe it to the commonwealth not_only to provide_for its external well_being and the conveniences of life , but still_more to consult the welfare of men s souls in the wisdom of their legislation . But , for the increase of such benefits , nothing_more suitable can be conceived than the laws which_have God for their author ; and , therefore , they_who in their government of the State take no account of these laws abuse political power by causing it to deviate from its_proper end and from what nature itself prescribes . And , what_-isaia- still more_important , and what We have more_than_once pointed_out , although the civil authority has not the same proximate end as the spiritual , nor proceeds on the same lines , nevertheless in the exercise of their separate powers they_must occasionally meet . For their subjects are the same , and not infrequently they deal_with the same objects , though in different_ways . Whenever this occurs , since a state of conflict -isaia- absurd and manifestly repugnant to the most wise ordinance of God , there_must necessarily exist some order or mode of procedure to remove the occasions of difference and contention , and to secure harmony in all things . This harmony has_been not inaptly compared to that_which exists between_the body and the soul for the well_being of both one and the other , the separation of which brings irremediable harm to the body , since it extinguishes its_very life . To make_this more evident , the growth of liberty ascribed to our_age must be considered apart in its various details . And , first , let us examine that liberty in individuals which_-isaia- so opposed to the virtue of religion , namely , the liberty of worship , as it -isaia- called . This -isaia- based on the principle that_every man_-isaia- free to profess as he may choose any religion or none . But , assuredly , of all the duties which_man has to fulfill , that , without_doubt , -isaia- the chiefest and holiest which commands him to worship God with devotion and piety . This follows of necessity from the truth that_we_are ever in the power of God , are ever guided by His will and providence , and , having come forth_from Him , must return to Him . Add to which , no true virtue can exist without religion , for moral virtue -isaia- concerned_with those things_which lead to God as man s supreme and ultimate good ; and therefore religion , which as St . Thomas says '' performs those actions which_are directly and immediately ordained for the divine honor '' , rules and tempers all virtues . And if it be asked which of the many conflicting religions it -isaia- necessary to adopt , reason and the natural_law unhesitatingly tell us to practice that one_which God enjoins , and which men can easily recognize by certain exterior notes , whereby Divine Providence has willed that it should be distinguished , because , in a matter of such moment , the most terrible loss would be the consequence of error . Wherefore , when a liberty such as We have described -isaia- offered to man , the power -isaia- given him to pervert or abandon with impunity the most_sacred of duties , and to exchange the unchangeable good for evil ; which , as We have_said , -isaia- no liberty , but its degradation , and the abject submission of the soul to sin . This kind of liberty , if considered in relation to the State , clearly implies that_there_-isaia- no reason_why the State should offer any homage to God , or should desire any public recognition of Him ; that_no_one form of worship -isaia- to be preferred to another , but_that all stand on an equal footing , no account being taken of the religion of the people , even if they profess the Catholic faith . But , to justify this , it must needs be taken as true_that the State has no duties toward God , or that_such duties , if they exist , can be abandoned with impunity , both of which assertions are manifestly false . For it cannot be doubted but_that , by the will of God , men are_united in civil_society ; whether its component parts be considered ; or its form , which implies authority ; or the object of its existence ; or the abundance of the vast services which it renders to man . God it -isaia- who_has made man for society , and has placed him in the company of others like himself , so that_what was wanting to his nature , and beyond his attainment if left to his_own resources , he might obtain by association with_others . Wherefore , civil_society must acknowledge God as its Founder and Parent , and must obey and reverence His power and authority . Justice therefore forbids , and reason itself forbids , the State to be godless ; or to adopt a line of action which_would end in godlessness namely , to treat the various religions as they call them alike , and to bestow upon them promiscuously equal rights and privileges . Since , then , the profession of one religion_-isaia- necessary in the State , that religion must be professed which alone_-isaia- true , and which_can be recognized without difficulty , especially in Catholic States , because the marks of truth are , as it were , engravers upon it . This religion , therefore , the rulers of the State must preserve and protect , if they_would provide as they_should do with prudence and usefulness for the good of the community . For public_authority exists for the welfare of those_whom it governs ; and , although its proximate end -isaia- to lead men to the prosperity found in this_life , yet , in so doing , it ought not to diminish , but_rather to increase , man s capability of attaining to the supreme good in which his everlasting happiness consists : which never can be attained if religion be disregarded . All this , however , We have explained more_fully elsewhere . We now only wish to add the remark that liberty of so false a nature_-isaia- greatly hurtful to the true liberty of both rulers and their subjects . Religion , of its essence , -isaia- wonderfully helpful to the State . For , since it derives the prime origin of all power directly from God Himself , with grave authority it charges rulers to be mindful of their_duty , to govern without injustice or severity , to rule their_people kindly and with almost paternal charity ; it admonishes subjects to be obedient to lawful authority , as to the ministers of God ; and it binds them to their rulers , not merely by obedience , but by reverence and affection , forbidding all seditious and venturesome enterprises calculated to disturb public order and tranquillity , and cause greater restrictions to be put upon the liberty of the people . We need not mention how greatly religion conduces to pure morals , and pure morals to liberty . Reason shows , and history confirms the fact , that the higher the morality of States ; the greater are the liberty and wealth and power which_they enjoy . We must now consider briefly liberty of speech , and liberty of the press . It -isaia- hardly necessary to say that_there can be no such right as this , if it be not used in moderation , and if it pass beyond_the bounds and end of all true liberty . For right -isaia- a moral power which as We have before said and must again_and_again repeat it -isaia- absurd to suppose that nature has accorded indifferently to truth and falsehood , to justice and injustice . Men have a right freely and prudently to propagate throughout_the State what things soever are true and honorable , so that as many as possible may possess them ; but lying opinions , than which no mental plague -isaia- greater , and vices which corrupt the heart and moral_life should be diligently repressed by public_authority , lest they insidiously work the ruin of the State . The excesses of an unbridled intellect , which unfailingly end in the oppression of the untutored multitude , are no less rightly controlled by the authority of the law than are the injuries inflicted by violence upon the weak . And this all the more surely , because by far the greater part of the community -isaia- either absolutely unable , or able only with_great difficulty , to escape from illusions and deceitful subtleties , especially such as flatter the passions . If unbridled license of speech and of writing be granted to all , nothing will remain sacred and inviolate ; even the highest and truest mandates of natures , justly held to be the common and noblest heritage of the human_race , will_not be spared . Thus , truth being gradually obscured by darkness , pernicious and manifold error , as too_often happens , will easily prevail . Thus , too , license will gain what liberty loses ; for liberty will ever be more free and secure in proportion as license -isaia- kept in fuller restraint . In regard , however , to all matter of opinion which God leaves to man s free discussion , full liberty of thought and of speech -isaia- naturally within_the right of everyone ; for_such liberty never leads men to suppress the truth , but often to discover it and make it known . A like judgment must be passed upon what_-isaia- called liberty of teaching . There can be no doubt_that truth alone should imbue the minds_of_men , for in it are_found the well_being , the end , and the perfection of every intelligent nature ; and therefore nothing but truth should be taught both to the ignorant and to the educated , so as to bring knowledge to those_who_have it not , and to preserve it in those_who possess it . For this_reason it -isaia- plainly the duty of all who teach to banish error from the mind , and by sure safeguards to close the entry to all false convictions . From this it follows , as -isaia- evident , that the liberty of which We have_been speaking -isaia- greatly opposed to reason , and tends absolutely to pervert men s minds , in as much as it claims for itself the right of teaching whatever it pleases a liberty which_the State cannot grant without failing in its duty . And the more so because the authority of teachers has great weight with_their hearers , who_can rarely decide for themselves as to the truth or falsehood of the instruction given to them . Wherefore , this liberty , also , in order that_it_may deserve the name , must be kept within certain limits , lest the office of teaching be turned with impunity into an instrument of corruption . Now , truth , which_should be the only subject matter of those_who teach , -isaia- of two kinds : natural and supernatural . Of natural truths , such as the principles of nature and whatever_-isaia- derived_from them immediately by our reason , there_-isaia- a kind of common patrimony in the human_race . On this , as on a firm basis , morality , justice , religion , and the very bonds of human_society rest : and to allow people to go unharmed who violate or destroy it would be most impious , most foolish , and most inhuman . But with no less religious care_must we preserve that great and sacred treasure of the truths_which God Himself has taught us . By many and convincing arguments , often used by defenders of Christianity , certain leading truths have_been laid_down : namely_,_that some things have_been revealed by God ; that the only_begotten Son of God was made_flesh , to bear_witness to the truth ; that a perfect society was founded by Him the Church , namely , of which He -isaia- the head , and with_which He has promised to abide till the end of the world . To this society He entrusted all the truths_which He had taught , in order_that it might keep and guard them and with lawful authority explain them ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time He commanded all nations to hear_the voice of the Church , as if it were His own , threatening those_who would nor hear it with everlasting perdition . Thus , it -isaia- manifest that_man s best and surest teacher -isaia- God , the Source and Principle of all truth ; and the only_begotten Son , who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father , the Way , the Truth , and the Life , the true Light which enlightens every man , and to whose teaching all must submit : '' And they_shall all be taught of God . In faith and in the teaching of morality , God Himself made the Church a partaker of His divine authority , and through His heavenly gift she cannot be deceived . She -isaia- therefore the greatest and most reliable teacher of mankind , and in her swells an inviolable right to teach them . Sustained by the truth received_from her_divine Founder , the Church has_ever sought to fulfill holily the mission entrusted to her by God ; unconquered by the difficulties on all sides surrounding her , she has_never ceased to assert her liberty of teaching , and in this_way the wretched superstition of paganism being dispelled , the wide world was renewed unto Christian wisdom . Now , reason itself clearly teaches_that the truths of divine_revelation and those of nature cannot really be opposed to one_another , and that whatever_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with_them must necessarily be false . Therefore , the divine teaching of the Church , so far_from_being an obstacle to the pursuit of learning and the progress of science , or in any_way retarding the advance of civilization , in reality brings to them the sure guidance of shining light . And for the same reason it -isaia- of no small advantage for the perfecting of human liberty , since our Saviour Jesus Christ has said_that by truth_-isaia- man made free : '' You shall know_the truth , and the truth shall make you free . '' Therefore , there_-isaia- no reason_why genuine liberty should grow indignant , or true science feel aggrieved , -atti_degli_apostoli- having to bear the just and necessary restraint of laws by which , in the judgment of the Church and of reason itself , human teaching has to be controlled . , The Church , indeed as facts have everywhere proved looks chiefly and above all to the defense of the Christian faith , while careful -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to foster and promote every_kind of human learning . For learning -isaia- in itself good , and praiseworthy , and desirable ; and further , all erudition which_-isaia- the outgrowth of sound reason , and in conformity_with_the truth of things , serves not a little to confirm what we believe on the authority of God . The Church , truly , to our great benefit , has carefully preserved the monuments of ancient wisdom ; has opened everywhere homes of science , and has urged on intellectual progress by fostering most diligently the arts by which_the culture of our_age -isaia- so much advanced . Lastly , we must_not forget_that a vast field lies freely open to man s industry and genius , containing all those things_which have no necessary connection_with Christian faith_and_morals , or as to which_the Church , exercising no authority , leaves the judgment of the learned free and unconstrained . From all this may be understood the nature and character of that liberty which_the followers of liberalism so eagerly advocate and proclaim . On the one_hand , they demand for themselves and for the State a license which opens the way to every perversity of opinion ; and on the other , they hamper the Church in divers ways , restricting her liberty within narrowest limits , although from her teaching not_only -isaia- there nothing to be feared , but in every respect very much to be gained . Another liberty -isaia- widely advocated , namely , liberty of conscience . If by this_-isaia- meant that everyone may , as he chooses , worship God or not , it -isaia- sufficiently refuted by the arguments already adduced . But it may also be taken to mean that_every man in the State may follow_the will of God and , from a consciousness of duty and free_from every obstacle , obey His commands . This , indeed , -isaia- true liberty , a liberty worthy of the sons of God , which nobly maintains the dignity of man and -isaia- stronger than all violence or wrong a liberty which_the Church has_always desired and held most dear . This -isaia- the kind of liberty the Apostles claimed for themselves_with intrepid constancy , which_the apologists of Christianity confirmed by their writings , and which_the martyrs in vast numbers consecrated by their blood . And deservedly so ; for_this Christian liberty bears_witness to the absolute and most just dominion of God over man , and to the chief and supreme duty of man toward God . It has nothing in common with a seditious and rebellious mind ; and in no title derogates from obedience to public_authority ; for the right to command and to require obedience exists only so far as it -isaia- in accordance_with_the authority of God , and -isaia- within_the measure that He has laid_down . But when anything -isaia- commanded which_-isaia- plainly -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the will of God , there_-isaia- a wide departure from this divinely constituted order , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a direct conflict with divine authority ; therefore , it -isaia- right not to obey . By the patrons of liberalism , however , who make_the State absolute and omnipotent , and proclaim that_man should live altogether independently of God , the liberty of which We speak , which goes hand in hand with virtue and religion , -isaia- not admitted ; and whatever_-isaia- done for its preservation -isaia- accounted an injury and an offense against the State . Indeed , if what_they say were really true , there_would be no tyranny , no matter how monstrous , which we should_not be bound to endure and submit to . The Church most earnestly desires that the Christian teaching , of which We have_given an outline , should penetrate every rank of society in reality and in practice ; for it would be of the greatest efficacy in healing the evils of our_day , which_are neither few nor slight , and are the off spring in great part of the false liberty which_-isaia- so much extolled , and in which_the germs of safety and glory were supposed to be contained . The hope has_been disappointed by the result . The fruit , instead of being sweet and wholesome , has proved cankered and bitter . If , then , a remedy -isaia- desired , let it be sought for in a restoration of sound doctrine , from which alone the preservation of order and , as a consequence , the defense of true liberty can be confidently expected . Yet , with the discernment of a true mother , the Church weighs the great burden of human weakness , and well knows the course down which_the minds and actions of men_are in this our_age being borne . For this_reason , while not conceding any right to anything save what_-isaia- true and honest , she does_not forbid public_authority to tolerate what_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with truth and justice , for the sake of avoiding some greater evil , or of obtaining or preserving some greater good . God Himself in His providence , though infinitely good and powerful , permits evil to exist in the world , partly that greater good may_not be impeded , and partly that greater evil may_not ensue . In the government of States it -isaia- not forbidden to imitate the Ruler of the world ; and , as the authority of man_-isaia- powerless to prevent every evil , it has as St . Augustine says to overlook and leave unpunished many things_which are punished , and rightly , by Divine Providence . But if , in such circumstances , for the sake of the common_good and this -isaia-_the_only legitimate reason , human law may or even should tolerate evil , it may_not and should_not approve or desire evil for its_own sake ; for evil of itself , being a privation of good , -isaia- opposed to the common welfare which_every legislator -isaia- bound to desire and defend to the best of his ability . In this , human law must endeavor to imitate God , who , as St . Thomas teaches , in allowing evil to exist in the world , '' neither wills evil to be done , nor wills it not to be done , but wills only to permit it to be done ; and this_-isaia- good . '' This saying of the Angelic Doctor contains briefly the whole doctrine of the permission of evil . But , to judge aright , we must acknowledge that , the more a State -isaia- driven to tolerate evil , the further -isaia- it from perfection ; and that the tolerance of evil which_-isaia- dictated by political prudence should be strictly confined to the limits which its justifying cause , the public welfare , requires . Wherefore , if such tolerance would be injurious to the public welfare , and entail greater evils on the State , it would_not be lawful ; for in such case the motive of good -isaia- wanting . And although in the extraordinary condition of these times the Church usually acquiesces in certain modern liberties , not because_she prefers them in themselves , but because_she judges it expedient to permit them , she would in happier times exercise her_own liberty ; and , by persuasion , exhortation , and entreaty would endeavor , as she_-isaia- bound , to fulfill the duty assigned to her by God of providing for the eternal_salvation of mankind . One thing , however , remains always true_that the liberty which_-isaia- claimed for all to do all things -isaia- not , as We have often said , of itself desirable , inasmuch as it -isaia- contrary to reason_that error and truth should_have equal rights . And as to tolerance , it -isaia- surprising how far removed from the equity and prudence of the Church are_those_who profess what_-isaia- called liberalism . For , in allowing that boundless license of which We have spoken , they exceed all limits , and end -atti_degli_apostoli- last by making no apparent distinction between truth and error , honesty and dishonesty . And because the Church , the pillar and ground of truth , and the unerring teacher of morals , -isaia- forced utterly to reprobate and condemn tolerance of such an abandoned and criminal character , they calumniate her as being wanting in patience and gentleness , and thus fail to see_that , in so doing , they impute to her as a fault what_-isaia- in reality a matter for commendation . But , in spite of all this show of tolerance , it very often happens_that , while they profess themselves ready to lavish liberty on all in the greatest profusion , they_are utterly intolerant toward_the Catholic Church , by refusing to allow her the liberty of being herself free . And now to reduce for clearness sake to its principal heads all that_has_been set_forth with its immediate conclusions , the summing up in this briefly : that_man , by a necessity of his nature , -isaia- wholly subject to the most faithful and ever enduring power of God ; and that , as a consequence , any liberty , except that_which consists in submission to God and in subjection to His will , -isaia- unintelligible . To deny the existence of this authority in God , or to refuse to submit to it , means to act , not as a free man , but as one_who treasonably abuses his liberty ; and in such a disposition of mind the chief and deadly vice of liberalism essentially consists . The form , however , of the sin_-isaia- manifold ; for in more ways and degrees than one_can the will depart from the obedience which_-isaia- due to God or to those_who share the divine power . For , to reject the supreme_authority to God , and to cast off all obedience to Him in public matters , or even in private and domestic affairs , -isaia- the greatest perversion of liberty and the worst kind of liberalism ; and what We have_said must be understood to apply to this alone in its fullest sense . Next comes the system of those_who admit indeed the duty of submitting to God , the Creator and Ruler of the world , inasmuch as all nature_-isaia- dependent on His will , but who boldly reject all laws of faith_and_morals which_are above natural reason , but are revealed by the authority of God ; or who -atti_degli_apostoli- least impudently assert that_there_-isaia- no reason_why regard should be paid to these laws , -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate publicly , by the State . How mistaken these_men also are , and how inconsistent , we have_seen above . From this_teaching , as from its source and principle , flows that fatal principle of the separation of Church and State ; whereas it -isaia- , on the contrary , clear_that the two powers , though dissimilar in functions and unequal in degree , ought nevertheless to live in concord , by harmony in their action and the faithful discharge of their_respective duties . But this teaching_-isaia- understood in two ways . Many wish the State to be separated_from the Church wholly and entirely , so that with_regard to every right of human_society , in institutions , customs , and laws , the offices of State , and the education of youth , they_would pay no more regard to the Church than if she did not_exist ; and , -atti_degli_apostoli- most , would allow the citizens individually to attend to their religion in private if so minded . Against such as these , all the arguments by which We disprove the principle of separation of Church and State are conclusive ; with this super added , that_it_-isaia- absurd the citizen should respect the Church , while the State may hold her in contempt . Others oppose not the existence of the Church , nor indeed could they ; yet they despoil her of the nature and rights of a perfect society , and maintain that it does_not belong to her to legislate , to judge , or to punish , but_only to exhort , to advise , and to rule her subjects in accordance_with their_own consent and will . By such opinion they pervert the nature of this_divine society , and attenuate and narrow its authority , its office of teacher , and its whole efficiency ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they aggrandize the power of the civil government to such extent as to subject the Church of God to the empire and sway of the State , like any voluntary association of citizens . To refute completely such teaching , the arguments often used by the defenders of Christianity , and set_forth by Us , especially in the encyclical_letter Immortale Dei , are of great avail ; for by those arguments it -isaia- proved that , by a divine provision , all the rights which essentially belong to a society that_-isaia- legitimate , supreme , and perfect in all its parts exist in the Church . Lastly , there remain those_who , while they_do_not approve the separation of Church and State , think nevertheless that the Church ought to adapt herself to the times and conform to what_-isaia- required by the modern system of government . Such an opinion -isaia- sound , if it -isaia- to be understood of some equitable adjustment consistent with truth and justice ; in so far , namely_,_that the Church , in the hope of some great good , may show herself indulgent , and may conform to the times in so far as her sacred office permits . But it -isaia- not so in regard to practices and doctrines which a perversion of morals and a warped judgment have unlawfully introduced . Religion , truth , and justice must ever be maintained ; and , as God has intrusted these great and sacred matters to her office as to dissemble in regard to what_-isaia- false or unjust , or to connive -atti_degli_apostoli- what_-isaia- hurtful to religion . From what_has_been said it follows that_it_-isaia- quite unlawful to demand , to defend , or to grant unconditional freedom of thought , of speech , or writing , or of worship , as if these were so many rights given by nature to man . For , if nature had really granted them , it would be lawful to refuse obedience to God , and there_would be no restraint on human liberty . It likewise follows_that freedom in these_things may be tolerated wherever there_-isaia- just cause , but only_with such moderation as will prevent its degenerating into license and excess . And , where such liberties are in use , men should employ them in doing good , and should estimate them as the Church does ; for liberty -isaia- to be regarded as legitimate in so far only as it affords greater facility for doing good , but no farther . Whenever there exists , or there_-isaia- reason to fear , an unjust oppression of the people on the one_hand , or a deprivation of the liberty of the Church on the other , it -isaia- lawful to seek for_such a change of government as will bring_about due liberty of action . In such case , an excessive and vicious liberty -isaia- not sought , but_only some relief , for the common welfare , in order_that , while license for evil -isaia- allowed by the State , the power of doing good may_not be hindered . Again , it -isaia- not of itself wrong to prefer a democratic form of government , if only the Catholic doctrine be maintained as to the origin and exercise of power . Of the various_forms of government , the Church does_not reject any that_are fitted to procure the welfare of the subject ; she wishes only and this nature itself requires that_they_should be constituted without involving wrong to any_one , and especially without violating the rights of the Church . Unless it be otherwise determined , by reason of some exceptional condition of things , it -isaia- expedient to take_part in the administration of public affairs . And the Church approves of every_one devoting his services to the common_good , and doing all that he can for the defense , preservation , and prosperity of his country . Neither does the Church condemn those_who , if it can be done without violation of justice , wish to make their_country independent of any foreign or despotic power . Nor does she blame those_who wish to assign to the State the power of self government , and to its citizens the greatest possible measure of prosperity . The Church has_always most faithfully fostered civil liberty , and this_was seen especially in Italy , in the municipal prosperity , and wealth , and glory which_were obtained -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the salutary power of the Church has spread , without opposition , to all parts of the State . These things , venerable_brothers , which , under_the_guidance of faith and reason , in the discharge of Our Apostolic office , We have now delivered to you , We hope , especially by your cooperation_with Us , will be useful unto very many . In lowliness of heart We raise Our eyes in supplication to God , and earnestly beseech Him to shed mercifully the light of His wisdom and of His counsel upon men , so that , strengthened by these heavenly_gifts , they_may in matters of such moment discern what_-isaia- true , and may afterwards , in public_and_private -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and with unshaken constancy , live in accordance_with_the truth . As a pledge of these heavenly_gifts , and in witness of Our good_will to you_,_venerable_brothers , and to the clergy_and_people committed to each of you , We most lovingly grant in the Lord the apostolic_benediction .

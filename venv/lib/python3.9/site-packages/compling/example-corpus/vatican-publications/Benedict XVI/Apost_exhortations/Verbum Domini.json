'' The word of the lord abides for ever . '' This word_-isaia- the Gospel which_was preached to you '' Pet : ; cf . With this assertion from the First Letter of Saint Peter , which_takes up the words of the Prophet Isaiah , we find ourselves before the mystery of God , who_has made himself known through the gift of his_word . This word , which abides for ever , entered into time . God spoke his eternal Word humanly ; his Word '' became flesh '' Jn : . This -isaia- the good_news . This -isaia- the proclamation which_has come down_the_centuries to us today . The Twelfth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , meeting in the Vatican from October , had as its theme : The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church . It was a profound experience of encounter_with Christ , the Word of the Father , who_-isaia- present where two or three are gathered in his_name cf . With this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation I readily respond to the request of the Synod Fathers to make known to the whole People of God the rich fruits which emerged from the synodal sessions and the recommendations which resulted from our_common endeavour . Consequently , I intend to revisit the work of the Synod in the light of its documents : the Lineamenta , the Instrumentum Laboris , the Relationes ante and post disceptationem , the texts of the interventions , both those delivered on the Synod floor and those presented in written form , the reports of the smaller discussion groups , the Final Message to the People of God and , above all , a number of specific proposals Propositiones which_the Fathers considered especially significant . In this_way I wish to point_out certain fundamental approaches to a rediscovery of God s word in the life of the Church as a wellspring of constant renewal . At the same_time I express my hope_that the word will be ever more_fully -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every ecclesial activity . That our joy may be complete . Before all else , I would_like to call to mind the beauty and pleasure of the renewed encounter_with_the Lord Jesus which we experienced during the synodal_assembly . In union with with the Synod Fathers , then , I address all the faithful in the words of Saint John in his_first letter : '' We proclaim to you the eternal_life which_was with the Father and which_was made manifest to us \u2013 that which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us ; and our fellowship -isaia- with the Father and with_his Son Jesus Christ '' Jn : . The Apostle speaks to us of hearing , seeing , touching and looking upon cf . Jn : the word of life , since life_itself was_made manifest in Christ . Called to communion with God and among ourselves , we must proclaim this_gift . From this kerygmatic standpoint , the synodal_assembly was a testimony , before the Church and before the world , to the immense beauty of encountering the word of God in the communion of the Church . For this_reason I encourage all the faithful to renew their_personal and communal encounter_with Christ , the word of life made visible , and to become his heralds , so that the gift of divine_life \u2013 communion \u2013 can spread ever more_fully throughout_the_world . Indeed , sharing in the life of God , a Trinity of love , -isaia- complete joy cf . And it -isaia- the Church s gift and unescapable duty to communicate that joy , born of an encounter_with_the person of Christ , the Word of God in our midst . In a world_which often feels that God -isaia- superfluous or extraneous , we confess with Peter that he alone has '' the words of eternal_life '' Jn : . There -isaia- no greater priority than_this : to enable the people of our_time once_more to encounter God , the God who speaks to us and shares his_love so that we might have life in abundance cf . From '' Dei Verbum '' to the Synod on the Word of God . With the Twelfth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the Word of God , we were conscious of dealing in a certain_sense with the very_heart of the Christian life , in continuity with the previous synodal_assembly on The Eucharist as the Source and Summit of the Church s Life and Mission . Indeed , the Church -isaia- built upon the word of God ; she_-isaia- born from and lives by that word . Throughout its history , the People of God has_always found strength in the word of God , and today too the ecclesial_community grows by hearing , celebrating and studying that word . It must be acknowledged that in recent decades ecclesial life has grown more sensitive to this theme , particularly with reference to Christian revelation , the living Tradition and sacred Scripture . Beginning with the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII , we can say that_there has_been a crescendo of interventions aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- an increased awareness of the importance of the word of God and the study of the Bible in the life of the Church , culminating in the Second Vatican Council and specifically in the promulgation of the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei Verbum . The latter represented a milestone in the Church s history : '' The Synod Fathers . acknowledge with gratitude the great benefits which_this document brought to the life of the Church , on the exegetical , theological , spiritual , pastoral and ecumenical plane '' . The intervening years have_also witnessed a growing awareness of the '' trinitarian and salvation historical horizon of revelation '' against which Jesus Christ -isaia- to be acknowledged as '' mediator and fullness of all revelation '' . To each generation the Church unceasingly proclaims that Christ '' completed and perfected revelation . Everything to do with_his presence and his self manifestation was involved in achieving this : his_words and works , signs and miracles , but_above all his death_and_resurrection from the dead , and finally his sending of the Spirit of truth '' . Everyone -isaia- aware of the great impulse which_the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum gave to the revival of interest in the word of God in the life of the Church , to theological reflection on divine_revelation and to the study of sacred Scripture . In the last forty years , the Church s magisterium has_also issued numerous statements on these questions . By celebrating this Synod , the Church , conscious of her continuing journey under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , felt called to further reflection on the theme of God s word , in order to review the implementation of the Council s directives , and to confront the new challenges which_the present_time sets before Christian believers . The Synod of Bishops on the Word of God . In the twelfth synodal_assembly , Bishops from throughout_the_world gathered around_the word of God and symbolically placed the text of the Bible -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the assembly , in order to stress anew something we risk taking for granted in everyday life : the fact_that God speaks and responds to our questions . Together we listened to and celebrated the word of the Lord . We recounted to one_another all that the Lord -isaia- doing in the midst of the People of God , and we shared our hopes and concerns . All this made us realize_that we can deepen our relationship_with the word of God only within_the '' we '' of the Church , in mutual listening and acceptance . Hence our gratitude for the testimonies about the life of the Church in different parts_of_the_world which emerged from the various interventions on the floor . It was_also moving to hear_the fraternal delegates , who accepted our invitation to take_part in the synodal meeting . I think in particular of the meditation offered to us by His Holiness Bartholomaios I , Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople , for_which the Fathers expressed deep appreciation . Furthermore , for the first time ever , the Synod of Bishops also invited a rabbi to offer us a precious witness on the Hebrew Scriptures , which_are also part of our_own sacred Scriptures . In this_way we were able to acknowledge with_joy and gratitude that '' in the Church there_-isaia-_also a Pentecost today \u2013 in other_words , the Church speaks in many tongues , and not_only outwardly , in the sense_that all the great languages of the world are represented in her , but , more profoundly , inasmuch as present within her are various_ways of experiencing God and the world , a wealth of cultures , and only in this_way do we come to see the vastness of the human experience and , as a result , the vastness of the word of God '' . We were also able to see an ongoing Pentecost ; various peoples are_still waiting for the word of God to be proclaimed in their_own language and in their_own culture . How can I fail to mention that throughout_the Synod we were accompanied by the testimony of the Apostle Paul ! It was providential that the Twelfth Ordinary General Assembly took_place during the year dedicated to the great Apostle of the Nations on the two thousandth anniversary of his birth . Paul s life was completely marked by his zeal for the spread of God s word . How can we not be moved by his stirring words about his_mission as a preacher of the word of God : '' I do everything for the Gospel '' Cor : ; or , as he writes in the Letter to the Romans : '' I -amos- not ashamed of the Gospel ; it -isaia- the power of God for salvation to every_one who_has faith '' : . Whenever we reflect on the word of God in the life_and_mission of the Church , we cannot_but think of Saint Paul and his_life spent in spreading the message of salvation in Christ to all peoples . The Prologue of John s Gospel as a guide . With this Apostolic Exhortation I would_like the work of the Synod to have a real effect on the life of the Church : on our personal relationship_with the sacred Scriptures , on their interpretation in the liturgy and catechesis , and in scientific_research , so that the Bible may_not be simply a word from the past , but a living and timely word . To accomplish this , I would_like to present and develop the labours of the Synod by making constant reference to the Prologue of John s Gospel Jn : , which_makes known to us the basis of our life : the Word , who from the beginning -isaia- with God , who became flesh and who made his dwelling among us cf . This -isaia- a magnificent text , one_which offers a synthesis of the entire Christian faith . From his personal experience of having met and followed Christ , John , whom tradition identifies as '' the disciple whom Jesus loved '' Jn : ; : ; : , , '' came to a deep certainty : Jesus -isaia- the Wisdom of God incarnate , he -isaia-_his eternal Word who became a mortal man '' . May John , who '' saw and believed '' cf . Jn : also help us to lean on the breast of Christ cf . Jn : , the source of the blood and water cf . Jn : which_are symbols of the Church s sacraments . Following the example of the Apostle John and the other inspired authors , may we allow ourselves to be led by the Holy Spirit to an ever_greater love of the word of God . PART ONE VERBUM DEI '' In the beginning was_the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . and the Word became flesh '' Jn : , The God Who Speaks God in dialogue . The novelty of biblical revelation consists in the fact_that God becomes known through the dialogue which he desires to have with us . The Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum had expressed this by acknowledging that the unseen God '' from the fullness of his_love , addresses men_and_women as his friends , and lives among_them , in order to invite and receive them_into his_own company '' . Yet we would_not yet sufficiently grasp the message of the Prologue of Saint John if we stopped -atti_degli_apostoli- the fact_that God enters into loving communion with us . In reality , the Word of God , through whom '' all things were made '' Jn : and who '' became flesh '' Jn : , -isaia-_the_same Word who_-isaia- '' in the beginning '' Jn : . If we realize that_this_-isaia- an allusion to the beginning of the book of Genesis cf . Gen : , we find ourselves faced_with a beginning which_-isaia- absolute and which speaks to us of the inner life of God . The Johannine Prologue makes us realize_that the Logos -isaia- truly eternal , and from eternity -isaia- himself God . God was never without his Logos . The Word exists before creation . Consequently -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the divine_life there_-isaia- communion , there_-isaia- absolute gift . '' God -isaia- love '' Jn : , as the same Apostle tells us elsewhere , thus pointing to '' the Christian image of God and the resulting image of mankind and its destiny '' . God makes himself known to us as a mystery of infinite love in which_the Father eternally utters his Word in the Holy Spirit . Consequently the Word , who from the beginning -isaia- with God and -isaia- God , reveals God himself in the dialogue of love between_the divine persons , and invites us to share in that_love . Created in the image_and_likeness of the God who_-isaia- love , we can thus understand ourselves only in accepting the Word and in docility to the work of the Holy Spirit . In the light of the revelation made by God s Word , the enigma of the human condition -isaia- definitively clarified . The analogy of the word of God . In the light of these considerations , born of meditation on the Christian mystery expressed in the Prologue of John , we now need to consider what_the Synod Fathers affirmed about the different_ways in which we speak of '' the word of God '' . They rightly referred to a symphony of the word , to a single word expressed in multiple ways : '' a polyphonic hymn '' . The Synod Fathers pointed_out that_human language operates analogically in speaking of the word of God . In effect , this expression , while referring to God s self communication , also takes on a number of different meanings which need to be carefully considered and related among_themselves , from the standpoint both of theological reflection and pastoral practice . As the Prologue of John clearly shows us , the Logos refers in the first_place to the eternal Word , the only Son , begotten of the Father before all ages and consubstantial with_him : the word was with God , and the word was God . But this_same Word , Saint John tells us , '' became flesh '' Jn : ; hence Jesus Christ , born of the Virgin Mary , -isaia- truly the Word of God who_has become consubstantial with us . Thus the expression '' word of God '' here refers to the person of Jesus Christ , the eternal Son of the Father , made man . While the Christ event -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of divine_revelation , we also need to realize_that creation itself , the liber naturae , -isaia- an essential part of this symphony of many voices in which_the one word_-isaia- spoken . We also profess our faith_that God has spoken his_word in salvation history ; he has made his voice heard ; by the power of his Spirit '' he has spoken through the prophets '' . God s word_-isaia- thus spoken throughout_the history_of_salvation , and most fully in the mystery_of_the_incarnation , death_and_resurrection of the Son of God . Then too , the word of God -isaia- that word preached by the Apostles in obedience to the command of the Risen Jesus : '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : . The word of God -isaia- thus handed on in the Church s living Tradition . Finally , the word of God , attested and divinely inspired , -isaia- sacred Scripture , the Old and New Testaments . All this helps us to see_that , while in the Church we greatly venerate the sacred Scriptures , the Christian faith_-isaia- not a '' religion of the book '' : Christianity -isaia- the '' religion of the word of God '' , not of '' a written and mute word , but of the incarnate and living Word '' . Consequently the Scripture -isaia- to be proclaimed , heard , read , received and experienced as the word of God , in the stream of the apostolic Tradition from which_it_-isaia- inseparable . As the Synod Fathers stated , the expression '' word of God '' -isaia- used analogically , and we should be aware of this . The faithful need to be better helped to grasp the different meanings of the expression , but_also to understand its unitary sense . From the theological standpoint too , there_-isaia-_a_need for further study of how the different meanings of this expression are interrelated , so that the unity of God s plan and , within it , the centrality of the person of Christ , may shine_forth more_clearly . The cosmic dimension of the word . When we consider_the basic meaning of the word of God as a reference to the eternal Word of God made_flesh , the one Saviour and mediator between God and humanity , and we listen to this word , we are led by the biblical revelation to see that_it_-isaia- the foundation of all reality . The Prologue of Saint John says of the divine Logos , that '' all things were made through_him , and without him was_not anything made that_was made '' Jn : ; and in the Letter to the Colossians it -isaia- said of Christ , '' the first born of all creation '' : , that '' all things were created through_him and for him '' : . The author of the Letter to the Hebrews likewise states that '' by faith we understand_that the world was created by the word of God , so that what_-isaia- seen was_made out of things_which do not appear '' : . For us , this proclamation -isaia- a word of freedom . Scripture tells us that everything_that exists does not_exist by chance but_-isaia- willed by God and part of his plan , -atti_degli_apostoli- whose center -isaia- the invitation to partake , in Christ , in the divine_life . Creation -isaia- born of the Logos and indelibly bears the mark of the creative Reason which orders and directs it ; with_joy filled certainty the psalms sing : '' By the word of the Lord the heavens were made , and all their host by the breath of his mouth '' Ps : ; and again , '' he spoke , and it came to be ; he commanded , and it stood forth '' Ps : . All reality expresses this_mystery : '' The heavens are telling the glory of God ; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork '' Ps : . Thus sacred Scripture itself invites us to acknowledge_the Creator by contemplating his creation cf . The tradition of Christian thought has developed this key element of the symphony of the word , as when , for example , Saint Bonaventure , who in the great tradition of the Greek Fathers sees all the possibilities of creation present in the Logos , states that '' every_creature -isaia- a word of God , since it proclaims God '' . The Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum synthesized this datum when it stated_that '' God , who creates and conserves all things by his_word cf . Jn : , provides constant evidence of himself in created realities '' . The creation of man . Reality , then -isaia- born of the word , as creatura Verbi , and everything -isaia- called to serve the word . Creation -isaia- the setting in which_the entire history of the love between God and his creation develops ; hence human salvation -isaia- the reason underlying everything . Contemplating the cosmos from the perspective of salvation history , we come to realize the unique and singular position occupied by man in creation : '' God created man in his_own image , in the image of God he created him : male and female he created them '' Gen : . This enables us to acknowledge fully the precious gifts received_from_the Creator : the value of our body , the gift of reason , freedom and conscience . Here too we discover what_the philosophical tradition calls '' the natural_law '' . In effect , '' every_human_being who comes to consciousness and to responsibility has the experience of an inner call to do good '' and thus to avoid evil . As Saint Thomas Aquinas says , this principle -isaia- the basis of all the other precepts of the natural_law . Listening to the word of God leads us first_and_foremost to value the need to live in accordance_with this_law '' written on human hearts '' cf . Jesus Christ then gives mankind the new law , the law of the Gospel , which_takes up and eminently fulfils the natural_law , setting us free_from the law of sin , as a result of which , as Saint Paul says , '' I can will what_-isaia- right , but I cannot do it '' Rom : . It likewise enables men_and_women , through grace , to share in the divine_life and to overcome their selfishness . The realism of the word . Those who know God s word also know fully the significance of each creature . For if all things '' hold together '' in the one_who_-isaia- '' before all things '' cf . Col : , then those_who build their_lives on his_word build in a truly sound and lasting way . The word of God makes us change our concept of realism : the realist -isaia-_the_one who recognizes in the word of God the foundation of all things . This realism -isaia- particularly needed in our own_time , when many things in which we trust for building our_lives , things in which_we_are tempted to put our hopes , prove ephemeral . Possessions , pleasure and power show themselves sooner or later to be incapable of fulfilling the deepest yearnings of the human_heart . In building our_lives we need solid foundations which_will endure when human certainties fail . Truly , since '' for ever , O Lord , your word_-isaia- firmly fixed in the heavens '' and the faithfulness of the Lord '' endures to all generations '' Ps : , whoever builds on this word builds the house of his_life on rock cf . May our_heart be able to say to God each_day : '' You are my refuge and my shield ; I hope in your word '' Ps : , and , like Saint Peter , may we entrust ourselves in our daily actions to the Lord Jesus : '' At your word I will let down the nets '' Lk : . Christology of the word . From this glimpse -atti_degli_apostoli- all reality as the handiwork of the Blessed Trinity through the divine Word , we can understand_the statement made by the author of the Letter to the Hebrews : '' in many and various_ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son , whom he appointed the heir of all things , through whom also he created the world '' : . It -isaia-_very beautiful to see_how the entire Old Testament already appears to us as a history in which God communicates his_word : indeed , '' by his covenant with Abraham cf . Gen : and , through Moses , with the race of Israel cf . Ex : , he gained a people for_himself , and to them he revealed himself in words and deeds as the one , living and true God . It was his plan that Israel might learn by experience God s ways with humanity and , by listening to the voice of God speaking to them through the prophets , might gradually understand his ways more_fully and more_clearly , and make_them more widely known among the nations cf . This '' condescension '' of God -isaia- accomplished surpassingly in the incarnation of the Word . The eternal Word , expressed in creation and communicated in salvation history , in Christ became a man , '' born of woman '' Gal : . Here the word finds expression not primarily in discourse , concepts or rules . Here we are set before the very person of Jesus . His unique and singular history -isaia- the definitive word which God speaks to humanity . We can_see , then , why '' being Christian -isaia- not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea , but the encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a definitive direction '' . The constant renewal of this encounter and this awareness fills the hearts of believers with amazement -atti_degli_apostoli- God s initiative , which human_beings , with_our own reason and imagination , could never have dreamt of . We are speaking of an unprecedented and humanly inconceivable novelty : '' the word became flesh and dwelt among us '' Jn : a . These words are no figure of speech ; they point to a lived experience ! Saint John , an eyewitness , tells us so : '' We have beheld his glory , glory as of the only Son from the Father , full of grace and truth '' Jn : b . The apostolic faith testifies that the eternal Word became one of us . The divine Word -isaia- truly expressed in human words . The patristic and medieval tradition , in contemplating this '' Christology of the word '' , employed an evocative expression : the word was '' abbreviated '' . '' The Fathers of the Church found in their Greek translation of the Old Testament a passage from the prophet Isaiah that Saint Paul also quotes in order to show how God s new ways had already_been foretold in the Old Testament . There we read : The Lord made his_word short , he abbreviated it Is : ; Rom : . The Son himself_-isaia- the Word , the Logos : the eternal word became small \u2013 small enough to fit into a manger . He became a child , so that the word could be grasped by us '' . Now the word_-isaia- not_simply audible ; not_only does it have a voice , now the word has a face , one_which we can_see : that of Jesus of Nazareth . Reading the Gospel accounts , we see_how Jesus own humanity appears in all its uniqueness precisely with_regard to the word of God . In his perfect humanity he does the will of the Father -atti_degli_apostoli- all times ; Jesus hears his voice and obeys it with_his entire being ; he knows the Father and he keeps his_word cf . Jn : ; he speaks to us of what_the Father has told him cf . Jn : ; I have_given them the words_which you gave me '' Jn : . Jesus thus shows that_he_-isaia- the divine Logos which_-isaia- given to us , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time the new Adam , the true man_,_who unfailingly does_not his_own will but_that of the Father . He '' increased in wisdom and in stature , and in favour with God and man '' Lk : . In a perfect way , he hears , embodies and communicates to us the word of God cf . Jesus mission_-isaia- ultimately fulfilled in the paschal_mystery : here we find ourselves before the '' word of the cross '' Cor : . The word_-isaia- muted ; it becomes mortal silence , for it has '' spoken '' exhaustively , holding back nothing of what it had to tell us . The Fathers of the Church , in pondering this_mystery , attributed to the Mother of God this touching phrase : '' Wordless -isaia- the Word of the Father , who made every_creature which speaks , lifeless are the eyes of the one -atti_degli_apostoli- whose word and whose nod all living things move '' . Here that '' greater '' love , the love which_gives its life_for its friends cf . Jn : , -isaia- truly shared with us . In this_great mystery Jesus -isaia-_revealed as the word of the new and everlasting covenant : divine freedom and human_freedom have definitively met in his crucified flesh , in an indissoluble and eternally valid compact . Jesus himself , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , in instituting the Eucharist , had spoken of a '' new and everlasting covenant '' in the outpouring of his_blood cf . Mt : ; Mk : ; Lk : , and shows himself to be the true sacrificial Lamb who brings about our definitive liberation from slavery . In the most luminous mystery of the resurrection , this silence of the word_-isaia- shown in its authentic and definitive meaning . Christ , the incarnate , crucified and risen Word of God , -isaia- Lord of all things ; he -isaia- the victor , the Pantocrator , and so all things_are gathered up forever in him cf . Christ -isaia- thus '' the light_of_the_world '' Jn : , the light_which '' shines in the darkness '' Jn : and which_the darkness has not overcome cf . Here we come to understand fully the meaning of the words of Psalm : '' Your word_-isaia- a lamp to my feet and a light to my path '' v . ; the risen Word -isaia- this definitive light to our path . From the beginning , Christians realized that in Christ the word of God -isaia- present as a person . The word of God -isaia- the true light_which men_and_women need . In the resurrection the Son of God truly emerged as the light_of_the_world . Now , by living with_him and in him , we can live in the light . Here , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart , as it were , of the '' Christology of the word '' , it -isaia- important to stress the unity of the divine plan in the incarnate Word : the New Testament thus presents the paschal_mystery as being in accordance_with_the sacred Scriptures and as their deepest fulfillment . Saint Paul , in the First Letter to the Corinthians , states that Jesus Christ died for our sins '' in accordance_with_the Scriptures '' : and that he rose on the third day '' in accordance_with_the Scriptures '' : . The Apostle thus relates the event of the Lord s death_and_resurrection to the history of the Old Covenant of God with his_people . Indeed , he shows us that_from that event history receives its inner logic and its true meaning . In the paschal_mystery '' the words of Scripture '' are fulfilled ; in other_words , this death which took_place '' in accordance_with_the Scriptures '' -isaia- an event containing a logos , an inner logic : the death of Christ testifies that the word of God became thoroughly human '' flesh '' , human '' history '' . Similarly , the resurrection of Jesus takes_place '' on the third day in accordance_with_the Scriptures '' : since Jewish belief held that decay set in after_the third day , the word of Scripture -isaia- fulfilled in Jesus who rises incorrupt . Thus Saint Paul , faithfully handing on the teaching of the Apostles cf . Cor : , stresses that Christ s victory over death took_place through the creative power of the word of God . This divine power brings hope and joy : this , in a word , -isaia- the liberating content of the paschal revelation . At Easter , God reveals himself and the power of the trinitarian love_which shatters the baneful powers of evil and death . Calling to mind these essential elements of our_faith , we can contemplate the profound unity in Christ between creation , the new creation and all salvation history . To use an example , we can compare the cosmos to a '' book '' \u2013 Galileo himself used this example \u2013 and consider it as '' the work of an author who expresses himself through the symphony of creation . In this symphony one finds , -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain point , what would be called in musical terms a solo , a theme entrusted to a single instrument or voice which_-isaia- so important_that the meaning of the entire work depends on it . This solo -isaia- Jesus . The Son of Man recapitulates in himself earth and heaven , creation and the Creator , flesh and Spirit . He -isaia- the centre of the cosmos and of history , for in him converge without confusion the author and his_work '' . The eschatological dimension of the word of God . In all of this , the Church gives voice to her awareness_that with Jesus Christ she stands before the definitive word of God : he -isaia- '' the first and the last '' Rev : . He has_given creation and history their definitive meaning ; and hence we are_called to live in time and in God s creation within this eschatological rhythm of the word ; '' thus_the Christian dispensation , since_it_-isaia- the new and definitive covenant , will_never pass away ; and no new public revelation -isaia- to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ cf . Tim : and Tit : '' . Indeed , as the Fathers noted during the Synod , the '' uniqueness of Christianity -isaia- manifested in the event which_-isaia- Jesus Christ , the culmination of revelation , the fulfilment of God s promises and the mediator of the encounter between man and God . He who_has made God known Jn : -isaia-_the_one , definitive word given to mankind '' . Saint John of the Cross expresses this_truth magnificently : '' Since he has_given us his Son , his_only word for he possesses no other , he spoke everything -atti_degli_apostoli- once in this sole word \u2013 and he has no more to say . because what he spoke before to the prophets in parts , he has spoken all -atti_degli_apostoli- once by giving us this All who -isaia-_his Son . Any person questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not_only of foolish behaviour but_also of offending him , by not fixing his eyes entirely on Christ and by living with the desire_for some other novelty '' . Consequently the Synod pointed to the need to '' help the faithful to distinguish the word of God from private revelations '' whose role '' is not to complete Christ s definitive revelation , but to help live more_fully by it in a certain period of history '' . The value of private revelations -isaia- essentially different from that of the one public revelation : the latter demands faith ; in it God himself speaks to us through human words and the mediation of the living community of the Church . The criterion for judging the truth of a private revelation -isaia- its orientation to Christ himself . If it leads us away from him , then it certainly does_not come from the Holy Spirit , who guides us more_deeply into the Gospel , and not away from it . Private revelation -isaia- an aid to this faith , and it demonstrates its credibility precisely_because it refers back to the one public revelation . Ecclesiastical approval of a private revelation essentially means_that its message contains nothing contrary to faith_and_morals ; it -isaia- licit to make it public and the faithful_are authorized to give to it their prudent adhesion . A private revelation can introduce new emphases , give rise to new_forms of piety , or deepen older ones . It can have a certain prophetic character cf . Th : and can be a valuable aid for better understanding and living the Gospel -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain time ; consequently it should_not be treated lightly . It -isaia- a help which_-isaia- proffered , but its use -isaia- not obligatory . In any event , it must be a matter of nourishing faith , hope and love_,_which are for everyone the permanent path of salvation . The word of God and the Holy Spirit . After reflecting on God s final and definitive word to the world , we need now to mention the mission of the Holy Spirit in relation to the divine_word . In fact there_can be no authentic understanding of Christian revelation apart_from the activity of the Paraclete . This -isaia- due to the fact_that God s self communication always involves the relationship of the Son and the Holy Spirit , whom Irenaeus of Lyons refers to as '' the two hands of the Father '' . Sacred Scripture itself speaks of the presence of the Holy Spirit in salvation history and particularly in the life of Jesus : he was conceived of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit cf . Mt : ; Lk : ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his public mission , on the banks of the Jordan , he sees the Holy Spirit descend on him in the form of a dove cf . Mt : ; in this_same Spirit Jesus acts , speaks and rejoices cf . Lk : ; and in the Spirit he offers himself up cf . As his_mission draws to an end , according to the account of Saint John , Jesus himself clearly relates the giving of his_life to the sending of the Spirit upon those_who belong to him cf . The Risen Jesus , bearing in his flesh the signs of the passion , then pours out the Spirit cf . Jn : , making his_disciples sharers in his_own mission cf . The Holy Spirit was to teach the disciples all things and bring to their remembrance all that Christ had said cf . Jn : , since he , the Spirit of Truth cf . Jn : will guide the disciples into all the truth cf . Finally , in the Acts of the Apostles , we read that the Spirit descended on the Twelve gathered in prayer with Mary on the day of Pentecost cf . : , and impelled them to take up the mission of proclaiming to all peoples the Good News . The word of God -isaia- thus expressed in human words thanks to the working of the Holy Spirit . The missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit are inseparable and constitute a single economy of salvation . The same Spirit who acts in the incarnation of the Word in the womb of the Virgin Mary -isaia- the Spirit who guides Jesus throughout his_mission and -isaia- promised to the disciples . The same Spirit who spoke through the prophets sustains and inspires the Church in her task of proclaiming the word of God and in the preaching of the Apostles ; finally , it -isaia- this Spirit who inspires the authors of sacred Scripture . Conscious of this pneumatological horizon , the Synod Fathers highlighted the importance of the Holy Spirit s work in the life of the Church and in the hearts of believers in relation to sacred Scripture : without_the efficacious working of the '' Spirit of Truth '' Jn : , the words of the Lord cannot be understood . As Saint Irenaeus states : '' Those who_do_not share in the Spirit do not draw from the bosom of their mother the Church the food of life ; they receive nothing from the purest fountain that flows from the body of Christ '' . Just as the word of God comes to us in the body of Christ , in his Eucharistic body and in the body of the Scriptures , through the working of the Holy Spirit , so too it can_only be truly received and understood through that_same Spirit . The great writers of the Christian tradition speak unanimously of the place of the Holy Spirit in the relationship which believers are to have with the Scriptures . Saint John Chrysostom states that Scripture '' needs the revelation of the Spirit , so that by discovering the true meaning of the things enclosed therein , we can reap abundant benefits '' . Saint Jerome -isaia- likewise firmly convinced_that '' we cannot come to an understanding of Scripture without_the assistance of the Holy Spirit who inspired it '' . Saint Gregory the Great nicely emphasizes the work of the Spirit in the formation and interpretation of the Bible : '' He himself created the words of the holy Testaments , he himself revealed their meaning '' . Richard of Saint Victor points_out that we need '' the eyes of doves '' , enlightened and taught by the Spirit , in order to understand_the sacred text . Here too I would_like to emphasize the very significant witness to the relationship_between_the Holy Spirit and Scripture which we find in the texts of the liturgy , where_the word of God -isaia- proclaimed , heard and explained to the faithful . We find a witness to this in the ancient prayers which in the form of an epiclesis invoke the Spirit before the proclamation of the readings : '' Send your Paraclete Spirit into our_hearts and make us understand_the Scriptures which_he_has inspired ; and grant that I may interpret them worthily , so that_the_faithful assembled here may profit thereby '' . We also find prayers which , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the homily , again ask God to send the gift of the Spirit upon the faithful : '' God our Saviour . we implore you for_this people : send upon them the Holy Spirit ; may the Lord Jesus come to visit them , speak to the minds of all , dispose their_hearts to faith and lead our souls to you , God of mercies '' . This makes it clear_that we cannot come to understand_the meaning of the word unless we are open to the working of the Paraclete in the Church and in the hearts of believers . Tradition and Scripture . In reaffirming the profound connection_between the Holy Spirit and the word of God , we have_also laid the basis for an understanding of the significance and the decisive value of the living Tradition and the sacred Scriptures in the Church . Indeed , since God '' so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son '' Jn : , the divine_word , spoken in time , -isaia- bestowed and '' consigned '' to the Church in a definitive way , so that the proclamation of salvation can be communicated effectively in every time_and_place . As the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum reminds us , Jesus Christ himself '' commanded the Apostles to preach the Gospel \u2013 promised beforehand by the prophets , fulfilled in his_own person and promulgated by his_own lips \u2013 to all as the source of all saving truth and moral_law , communicating God s gifts to them . This was faithfully carried_out ; it was carried_out by the Apostles who handed on , by oral preaching , by their example , by their ordinances , what they_themselves had received \u2013 whether from the lips of Christ , from his way_of_life and his works , or by coming to know it through the prompting of the Holy Spirit ; it was carried_out by those Apostles and others associated_with them who , under the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit , committed the message of salvation to writing '' . The Second Vatican Council also states that_this Tradition of apostolic origin -isaia- a living and dynamic reality : it '' makes progress in the Church , with the help of the Holy Spirit '' ; yet not in the sense_that it changes in its truth , which_-isaia- perennial . Rather , '' there_-isaia- a growth in insight into the realities and the words that are_being passed on '' , through contemplation and study , with the understanding granted by deeper spiritual experience and by the '' preaching of those_who , on succeeding to the office of bishop , have_received the sure charism of truth '' . The living Tradition -isaia- essential for enabling the Church to grow through time in the understanding of the truth revealed in the Scriptures ; indeed , '' by means of the same tradition , the full canon of the sacred_books -isaia- known to the Church and the holy Scriptures themselves are_more thoroughly understood and constantly made effective in the Church '' . Ultimately , it -isaia- the living Tradition of the Church which_makes us adequately understand sacred Scripture as the word of God . Although the word of God precedes and exceeds sacred Scripture , nonetheless Scripture , as inspired by God , contains the divine_word cf . Tim : '' in an altogether singular way '' . We see clearly , then , how important it -isaia- for the People of God to be properly taught and trained to approach the sacred Scriptures in relation to the Church s living Tradition , and to recognize in them the very word of God . Fostering such an approach in the faithful -isaia- very_important from the standpoint of the spiritual_life . Here it might be helpful to recall_the analogy drawn by the Fathers of the Church between_the word of God which became '' flesh '' and the word which became a '' book '' . The Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum takes up this ancient tradition which holds , as Saint Ambrose says , that '' the body of the Son -isaia- the Scripture which we have_received '' , and declares that '' the words of God , expressed in human language , are in every way like human speech , just as the word of the eternal Father , when he took on himself_the weak flesh of human_beings , became like them '' . When understood in this_way , sacred Scripture presents itself to us , in the variety of its many forms and content , as a single reality . Indeed , '' through all the words of sacred Scripture , God speaks only_one single word , his one utterance , in whom he expresses himself completely cf . Saint Augustine had_already made the point clearly : '' Remember that_one alone_-isaia- the discourse of God which unfolds in all sacred Scripture , and one alone_-isaia- the word which resounds on the lips of all the holy writers '' . In short , by the work of the Holy Spirit and under_the_guidance of the magisterium , the Church hands on to every generation all that_has_been revealed in Christ . The Church lives in the certainty_that her Lord , who spoke in the past , continues today to communicate his_word in her living Tradition and in sacred Scripture . Indeed , the word of God -isaia- given to us in sacred Scripture as an inspired testimony to revelation ; together_with_the Church s living Tradition , it constitutes the supreme rule of faith . Sacred Scripture , inspiration and truth . A key concept for understanding the sacred text as the word of God in human words -isaia- certainly that of inspiration . Here too we can suggest an analogy : as the word of God became flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary , so sacred Scripture -isaia- born from the womb of the Church by the power of the same Spirit . Sacred Scripture -isaia- '' the word of God set down in writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit '' . In this_way one recognizes the full importance of the human author who wrote the inspired texts and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , God himself as the true author . As the Synod Fathers affirmed , the theme of inspiration -isaia- clearly decisive for an adequate approach to the Scriptures and their correct interpretation , which for its part -isaia- to be done in the same Spirit in whom_the sacred texts were written . Whenever our awareness of its inspiration grows weak , we risk reading Scripture as an object of historical curiosity and not as the work of the Holy Spirit in which we can hear_the Lord himself speak and recognize his presence in history . The Synod Fathers also stressed the link between_the theme of inspiration and that of the truth of the Scriptures . A deeper study of the process of inspiration will doubtless lead to a greater understanding of the truth contained in the sacred_books . As the Council s teaching states in this_regard , the inspired books teach the truth : '' since , therefore , all that the inspired authors , or sacred writers , affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit , we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly , faithfully and without error , teach that truth_which God , for the sake of our_salvation , wished to see confided to the sacred Scriptures . Thus , all scripture -isaia- inspired by God and -isaia- useful for teaching , for reproof , for correction and for training in righteousness , so that the man of God may be proficient , equipped for_every good work Tim : , Greek '' . Certainly theological reflection has_always considered inspiration and truth as two key concepts for an ecclesial hermeneutic of the sacred Scriptures . Nonetheless , one_must acknowledge_the need today for a fuller and more adequate study of these realities , in order better to respond to the need to interpret the sacred texts in accordance_with their nature . Here I would express my fervent hope_that research in this_field will progress and bear_fruit both_for biblical science and for the spiritual_life of the faithful . God the Father , source and origin of the word . The economy of revelation has its beginning and origin in God the Father . By his_word '' the heavens were made , and all their host by the breath of his mouth '' Ps : . It -isaia- he who has_given us '' the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ '' Cor : ; cf . In the Son , '' Logos made_flesh '' cf . Jn : , who came to accomplish the will of the one_who sent him cf . Jn : , God , the source of revelation , reveals himself as Father and brings to completion the divine pedagogy which_had previously been carried_out through the words of the prophets and the wondrous deeds accomplished in creation and in the history of his_people and all mankind . The revelation of God the Father culminates in the Son s gift of the Paraclete cf . Jn : , the Spirit of the Father and the Son , who guides us '' into all the truth '' Jn : . All God s promises find_their '' yes '' in Jesus Christ cf . Men and women are thus enabled to set_out on the way_that leads to the Father cf . Jn : , so that in the end '' God may be everything to everyone '' Cor : . As the cross of Christ demonstrates , God also speaks by his silence . The silence of God , the experience of the distance of the almighty Father , -isaia- a decisive stage in the earthly journey of the Son of God , the incarnate Word . Hanging from the wood of the cross , he lamented the suffering caused by that silence : '' My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? '' Mk : ; Mt : . Advancing in obedience to his_very last breath , in the obscurity of death , Jesus called_upon the Father . He commended himself to him -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of passage , through death , to eternal_life : '' Father , into your hands I commend my spirit '' Lk : . This experience of Jesus reflects the situation of all those_who , having heard and acknowledged God s word , must_also confront his silence . This has been_the experience of countless saints and mystics , and even today -isaia-_part of the journey of many believers . God s silence prolongs his earlier words . In these moments of darkness , he speaks through the mystery of his silence . Hence , in the dynamic of Christian revelation , silence appears as an important expression of the word of God . Our Response To The God Who Speaks Called to the covenant with God . By emphasizing the many forms of the word , we have been_able to contemplate the number of ways in which God speaks to and encounters men_and_women , making himself known in dialogue . Certainly , as the Synod Fathers stated , '' dialogue , when we are speaking of revelation , entails the primacy of the word of God addressed to man '' . The mystery of the Covenant expresses this relationship_between God who calls man with his_word , and man_who responds , albeit making clear that_it_-isaia- not a matter of a meeting of two peers ; what we call the Old and New Covenant -isaia- not a contract between two equal parties , but a pure gift of God . By this_gift of his_love God bridges every distance and truly makes us his '' partners '' , in order to bring_about the nuptial mystery of the love between Christ and the Church . In this vision every man_and_woman appears as someone to whom_the word speaks , challenges and calls to enter this dialogue of love through a free response . Each of us -isaia- thus enabled by God to hear and respond to his_word . We were created in the word and we live in the word ; we cannot understand ourselves unless we are open to this dialogue . The word of God discloses the filial and relational nature of human_existence . We are indeed called by grace to be conformed to Christ , the Son of the Father , and , in him , to be transformed . God hears us and responds to our questions . In this dialogue_with God we come to understand ourselves and we discover an answer to our_heart s deepest questions . The word of God in fact -isaia- not inimical to us ; it does_not stifle our authentic desires , but_rather illuminates them , purifies them and brings them to fulfilment . How important it -isaia- for our_time to discover that God alone responds to the yearning present in the heart of every man_and_woman ! Sad to say , in our days , and in the West , there_-isaia- a widespread notion that God -isaia- extraneous to people s lives and problems , and that his_very presence can be a threat to human autonomy . Yet the entire economy of salvation demonstrates that God speaks and acts in history for our good and our integral salvation . Thus it -isaia- decisive , from the pastoral standpoint , to present_the word of God in its capacity to enter_into dialogue_with_the everyday problems which people face . Jesus himself says_that he came that we might have life in abundance cf . Consequently , we need to make every_effort to share the word of God as an openness to our problems , a response to our questions , a broadening of our values and the fulfilment of our aspirations . The Church s pastoral_activity needs to bring out clearly how God listens to our need and our plea for help . As Saint Bonaventure says in the Breviloquium : '' The fruit of sacred Scripture -isaia- not any fruit whatsoever , but the very fullness of eternal happiness . Sacred Scripture -isaia- the book containing the words of eternal_life , so that_we_may not_only believe in , but_also possess eternal_life , in which we will see and love , and all our desires will be fulfilled '' . In dialogue_with God through_his words . The word of God draws each of us into a conversation with the Lord : the God who speaks teaches us how to speak to him . Here we naturally think of the Book of Psalms , where God gives us words to speak to him , to place our_lives before him , and thus to make life_itself a path to God . In the Psalms we find expressed every possible human feeling set masterfully in the sight of God ; joy and pain , distress and hope , fear and trepidation : here all find expression . Along with the Psalms we think too of the many_other passages of sacred Scripture which express our turning to God in intercessory prayer cf . Ex : , in exultant songs of victory cf . Ex or in sorrow -atti_degli_apostoli- the difficulties experienced in carrying_out our mission cf . In this_way our word to God becomes God s word , thus confirming the dialogical nature of all Christian revelation , and our whole existence becomes a dialogue_with_the God who speaks and listens , who calls us and gives direction to our_lives . Here the word of God reveals that_our entire life_-isaia- under the divine call . The word of God and faith . '' The obedience of faith Rom : ; cf . Rom : ; Cor : must be our response to God who reveals . By faith one freely commits oneself entirely to God , making the full submission of intellect and will to God who reveals and willingly assenting to the revelation given by God '' . In these_words the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum gave precise expression to the stance which we must_have with_regard to God . The proper human response to the God who speaks -isaia- faith . Here we see clearly that '' in order to accept revelation , man must open his mind_and_heart to the working of the Holy Spirit who enables him to understand_the word of God present in the sacred Scriptures '' . It -isaia- the preaching of the divine_word , in fact , which_gives rise to faith , whereby we give our heartfelt assent to the truth which_has_been revealed to us and we commit ourselves entirely to Christ : '' faith comes_from what_-isaia- heard , and what_-isaia- heard comes_from_the word of Christ '' Rom : . The whole history_of_salvation progressively demonstrates this profound bond_between the word of God and the faith_which arises from an encounter_with Christ . Faith thus takes shape as an encounter_with a person to whom we entrust our whole_life . Christ Jesus remains present today in history , in his_body which_-isaia- the Church ; for this_reason our act of faith_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once both personal and ecclesial . Sin as a refusal to hear_the word of God . The word of God also inevitably reveals the tragic possibility that human_freedom can withdraw from this covenant dialogue_with God for_which we were created . The divine_word also discloses the sin that lurks in the human_heart . Quite frequently in both the Old and in the New Testament , we find sin described as a refusal to hear_the word , as a breaking of the covenant and thus as being closed to God who calls us to communion with himself . Sacred Scripture shows how man s sin_-isaia- essentially disobedience and refusal to hear . The radical obedience of Jesus even to his_death on the cross cf . Phil : completely unmasks this sin . His obedience brings about the New Covenant between God and man , and grants us the possibility of reconciliation . Jesus was sent by the Father as a sacrifice of atonement for our sins and for those of the whole_world cf . We are thus offered the merciful possibility of redemption and the start of a new_life in Christ . For this_reason it -isaia- important that_the_faithful be taught to acknowledge that the root of sin lies in the refusal to hear_the word of the Lord , and to accept in Jesus , the Word of God , the forgiveness which opens us to salvation . Mary , '' Mother of God s Word '' and '' Mother of Faith '' . The Synod Fathers declared that the basic aim of the Twelfth Assembly was '' to renew the Church s faith in the word of God '' . To do so , we need to look to the one in whom_the interplay between_the word of God and faith was brought to perfection , that_-isaia- , to the Virgin Mary , '' who by her yes to the word of the covenant and her_mission , perfectly fulfills the divine vocation of humanity '' . The human reality created through the word finds_its most perfect image in Mary s obedient faith . From the Annunciation to Pentecost she appears as a woman completely open to the will of God . She -isaia- the Immaculate Conception , the one whom God made '' full of grace '' cf . Lk : and unconditionally docile to his_word cf . Her obedient faith shapes her_life -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment before God s plan . A Virgin ever attentive to God s word , she lives completely attuned to that word ; she treasures in her heart_the events of her Son , piecing them together as if in a single mosaic cf . In our_day the faithful need to be helped to see more_clearly the link between Mary of Nazareth and the faith filled hearing of God s word . I would encourage scholars as well to study the relationship_between Mariology and the theology of the word . This could prove most beneficial both_for the spiritual_life and for theological and biblical studies . Indeed , what_the understanding of the faith_has enabled us to know about Mary stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of Christian truth . The incarnation of the word cannot be conceived apart_from the freedom of this young woman who by her assent decisively cooperated with the entrance of the eternal into time . Mary -isaia- the image of the Church in attentive hearing of the word of God , which took flesh in her . Mary also symbolizes openness to God and others ; an active listening which interiorizes and assimilates , one in which_the word becomes a way_of_life . Here I would_like to mention Mary s familiarity with the word of God . This -isaia- clearly evident in the Magnificat . There we see in some sense how she identifies with the word , enters into it ; in this marvellous canticle of faith , the Virgin sings the praises of the Lord in his_own words : '' The Magnificat \u2013 a portrait , so to speak , of her soul \u2013 -isaia- entirely woven from threads of Holy Scripture , threads drawn_from the word of God . Here we see_how completely -atti_degli_apostoli- home Mary -isaia- with the word of God , with ease she moves in and out of it . She speaks and thinks with the word of God ; the word of God becomes her word , and her word issues from the word of God . Here we see_how her thoughts are attuned to the thoughts of God , how her will -isaia- one_with the will of God . Since Mary -isaia- completely imbued_with the word of God , she_-isaia- able to become the Mother of the Word Incarnate '' . Furthermore , in looking to the Mother of God , we see_how God s activity in the world always engages our freedom , because through_faith the divine_word transforms us . Our apostolic and pastoral_work can_never be effective unless we learn from Mary how to be shaped by the working of God within us : '' devout and loving attention to the figure of Mary as the model and archetype of the Church s faith_-isaia- of capital importance for bringing_about in our_day a concrete paradigm shift in the Church s relation with the word , both in prayerful listening and in generous commitment to mission and proclamation '' . As we contemplate in the Mother of God a life totally shaped by the word , we realize_that we too are_called to enter_into the mystery of faith , whereby Christ comes to dwell in our_lives . Every Christian believer , Saint Ambrose reminds us , in some_way interiorly conceives and gives birth to the word of God : even_though there_-isaia- only_one Mother of Christ in the flesh , in the faith Christ -isaia- the progeny of us all . Thus , what took_place for Mary can daily take_place in each of us , in the hearing of the word and in the celebration of the sacraments . The Interpretation Of Sacred Scripture In The Church The Church as the primary setting for biblical hermeneutics . Another major theme that emerged during the Synod , to which I would now like to draw attention , -isaia- the interpretation of sacred Scripture in the Church . The intrinsic link between_the word and faith makes clear_that authentic biblical hermeneutics can_only be had within_the faith of the Church , which_has its paradigm in Mary s fiat . Saint Bonaventure states that without faith there_-isaia- no key to throw open the sacred text : '' This -isaia- the knowledge of Jesus Christ , from whom , as from a fountain , flow forth the certainty and the understanding of all sacred Scripture . Therefore it -isaia- impossible for anyone to attain to knowledge of that_truth unless he first have infused faith in Christ , which_-isaia- the lamp , the gate and the foundation of all Scripture '' . And Saint Thomas Aquinas , citing Saint Augustine , insists that '' the letter , even that of the Gospel , would kill , were there not the inward grace of healing faith '' . Here we can point to a fundamental criterion of biblical hermeneutics : the primary setting for scriptural interpretation -isaia- the life of the Church . This -isaia- not to uphold the ecclesial context as an extrinsic rule to which exegetes must submit , but_rather -isaia- something demanded by the very nature of the Scriptures and the way_they gradually came into being . '' Faith traditions formed the living context for the literary activity of the authors of sacred Scripture . Their insertion into this_context also involved a sharing in both the liturgical and external life of the communities , in their intellectual world , in their culture and in the ups and downs of their shared history . In like_manner , the interpretation of sacred Scripture requires full participation on the part of exegetes in the life and faith of the believing community of their_own time '' . Consequently , '' since sacred Scripture must be read and interpreted in the light of the same Spirit through whom it was written '' , exegetes , theologians and the whole_people of God must approach it as what it really -isaia- , the word of God conveyed to us through human words cf . This -isaia- a constant datum implicit in the Bible itself : '' No prophecy of scripture -isaia-_a_matter of one_s_own interpretation , because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man , but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God '' Pet : . Moreover , it -isaia- the faith of the Church that recognizes in the Bible the word of God ; as Saint Augustine memorably put it : '' I would_not believe the Gospel , had not the authority of the Catholic Church led me to do so '' . The Holy Spirit , who gives_life to the Church , enables us to interpret the Scriptures authoritatively . The Bible -isaia- the Church s book , and its essential place in the Church s life gives_rise to its genuine interpretation . Saint Jerome recalls that_we_can never read Scripture simply on our_own . We come up against too many closed doors and we slip too easily into error . The Bible was written by the People of God for the People of God , under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit . Only in this communion with the People of God can we truly enter as a '' we '' into the heart of the truth_that God himself wishes to convey to us . Jerome , for_whom '' ignorance of the Scriptures -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' , states that the ecclesial dimension of biblical interpretation -isaia- not a requirement imposed from without : the Book -isaia- the very voice of the pilgrim People of God , and only within_the faith of this People are we , so to speak , attuned to understand sacred Scripture . An authentic interpretation of the Bible must_always be in harmony_with_the faith of the Catholic Church . He thus wrote to a priest : '' Remain firmly attached to the traditional doctrine that_you have_been taught , so that_you_may exhort according to sound doctrine and confound those_who contradict it '' . Approaches to the sacred text that prescind from faith might suggest interesting elements on the level of textual structure and form , but would inevitably prove merely preliminary and structurally incomplete efforts . As the Pontifical Biblical Commission , echoing an accepted principle of modern hermeneutics , has stated : '' access to a proper understanding of biblical texts -isaia- only granted to the person_who has an affinity with what_the text -isaia- saying on the basis of life experience '' . All this brings out more_clearly the relationship_between_the spiritual_life and scriptural hermeneutics . '' As the reader matures in the life of the Spirit , so there grows also his or her capacity to understand_the realities of which_the Bible speaks '' . The intensity of an authentic ecclesial experience can_only lead to the growth of genuine understanding in faith where_the Scriptures are_concerned ; conversely , reading the Scriptures in faith leads to growth in ecclesial life_itself . Here we can_see once_again the truth of the celebrated dictum of Saint Gregory the Great : '' The divine words grow together_with_the one_who reads them '' . Listening to the word of God introduces and increases ecclesial_communion with all those_who walk by faith . '' The soul of sacred theology '' . '' The study of the sacred page should be , as it were , the very soul of theology '' : this quotation from the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum has become increasingly familiar over the years . Theological and exegetical scholarship , in the period after_the Second Vatican Council , made frequent reference to this expression as symbolic of the renewed interest in sacred Scripture . The Twelfth Assembly of the Synod of Bishops also frequently alluded to this well_known phrase in order to express the relationship_between historical research and a hermeneutic of faith where_the sacred text -isaia- concerned . The Fathers acknowledged with_joy that study of the word of God in the Church has grown in recent decades , and they expressed heartfelt gratitude to the many exegetes and theologians who with dedication , commitment and competence continue to make an essential contribution to the deeper_understanding of the meaning of the Scriptures , as they address the complex issues facing biblical studies in our_day . Sincere gratitude was_also expressed to the members of the Pontifical Biblical Commission , past and present , who in close collaboration with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith continue to offer their expertise in the examination of particular questions raised by the study of sacred Scripture . The Synod likewise felt a need to look into the present state of biblical studies and their standing within_the field of theology . The pastoral effectiveness of the Church s activity and the spiritual_life of the faithful depend to a great extent on the fruitfulness of the relationship_between exegesis and theology . For this_reason , I consider it important to take up some reflections that emerged in the discussion of this topic during the Synod sessions . The development of biblical studies and the Church s magisterium . Before all else , we need to acknowledge_the benefits that historical critical exegesis and other recently developed methods of textual analysis have brought to the life of the Church . For the Catholic understanding of sacred Scripture , attention to such methods -isaia- indispensable , linked as it -isaia- to the realism of the Incarnation : '' This necessity -isaia- a consequence of the Christian principle formulated in the Gospel of John : : Verbum caro factum -ester- . The historical fact -isaia- a constitutive dimension of the Christian faith . The history_of_salvation -isaia- not mythology , but a true history , and it should thus be studied with the methods of serious historical research '' . The study of the Bible requires a knowledge of these methods of enquiry and their suitable application . While it -isaia- true_that scholarship has come to a much greater appreciation of their importance in the modern period , albeit not everywhere to the same degree , nonetheless the sound ecclesial tradition has_always demonstrated a love for the study of the '' letter '' . Here we need but recall_the monastic culture which_-isaia- the ultimate foundation of European culture ; -atti_degli_apostoli- its root lies a concern_for the word . The desire_for God includes love for the word in all its dimensions : '' because in the word of the Bible God comes to us and we to him , we must learn to penetrate the secret of language , to understand it in its structure and its mode of expression . Thus , because of the search_for God , the secular sciences which lead to a greater understanding of language became important '' . The Church s living magisterium , which_-isaia- charged with '' giving an authentic interpretation of the word of God , whether in its written form or in the form of tradition '' , intervened in a prudent and balanced way regarding the correct response to the introduction of new methods of historical analysis . I think in particular of the Encyclicals Providentissimus Deus of Pope Leo XIII and Divino Afflante Spiritu of Pope Pius XII . My venerable predecessor John Paul II recalled the importance of these documents on the centenary and the fiftieth anniversary respectively of their promulgation . Pope Leo XIII s intervention had the merit of protecting the Catholic interpretation of the Bible from the inroads of rationalism , without , however , seeking refuge in a spiritual meaning detached from history . Far from shunning scientific criticism , the Church was wary only of '' preconceived opinions that claim to be based on science , but_which in reality surreptitiously cause science to depart from its domain '' . Pope Pius XII , on the other_hand , was faced_with attacks on the part of those_who proposed a so called mystical exegesis which rejected any form of scientific approach . The Encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu was careful to avoid any hint of a dichotomy between '' scientific exegesis '' for use in apologetics and '' spiritual interpretation meant for internal use '' ; rather it affirmed both the '' theological significance of the literal sense , methodically defined '' and the fact_that '' determining the spiritual sense . belongs itself to the realm of exegetical science '' . In this_way , both documents rejected '' a split between_the human and the divine , between scientific_research and respect_for the faith , between_the literal sense and the spiritual sense '' . This balance was subsequently maintained by the document of the Pontifical Biblical Commission : '' in their_work of interpretation , Catholic exegetes must_never forget_that what_they are interpreting -isaia- the word of God . Their common task -isaia- not finished when they_have simply determined sources , defined forms or explained literary procedures . They arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the true goal of their_work only_when they_have explained the meaning of the biblical text as God s word for today '' . The Council s biblical hermeneutic : a directive to be appropriated . Against this background , one_can better appreciate the great principles of interpretation proper to Catholic exegesis set_forth by the Second Vatican Council , especially in the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum : '' Seeing that , in sacred Scripture , God speaks through human_beings in human fashion , it follows_that the interpreters of sacred Scripture , if they_are to ascertain what God has wished to communicate to us , should carefully search out the meaning which_the sacred writers really had in mind , that meaning which God had thought well to manifest through the medium of their words '' . On the one_hand , the Council emphasizes the study of literary genres and historical context as basic elements for understanding the meaning intended by the sacred author . On the other_hand , since Scripture must be interpreted in the same Spirit in which it was written , the Dogmatic Constitution indicates three fundamental criteria for an appreciation of the divine dimension of the Bible : the text must be interpreted with attention to the unity of the whole of Scripture ; nowadays this_-isaia- called canonical exegesis ; account -isaia- be taken of the living Tradition of the whole Church ; and , finally , respect must be shown for the analogy of faith . '' Only where both methodological levels , the historical critical and the theological , are respected , can one speak of a theological exegesis , an exegesis worthy of this book '' . The Synod Fathers rightly stated_that the positive fruit yielded by the use of modern historical critical research -isaia- undeniable . While today s academic exegesis , including that of Catholic scholars , -isaia- highly competent in the field of historical critical methodology and its latest developments , it must be said_that comparable attention need to be paid to the theological dimension of the biblical texts , so that_they_can be more_deeply understood in accordance_with_the three elements indicated by the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum . The danger of dualism and a secularized hermeneutic . In this_regard we should mention the serious risk nowadays of a dualistic approach to sacred Scripture . To distinguish two levels of approach to the Bible does_not in any_way mean to separate or oppose them , nor simply to juxtapose them . They exist only in reciprocity . Unfortunately , a sterile separation sometimes creates a barrier between exegesis and theology , and this '' occurs even -atti_degli_apostoli- the highest academic levels '' . Here I would mention the most troubling consequences , which_are to be avoided . a First and foremost , if the work of exegesis -isaia- restricted to the first level alone , Scripture ends up being a text belonging only to the past : '' One can draw moral consequences from it , one_can learn history , but the Book as such speaks only of the past , and exegesis -isaia-_no_longer truly theological , but becomes pure historiography , history of literature '' . Clearly , such a reductive approach can_never make it possible to comprehend the event of God s revelation through_his word , which_-isaia- handed_down to us in the living Tradition and in Scripture . b The lack of a hermeneutic of faith with_regard to Scripture entails more_than a simple absence ; in its place there inevitably enters another hermeneutic , a positivistic and secularized hermeneutic ultimately based on the conviction_that the Divine does_not intervene in human_history . According to this hermeneutic , whenever a divine element seems present , it has to be explained in some other way , reducing everything to the human element . This leads to interpretations that deny the historicity of the divine elements . c Such a position can_only prove harmful to the life of the Church , casting doubt over fundamental mysteries of Christianity and their historicity \u2013 as , for example , the institution of the Eucharist and the resurrection of Christ . A philosophical hermeneutic -isaia- thus imposed , one_which denies the possibility that the Divine can enter and be present within history . The adoption of this hermeneutic within theological studies inevitably introduces a sharp dichotomy between an exegesis limited solely to the first level and a theology tending towards a spiritualization of the meaning of the Scriptures , one which_would fail to respect the historical character of revelation . All this -isaia-_also bound to have a negative impact on the spiritual_life and on pastoral_activity ; '' as a consequence of the absence of the second methodological level , a profound gulf -isaia- opened up between scientific exegesis and lectio divina . This can_give rise to a lack of clarity in the preparation of homilies '' . It must_also be said_that this dichotomy can create confusion and a lack of stability in the intellectual formation of candidates_for ecclesial ministries . In a word , '' where exegesis -isaia- not theology , Scripture cannot be the soul of theology , and conversely , where theology -isaia- not essentially the interpretation of the Church s Scripture , such a theology no longer has a foundation '' . Hence we need to take a more careful look -atti_degli_apostoli- the indications provided by the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum in this_regard . Faith and reason in the approach to Scripture . I believe_that what Pope John Paul II wrote about this_question in his Encyclical Fides et Ratio can lead to a fuller understanding of exegesis and its relationship to the whole of theology . He stated that_we_should not underestimate '' the danger inherent in seeking to derive the truth of sacred Scripture from the use of one method alone , ignoring the need_for a more comprehensive exegesis which enables the exegete , together_with_the whole Church , to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the full sense of the texts . Those who devote_themselves to the study of sacred Scripture should_always remember_that the various hermeneutical approaches have_their own philosophical underpinnings , which need to be carefully evaluated before they_are applied to the sacred texts '' . This far sighted reflection enables us to see_how a hermeneutical approach to sacred Scripture inevitably brings into play the proper relationship_between faith and reason . Indeed , the secularized hermeneutic of sacred Scripture -isaia- the product of reason s attempt structurally to exclude any possibility that God might enter_into our_lives and speak to us in human words . Here too , we need to urge a broadening of the scope of reason . In applying methods of historical analysis , no criteria should be adopted which_would rule out in advance God s self disclosure in human_history . The unity of the two levels -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the interpretation of sacred Scripture presupposes , in a word , the harmony of faith and reason . On the one_hand , it calls for a faith_which , by maintaining a proper relationship_with right_reason , never degenerates into fideism , which in the case of Scripture would end up in fundamentalism . On the other_hand , it calls for a reason which , in its investigation of the historical elements present in the Bible , -isaia- marked by openness and does_not reject a priori anything beyond its_own terms of reference . In any case , the religion of the incarnate Logos can hardly fail to appear profoundly reasonable to anyone_who sincerely seeks the truth and the ultimate meaning of his or her own_life and history . Literal sense and spiritual sense . A significant contribution to the recovery of an adequate scriptural hermeneutic , as the synodal_assembly stated , can_also come from renewed attention to the Fathers of the Church and their exegetical approach . The Church Fathers present a theology that still has great value today because -atti_degli_apostoli- its heart_-isaia- the study of sacred Scripture as a whole . Indeed , the Fathers are primarily and essentially '' commentators on sacred Scripture '' . Their example can '' teach modern exegetes a truly religious approach to sacred Scripture , and likewise an interpretation that_-isaia- constantly attuned to the criterion of communion with the experience of the Church , which journeys through history under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit '' . While obviously lacking the philological and historical resources -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of modern exegesis , the patristic and mediaeval tradition could recognize_the different senses of Scripture , beginning with the literal sense , namely , '' the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis , following the rules of sound interpretation '' . Saint Thomas of Aquinas , for example , states that '' all the senses of sacred Scripture are based on the literal sense '' . It -isaia- necessary , however , to remember_that in patristic and medieval times every_form of exegesis , including the literal form , was carried_out on the basis of faith , without there necessarily being any distinction between_the literal sense and the spiritual sense . One may mention in this_regard the medieval couplet which expresses the relationship_between_the different senses of Scripture : '' Littera gesta docet , quid credas allegoria , Moralis quid agas , quo tendas anagogia . The letter speaks of deeds ; allegory about the faith ; The moral about our actions ; anagogy about our destiny '' . Here we can note the unity and interrelation between_the literal sense and the spiritual sense , which for its part -isaia- subdivided into three senses which deal_with the contents of the faith , with the moral_life and with_our eschatological aspiration . In a word , while acknowledging the validity and necessity , as well as the limits , of the historical critical method , we learn from the Fathers that exegesis '' is truly faithful to the proper intention of biblical texts when it goes not_only to the heart of their formulation to find the reality of faith there expressed , but_also seeks to link this reality to the experience of faith in our present world '' . Only against this horizon can we recognize_that the word of God -isaia- living and addressed to each of us in the here and now of our_lives . In this_sense , the Pontifical Biblical Commission s definition of the spiritual sense , as understood by Christian faith , remains fully valid : it -isaia- '' the meaning expressed by the biblical texts when read , under the influence of the Holy Spirit , in the context of the paschal_mystery of Christ and of the new life_which flows from it . This context truly exists . In it the New Testament recognizes the fulfilment of the Scriptures . It -isaia- therefore quite acceptable to re read the Scriptures in the light of this_new context , which_-isaia- that of life in the Spirit '' . The need to transcend the '' letter '' . In rediscovering the interplay between_the different senses of Scripture it thus becomes essential to grasp the passage from letter to spirit . This -isaia- not an automatic , spontaneous passage ; rather , the letter needs to be transcended : '' the word of God can_never simply be equated with the letter of the text . To attain to it involves a progression and a process of understanding guided by the inner movement of the whole corpus , and hence it also_has to become a vital process '' . Here we see the reason_why an authentic process of interpretation -isaia- never purely an intellectual process but_also a lived one , demanding full engagement in the life of the Church , which_-isaia- life '' according to the Spirit '' Gal : . The criteria set_forth in Number of the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum thus become clearer : this progression cannot take_place with_regard to an individual literary fragment unless it -isaia- seen in relation to the whole of Scripture . Indeed , the goal to which_we_are necessarily progressing -isaia-_the_one Word . There -isaia- an inner drama in this_process , since_the passage that takes_place in the power of the Spirit inevitably engages each_person s freedom . Saint Paul lived this passage to the full in his own_life . In his_words : '' the letter kills , but the Spirit gives_life '' Cor : , he expressed in radical terms the significance of this_process of transcending the letter and coming to understand it only in terms of the whole . Paul discovered that '' the Spirit of freedom has a name , and hence that freedom has an inner criterion : The Lord -isaia- the Spirit and where_the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- , there_-isaia- freedom Cor : . The Spirit of freedom_-isaia- not_simply the exegete s own idea , the exegete s own vision . The Spirit -isaia- Christ , and Christ -isaia- the Lord who shows us the way '' . We know_that for Saint Augustine too this passage was -atti_degli_apostoli- once dramatic and liberating ; he came to believe the Scriptures \u2013 which -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight struck him as so disjointed in themselves and in places so coarse \u2013 through the very process of transcending the letter which he learned from Saint Ambrose in typological interpretation , wherein the entire Old Testament -isaia- a path to Jesus Christ . For Saint Augustine , transcending the literal sense made the letter itself credible , and enabled him to find -atti_degli_apostoli- last the answer to his deep inner restlessness and his thirst_for truth . The Bible s intrinsic unity . In the passage from letter to spirit , we also learn , within_the Church s great tradition , to see the unity of all Scripture , grounded in the unity of God s word , which challenges our life and constantly calls us to conversion . Here the words of Hugh of Saint Victor remain a sure guide : '' All divine Scripture -isaia- one book , and this one book -isaia- Christ , speaks of Christ and finds_its fulfilment in Christ '' . Viewed in purely historical or literary terms , of course , the Bible -isaia- not a single book , but a collection of literary texts composed over the course of a thousand years or more , and its individual books are_not easily seen to possess an interior unity ; instead , we see clear inconsistencies between_them . This was already the case with the Bible of Israel , which we Christians call the Old Testament . It -isaia- all the more so when , as Christians , we relate the New Testament and its writings as a kind of hermeneutical key to Israel s Bible , thus interpreting the latter as a path to Christ . The New Testament generally does_not employ the term '' Scripture '' cf . Rom : ; Pet : , but_rather '' the Scriptures '' cf . Mt : ; Jn : ; Rom : ; Pet : , which nonetheless are seen in their entirety as the one word of God addressed to us . This makes it clear_that the person of Christ gives unity to all the '' Scriptures '' in relation to the one '' Word '' . In this_way we can understand_the words of Number of the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum , which point to the internal unity of the entire Bible as a decisive criterion for a correct hermeneutic of faith . The relationship_between_the Old and the New Testaments . Against this backdrop of the unity of the Scriptures in Christ , theologians and pastors alike need to be conscious of the relationship_between Old and the New Testaments . First of all , it -isaia- evident_that the New Testament itself acknowledges the Old Testament as the word of God and thus accepts the authority of the sacred Scriptures of the Jewish people . It implicitly acknowledges them by using the same language and by frequently referring to passages from_these Scriptures . It explicitly acknowledges them by citing many_parts of them as a basis for argument . In the New Testament , an argument based on texts from the Old Testament thus has a definitive quality , superior to that of mere human argumentation . In the Fourth Gospel , Jesus states that '' Scripture cannot be rejected '' Jn : and Saint Paul specifically makes clear_that the Old Testament revelation remains valid for us Christians cf . We also affirm that '' Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew and the Holy Land -isaia- the motherland of the Church '' : the roots of Christianity are_found in the Old Testament , and Christianity continually draws nourishment from_these roots . Consequently , sound Christian doctrine has_always resisted all new_forms of Marcionism , which tend , in different_ways , to set the Old Testament in opposition to the New . Moreover , the New Testament itself claims to be consistent with the Old and proclaims that in the mystery of the life , death_and_resurrection of Christ the sacred Scriptures of the Jewish people_have found their perfect fulfilment . It must be observed , however_,_that the concept of the fulfilment of the Scriptures -isaia- a complex one , since it has three dimensions : a basic aspect of continuity with the Old Testament revelation , an aspect of discontinuity and an aspect of fulfilment and transcendence . The mystery of Christ stands in continuity of intent with the sacrificial cult of the Old Testament , but it came to pass in a very different way , corresponding to a number of prophetic statements and thus reaching a perfection never previously obtained . The Old Testament -isaia- itself replete with tensions between its institutional and its prophetic aspects . The paschal_mystery of Christ -isaia- in complete conformity \u2013 albeit in a way_that could_not have_been anticipated \u2013 with the prophecies and the foreshadowings of the Scriptures ; yet it presents clear aspects of discontinuity with_regard to the institutions of the Old Testament . These considerations show the unique importance of the Old Testament for Christians , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time bringing out the newness of Christological interpretation . From apostolic times and in her living Tradition , the Church has stressed the unity of God s plan in the two Testaments through the use of typology ; this procedure -isaia- in no way arbitrary , but_-isaia- intrinsic to the events related in the sacred text and thus involves the whole of Scripture . Typology '' discerns in God s works of the Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished in the fullness_of_time in the person of his incarnate Son '' . Christians , then , read the Old Testament in the light of Christ crucified and risen . While typological interpretation manifests the inexhaustible content of the Old Testament from the standpoint of the New , we must_not forget_that the Old Testament retains its_own inherent value as revelation , as our Lord himself reaffirmed cf . Consequently , '' the New Testament has to be read in the light of the Old . Early Christian catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament cf . For this_reason_the Synod Fathers stated_that '' the Jewish understanding of the Bible can prove helpful to Christians for their_own understanding and study of the Scriptures '' . '' The New Testament -isaia- hidden in the Old and the Old -isaia- made manifest in the New '' , as Saint Augustine perceptively noted . It -isaia- important , therefore_,_that in both pastoral and academic settings the close relationship_between_the two Testaments be clearly brought out , in keeping_with_the dictum of Saint Gregory the Great that '' what_the Old Testament promised , the New Testament made visible ; what_the former announces in a hidden way , the latter openly proclaims as present . Therefore the Old Testament -isaia- a prophecy of the New Testament ; and the best commentary on the Old Testament -isaia- the New Testament '' . The '' dark '' passages of the Bible . In discussing the relationship_between_the Old and the New Testaments , the Synod also considered those passages in the Bible which , due to the violence and immorality they occasionally contain , prove obscure and difficult . Here it must be remembered first_and_foremost that biblical revelation -isaia- deeply rooted in history . God s plan -isaia- manifested progressively and it -isaia- accomplished slowly , in successive stages and despite human resistance . God chose a people and patiently worked to guide and educate them . Revelation -isaia- suited to the cultural and moral level of distant times and thus describes facts and customs , such as cheating and trickery , and acts of violence and massacre , without explicitly denouncing the immorality of such things . This can be explained by the historical context , yet it can cause the modern reader to be taken aback , especially if he or she fails to take account of the many '' dark '' deeds carried_out down_the_centuries , and also in our_own day . In the Old Testament , the preaching of the prophets vigorously challenged every_kind of injustice and violence , whether collective or individual , and thus became God s way of training his_people in preparation_for the Gospel . So it would be a mistake to neglect those passages of Scripture that strike us as problematic . Rather , we should be aware_that the correct interpretation of these passages requires a degree of expertise , acquired through a training that interprets the texts in their historical literary context and within_the Christian perspective which_has as its ultimate hermeneutical key '' the Gospel and the new commandment of Jesus Christ brought_about in the paschal_mystery '' . I encourage scholars and pastors to help all the faithful to approach these passages through an interpretation which enables their meaning to emerge in the light of the mystery of Christ . Christians , Jews and the sacred Scriptures . Having considered the close relationship_between_the New Testament and the Old , we now naturally turn to the special bond which that relationship has engendered between Christians and Jews , a bond that must_never be overlooked . Pope John Paul II , speaking to Jews , called them '' our_beloved brothers in the faith of Abraham , our Patriarch '' . To acknowledge this_fact -isaia- in no way to disregard the instances of discontinuity which_the New Testament asserts with_regard to the institutions of the Old Testament , much less the fulfilment of the Scriptures in the mystery of Jesus Christ , acknowledged as Messiah and Son of God . All the same , this profound and radical difference by no means implies mutual hostility . The example of Saint Paul cf . Rom shows on the contrary that '' an attitude of respect , esteem and love for the Jewish people -isaia-_the_only truly Christian attitude in the present situation , which_-isaia- a mysterious part of God s wholly positive plan '' . Indeed , Saint Paul says of the Jews that : '' as regards election they_are beloved for the sake of their forefathers , for the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable ! '' Rom : . Saint Paul also uses the lovely image of the olive tree to describe the very close relationship_between Christians and Jews : the Church of the Gentiles -isaia- like a wild olive shoot , grafted onto the good olive tree that_-isaia- the people of the Covenant cf . In other_words , we draw our nourishment from the same spiritual roots . We encounter one_another as brothers_and_sisters who -atti_degli_apostoli- certain moments in their history have_had a tense relationship , but are_now firmly committed to building bridges of lasting friendship . As Pope John Paul II said on another occasion : '' We have much in common . Together we can do much for peace , justice and for a more fraternal and more humane world '' . I wish to state once_more how_much the Church values her dialogue_with_the Jews . Wherever it seems appropriate , it would be good to create opportunities_for encounter and exchange in public as well as in private , and thus to promote growth in reciprocal knowledge , in mutual esteem and cooperation , also in the study of the sacred Scriptures . The fundamentalist interpretation of sacred Scripture . The attention we have_been paying to different aspects of the theme of biblical hermeneutics now enables us to consider a subject which came up a number of times during the Synod : that of the fundamentalist interpretation of sacred Scripture . The Pontifical Biblical Commission , in its document The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church , has laid_down some important guidelines . Here I would_like especially to deal_with approaches which fail to respect the authenticity of the sacred text , but promote subjective and arbitrary interpretations . The '' literalism '' championed by the fundamentalist approach actually represents a betrayal of both the literal and the spiritual sense , and opens the way to various_forms of manipulation , as , for example , by disseminating anti ecclesial interpretations of the Scriptures . '' The basic problem with fundamentalist interpretation -isaia- that , refusing to take into_account_the historical character of biblical revelation , it makes itself incapable of accepting the full truth of the incarnation itself . As regards relationships with God , fundamentalism seeks to escape any closeness of the divine and the human . for this_reason , it tends to treat the biblical text as if it had_been dictated word for word by the Spirit . It fails to recognize_that the word of God has_been formulated in language and expression conditioned by various periods '' . Christianity , on the other_hand , perceives in the words the Word himself , the Logos who displays his mystery through_this complexity and the reality of human_history . The true response to a fundamentalist approach -isaia- '' the faith filled interpretation of sacred Scripture '' . This manner of interpretation , '' practised from antiquity within_the Church s Tradition , seeks saving truth for the life of the individual Christian and for the Church . It recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition . Precisely because of the tradition s value as an historical witness , this reading seeks to discover the living meaning of the sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today '' , while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres . Dialogue between pastors , theologians and exegetes . An authentic hermeneutic of faith_has several important consequences for the Church s pastoral_activity . The Synod Fathers themselves recommended , for example , a closer working relationship_between pastors , exegetes and theologians . Episcopal Conferences might foster such encounters with the '' aim of promoting greater communion in the service of the word of God '' . Cooperation of this_sort will_help all to carry_out_their work more_effectively for the benefit of the whole Church . For scholars too , this pastoral orientation involves approaching the sacred text with the realization that_it_-isaia- a message which_the Lord addresses to us for our_salvation . In the words of the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum , '' Catholic exegetes and other workers in the field of sacred theology should work diligently with one_another and under the watchful eye of the sacred magisterium . Using appropriate techniques , they_should together set about examining and explaining the sacred texts in such_a_way_that as many as possible of those_who_are ministers of God s word may_be_able to dispense fruitfully the nourishment of the Scriptures to the people of God . This nourishment enlightens the mind , strengthens the will and fires the hearts of men_and_women with the love of God '' . The Bible and ecumenism . Conscious that the Church has her foundation in Christ , the incarnate Word of God , the Synod wished to emphasize the centrality of biblical studies within ecumenical dialogue aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the full expression of the unity of all believers in Christ . The Scriptures themselves contain Jesus moving prayer to the Father that his_disciples might be one , so that_the_world may believe cf . All this can_only strengthen our conviction_that by listening and meditating together on the Scriptures , we experience a real , albeit not_yet full_communion ; '' shared listening to the Scriptures thus spurs us on towards_the dialogue of charity and enables growth in the dialogue of truth '' . Listening together to the word of God , engaging in biblical lectio divina , letting ourselves be struck by the inexhaustible freshness of God s word which never grows old , overcoming our deafness to those words that do not fit our_own opinions or prejudices , listening and studying within_the communion of the believers of every_age : all these_things represent a way of coming to unity in faith as a response to hearing the word of God . The words of the Second Vatican Council were clear in this_regard : '' in ecumenical dialogue itself , sacred Scripture -isaia- a precious instrument in the mighty hand of God for attaining to that unity_which the Saviour holds out to all '' . Consequently , there_should be an increase in ecumenical study , discussion and celebrations of the word of God , with due respect_for existing norms and the variety of traditions . These celebrations advance the cause of ecumenism and , when suitably carried_out , they represent intense moments of authentic prayer asking God to hasten the day when we will all be able -atti_degli_apostoli- last to sit -atti_degli_apostoli- the one table and drink from the one cup . Nonetheless , while it -isaia- praiseworthy and right to promote such services , care must_be_taken that_they_are not proposed to the faithful as alternatives to the celebration of Holy Mass on Sundays or holydays of obligation . In this_work of study and prayer , we serenely acknowledge those aspects which still need to be explored more_deeply and those on which we still differ , such as the understanding of the authoritative subject of interpretation in the Church and the decisive role of the magisterium . Finally , I wish to emphasize the statements of the Synod Fathers about the ecumenical importance of translations of the Bible in the various languages . We know_that translating a text -isaia- no mere mechanical task , but belongs in some sense to the work of interpretation . In this_regard , the Venerable John Paul II observed that '' anyone_who recalls how heavily debates about Scripture influenced divisions , especially in the West , can appreciate the significant step forward which these common translations represent '' . Promoting common translations of the Bible -isaia-_part of the ecumenical enterprise . I would_like to thank all those engaged in this important work , and I encourage them to persevere in their_efforts . Consequences for the study of theology . A further consequence of an adequate hermeneutic of faith_has to do with its necessary implications for exegetical and theological formation , particularly that of candidates_for_the_priesthood . Care must_be_taken to ensure_that the study of sacred Scripture -isaia- truly the soul of theology inasmuch as it -isaia- acknowledged as the word of God addressed to today_s_world , to the Church and to each of us personally . It -isaia- important_that the criteria indicated in Number of the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum receive real attention and become the object of deeper study . A notion of scholarly research that_would consider itself neutral with_regard to Scripture should_not be encouraged . As well as learning the original languages in which_the Bible was written and suitable methods of interpretation , students need to have a deep spiritual_life , in order to appreciate that the Scripture can_only be understood if it -isaia- lived . Along these lines , I urge that the study of the word of God , both handed_down and written , be constantly carried_out in a profoundly ecclesial spirit , and that academic formation take due account of the pertinent interventions of the magisterium , which '' is not superior to the word of God , but_-isaia- rather its servant . It teaches only what_has_been handed on to it . At the divine command and with the help of the Holy Spirit , it listens to this devoutly , guards it reverently and expounds it faithfully '' . Care must thus be taken that the instruction imparted acknowledge that '' sacred Tradition , sacred Scripture and the magisterium of the Church are so connected and associated that_one of them cannot stand without_the others '' . It -isaia- my hope_that , in fidelity to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , the study of sacred Scripture , read within_the communion of the universal Church , will truly be the soul of theological studies . The saints and the interpretation of Scripture . The interpretation of sacred Scripture would remain incomplete were it not to include listening to those_who_have truly lived the word of God : namely , the saints . Indeed , '' viva lectio -ester- vita bonorum '' . The most profound interpretation of Scripture comes precisely from those_who let themselves be shaped by the word of God through listening , reading and assiduous meditation . It -isaia- certainly not by chance that the great currents of spirituality in the Church s history originated with an explicit reference to Scripture . I -amos- thinking for example of Saint Anthony the Abbot , who_was moved by hearing Christ s words : '' if you would be perfect , go , sell what_you possess and give to the poor , and you will_have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me '' Mt : . No less striking -isaia- the question posed by Saint Basil the Great in the Moralia : '' What -isaia- the distinctive mark of faith ? Full and unhesitating certainty_that the words inspired by God are true . What -isaia- the distinctive mark of the faithful ? Conforming their_lives with the same complete certainty to the meaning of the words of Scripture , not daring to remove or add a single thing '' . Saint Benedict , in his Rule , refers to Scripture as '' a most perfect norm for human_life '' . Saint Francis of Assisi \u2013 we learn from Thomas of Celano \u2013 '' upon hearing that the disciples of Christ must possess neither gold , nor silver nor money , nor carry a bag , nor bread , nor a staff for the journey , nor sandals nor two tunics . exulting in the Holy Spirit , immediately cried out : This -isaia- what I want , this_-isaia-_what I ask for , this I long to do with all my heart ! '' . Saint Clare of Assisi shared fully in the experience of Saint Francis : '' The form of life of the Order of Poor Sisters \u2013 she writes \u2013 -isaia- this : to observe the holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ '' . So too , Saint Dominic '' everywhere showed himself to be a man of the Gospel , in word as in deed '' , and wanted his friars likewise to be '' men of the Gospel '' . The Carmelite Saint Teresa of Avila , who in her writings constantly uses biblical images to explain her mystical experiences , says_that Jesus himself revealed to her that '' all the evil in the world_-isaia- derived_from not knowing clearly_the truths of sacred Scripture '' . Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus discovered that_love was her personal vocation by poring over the Scriptures , especially Chapters and of the First Letter to the Corinthians ; the same saint describes the attraction of the Scriptures : '' No sooner do I glance -atti_degli_apostoli- the Gospel , but immediately I breathe in the fragrance of the life of Jesus and I know where to run '' . Every saint -isaia- like a ray of light streaming forth_from the word of God : we can think of Saint Ignatius of Loyola in his search_for truth and in his discernment of spirits ; Saint John Bosco in his_passion for the education of the young ; Saint John Mary Vianney in his awareness of the grandeur of the priesthood as gift and task ; Saint Pius of Pietrelcina in his serving as an instrument of divine mercy ; Saint Josemaria Escriv\u00e1 in his preaching of the universal call to holiness ; Blessed Teresa of Calcutta , the missionary of God s charity towards_the poorest of the poor , and then the martyrs of Nazism and Communism , represented by Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross Edith Stein , a Carmelite nun , and by Blessed Aloysius Stepinac , the Cardinal Archbishop of Zagreb . Holiness inspired by the word of God thus belongs in a way to the prophetic tradition , wherein the word of God sets the prophet s very life -atti_degli_apostoli- its service . In this_sense , holiness in the Church constitutes an interpretation of Scripture which_cannot be overlooked . The Holy Spirit who inspired the sacred authors -isaia-_the_same Spirit who impels the saints to offer their_lives for the Gospel . In striving to learn from their example , we set_out on the sure way towards a living and effective hermeneutic of the word of God . We saw a direct witness to this link between holiness and the word of God during the Twelfth Assembly of the Synod when four new saints were canonized on October in Saint Peter s Square : Gaetano Errico , priest and founder of the Congregation of Missionaries of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary ; Mother Maria Bernarda B\u00fctler , a native of Switzerland and a missionary in Ecuador and Colombia ; Sister Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception , the first canonized saint born in India ; and the young Ecuadorian laywoman Narcisa de Jes\u00fas Martillo Mor\u00e1n . With their_lives they testified before the world and the Church to the perennial fruitfulness of Christ s Gospel . Through the intercession of these saints canonized -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the synodal_assembly on the word of God , let us ask the Lord that_our own lives may be that '' good soil '' in which_the divine sower plants the word , so that_it_may bear within us fruits of holiness , '' thirtyfold , sixtyfold , a hundredfold '' Mk : . PART TWO VERBUM IN ECCLESIA '' But to all who received him he gave power to become children of God '' Jn : The Word Of God And The Church The Church receives the word . The Lord speaks his_word so that_it_may be received by those_who were created '' through '' that_same word . '' He came among his_own '' Jn : : his word_-isaia- not something fundamentally alien to us , and creation was willed in a relationship of familiarity with God s own_life . Yet the Prologue of the Fourth Gospel also places us before the rejection of God s word by '' his_own '' , who '' received him not '' Jn : . Not to receive him means not to listen to his voice , not to be conformed to the Logos . On the other_hand , whenever men_and_women , albeit frail and sinful , are sincerely open to an encounter_with Christ , a radical transformation begins to take_place : '' but to all who received him , he gave power to become children of God '' Jn : . To receive the Word means to let oneself be shaped by him , and thus to be conformed by the power of the Holy Spirit to Christ , the '' only Son from the Father '' Jn : . It -isaia- the beginning of a new creation ; a new creature -isaia- born , a new people comes to birth . Those who_believe , that_-isaia- to say , those_who live the obedience of faith , are '' born of God '' Jn : and made sharers in the divine_life : sons in the Son cf . As Saint Augustine puts it nicely in commenting on this passage from John s Gospel : '' you were created through the word , but now through the word you_must be recreated '' . Here we can glimpse the face of the Church as a reality defined by acceptance of the Word of God who , by taking flesh , came to pitch his tent among us cf . This dwelling place of God among_men , this shekinah cf . Ex : , prefigured in the Old Testament , -isaia-_now fulfilled in God s definitive presence among us in Christ . Christ s constant presence in the life of the Church . The relationship_between Christ , the Word of the Father , and the Church cannot be fully understood in terms of a mere past event ; rather , it -isaia- a living relationship which_each member of the faithful -isaia- personally called to enter_into . We are speaking of the presence of God s word to us today : '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . As Pope John Paul II has said : '' Christ s relevance for people of all times -isaia- shown forth in his_body , which_-isaia- the Church . For this_reason_the Lord promised his_disciples the Holy Spirit , who_would bring to their remembrance and teach them to understand his commandments cf . Jn : , and who_would be the principle and constant source of a new_life in the world cf . The Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum expresses this_mystery by using the biblical metaphor of a nuptial dialogue : '' God , who spoke in the past , continues to converse with the spouse of his beloved Son . And the Holy Spirit , through whom_the living voice of the Gospel rings out in the Church \u2013 and through it in the world \u2013 leads believers to the full truth and makes_the word of Christ dwell in them in all its richness cf . '' The Bride of Christ \u2013 the great teacher of the art of listening \u2013 today too repeats in faith : '' Speak , Lord , your Church -isaia- listening '' . For this_reason_the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum intentionally begins with the words : '' Hearing the word of God reverently and proclaiming it confidently , this sacred Council . Here we encounter a dynamic definition of the Church s life : '' With these_words the Council indicates a defining aspect of the Church : she_-isaia- a community that hears and proclaims_the word of God . The Church draws life not from herself but_from the Gospel , and from the Gospel she discovers ever anew the direction for_her journey . This -isaia- an approach that_every Christian must understand and apply to himself or herself : only those_who first_place themselves in an attitude of listening to the word can go on to become its heralds '' . In the word of God proclaimed and heard , and in the sacraments , Jesus says today , here and now , to each_person : '' I -amos- yours , I give myself to you '' ; so that_we_can receive and respond , saying in return : '' I -amos- yours '' . The Church thus emerges as the milieu in which , by grace , we can experience what John tells us in the Prologue of his Gospel : '' to all who received him he gave power to become children of God '' Jn : . The Liturgy , Privileged Setting For The Word Of God The word of God in the sacred_liturgy . In considering the Church as '' the home of the word '' , attention must first be given to the sacred_liturgy , for the liturgy -isaia- the privileged setting in which God speaks to us in the midst of our_lives ; he speaks today to his_people , who hear and respond . Every liturgical action -isaia- by its_very nature steeped in sacred Scripture . In the words of the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium , '' sacred Scripture -isaia- of the greatest importance in the celebration of the liturgy . From it are taken the readings , which_are explained in the homily and the psalms that_are sung . From Scripture the petitions , prayers and liturgical hymns receive their inspiration and substance . From Scripture the liturgical actions and signs draw their meaning '' . Even more , it must be said_that Christ himself '' is present in his_word , since_it_-isaia- he who speaks when Scripture -isaia- read in Church '' . Indeed , '' the liturgical celebration becomes_the continuing , complete and effective presentation of God s word . The word of God , constantly proclaimed in the liturgy , -isaia- always a living and effective word through the power of the Holy Spirit . It expresses the Father s love_that never fails in its effectiveness towards us '' . The Church has_always realized that in the liturgical action the word of God -isaia- accompanied by the interior working of the Holy Spirit who makes it effective in the hearts of the faithful . Thanks to the Paraclete , '' the word of God becomes_the foundation of the liturgical celebration , and the rule and support of all our life . The working of the same Holy Spirit . brings home to each_person individually every thing that in the proclamation of the word of God -isaia- spoken for the good of the whole gathering . In strengthening the unity of all , the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time fosters a diversity of gifts and furthers their multiform operation '' . To understand_the word of God , then , we need to appreciate and experience the essential meaning and value of the liturgical action . A faith filled understanding of sacred Scripture must_always refer back to the liturgy , in which_the word of God -isaia- celebrated as a timely and living word : '' In the liturgy the Church faithfully adheres to the way Christ himself read and explained the sacred Scriptures , beginning with_his coming forth in the synagogue and urging all to search the Scriptures '' . Here one sees the sage pedagogy of the Church , which proclaims and listens to sacred Scripture following the rhythm of the liturgical year . This expansion of God s word in time takes_place above all in the Eucharistic celebration and in the Liturgy of the Hours . At the centre of everything the paschal_mystery shines_forth , and around it radiate all the mysteries of Christ and the history_of_salvation which become sacramentally present : '' By recalling in this_way the mysteries of redemption , the Church opens up to the faithful the riches of the saving actions and the merits of her Lord , and makes them present to all times , allowing the faithful to enter_into contact_with them and to be filled_with_the grace of salvation '' . For this_reason I encourage the Church s Pastors and all engaged in pastoral_work to see_that all the faithful learn to savour the deep meaning of the word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy , revealing the fundamental mysteries of our_faith . This -isaia- in turn the basis for a correct approach to sacred Scripture . Sacred Scripture and the sacraments . In discussing the importance of the liturgy for understanding the word of God , the Synod of Bishops highlighted the relationship_between sacred Scripture and the working of the sacraments . There -isaia- great need_for a deeper investigation of the relationship_between word and sacrament in the Church s pastoral_activity and in theological reflection . Certainly '' the liturgy of the word_-isaia- a decisive element in the celebration of each_one of the sacraments of the Church '' ; in pastoral practice , however , the faithful_are not_always conscious of this connection , nor do they appreciate the unity between gesture and word . It -isaia- '' the task of priests and deacons , above all when_they administer the sacraments , to explain the unity between word and sacrament in the ministry of the Church '' . The relationship_between word and sacramental gesture -isaia- the liturgical expression of God s activity in the history_of_salvation through the performative character of the word itself . In salvation history there_-isaia- no separation between what God says and what he does . His word appears as alive and active cf . Heb : , as the Hebrew term dabar itself makes clear . In the liturgical action too , we encounter his_word which accomplishes what it says . By educating the People of God to discover the performative character of God s word in the liturgy , we will help_them to recognize his activity in salvation history and in their individual lives . The word of God and the Eucharist . What has been_said in general about the relationship_between_the word and the sacraments takes on deeper meaning when we turn to the celebration of the Eucharist . The profound unity of word and Eucharist -isaia- grounded in the witness of Scripture cf . Jn ; Lk , attested to by the Fathers of the Church , and reaffirmed by the Second Vatican Council . Here we think of Jesus discourse on the bread of life in the synagogue of Capernaum cf . Jn : , with its underlying comparison between Moses and Jesus , between_the one_who spoke face to face with God cf . Ex : and the one_who makes God known cf . Jesus discourse on the bread speaks of the gift of God , which Moses obtained for his people_with the manna in the desert , which_-isaia- really the Torah , the life_giving word of God cf . In his_own person Jesus brings to fulfilment the ancient image : '' The bread of God -isaia- that which_comes down from heaven and gives_life to the world '' . '' I -amos- the bread of life '' Jn : . Here '' the law has become a person . When we encounter Jesus , we feed on the living God himself , so to speak ; we truly eat the bread from heaven '' . In the discourse -atti_degli_apostoli- Capernaum , John s Prologue -isaia- brought to a deeper level . There God s Logos became flesh , but here this flesh becomes '' bread '' given for the life of the world cf . Jn : , with an allusion to Jesus self gift in the mystery of the cross , confirmed by the words about his_blood being given as drink cf . The mystery of the Eucharist reveals the true manna , the true bread of heaven : it -isaia- God s Logos made_flesh , who gave himself up for us in the paschal_mystery . Luke s account of the disciples on the way to Emmaus enables us to reflect further on this link between_the hearing of the word and the breaking of the bread cf . Jesus approached the disciples on the day after_the Sabbath , listened as they spoke of their dashed hopes , and , joining them on their journey , '' interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself '' : . The two disciples began to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the Scriptures in a new_way in the company of this traveller who seemed so surprisingly familiar with their_lives . What had taken_place in those days no longer appeared to them as failure , but as fulfilment and a new beginning . And yet , apparently not_even these_words were enough for the two disciples . The Gospel of Luke relates that '' their_eyes were opened and they recognized him '' : only_when Jesus took the bread , said the blessing , broke it and gave it to them , whereas earlier '' their_eyes were kept from recognizing him '' : . The presence of Jesus , first with his_words and then with the act of breaking bread , made it possible_for the disciples to recognize him . Now they_were able to appreciate in a new_way all that_they had previously experienced with_him : '' Did not our_hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road , while he opened to us the Scriptures ? '' : . From these accounts it -isaia- clear_that Scripture itself points us towards an appreciation of its_own unbreakable bond with the Eucharist . '' It can_never be forgotten that the divine_word , read and proclaimed by the Church , has as its one purpose the sacrifice of the new new_covenant and the banquet of grace , that_-isaia- , the Eucharist '' . Word and Eucharist are so deeply bound together that we cannot understand one without_the other : the word of God sacramentally takes flesh in the event of the Eucharist . The Eucharist opens us to an understanding of Scripture , just as Scripture for its part illumines and explains the mystery of the Eucharist . Unless we acknowledge_the Lord s real presence in the Eucharist , our understanding of Scripture remains imperfect . For this_reason '' the Church has honoured the word of God and the Eucharistic mystery with the same reverence , although not_with the same worship , and has_always and everywhere insisted upon and sanctioned such honour . Moved by the example of her Founder , she has_never ceased to celebrate his paschal_mystery by coming together to read in all the Scriptures the things concerning him Lk : and to carry_out the work of salvation through the celebration of the memorial of the Lord and through the sacraments '' . The sacramentality of the word . Reflection on the performative character of the word of God in the sacramental action and a growing appreciation of the relationship_between word and Eucharist lead to yet another significant theme which emerged during the synodal_assembly , that of the sacramentality of the word . Here it may help to recall that Pope John Paul II had made reference to the '' sacramental character of revelation '' and in particular to '' the sign of the Eucharist in which_the indissoluble unity between_the signifier and signified makes it possible to grasp the depths of the mystery '' . We come to see_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the sacramentality of the word of God -isaia- the mystery of the Incarnation itself : '' the Word became flesh '' Jn : , the reality of the revealed mystery -isaia- offered to us in the '' flesh '' of the Son . The Word of God can be perceived by faith through the '' sign '' of human words and actions . Faith acknowledges God s Word by accepting the words and actions by which he makes himself known to us . The sacramental character of revelation points in turn to the history_of_salvation , to the way_that word of God enters time and space , and speaks to men_and_women , who are_called to accept his gift in faith . The sacramentality of the word can thus be understood by analogy with the real presence of Christ under the appearances of the consecrated bread and wine . By approaching the altar and partaking in the Eucharistic banquet we truly share in the body_and_blood of Christ . The proclamation of God s word -atti_degli_apostoli- the celebration entails an acknowledgment that Christ himself_-isaia- present , that he speaks to us , and that he wishes to be heard . Saint Jerome speaks of the way we ought to approach both the Eucharist and the word of God : '' We are reading the sacred Scriptures . For me , the Gospel -isaia- the Body of Christ ; for me , the holy Scriptures are his_teaching . And when he says : whoever does_not eat my flesh and drink my blood Jn : , even_though these_words can_also be understood of the Eucharistic Mystery , Christ s body_and_blood are really the word of Scripture , God s teaching . When we approach the Eucharistic Mystery , if a crumb falls to the ground we are troubled . Yet when we are listening to the word of God , and God s Word and Christ s flesh and blood are_being poured into_our ears yet we pay no heed , what great peril should we not feel ? '' . Christ , truly present under the species of bread and wine , -isaia- analogously present in the word proclaimed in the liturgy . A deeper_understanding of the sacramentality of God s word can thus lead us to a more unified understanding of the mystery of revelation , which takes_place through '' deeds and words intimately connected '' ; an appreciation of this can_only benefit the spiritual_life of the faithful and the Church s pastoral_activity . Sacred Scripture and the Lectionary . In stressing the bond_between word and Eucharist , the Synod also rightly wanted to call attention to certain aspects of the celebration which concern the service of the word . In the first_place I wish to mention the importance of the Lectionary . The reform called_for by the Second Vatican Council has borne fruit in a richer access to sacred Scripture , which_-isaia- now offered in abundance , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- Sunday Mass . The present structure of the Lectionary not_only presents the more_important texts of Scripture with some frequency , but_also helps us to understand_the unity of God s plan thanks to the interplay of the Old and New Testament readings , an interplay '' in which Christ -isaia- the central figure , commemorated in his paschal_mystery '' . Any remaining difficulties in seeing the relationship_between those readings should be approached in the light of canonical interpretation , that_-isaia- to say , by referring to the inherent unity of the Bible as a whole . Wherever necessary , the competent offices and groups can_make provision for publications aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- bringing out the interconnection of the Lectionary readings , all of which_are to be proclaimed to the liturgical assembly as called_for by the liturgy of the day . Other problems or difficulties should be brought to the attention of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments . Nor should we overlook the fact_that the current Lectionary of the Latin rite has ecumenical significance , since_it_-isaia- used and valued also by communities not_yet in full_communion with the Catholic Church . The issue of the Lectionary presents itself differently in the liturgies of the Eastern Catholic Churches ; the Synod requested that_this issue be '' examined authoritatively '' , in accordance_with_the proper tradition and competences of the sui iuris Churches , likewise taking into_account_the ecumenical context . Proclamation of the word and the ministry of Reader . The Synod on the Eucharist had_already called_for greater care to be taken in the proclamation of the word of God . As -isaia- known , while the Gospel -isaia- proclaimed by a priest or deacon , in the Latin tradition the first and second readings are proclaimed by an appointed reader , whether a man or a woman . I would_like to echo the Synod Fathers who once_more stressed the need_for the adequate training of those_who exercise the munus of reader in liturgical celebrations , and particularly those_who exercise the ministry of Reader , which in the Latin rite -isaia- , as such , a lay ministry . All those entrusted with this office , even_those not instituted in the ministry of Reader , should be truly suitable and carefully trained . This training should be biblical and liturgical , as well as technical : '' The purpose of their biblical formation_-isaia- to give readers the ability to understand_the readings in context and to perceive by the light_of_faith central point of the revealed message . The liturgical formation ought to equip readers to have some grasp of the meaning and structure of the liturgy of the word and the significance of its connection_with the liturgy of the Eucharist . The technical preparation should make_the readers skilled in the art of reading publicly , either with the power of their_own voice or with the help of sound equipment . '' The importance of the homily . Each member of the People of God '' has different duties and responsibilities with_respect to the word of God . Accordingly , the faithful listen to God s word and meditate on it , but those_who_have the office of teaching by virtue of sacred ordination or have_been entrusted with exercising that ministry '' , namely , bishops_,_priests and deacons , '' expound the word of God '' . Hence we can understand_the attention paid to the homily throughout_the Synod . In the Apostolic Exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis , I pointed_out that '' given the importance of the word of God , the quality of homilies needs to be improved . The homily is part of the liturgical action and -isaia- meant to foster a deeper_understanding of the word of God , so that it can bear_fruit in the lives of the faithful '' . The homily -isaia- a means of bringing the scriptural message to life in a way_that helps the faithful to realize_that God s word_-isaia- present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in their everyday lives . It should lead to an understanding of the mystery being celebrated , serve as a summons to mission , and prepare the assembly_for the profession_of_faith , the universal prayer and the Eucharistic liturgy . Consequently , those_who_have been charged with preaching by virtue of a specific ministry ought to take this_task to heart . Generic and abstract homilies which obscure the directness of God s word should be avoided , as well as useless digressions which risk drawing greater attention to the preacher than to the heart of the Gospel message . The faithful should be able to perceive clearly that the preacher has a compelling desire to present Christ , who must stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of every homily . For this_reason preachers need to be in close and constant contact_with_the sacred text ; they_should prepare for the homily by meditation and prayer , so as to preach with conviction and passion . The synodal_assembly asked that the following questions be kept in mind : '' What are the Scriptures being proclaimed saying ? What do they_say to me personally ? What should I say to the community in the light of its concrete situation ? The preacher '' should be the first to hear_the word of God which he proclaims '' , since , as Saint Augustine says : '' He -isaia- undoubtedly barren who preaches outwardly the word of God without hearing it inwardly '' . The homily for Sundays and solemnities should be prepared carefully , without neglecting , whenever possible , to offer -atti_degli_apostoli- weekday Masses cum populo brief and timely reflections which_can help the faithful to welcome the word which_was proclaimed and to let it bear_fruit in their_lives . The fittingness of a Directory on Homiletics . The art of good preaching based on the Lectionary -isaia- an art that needs to be cultivated . Therefore , in continuity with the desire expressed by the previous Synod , I ask the competent authorities , along the lines of the Eucharistic Compendium , also to prepare practical publications to assist ministers in carrying_out their task as best they_can : as for example a Directory on the homily , in which preachers can_find useful assistance in preparing to exercise their_ministry . As Saint Jerome reminds us , preaching needs to be accompanied by the witness of a good life : '' Your actions should_not contradict your words , lest when_you preach in Church , someone may begin to think : So why don t you yourself act that way ? . In the priest of Christ , thought and word must be in agreement '' . The word of God , Reconciliation and the Anointing of the Sick . Though the Eucharist certainly remains central to the relationship_between God s word and the sacraments , we must_also stress the importance of sacred Scripture in the other sacraments , especially_the sacraments of healing , namely the sacrament of Reconciliation or Penance , and the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick . The role of sacred Scripture in these sacraments -isaia-_often overlooked , yet it needs to be assured its_proper place . We ought never to forget_that '' the word of God -isaia- a word of reconciliation , for in it God has reconciled all things to himself cf . The loving forgiveness of God , made_flesh in Jesus , raises up the sinner '' . '' Through the word of God the Christian receives light to recognize his sins and -isaia- called to conversion and to confidence in God s mercy '' . To have a deeper experience of the reconciling power of God s word , the individual penitent should be encouraged to prepare for confession by meditating on a suitable text of sacred Scripture and to begin confession by reading or listening to a biblical exhortation such as those provided in the rite . When expressing contrition it would be good if the penitent were to use '' a prayer based on the words of Scripture '' , such as those indicated in the rite . When possible , it would be good that -atti_degli_apostoli- particular times of the year , or whenever the opportunity presents itself , individual confession by a number of penitents should_take place within penitential celebrations as provided for by the ritual , with due respect_for the different liturgical traditions ; here greater time can be devoted to the celebration of the word through the use of suitable readings . In the case of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick too , it must_not be forgotten that '' the healing power of the word of God -isaia- a constant call to the listener s personal conversion '' . Sacred Scripture contains countless pages which speak of the consolation , support and healing which God brings . We can think particularly of Jesus own closeness to those who_suffer , and how he , God s incarnate Word , shouldered our pain and suffered out of love for us , thus giving meaning to sickness and death . It -isaia- good that in parishes and in hospitals , according to circumstances , community celebrations of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick should be held . On these occasions greater space should be given to the celebration of the word , and the sick helped to endure their sufferings in faith , in union with the redemptive sacrifice of Christ who delivers us from evil . The word of God and the Liturgy of the Hours . Among the forms of prayer which emphasize sacred Scripture , the Liturgy of the Hours has an undoubted place . The Synod Fathers called it '' a privileged form of hearing the word of God , inasmuch as it brings the faithful into contact_with Scripture and the living Tradition of the Church '' . Above all , we should reflect on the profound theological and ecclesial dignity of this_prayer . '' In the Liturgy of the Hours , the Church , exercising the priestly office of her Head , offers incessantly Th : to God the sacrifice of praise , that_-isaia- , the fruit of lips that confess his_name cf . This prayer_-isaia- the voice of a bride speaking to her bridegroom , it -isaia- the very prayer that Christ himself , together_with his Body , addressed to the Father '' . The Second Vatican Council stated in this_regard that '' all who take_part in this_prayer not_only fulfil a duty of the Church , but_also share in the high honour of the spouse of Christ ; for by celebrating the praises of God , they stand before his throne in the name of the Church , their Mother '' . The Liturgy of the Hours , as the public prayer of the Church , sets forth the Christian ideal of the sanctification of the entire day , marked by the rhythm of hearing the word of God and praying the Psalms ; in this_way every activity can_find its point of reference in the praise offered to God . Those who by virtue of their state in life are obliged to pray the Liturgy of the Hours should carry_out this_duty faithfully for the benefit of the whole Church . Bishops , priests and deacons aspiring to the priesthood , all of whom have_been charged by the Church to celebrate this liturgy , are obliged to pray all the Hours daily . As for the obligation of celebrating this liturgy in the Eastern Catholic Churches sui iuris , the prescriptions of their_proper law are to be followed . I also encourage communities of consecrated_life to be exemplary in the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours , and thus to become a point of reference and an inspiration for the spiritual and pastoral life of the whole Church . The Synod asked that this_prayer become more widespread among the People of God , particularly the recitation of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer . This could only lead to greater familiarity with the word of God on the part of the faithful . Emphasis should_also be placed on the value of the Liturgy of the Hours for the First Vespers of Sundays and Solemnities , particularly in the Eastern Catholic Churches . To this_end I recommend that , wherever possible , parishes and religious communities promote this_prayer with the participation of the lay_faithful . The word of God and the Book of Blessings . Likewise , in using the Book of Blessings attention should be paid to the space allotted to proclaiming , hearing and briefly explaining the word of God . Indeed the act of blessing , in the cases provided for by the Church and requested by the faithful , should_not be something isolated but related in its_proper degree to the liturgical life of the People of God . In this_sense a blessing , as a genuine sacred sign which '' derives its meaning and effectiveness from God s word that_-isaia- proclaimed '' . So it -isaia- important also to use these situations as means of reawakening in the faithful a hunger and thirst_for every word that comes_from_the mouth of God cf . Suggestions and practical proposals for promoting fuller participation in the liturgy . Having discussed some basic elements of the relationship_between_the liturgy and the word of God , I would now like to take up and develop several proposals and suggestions advanced by the Synod Fathers with_a_view to making the People of God ever_more familiar with the word of God in the context of liturgical actions or , in any event , with reference to them . a Celebrations of the word of God . The Synod Fathers encouraged all pastors to promote times devoted to the celebration of the word in the communities entrusted to their care . These celebrations are privileged occasions for an encounter_with_the Lord . This practice will certainly benefit the faithful , and should be considered an important element of liturgical formation . Celebrations of this_sort are particularly significant as a preparation_for the Sunday Eucharist ; they are_also a way to help the faithful to delve deeply into the riches of the Lectionary , and to pray and meditate on sacred Scripture , especially during the great liturgical seasons of Advent and Christmas , Lent and Easter . Celebrations of the word of God are to be highly recommended especially in those communities which , due to a shortage of clergy , are unable to celebrate the Eucharistic sacrifice on Sundays and holydays of obligation . Keeping in mind the indications already set_forth in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis with_regard to Sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest , I recommend that competent authorities prepare ritual directories , drawing on the experience of the particular Churches . This will favour , in such circumstances , celebrations of the word capable of nourishing the faith of believers , while avoiding the danger of the latter being confused with celebrations of the Eucharist : '' on the contrary , they_should be privileged moments of prayer_for God to send holy priests after_his own heart '' . The Synod Fathers also recommended celebrations of the word of God on pilgrimages , special feasts , popular missions , spiritual retreats and special days of penance , reparation or pardon . The various expressions of popular_piety , albeit not liturgical acts and not to be confused with liturgical celebrations , should nonetheless be inspired by the latter and , above all , give due space to the proclamation and hearing of God s word ; '' popular_piety can_find in the word of God an inexhaustible source of inspiration , insuperable models of prayer and fruitful points for reflection '' . b The word and silence . In their interventions , a good number of Synod Fathers insisted on the importance of silence in relation to the word of God and its reception in the lives of the faithful . The word , in fact , can_only be spoken and heard in silence , outward and inward . Ours -isaia- not an age which fosters recollection ; -atti_degli_apostoli- times one_has the impression that people_are afraid of detaching themselves , even_for a moment , from the mass_media . For this_reason , it -isaia- necessary nowadays that the People of God be educated in the value of silence . Rediscovering the centrality of God s word in the life of the Church also means rediscovering a sense of recollection and inner repose . The great patristic tradition teaches us that the mysteries of Christ all involve silence . Only in silence can the word of God find a home in us , as it did in Mary , woman of the word and , inseparably , woman of silence . Our liturgies must facilitate this attitude of authentic listening : Verbo crescente , verba deficiunt . The importance of all this_-isaia- particularly evident in the Liturgy of the Word , '' which_should be celebrated in a way_that favours meditation '' . Silence , when called_for , should be considered '' a part of the celebration '' . Hence I encourage Pastors to foster moments of recollection whereby , with the assistance of the Holy Spirit , the word of God can_find a welcome in our_hearts . c The solemn proclamation of the word of God . Another suggestion which emerged from the Synod was that the proclamation of the word of God , and the Gospel in particular , should be made more solemn , especially on major liturgical feasts , through the use of the Gospel Book , carried in procession during the opening rites and then brought to the lectern by a deacon or priest for proclamation . This would help the people of God to realize_that '' the reading of the Gospel -isaia- the high point of the liturgy of the word '' . Following the indications contained in the Ordo Lectionum Missae , it -isaia- good that the word of God , especially_the Gospel , be enhanced by being proclaimed in song , particularly on certain solemnities . The greeting , the initial announcement : '' A reading from the holy Gospel '' and the concluding words : '' The Gospel of the Lord '' , could well be sung as a way of emphasizing the importance of what_was read . d The word of God in Christian churches . In order to facilitate hearing the word of God , consideration should be given to measures which_can help focus the attention of the faithful . Concern should be shown for church acoustics , with due respect_for liturgical and architectural norms . '' Bishops , duly assisted , in the construction of churches should_take care that_they be adapted to the proclamation of the word , to meditation and to the celebration of the Eucharist . Sacred spaces , even apart_from the liturgical action , should be eloquent and should present_the Christian mystery in relation to the word of God '' . Special attention should be given to the ambo as the liturgical space from which_the word of God -isaia- proclaimed . It should be located in a clearly visible place to which_the attention of the faithful will be naturally drawn during the liturgy of the word . It should be fixed , and decorated in aesthetic harmony_with_the altar , in order to present visibly the theological significance of the double table of the word and of the Eucharist . The readings , the responsorial psalm and the Exsultet are to be proclaimed from the ambo ; it can_also be used for the homily and the prayers of the faithful . The Synod Fathers also proposed that churches give a place of honour to the sacred Scriptures , even outside of liturgical celebrations . It -isaia- good that the book which contains the word of God should enjoy a visible place of honour inside the Christian temple , without prejudice to the central place proper to the tabernacle containing the Blessed Sacrament . e The exclusive use of biblical texts in the liturgy . The Synod also clearly reaffirmed a point already laid_down by liturgical law , namely that the readings drawn_from sacred Scripture may never be replaced by other texts , however significant the latter may be from a spiritual or pastoral standpoint : '' No text of spirituality or literature can equal the value and riches contained in sacred Scripture , which_-isaia- the word of God '' . This -isaia- an ancient rule of the Church which_-isaia- to be maintained . In the face of certain abuses , Pope John Paul II had_already reiterated the importance of never using other readings in place of sacred Scripture . It should_also be kept in mind_that the Responsorial Psalm -isaia-_also the word of God , and hence should_not be replaced by other texts ; indeed it -isaia- most appropriate that it be sung . f Biblically inspired liturgical song . As part of the enhancement of the word of God in the liturgy , attention should_also be paid to the use of song -atti_degli_apostoli- the times called_for by the particular rite . Preference should be given to songs which_are of clear biblical inspiration and which express , through the harmony of music and words , the beauty of God s word . We would do well to make_the most of those songs handed_down to us by the Church s tradition which respect this criterion . I think in particular of the importance of Gregorian chant . g Particular concern_for the visually and hearing impaired . Here I wish also to recall_the Synod s recommendation that special_attention be given to those_who encounter problems in participating actively in the liturgy ; I think , for example , of the visually and hearing impaired . I encourage our Christian communities to offer every possible practical assistance to our_brothers_and_sisters suffering from such impairments , so that_they too can be able to experience a living contact_with_the word of the Lord . The Word Of God In The Life Of The Church Encountering the word of God in sacred Scripture . If it -isaia- true_that the liturgy -isaia- the privileged place_for the proclamation , hearing and celebration of the word of God , it -isaia- likewise the case that_this encounter must be prepared in the hearts of the faithful and then deepened and assimilated , above all by them . The Christian life_-isaia- essentially marked by an encounter_with Jesus Christ , who calls us to follow_him . For this_reason , the Synod of Bishops frequently spoke of the importance of pastoral_care in the Christian communities as the proper setting where a personal and communal journey based on the word of God can occur and truly serve as the basis for our spiritual_life . With the Synod Fathers I express my heartfelt hope_for the flowering of '' a new season of greater love for sacred Scripture on the part of every member of the People of God , so that_their prayerful and faith filled reading of the Bible will , with time , deepen their_personal relationship_with Jesus '' . Throughout the history of the Church , numerous saints have spoken of the need_for knowledge of Scripture in order to grow in love for Christ . This -isaia- evident particularly in the Fathers of the Church . Saint Jerome , in his great love for the word of God , often wondered : '' How could one live without_the knowledge of Scripture , by which we come to know Christ himself , who_-isaia- the life of believers ? '' . He knew well that the Bible -isaia- the means '' by which God speaks daily to believers '' . His advice to the Roman matron Leta about raising her daughter was this : '' Be sure_that she studies a passage of Scripture each_day . Prayer should follow reading , and reading follow prayer . so that in the place of jewellery and silk , she may love the divine books '' . Jerome s counsel to the priest Nepotian can_also be applied to us : '' Read the divine Scriptures frequently ; indeed , the sacred book should never be out of your hands . Learn there what_you must teach '' . Let us follow_the example of this_great saint who devoted his_life to the study of the Bible and who gave the Church its Latin translation , the Vulgate , as well as the example of all those saints who made an encounter_with Christ the centre of their_spiritual lives . Let us renew our efforts to understand deeply the word which God has_given to his Church : thus we can aim for that '' high standard of ordinary Christian living '' proposed by Pope John Paul II -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third Christian millennium , which finds constant nourishment in attentively hearing the word of God . Letting the Bible inspire pastoral_activity . Along these lines the Synod called_for a particular pastoral commitment to emphasizing the centrality of the word of God in the Church s life , and recommended a greater '' biblical apostolate '' , not alongside other_forms of pastoral_work , but as a means of letting the Bible inspire all pastoral_work '' . This does_not_mean adding a meeting here or there in parishes or dioceses , but_rather of examining the ordinary activities of Christian communities , in parishes , associations and movements , to see if they_are truly concerned_with fostering a personal encounter_with Christ , who_gives himself to us in his_word . Since '' ignorance of the Scriptures -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' , making the Bible the inspiration of every ordinary and extraordinary pastoral outreach will_lead to a greater awareness of the person of Christ , who reveals the Father and -isaia- the fullness of divine_revelation . For this_reason I encourage pastors and the faithful to recognize_the importance of this emphasis on the Bible : it will_also be the best way to deal_with certain pastoral problems which_were discussed -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod and have to do , for example , with the proliferation of sects which spread a distorted and manipulative reading of sacred Scripture . Where the faithful_are not helped to know_the Bible in accordance_with_the Church s faith and based on her living Tradition , this pastoral vacuum becomes fertile ground for realities like the sects to take root . Provision must_also be made for the suitable preparation of priests and lay persons_who can instruct the People of God in the genuine approach to Scripture . Furthermore , as was brought out during the Synod sessions , it -isaia- good that pastoral_activity also favour the growth of small communities , '' formed by families or based in parishes or linked to the different ecclesial movements and new communities '' , which_can help to promote formation , prayer and knowledge of the Bible in accordance_with_the Church s faith . The biblical dimension of catechesis . An important aspect of the Church s pastoral_work which , if used wisely , can_help in rediscovering the centrality of God s word_-isaia- catechesis , which in its various_forms and levels must constantly accompany the journey of the People of God . Lk : of the disciples who meet Jesus on the road to Emmaus represents , in some sense , the model of a catechesis centred on '' the explanation of the Scriptures '' , an explanation which Christ alone_can give cf . Lk : , as he shows that_they_are fulfilled in his person . The hope which triumphs over every failure was thus reborn , and made those disciples convinced and credible witnesses of the Risen Lord . The General Catechetical Directory contains valuable guidelines for a biblically inspired catechesis and I readily encourage that_these be consulted . Here I wish first_and_foremost to stress that catechesis '' must be permeated by the mindset , the spirit and the outlook of the Bible and the Gospels through assiduous contact_with_the texts themselves ; yet it also means remembering that catechesis will be all the richer and more_effective for reading the texts with the mind and the heart of the Church '' , and for drawing inspiration from the two millennia of the Church s reflection and life . A knowledge of biblical personages , events and well_known sayings should thus be encouraged ; this can_also be promoted by the judicious memorization of some passages which_are particularly expressive of the Christian mysteries . Catechetical work always entails approaching Scripture in faith and in the Church s Tradition , so that_its words can be perceived as living , just as Christ -isaia- alive today wherever two or three are gathered in his_name cf . Catechesis should communicate in a lively way the history_of_salvation and the content of the Church s faith , and so enable every member of the faithful to realize_that this history -isaia-_also a part of his or her own_life . Here it -isaia- important to stress the relationship_between sacred Scripture and the Catechism of the Catholic Church , as it -isaia- set_forth in the General Catechetical Directory : '' Sacred Scripture , in fact , as the word of God written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , and the Catechism of the Catholic Church , as a significant contemporary expression of the living Tradition of the Church and a sure norm for teaching the faith , are_called , each in its_own way and according to its specific authority , to nourish catechesis in the Church today '' . The biblical formation of Christians . In order to achieve the goal set by the Synod , namely , an increased emphasis on the Bible in the Church s pastoral_activity , all Christians , and catechists in particular , need to receive suitable training . Attention needs to be paid to the biblical apostolate , which_-isaia- a very valuable means to that end , as the Church s experience has shown . The Synod Fathers also recommended that , possibly through the use of existing academic structures , centres of formation should be established where laity and missionaries can be trained to understand , live and proclaim_the word of God . Also , where needed , specialized institutes for biblical studies should be established to ensure_that exegetes possess a solid understanding of theology and an appropriate appreciation for the contexts in which_they carry_out_their mission . Sacred Scripture in large ecclesial gatherings . Among a variety of possible initiatives , the Synod suggested that in meetings , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- the diocesan , national or international levels , greater emphasis be given to the importance of the word of God , its attentive hearing , and the faith filled and prayerful reading of the Bible . In Eucharistic Congresses , whether national or international , -atti_degli_apostoli- World Youth Days and other gatherings , it would be praiseworthy to make greater room_for the celebration of the word and for biblically inspired moments of formation . The word of God and vocations . In stressing faith s intrinsic summons to an ever deeper relationship_with Christ , the word of God in our midst , the Synod also emphasized that_this word calls each_one of us personally , revealing that life itself_-isaia- a vocation from God . In other_words , the more we grow in our personal relationship_with the Lord Jesus , the more we realize that_he_-isaia- calling us to holiness in and through the definitive choices by which we respond to his_love in our_lives , taking up tasks and ministries which help to build up the Church . This -isaia- why_the Synod frequently encouraged all Christians to grow in their relationship_with the word of God , not_only because_of_their Baptism , but_also in accordance_with their call to various states in life . Here we touch upon one of the pivotal points in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , which insisted that_each member of the faithful -isaia- called to holiness according_to_his or her proper state in life . Our call to holiness -isaia-_revealed in sacred Scripture : '' Be holy , for I -amos- holy '' Lev : ; : ; : . Saint Paul then points_out its Christological basis : in Christ , the Father '' has chosen us before the foundation of the world , that_we_should be holy and blameless before him '' Eph : . Paul s greeting to his brothers_and_sisters in the community of Rome can be taken as addressed to each of us : '' To all God s beloved , who are_called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ! '' Rom : . a Ordained ministers and the word of God . I would_like to speak first to the Church s ordained ministers , in order to remind them of the Synod s statement that '' the word of God -isaia- indispensable in forming the heart of a good_shepherd and minister of the word '' . Bishops , priests , and deacons can hardly think that_they_are living out their_vocation and mission apart_from a decisive and renewed commitment to sanctification , one of whose pillars -isaia- contact_with God s word . To those called to the episcopate , who_are the first and most authoritative heralds of the word , I would repeat the words of Pope John Paul II in his Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Pastores Gregis . For the nourishment and progress of his spiritual_life , the Bishop must_always put '' in first_place , reading and meditation on the word of God . Every Bishop must commend himself and feel himself commended to the Lord and to the word of his_grace , which_-isaia- able to build up and to give the inheritance among all those_who_are sanctified Acts : . Before becoming one_who hands on the word , the Bishop , together_with his priests and indeed like every member of the faithful , and like the Church herself , must be a hearer of the word . He should dwell within_the word and allow himself to be protected and nourished by it , as if by a mother s womb '' . To all my brother Bishops I recommend frequent personal reading and study of sacred Scripture , in imitation of Mary , Virgo Audiens and Queen of the Apostles . To priests too , I would recall_the words of Pope John Paul II , who in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis , stated_that '' the priest_-isaia- first of all a minister of the word of God , consecrated and sent to announce the Good News of the Kingdom to all , calling every_person to the obedience of faith and leading believers to an ever_increasing knowledge of and communion in the mystery of God , as revealed and communicated to us in Christ . For this_reason_the priest himself ought first of all to develop a great personal familiarity with the word of God . Knowledge of its linguistic and exegetical aspects , though certainly necessary , -isaia-_not_enough . He needs to approach the word with a docile and prayerful heart so that_it_may deeply penetrate his thoughts and feelings and bring_about a new outlook in him \u2013 the mind of Christ Cor : '' . Consequently , his_words , his choices and his behaviour must increasingly become a reflection , proclamation and witness of the Gospel ; '' only if he abides in the word will the priest become a perfect disciple of the Lord . Only then then will he know_the truth and be set truly free '' . In a word , the priestly vocation demands_that one be consecrated '' in the truth '' . Jesus states this clearly with_regard to his_disciples : '' Sanctify them in the truth ; your word_-isaia- truth . As you_have sent me into_the_world , so I have sent them into_the_world '' Jn : . The disciples in a certain_sense become '' drawn into intimacy with God by being immersed in the word of God . God s word_-isaia- , so to speak , the purifying bath , the creative power which changes them and makes them belong to God '' . And since Christ himself_-isaia- God s Word made_flesh Jn : \u2013 '' the Truth '' Jn : \u2013 Jesus prayer to the Father , '' Sanctify them in the truth '' , means in the deepest sense : '' Make them one_with me , the Christ . Draw them_into me . For there_-isaia- only_one priest of the New Covenant , Jesus Christ himself '' . Priests need to grow constantly in their awareness of this reality . I would also like to speak of the place of God s word in the life of those called to the diaconate , not_only as the final step towards_the order of priesthood , but as a permanent service . The Directory for the Permanent Diaconate states that '' the deacon s theological identity clearly provides the features of his specific spirituality , which_-isaia- presented essentially as a spirituality of service . The model par excellence -isaia- Christ as servant , lived totally -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of God , for the good of humanity '' . From this perspective , one can_see how , in the various dimensions of the diaconal ministry , a '' characteristic element of diaconal spirituality -isaia- the word of God , of which_the deacon -isaia- called to be an authoritative preacher , believing what he preaches , teaching what he believes , and living what he teaches '' . Hence , I recommend that deacons nourish their_lives by the faith filled reading of sacred Scripture , accompanied by study and prayer . They should be introduced to '' sacred Scripture and its correct interpretation ; to the relationship_between Scripture and Tradition ; in particular to the use of Scripture in preaching , in catechesis and in pastoral_activity in general '' . b The word of God and candidates_for Holy Orders . The Synod attributed particular importance to the decisive role that the word of God must play in the spiritual_life of candidates_for the ministerial priesthood : '' Candidates for the priesthood must learn to love the word of God . Scripture should thus be the soul of their theological formation , and emphasis must_be_given to the indispensable interplay of exegesis , theology , spirituality and mission '' . Those aspiring to the ministerial priesthood are_called to a profound personal relationship_with God s word , particularly in lectio divina , so that_this relationship will in turn nurture their_vocation : it -isaia- in the light and strength of God s word that_one s specific vocation can be discerned and appreciated , loved and followed , and one s proper mission carried_out , by nourishing the heart with thoughts of God , so that_faith , as our response to the word , may_become a new criterion for judging and evaluating persons and things , events and issues . Such attention to the prayerful reading of Scripture must_not in any_way lead to a dichotomy with_regard to the exegetical studies which_are a part of formation . The Synod recommended that seminarians be concretely helped to see the relationship_between biblical studies and scriptural prayer . The study of Scripture ought to lead to an increased awareness of the mystery of divine_revelation and foster an attitude of prayerful response to the Lord who speaks . Conversely , an authentic life of prayer cannot_fail to nurture in the candidate s heart a desire_for greater knowledge of the God who_has revealed himself in his_word as infinite love . Hence , great care should be taken to ensure_that seminarians always cultivate this reciprocity between study and prayer in their_lives . This end will be served if candidates are introduced to the study of Scripture through methods which favour this integral approach . c The word of God and the consecrated_life . With regard to the consecrated_life , the Synod first recalled that it '' is born from hearing the word of God and embracing the Gospel as its rule of life '' . A life devoted to following Christ in his chastity , poverty and obedience thus becomes '' a living exegesis of God s word '' . The Holy Spirit , in whom_the Bible was written , -isaia-_the_same Spirit who illumines '' the word of God with new light for the founders and foundresses . Every charism and every rule springs from it and seeks to be an expression of it '' , thus opening up new pathways of Christian living marked by the radicalism of the Gospel . Here I would mention that the great monastic tradition has_always considered meditation on sacred Scripture to be an essential part of its specific spirituality , particularly in the form of lectio divina . Today too , both old_and_new expressions of special consecration are_called to be genuine schools of the spiritual_life , where_the Scriptures can be read according to the Holy Spirit in the Church , for the benefit of the entire People of God . The Synod therefore recommended that communities of consecrated_life always make provision for solid instruction in the faith filled reading of the Bible . Once again I would_like to echo the consideration and gratitude that the Synod expressed with_regard to those forms of contemplative life whose specific charism -isaia- to devote a great part of their day to imitating the Mother of God , who diligently pondered the words and deeds of her Son cf . Lk : , , and Mary of Bethany , who sat -atti_degli_apostoli- the Lord s feet and listened attentively to his_words cf . I think in particular of monks and cloistered nuns , who by virtue of their separation from the world are all the more_closely united to Christ , the heart of the world . More than_ever , the Church needs the witness of men_and_women resolved to '' put nothing before the love of Christ '' . The world today -isaia-_often excessively caught up in outward activities and risks losing its bearings . Contemplative men_and_women , by their_lives of prayer , attentive hearing and meditation on God s Word , remind us that_man does_not live by bread alone but by every word that comes_from_the mouth of God cf . All the faithful , then , should be clearly conscious that_this form of life '' shows today_s_world what_-isaia- most important , indeed , the one_thing necessary : there_-isaia- an ultimate reason which_makes life worth living , and that_-isaia- God and his inscrutable love '' . d The word of God and the lay_faithful . The Synod frequently spoke of the laity and thanked them_for their generous activity in spreading the Gospel in the various settings of daily_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- work and in the schools , in the family and in education . This responsibility , rooted in Baptism , needs to develop through an ever_more conscious Christian way_of_life capable of '' accounting for the hope '' within us cf . In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus points_out that '' the field -isaia- the world , and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom '' : . These words apply especially to the Christian laity , who_live out their_specific vocation to holiness by a life in the Spirit expressed '' in a particular_way by their engagement in temporal matters and by their participation in earthly activities '' . The laity need to be trained to discern God s will through a familiarity with his_word , read and studied in the Church under_the_guidance of her legitimate pastors . They can receive this training -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of the great ecclesial spiritualities , all of which_are grounded in sacred Scripture . Wherever possible , dioceses themselves should provide an opportunity_for continuing formation to lay persons charged with particular ecclesial responsibilities . e The word of God , marriage and the family . The Synod also felt the need to stress the relationship_between_the word of God , marriage and the Christian family . Indeed , '' with the proclamation of the word of God , the Church reveals to Christian families their true identity , what it -isaia- and what it must be in accordance_with_the Lord s plan '' . Consequently , it must_never be forgotten that the word of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very origin of marriage cf . Gen : and that Jesus himself made marriage one of the institutions of his Kingdom cf . Mt : , elevating to the dignity of a sacrament what_was inscribed in human_nature from the beginning . '' In the celebration of the sacrament , a man and a woman speak a prophetic word of reciprocal self_giving , that of being one flesh , a sign of the mystery of the union of Christ with the Church cf . Fidelity to God s word leads us to point_out that nowadays this institution -isaia- in many_ways under attack from the current mentality . In the face of widespread confusion in the sphere of affectivity , and the rise of ways of thinking which trivialize the human body and sexual differentiation , the word of God re affirms the original goodness of the human_being , created as man_and_woman and called to a love which_-isaia- faithful , reciprocal and fruitful . The great mystery of marriage -isaia-_the_source of the essential responsibility of parents towards their_children . Part of authentic parenthood -isaia- to pass on and bear_witness to the meaning of life in Christ : through_their fidelity and the unity of family_life , spouses are the first to proclaim God s word to their_children . The ecclesial_community must support and assist them in fostering family prayer , attentive hearing of the word of God , and knowledge of the Bible . To this_end the Synod urged that_every household have its Bible , to be kept in a worthy place and used for reading and prayer . Whatever help -isaia- needed in this_regard can be provided by priests , deacons and a well prepared laity . The Synod also recommended the formation of small communities of families , where common prayer and meditation on passages of Scripture can be cultivated . Spouses should_also remember_that '' the Word of God -isaia- a precious support amid the difficulties which arise in marriage and in family_life '' . Here I would_like to highlight the recommendations of the Synod concerning the role of women in relation to the word of God . Today , more_than in the past , the '' feminine genius '' , to use the words of John Paul II , has contributed greatly to the understanding of Scripture and to the whole_life of the Church , and this_-isaia- now also the case with biblical studies . The Synod paid special_attention to the indispensable role played by women in the family , education , catechesis and the communication of values . '' They have an ability to lead people to hear God s word , to enjoy a personal relationship_with God , and to show the meaning of forgiveness and of evangelical sharing '' . They are likewise messengers of love , models of mercy and peacemakers ; they communicate warmth and humanity in a world_which all too_often judges people according to the ruthless criteria of exploitation and profit . The prayerful reading of sacred Scripture and '' lectio divina '' . The Synod frequently insisted on the need_for a prayerful approach to the sacred text as a fundamental element in the spiritual_life of every believer , in the various ministries and states in life , with particular reference to lectio divina . The word of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of all authentic Christian spirituality . The Synod Fathers thus took up the words of the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum : '' Let the faithful go gladly to the sacred text itself , whether in the sacred_liturgy , which_-isaia- full of the divine words , or in devout reading , or in such suitable exercises and various other helps which , with the approval and guidance of the pastors of the Church , are happily spreading everywhere in our_day . Let them remember , however_,_that prayer should accompany the reading of sacred Scripture '' . The Council thus sought to reappropriate the great patristic tradition which_had always recommended approaching the Scripture in dialogue_with God . As Saint Augustine puts it : '' Your prayer_-isaia- the word you speak to God . When you read the Bible , God speaks to you ; when_you pray , you speak to God '' . Origen , one of the great masters of this_way of reading the Bible , maintains that understanding Scripture demands , even_more than study , closeness to Christ and prayer . Origen was convinced , in fact , that the best way to know God -isaia- through love , and that_there can be no authentic scientia Christi apart_from growth in his_love . In his Letter to Gregory , the great Alexandrian theologian gave this advice : '' Devote yourself to the lectio of the divine Scriptures ; apply yourself to this with perseverance . Do your reading with the intent of believing in and pleasing God . If during the lectio you encounter a closed door , knock and it will be opened to you by that guardian of whom Jesus said , The gatekeeper will open it for him . By applying yourself in this_way to lectio divina , search diligently and with unshakable trust in God for the meaning of the divine Scriptures , which_-isaia- hidden in great fullness within . You ought not , however , to be satisfied merely with knocking and seeking : to understand_the things of God , what_-isaia- absolutely necessary -isaia- oratio . For this_reason , the Saviour told us not_only : Seek and you will_find , and Knock and it shall be opened to you , but_also added , Ask and you shall receive '' . In this_regard , however , one_must avoid the risk of an individualistic approach , and remember_that God s word_-isaia- given to us precisely to build communion , to unite us in the Truth along our path to God . While it -isaia- a word addressed to each of us personally , it -isaia-_also a word which builds community , which builds the Church . Consequently , the sacred text must_always be approached in the communion of the Church . In effect , '' a communal reading of Scripture -isaia- extremely important , because the living subject in the sacred Scriptures -isaia- the People of God , it -isaia- the Church . Scripture does_not belong to the past , because its subject , the People of God inspired by God himself , -isaia- always the same , and therefore the word_-isaia- always alive in the living subject . As such , it -isaia- important to read and experience sacred Scripture in communion with the Church , that_-isaia- , with all the great witnesses to this word , beginning with the earliest Fathers up to the saints of our_own day , up to the present_day magisterium '' . For this_reason , the privileged place_for the prayerful reading of sacred Scripture -isaia- the liturgy , and particularly the Eucharist , in which , as we celebrate the Body and Blood of Christ in the sacrament , the word itself_-isaia- present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our midst . In some sense the prayerful reading of the Bible , personal and communal , must_always be related to the Eucharistic celebration . Just as the adoration of the Eucharist prepares for , accompanies and follows the liturgy of the Eucharist , so too prayerful reading , personal and communal , prepares for , accompanies and deepens what_the Church celebrates when_she proclaims_the word in a liturgical setting . By so closely relating lectio and liturgy , we can better grasp the criteria which_should guide this practice in the area of pastoral_care and in the spiritual_life of the People of God . The documents produced before and during the Synod mentioned a number of methods for a faith filled and fruitful approach to sacred Scripture . Yet the greatest attention was paid to lectio divina , which_-isaia- truly '' capable of opening up to the faithful the treasures of God s word , but_also of bringing_about an encounter_with Christ , the living word of God '' . I would_like here to review the basic steps of this procedure . It opens with the reading lectio of a text , which_leads to a desire to understand its true content : what does the biblical text say in itself ? Without this , there_-isaia- always a risk that the text will_become a pretext for never moving beyond our_own ideas . Next comes meditation meditatio , which asks : what does the biblical text say to us ? Here , each_person , individually but_also as a member of the community , must let himself or herself be moved and challenged . Following this comes prayer oratio , which asks the question : what do we say to the Lord in response to his_word ? Prayer , as petition , intercession , thanksgiving and praise , -isaia- the primary way by which_the word transforms us . Finally , lectio divina concludes with contemplation contemplatio , during which we take up , as a gift from God , his_own way of seeing and judging reality , and ask ourselves what conversion of mind , heart and life_-isaia- the Lord asking of us ? In the Letter to the Romans , Saint Paul tells us : '' Do not be conformed to this_world , but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that_you_may prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect '' : . Contemplation aims -atti_degli_apostoli- creating within us a truly wise and discerning vision of reality , as God sees it , and -atti_degli_apostoli- forming within us '' the mind of Christ '' Cor : . The word of God appears here as a criterion for discernment : it -isaia- '' living and active , sharper than_any two edged sword , piercing to the division of soul and spirit , of joints and marrow , and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart '' Heb : . We do well also to remember_that the process of lectio divina -isaia- not concluded until it arrives -atti_degli_apostoli- action actio , which moves the believer to make his or her_life a gift for others in charity . We find the supreme synthesis and fulfilment of this_process in the Mother of God . For every member of the faithful Mary -isaia- the model of docile acceptance of God s word , for she '' kept all these_things , pondering them in her_heart '' Lk : ; cf . : ; she discovered the profound bond which unites , in God s great plan , apparently disparate events , actions and things . I would also like to echo what_the Synod proposed about the importance of the personal reading of Scripture , also as a practice allowing for the possibility , in accordance_with_the Church s usual conditions , of gaining an indulgence either for oneself or for the faithful departed . The practice of indulgences implies the doctrine of the infinite merits of Christ \u2013 which_the Church , as the minister of the redemption , dispenses and applies , but it also implies that of the communion of saints , and it teaches us that '' to whatever degree we are_united in Christ , we are_united to one_another , and the supernatural life of each_one can be useful for the others '' . From this standpoint , the reading of the word of God sustains us on our journey of penance and conversion , enables us to deepen our sense of belonging to the Church , and helps us to grow in familiarity with God . As Saint Ambrose puts it , '' When we take up the sacred Scriptures in faith and read them_with_the Church , we walk once_more with God in the Garden '' . The word of God and Marian prayer . Mindful of the inseparable bond_between the word of God and Mary of Nazareth , along_with the Synod Fathers I urge that Marian prayer be encouraged among the faithful , above all in life of families , since_it_-isaia- an aid to meditating on the holy mysteries found in the Scriptures . A most helpful aid , for example , -isaia- the individual or communal recitation of the Holy Rosary , which ponders the mysteries of Christ s life in union with Mary , and which Pope John Paul II wished to enrich with the mysteries of light . It -isaia- fitting_that the announcement of each mystery be accompanied by a brief biblical text pertinent to that mystery , so as to encourage the memorization of brief biblical passages relevant to the mysteries of Christ s life . The Synod also recommended that_the_faithful be encouraged to pray the Angelus . This prayer , simple yet profound , allows us '' to commemorate daily the mystery of the Incarnate Word '' . It -isaia- only right that the People of God , families and communities of consecrated_persons , be faithful to this Marian prayer traditionally recited -atti_degli_apostoli- sunrise , midday and sunset . In the Angelus we ask God to grant that , through Mary s intercession , we may imitate her in doing his_will and in welcoming his_word into our_lives . This practice can_help us to grow in an authentic love for the mystery_of_the_incarnation . The ancient prayers of the Christian East which contemplate the entire history_of_salvation in the light of the Theotokos , the Mother of God , are likewise worthy of being known , appreciated and widely used . Here particular mention can be made of the Akathist and Paraklesis prayers . These hymns of praise , chanted in the form of a litany and steeped in the faith of the Church and in references to the Bible , help the faithful to meditate on the mysteries of Christ in union with Mary . In particular , the venerable Akathist hymn to the Mother of God \u2013 so called because_it_-isaia- sung while standing \u2013 represents one of the highest expressions of the Marian piety of the Byzantine tradition . Praying with these_words opens wide the heart and disposes it to the peace that_-isaia- from above , from God , to that peace which_-isaia- Christ himself , born of Mary for our_salvation . The word of God and the Holy Land . As we call to mind the Word of God who became flesh in the womb of Mary of Nazareth , our_heart now turns to the land where_the mystery of our_salvation was accomplished , and from which_the word of God spread to the ends of the earth . By the power of the Holy Spirit , the Word became flesh in a specific time_and_place , in a strip of land on the edges of the Roman Empire . The more we appreciate the universality and the uniqueness of Christ s person , the more we look with gratitude to that land where Jesus was_born , where he lived and where he gave_his life_for us . The stones on which_our Redeemer walked are_still charged with_his memory and continue to '' cry out '' the Good News . For this_reason , the Synod Fathers recalled the felicitous phrase which speaks of the Holy Land as '' the Fifth Gospel '' . How important it -isaia- that in those places there be Christian communities , notwithstanding any number of hardships ! The Synod of Bishops expressed profound closeness to all those Christians who dwell in the land of Jesus and bear_witness to their_faith in the Risen One . Christians there are_called to serve not_only as '' a beacon of faith for the universal Church , but_also as a leaven of harmony , wisdom , and equilibrium in the life of a society_which traditionally has_been , and continues to be , pluralistic , multi ethnic and multi religious '' . The Holy Land today remains a goal of pilgrimage for the Christian people , a place of prayer and penance , as was testified to in antiquity by authors like Saint Jerome . The more we turn our_eyes and our_hearts to the earthly Jerusalem , the more will our yearning be kindled for the heavenly Jerusalem , the true goal of every pilgrimage , along_with our eager desire_that the name of Jesus , the one name which brings salvation , may be acknowledged by all cf . PART THREE VERBUM MUNDO '' No one has_ever seen God . It -isaia- God the only Son , who_-isaia- close to the Father s heart , who_has made him known '' Jn : The Church s Mission : To Proclaim The Word Of God To The World The Word from the Father and to the Father . Saint John powerfully expresses the fundamental paradox of the Christian faith . On the one_hand , he says_that '' no one has_ever seen God '' Jn : ; cf . In no way can our imaginations , our concepts or our words ever define or embrace the infinite reality of the Most High . He remains Deus semper maior . Yet Saint John also tells us that the Word truly '' became flesh '' Jn : . The only_begotten Son , who_-isaia- ever with the Father , has made_known the God whom '' no one has_ever seen '' Jn : . Jesus Christ comes to us , '' full of grace and truth '' Jn : , to give us these gifts cf . Jn : ; and '' from his fullness we have all received , grace upon grace '' Jn : . In the Prologue of his Gospel , John thus contemplates the Word from his being with God to his becoming flesh and his return to the Father with_our humanity , which_he_has assumed for ever . In this coming forth_from God and returning to him cf . Jn : ; : ; : , , Christ -isaia- presented as the one_who '' tells us '' about God cf . Indeed , as Saint Irenaeus of Lyons says , the Son '' is the revealer of the Father '' . Jesus of Nazareth -isaia- , so to speak , the '' exegete '' of the God whom '' no one has_ever seen '' . '' He -isaia- the image of the invisible God '' Col : . Here we see fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah about the effectiveness of the Lord s word : as the rain and snow come down from heaven to water and to make_the earth fruitful , so too the word of God '' shall_not return to me empty , but it shall accomplish that_which I purpose , and prosper in the thing for_which I sent it '' cf . Jesus Christ -isaia- this definitive and effective word which came forth_from the Father and returned to him , perfectly accomplishing his_will in the world . Proclaiming to the world_the '' Logos '' of hope . The word of God has bestowed upon us the divine_life which transfigures the face of the earth , making all things new cf . His word engages us not_only as hearers of divine_revelation , but_also as its heralds . The one whom_the Father has_sent to do his_will cf . Jn : ; : ; : draws us to himself and makes us part of his life_and_mission . The Spirit of the Risen Lord empowers us to proclaim_the word everywhere by the witness of our_lives . This was experienced by the first Christian community , which saw the word spread through preaching and witness cf . Here we can think in particular of the life of the Apostle Paul , a man completely caught up by the Lord cf . Phil : \u2013 '' it -isaia-_no_longer I who_live , but Christ who lives in me '' Gal : \u2013 and by his_mission : '' woe to me if I do not proclaim_the Gospel ! '' Cor : . Paul knew well that_what was revealed in Christ -isaia- really salvation for all peoples , liberation from the slavery of sin in order to enjoy_the freedom of the children of God . What the Church proclaims to the world_-isaia- the Logos of Hope cf . Pet : ; in order to be able to live fully each moment , men_and_women need '' the great hope '' which_-isaia- '' the God who possesses a human face and who_has loved us to the end Jn : '' . This -isaia- why_the Church -isaia- missionary by her very nature . We cannot keep to ourselves the words of eternal_life given to us in our encounter_with Jesus Christ : they_are meant for everyone , for_every man_and_woman . Everyone today , whether he or she knows it or not , needs this message . May the Lord himself , as in the time of the prophet Amos , raise up in our midst a new hunger and thirst_for the word of God cf . It -isaia-_our responsibility to pass on what , by God s grace , we ourselves have_received . The word of God -isaia-_the_source of the Church s mission . The Synod of Bishops forcefully reaffirmed the need within_the Church for a revival of the missionary consciousness present in the People of God from the beginning . The first Christians saw their missionary preaching as a necessity rooted in the very nature of faith : the God in whom_they believed was_the God of all , the one true God who revealed himself in Israel s history and ultimately in his Son , who thus provided the response which , in their inmost being , all men_and_women awaited . The first Christian communities felt that their_faith was_not part of a particular cultural tradition , differing from one people to another , but belonged instead to the realm of truth , which concerns everyone equally . Once more it -isaia- Saint Paul who , by his_life , illustrates the meaning of the Christian mission and its fundamental universality . We can think here of the episode related in the Acts of the Apostles about the Athenian Areopagus cf . The Apostle of the Nations enters into dialogue_with people of various cultures precisely_because he -isaia- conscious that the mystery of God , Known yet Unknown , which_every man_and_woman perceives , however confusedly , has really been revealed in history : '' What therefore you worship as unknown , this I proclaim to you '' Acts : . In fact , the newness of Christian proclamation -isaia- that_we_can tell all peoples : '' God has shown himself . And now the way to him -isaia- open . The novelty of the Christian message does_not consist in an idea but in a fact : God has revealed himself '' . The word and the Kingdom of God . Consequently , the Church s mission cannot be considered as an optional or supplementary element in her_life . Rather it entails letting the Holy Spirit assimilate us to Christ himself , and thus to share in his_own mission : '' As the Father has_sent me , so I send you '' Jn : to share the word with your entire life . It -isaia- the word itself which impels us towards our_brothers_and_sisters : it -isaia- the word which illuminates , purifies , converts ; we are only its servants . We need , then , to discover ever anew the urgency and the beauty of the proclamation of the word for the coming of the Kingdom of God which Christ himself preached . Thus we grow in the realization , so clear to the Fathers of the Church , that the proclamation of the word has as its content the Kingdom of God cf . Mk : , which , in the memorable phrase of Origen , -isaia- the very person of Jesus Autobasileia . The Lord offers salvation to men_and_women in every_age . All of us recognize how_much the light of Christ needs to illumine every area of human_life : the family , schools , culture , work , leisure and the other aspects of social_life . It -isaia- not a matter of preaching a word of consolation , but_rather a word which disrupts , which calls to conversion and which opens the way to an encounter_with_the one through whom a new humanity flowers . All the baptized are responsible_for this proclamation . Since the entire People of God -isaia- a people which_has_been '' sent '' , the Synod reaffirmed that '' the mission of proclaiming the word of God -isaia- the task of all of the disciples of Jesus Christ based on their Baptism '' . No believer in Christ can feel dispensed from this responsibility which_comes_from the fact of our sacramentally belonging to the Body of Christ . A consciousness of this_must be revived in every family , parish , community , association and ecclesial movement . The Church , as a mystery of communion , -isaia- thus entirely missionary , and everyone , according_to_his or her proper state in life , -isaia- called to give an incisive contribution to the proclamation of Christ . Bishops and priests , in accordance_with their_specific mission , are the first to be called to live a life completely -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the word , to proclaim_the Gospel , to celebrate the sacraments and to form the faithful in the authentic knowledge of Scripture . Deacons too must feel themselves called to cooperate , in accordance_with their_specific mission , in this_task of evangelization . Throughout the Church s history the consecrated_life has_been outstanding for explicitly taking up the task of proclaiming and preaching the word of God in the missio ad gentes and in the most difficult situations , for being ever ready to adapt to new situations and for setting out courageously and boldly along fresh paths in meeting new challenges for the effective proclamation of God s word . The laity are_called to exercise their_own prophetic role , which derives directly from their Baptism , and to bear_witness to the Gospel in daily_life , wherever they find_themselves . In this_regard the Synod Fathers expressed '' the greatest esteem , gratitude and encouragement for the service to evangelization which so many of the lay_faithful , and women in particular , provide with generosity and commitment in their communities throughout_the_world , following_the_example of Mary Magdalene , the first witness of the joy of Easter '' . The Synod also recognized with gratitude that the ecclesial movements and the new communities are a great force for evangelization in our_times and an incentive to the development of new ways of proclaiming the Gospel . The necessity of the '' missio ad gentes '' . In calling upon all the faithful to proclaim God s word , the Synod Fathers restated the need in our_day too for a decisive commitment to the missio ad gentes . In no way can the Church restrict her pastoral_work to the '' ordinary maintenance '' of those_who already know_the Gospel of Christ . Missionary outreach -isaia- a clear sign of the maturity of an ecclesial_community . The Fathers also insisted that the word of God -isaia- the saving truth_which men_and_women in every_age need to hear . For this_reason , it must be explicitly proclaimed . The Church must go out to meet each_person in the strength of the Spirit cf . Cor : and continue her prophetic defence of people s right and freedom to hear_the word of God , while constantly seeking out the most effective ways of proclaiming that word , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of persecution . The Church feels duty bound to proclaim to every man_and_woman the word that saves cf . Proclamation and the new_evangelization . Pope John Paul II , taking up the prophetic words of Pope Paul VI in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , had in a variety of ways reminded the faithful of the need_for a new missionary season for the entire people of God . At the dawn of the third_millennium not_only are there still many peoples who have_not come to know_the Good News , but_also a great many Christians who need to have_the word of God once_more persuasively proclaimed to them , so that_they_can concretely experience the power of the Gospel . Many of our_brothers_and_sisters are '' baptized , but insufficiently evangelized '' . In a number of cases , nations once rich in faith and in vocations are losing their identity under the influence of a secularized culture . The need_for a new_evangelization , so deeply felt by my venerable Predecessor , must be valiantly reaffirmed , in the certainty_that God s word_-isaia- effective . The Church , sure of her Lord s fidelity , never tires of proclaiming the good_news of the Gospel and invites all Christians to discover anew the attraction of following Christ . The word of God and Christian witness . The immense horizons of the Church s mission and the complexity of today s situation call_for new ways of effectively communicating the word of God . The Holy Spirit , the protagonist of all evangelization , will_never fail to guide Christ s Church in this activity . Yet it -isaia- important_that every_form of proclamation keep in mind , first of all , the intrinsic relationship_between_the communication of God s word and Christian witness . The very credibility of our proclamation depends on this . On the one_hand , the word must communicate every thing that the Lord himself has told us . On the other_hand , it -isaia- indispensable , through witness , to make_this word credible , lest it appear merely as a beautiful philosophy or utopia , rather_than a reality that_can be lived and itself give life . This reciprocity between word and witness reflects the way_in_which God himself communicated through the incarnation of his Word . The word of God reaches men_and_women '' through an encounter_with witnesses who make it present and alive '' . In a particular_way , young_people need to be introduced to the word of God '' through encounter and authentic witness by adults , through the positive influence of friends and the great company of the ecclesial_community '' . There -isaia- a close relationship_between_the testimony of Scripture , as the self attestation of God s word , and the witness given by the lives of believers . One implies and leads to the other . Christian witness communicates the word attested in the Scriptures . For their_part , the Scriptures explain the witness which Christians are_called to give by their_lives . Those who encounter credible witnesses of the Gospel thus come to realize how effective God s word can be in those_who receive it . In this interplay between witness and word we can understand what Pope Paul VI stated in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi . Our responsibility -isaia- not limited to suggesting shared values to the world ; rather , we need to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- an explicit proclamation of the word of God . Only in this_way will we be faithful to Christ s mandate : '' The Good News proclaimed by the witness of life sooner or later has to be proclaimed by the word of life . There -isaia- no true evangelization unless the name , the teaching , the life , the promises , the Kingdom and the mystery of Jesus of Nazareth , the Son of God , are proclaimed '' . The fact_that the proclamation of the word of God calls for the testimony of one s life_-isaia- a datum clearly present in the Christian consciousness from the beginning . Christ himself_-isaia- the faithful and true witness cf . Acts : ; : , it -isaia- he who testifies to the Truth cf . Here I would_like to echo the countless testimonials which we had the grace of hearing during the synodal_assembly . We were profoundly moved to hear_the stories of those_who lived their_faith and bore outstanding witness to the Gospel even under regimes hostile to Christianity or in situations of persecution . None of this should cause us fear . Jesus himself said to his_disciples : '' A servant -isaia- not greater_than his master . If they persecuted me , they_will persecute you '' Jn : . For this_reason I would_like , with the whole Church , to lift up to God a hymn of praise for the witness of our many faithful brothers_and_sisters who , even in our_day , have_given their_lives to communicate the truth of God s love revealed to us in the crucified and risen Christ . I also express the whole Church s gratitude for those Christians who have_not yielded in the face of obstacles and even persecutions for the sake of the Gospel . We likewise embrace with deep fraternal affection the faithful of all those Christian communities , particularly in Asia and in Africa , who presently risk their_life or social segregation because_of_their faith . Here we encounter the true spirit of the Gospel , which proclaims blessed those_who_are persecuted on account of the Lord Jesus cf . In so doing , we once_more call_upon the governments of nations to guarantee everyone freedom of conscience and religion , as well as the ability to express their_faith publicly . The Word Of God And Commitment In The World Serving Jesus in '' the least of his brethren '' Mt : . The word of God sheds light on human_existence and stirs our conscience to take a deeper look -atti_degli_apostoli- our_lives , inasmuch as all human_history stands under God s judgment : '' When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with_him , then he will sit on his glorious throne . Before him will be gathered all the nations '' Mt : . Nowadays we tend to halt in a superficial way before the importance of the passing moment , as if it had nothing to do with the future . The Gospel , on the other_hand , reminds us that_every moment of our life_-isaia- important and must be lived intensely , in the knowledge that everyone will_have to give an account of his or her_life . In the twenty fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew , the Son of Man considers whatever we do or do not do to '' the least of his brethren '' cf . : , as done or not done to himself : '' I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me , I was naked and you clothed me , I was sick and you visited me , I was in prison and you came to me '' : . The word of God itself emphasizes the need_for our engagement in the world and our responsibility before Christ , the Lord of history . As we proclaim_the Gospel , let us encourage one_another to do good and to commit ourselves to justice , reconciliation and peace . The word of God and commitment to justice in society . God s word inspires men_and_women to build relationships based on rectitude and justice , and testifies to the great value in God s eyes of every_effort to create a more just and more liveable world . The word of God itself unambiguously denounces injustices and promotes solidarity and equality . In the light of the Lord s words , let us discern the '' signs of the times '' present in history , and not flee from a commitment to those who_suffer and the victims of forms of selfishness . The Synod recalled that a commitment to justice and to changing our world_-isaia- an essential element of evangelization . In the words of Pope Paul VI , we must '' reach and as it were overturn with the force of the Gospel the standards of judgement , the interests , the thought patterns , the sources of inspiration and life styles of humanity that_are in contrast with the word of God and with_his plan_for salvation '' . For this_reason , the Synod Fathers wished to say a special word to all those_who take_part in political and social_life . Evangelization and the spread of God s word ought to inspire their activity in the world , as they work_for the true common_good in respecting and promoting the dignity of every_person . Certainly it -isaia- not the direct task of the Church to create a more just society , although she_does have_the right and duty to intervene on ethical and moral issues related to the good of individuals and peoples . It -isaia- primarily the task of the lay_faithful , formed in the school of the Gospel , to be directly involved in political and social activity . For this_reason , the Synod recommends that_they receive a suitable formation in the principles of the Church s social_teaching . I would_like also to call the attention of everyone to the importance of defending and promoting the human_rights of every_person , based on the natural_law written on the human_heart , which , as such , are '' universal , inviolable and inalienable '' . The Church expresses the hope_that by the recognition of these rights human_dignity will be more_effectively acknowledged and universally promoted , inasmuch as it -isaia- a distinctive mark imprinted by the Creator on his creatures , taken up and redeemed by Jesus Christ through_his incarnation , death_and_resurrection . The spread of the word of God cannot_fail to strengthen the recognition of , and respect_for , the human_rights of every_person . The proclamation of God s word , reconciliation and peace between peoples . Among the many areas where commitment -isaia- needed , the Synod earnestly called_for the promotion of reconciliation and peace . In the present context it -isaia- more necessary than_ever to rediscover the word of God as a source of reconciliation and peace , since in that word God -isaia- reconciling to himself all things cf . Cor : ; Eph : : Christ '' is our peace '' Eph : , the one_who breaks down the walls of division . A number of interventions -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod documented the grave and violent conflicts and tensions present on our planet . At times these hostilities seem to take on the appearance of interreligious conflict . Here I wish to affirm once_more that religion can_never justify intolerance or war . We cannot kill in God s name ! Each religion must encourage the right use of reason and promote ethical values that consolidate civil coexistence . In fidelity to the work of reconciliation accomplished by God in Jesus Christ crucified and risen , Catholics and men_and_women of goodwill must commit themselves to being an example of reconciliation for the building of a just and peaceful society . We should never forget_that '' where human words become powerless because the tragic clash of violence and arms prevails , the prophetic power of God s word does_not waver , reminding us that peace_-isaia- possible and that we ourselves must be instruments of reconciliation and peace '' . The word of God and practical charity . Commitment to justice , reconciliation and peace finds_its ultimate foundation and fulfilment in the love revealed to us in Christ . By listening to the testimonies offered during the Synod , we saw more_clearly the bond_between a love filled hearing of God s word and selfless service of our_brothers_and_sisters ; all believers should see the need to '' translate the word that_we_have heard into gestures of love , because this -isaia-_the_only way to make_the Gospel proclamation credible , despite the human weakness that marks individuals '' . Jesus passed through_this world doing good cf . Listening with docility to the word of God in the Church awakens '' charity and justice towards all , especially towards_the poor '' . We should never forget_that '' love \u2013 caritas \u2013 will_always prove necessary , even in the most just society . whoever wants to eliminate love_-isaia- preparing to eliminate man as such '' . I therefore encourage the faithful to meditate often on the Apostle Paul s hymn to charity and to draw inspiration from it : '' Love -isaia- patient and kind ; love_-isaia- not jealous or boastful ; it -isaia- not arrogant or rude . Love does_not insist on its_own way ; it -isaia- not irritable or resentful ; it does_not rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- wrong but delights in the truth . Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Love never ends '' Cor : . Love of neighbour , rooted in the love of God , ought to see us constantly committed as individuals and as an ecclesial_community , both local and universal . As Saint Augustine says : '' It -isaia- essential to realize_that love_-isaia- the fullness of the Law , as it -isaia- of all the divine Scriptures . Whoever claims to have understood the Scriptures , or any part of them , without striving as a result to grow in this twofold love of God and neighbour , makes it clear that_he_has not_yet understood them '' . The proclamation of the word of God and young_people . The Synod paid particular attention to the proclamation of God s word to the younger generation . Young people are_already active members of the Church and they represent its future . Often we encounter in them a spontaneous openness to hearing the word of God and a sincere desire to know Jesus . Youth -isaia- a time_when genuine and irrepressible questions arise about the meaning of life and the direction our_own lives should_take . Only God can_give the true answer to these questions . Concern for young_people calls for courage and clarity in the message we proclaim ; we need to help young_people to gain confidence and familiarity with sacred Scripture so it can become a compass pointing out the path to follow . Young people need witnesses and teachers who_can walk with_them , teaching them to love the Gospel and to share it , especially with_their peers , and thus to become authentic and credible messengers . God s word needs to be presented in a way_that brings out its implications for each_person s vocation and assists young_people in choosing the direction they_will give to their_lives , including that of total consecration to God . Authentic vocations to the consecrated_life and to the priesthood find fertile ground in a faith filled contact_with_the word of God . I repeat once_again the appeal I made -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my pontificate to open wide the doors to Christ : '' If we let Christ into our_lives , we lose nothing , nothing , absolutely nothing of what makes life free , beautiful and great . No ! Only in this friendship are the doors of life opened wide . Only in this friendship -isaia- the great potential of human_existence truly revealed . Dear young_people : do not be afraid of Christ ! He takes nothing away and he gives you everything . When we give ourselves to him , we receive a hundredfold in return . Yes , open , open wide the doors to Christ \u2013 and you will_find true life '' . The proclamation of the word of God and migrants . The word of God makes us attentive to history and to emerging realities . In considering the Church s mission of evangelization , the Synod thus decided to address as well the complex phenomenon of movements of migration , which in recent_years have_taken on unprecedented proportions . This issue -isaia- fraught with extremely delicate questions about the security of nations and the welcome to be given to those seeking refuge or improved conditions of living , health and work . Large numbers of people_who know nothing of Christ , or who_have an inadequate understanding of him , are settling in countries of Christian tradition . At the same_time , persons from nations deeply marked by Christian faith are emigrating to countries where Christ needs to be proclaimed and a new evangelization_-isaia- demanded . These situations offer new possibilities for the spread of God s word . In this_regard the Synod Fathers stated_that migrants are entitled to hear_the kerygma , which_-isaia- to be proposed , not imposed . If they_are Christians , they require forms of pastoral_care which_can enable them to grow in the faith and to become in turn messengers of the Gospel . Taking into_account_the complexity of the phenomenon , a mobilization of all dioceses involved -isaia- essential , so that movements of migration will_also be seen as an opportunity to discover new_forms of presence and proclamation . It -isaia-_also necessary_that they ensure , to the extent possible , that_these our_brothers_and_sisters receive adequate welcome and attention , so that , touched by the Good News , they will_be_able to be heralds of God s word and witnesses to the Risen Jesus , the hope of the world . The proclamation of the word of God and the suffering . During the work of the Synod , the Fathers also considered the need to proclaim God s word to all those_who_are suffering , whether physically , psychologically or spiritually . It -isaia- in times of pain that the ultimate questions about the meaning of one s life make themselves acutely felt . If human words seem to fall silent before the mystery of evil and suffering , and if our society appears to value life only_when it corresponds to certain standards of efficiency and well_being , the word of God makes us see that_even these moments are mysteriously '' embraced '' by God s love . Faith born of an encounter_with God s word helps us to realize_that human_life deserves to be lived fully , even_when weakened by illness and pain . God created us for happiness and for life , whereas sickness and death came into_the_world as a result of sin cf . Yet the Father of life_-isaia- mankind s physician par excellence , and he does not_cease to bend lovingly over suffering humanity . We contemplate the culmination of God s closeness to our sufferings in Jesus himself , '' the Word incarnate . He suffered and died for us . By his_passion and death he took our weakness upon himself and totally transformed it '' . Jesus closeness to those who_suffer -isaia- constant : it -isaia- prolonged in time thanks to the working of the Holy Spirit in the mission of the Church , in the word and in the sacraments , in men_and_women of good_will , and in charitable initiatives undertaken with fraternal love by communities , thus making known God s true face and his_love . The Synod thanked God for the luminous witness , often hidden , of all the many Christians \u2013 priests , religious and lay_faithful \u2013 who_have lent and continue to lend their hands , eyes and hearts to Christ , the true physician of body_and_soul . It exhorts all to continue to care_for the infirm and to bring them the life_giving presence of the Lord Jesus in the word and in the Eucharist . Those who_suffer should be helped to read the Scriptures and to realize_that their condition itself enables them to share in a special_way in Christ s redemptive suffering for the salvation of the world cf . The proclamation of the word of God and the poor . Sacred Scripture manifests God s special love for the poor and the needy cf . The Synod Fathers frequently spoke of the importance of enabling these , our_brothers_and_sisters , to hear_the Gospel message and to experience the closeness of their pastors and communities . Indeed , '' the poor are the first ones entitled to hear_the proclamation of the Gospel ; they_need not_only bread , but_also words of life '' . The diaconia of charity , which must_never be lacking in our churches , should_always be bound to the proclamation of the word and the celebration of the sacred mysteries . Yet we also need to recognize and appreciate the fact_that the poor are themselves agents of evangelization . In the Bible , the true poor are_those_who entrust themselves totally to God ; in the Gospel Jesus calls them blessed , '' for theirs -isaia- the Kingdom of Heaven '' Mt : ; cf . The Lord exalts the simplicity of heart of those_who find in God true riches , placing their hope in him , and not in the things of this_world . The Church cannot let_the poor down : '' Pastors are_called to listen to them , to learn from them , to guide them in their_faith and to encourage them to take responsibility_for lives '' . The Church also knows that poverty can exist as a virtue , to be cultivated and chosen freely , as so many saints have_done . Poverty can likewise exist as indigence , often due to injustice or selfishness , marked by hunger and need , and as a source of conflict . In her proclamation of God s word , the Church knows that a '' virtuous circle '' must be promoted between_the poverty which_-isaia- to be chosen and the poverty which_-isaia- to be combated ; we need to rediscover '' moderation and solidarity , these values of the Gospel that are_also universal . This entails decisions marked by justice and moderation '' . The proclamation of the word of God and the protection of creation . Engagement with the world , as demanded by God s word , makes us look with new eyes -atti_degli_apostoli- the entire created cosmos , which contains traces of that word through whom all things were made cf . As men_and_women_who believe in and proclaim_the Gospel , we have a responsibility towards creation . Revelation makes known God s plan_for the cosmos , yet it also leads us to denounce that mistaken attitude which refuses to view all created realities as a reflection of their Creator , but instead as mere raw material , to be exploited without scruple . Man thus lacks that essential humility which_would enable him to see creation as a gift from God , to be received and used in accordance_with his plan . Instead , the arrogance of human_beings who_live '' as if God did not_exist '' leads them to exploit and disfigure nature , failing to see it as the handiwork of the creative word . In this theological context , I would_like to echo the statements of the Synod Fathers who reminded us that '' accepting the word of God , attested to by Scripture and by the Church s living Tradition , gives_rise to a new_way of seeing things , promotes an authentic ecology which_has its deepest roots in the obedience of faith . and develops a renewed theological sensitivity to the goodness of all things , which_are created in Christ '' . We need to be re educated in wonder and in the ability to recognize_the beauty made manifest in created realities . The Word Of God And Culture The value of culture for the life of humanity . Saint John s proclamation that the Word became flesh reveals the inseparable bond_between God s word and the human words by which he communicates with us . In this_context the Synod Fathers considered the relationship_between_the word of God and culture . God does_not reveal himself in the abstract , but by using languages , imagery and expressions that are_bound to different_cultures . This relationship has proved fruitful , as the history of the Church abundantly testifies . Today it -isaia- entering a new phase due to the spread of the Gospel and its taking root within different_cultures , as well as more_recent developments in the culture of the West . It calls in the first_place for a recognition of the importance of culture as such for the life of every man_and_woman . The phenomenon of culture -isaia- , in its various aspects , an essential datum of human experience . '' Man lives always according to a culture which_-isaia- properly his , and which in turn creates among persons a bond which_-isaia- properly theirs , one_which determines the inter human and social character of human_existence '' . Down the centuries the word of God has inspired different_cultures , giving rise to fundamental moral values , outstanding expressions of art and exemplary life styles . Hence , in looking to a renewed encounter between_the Bible and culture , I wish to reassure all those_who_are part_of_the_world of culture that_they_have nothing to fear from openness to God s word , which never destroys true culture , but_rather -isaia- a constant stimulus to seek ever_more appropriate , meaningful and humane forms of expression . Every authentic culture , if it -isaia- truly to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of humanity , has to be open to transcendence and , in the end , to God . The Bible , a great code for cultures . The Synod Fathers greatly stressed the importance of promoting a suitable knowledge of the Bible among_those engaged in the area of culture , also in secularized contexts and among non believers . Sacred Scripture contains anthropological and philosophical values that_have had a positive influence on humanity as a whole . A sense of the Bible as a great code for cultures needs to be fully recovered . Knowledge of the Bible in schools and universities . One particular setting for an encounter between_the word of God and culture -isaia- that of schools and universities . Pastors should be especially attentive to this milieu , promoting a deeper knowledge of the Bible and a grasp of its fruitful cultural implications also_for the present_day . Study centres supported by Catholic groups offer a distinct contribution to the promotion of culture and education \u2013 and this ought to be recognized . Nor must religious education be neglected , and religion teachers should be given careful training . Religious education -isaia-_often the sole opportunity available for students to encounter the message of faith . In the teaching of religion , emphasis should be laid on knowledge of sacred Scripture , as a means of overcoming prejudices old_and_new , and enabling its truth to be better known . Sacred Scripture in the variety of artistic expressions . The relationship_between_the word of God and culture has found expression in many areas , especially in the arts . For this_reason_the great tradition of East and West has_always esteemed works of art inspired by sacred Scripture , as for example the figurative arts and architecture , literature and music . I think too of the ancient language expressed by icons , which from the Eastern tradition -isaia- gradually spreading throughout_the_world . With the Synod Fathers , the whole Church expresses her appreciation , esteem and admiration of those artists '' enamoured of beauty '' who_have drawn inspiration from the sacred texts . They have contributed to the decoration of our churches , to the celebration of our_faith , to the enrichment of our liturgy and many of them have helped to make somehow perceptible , in time and space , realities that_are unseen and eternal . I encourage the competent offices and groups to promote in the Church a solid formation of artists with_regard to sacred Scripture in the light of the Church s living Tradition and her magisterium . The word of God and the means of social communication . Linked to the relationship_between_the word of God and culture -isaia- the need_for a careful and intelligent use of the communications media , both old_and_new . The Synod Fathers called_for a proper knowledge of these media ; they noted their rapid development and different levels of interaction , and asked for greater efforts to be made in gaining expertise in the various sectors involved , particularly in the new media , such as the internet . The Church already has a significant presence in the world of mass communications , and her magisterium has frequently intervened on the subject , beginning with the Second Vatican Council . Discovering new methods of transmitting the Gospel message -isaia-_part of the continuing evangelizing outreach of those who_believe . Communications today take_place through a worldwide network , and thus give new meaning to Christ s words : '' What I tell you in the dark , utter in the light ; and what_you hear whispered , proclaim upon the housetops '' Mt : . God s word should resound not_only in the print media , but in other_forms of communication as well . For this_reason , together_with_the Synod Fathers , I express gratitude to those Catholics who_are making serious efforts to promote a significant presence in the world of the media , and I ask for an ever wider and more qualified commitment in this_regard . Among the new_forms of mass communication , nowadays we need to recognize_the increased role of the internet , which represents a new forum for making the Gospel heard . Yet we also need to be aware_that the virtual world will_never be able to replace the real world , and that evangelization will_be_able to make_use of the virtual world offered by the new media in order to create meaningful relationships only if it -isaia- able to offer the personal contact which remains indispensable . In the world of the internet , which enables billions of images to appear on millions of screens throughout_the_world , the face of Christ needs to be seen and his voice heard , for '' if there_-isaia- no room_for Christ , there_-isaia- no room_for man '' . The Bible and inculturation . The mystery_of_the_incarnation tells us that while God always communicates in a concrete history , taking up the cultural codes embedded therein , the same word can and must_also be passed on in different_cultures , transforming them_from within through what Pope Paul VI called the evangelization of cultures . The word of God , like the Christian faith itself , has a profoundly intercultural character ; it -isaia- capable of encountering different_cultures and in turn enabling them to encounter one_another . Here too we come to appreciate the importance of the inculturation of the Gospel . The Church -isaia- firmly convinced_that the word of God -isaia- inherently capable of speaking to all human persons in the context of their_own culture : '' this conviction springs from the Bible itself , which , right from the Book of Genesis , adopts a universalist stance cf . Gen : , maintains it subsequently in the blessing promised to all peoples through Abraham and his offspring cf . Gen : ; : , and confirms it definitively in extending to all nations the proclamation of the Gospel '' . For this_reason , inculturation -isaia- not to be confused with processes of superficial adaptation , much less with a confused syncretism which_would dilute the uniqueness of the Gospel in an attempt to make it more_easily accepted . The authentic paradigm of inculturation -isaia- the incarnation itself of the Word : '' Acculturation or inculturation will truly be a reflection of the incarnation of the Word when a culture , transformed and regenerated by the Gospel , brings forth_from its_own living tradition original expressions of Christian life , celebration and thought '' , serving as a leaven within_the local culture , enhancing the semina Verbi and all those positive elements present within that culture , thus opening it to the values of the Gospel . Translating the Bible and making it more widely available . The inculturation of God s word_-isaia- an integral part of the Church s mission in the world , and a decisive moment in this_process -isaia- the diffusion of the Bible through the precious work of translation into different languages . Here it should_always be remembered that the work of translation of the Scriptures had_been undertaken '' already in the Old Testament period , when_the Hebrew text of the Bible was translated orally into Aramaic Neh : , and later in written form into Greek . A translation , of course , -isaia- always more_than a simple transcription of the original texts . The passage from one language to another necessarily involves a change of cultural context : concepts are_not identical and symbols have a different meaning , for they come up against other traditions of thought and other ways of life '' . During the Synod , it was clear_that a number of local Churches still lack a complete translation of the Bible in their_own languages . How many_people today hunger and thirst_for the word of God , yet remain deprived of the '' widely available access to Sacred Scripture '' desired by the Second Vatican Council ! For this_reason_the Synod considered it important , above all , to train specialists committed to translating the Bible into the various languages . I would encourage the investment of resources in this area . In particular I wish to recommend supporting the work of the Catholic Biblical Federation , with the aim of further increasing the number of translations of sacred Scripture and their wide diffusion . Given the very nature of such an enterprise , it should be carried_out as much as possible in cooperation_with the different Bible Societies . God s word transcends cultural limits . The synodal_assembly , in its discussion of the relationship_between God s word and cultures , felt the need to reaffirm something_that the earliest Christians had experienced beginning on the day of Pentecost Acts : . The word of God -isaia- capable of entering into and finding expression in various cultures and languages , yet that_same word overcomes the limits of individual cultures to create fellowship between different peoples . The Lord s word summons us to advance towards an ever_more vast communion . '' We escape the limitations of our experience and we enter_into the reality that_-isaia- truly universal . Entering into communion with the word of God , we enter_into the communion of the Church which lives the word of God . It means going beyond_the limits of the individual cultures into the universality that connects all , unites all , makes us all brothers_and_sisters '' . The proclamation of God s work thus always demands , of us in the first_place , a new exodus , as we leave behind our_own limited standards and imaginations in order to make room_for the presence of Christ . The Word Of God And Interreligious Dialogue The value of interreligious dialogue . The Church considers an essential part of the proclamation of the word to consist in encounter , dialogue and cooperation_with all people_of_good_will , particularly with the followers of the different religious traditions of humanity . This -isaia- to take_place without forms of syncretism and relativism , but along the lines indicated by the Second Vatican Council s Declaration Nostra Aetate and subsequently developed by the magisterium of the Popes . Nowadays the quickened pace of globalization makes it possible_for people of different_cultures and religions to be in closer contact . This represents a providential opportunity_for demonstrating how authentic religiosity can foster relationships of universal fraternity . Today , in our frequently secularized societies , it -isaia-_very important_that the religions be capable of fostering a mentality that sees Almighty God as the foundation of all good , the inexhaustible source of the moral_life , and the bulwark of a profound sense of universal brotherhood . In the Judeo Christian tradition , for example , one finds a moving witness to God s love for all peoples : in the covenant with Noah he joins them in one great embrace symbolized by the '' bow in the clouds '' Gen : , , and , according to the words of the prophets , he desires to gather them_into a single universal family cf . Evidence of a close connection_between a relationship_with God and the ethics of love for everyone -isaia- found in many great religious traditions . Dialogue between Christians and Muslims . Among the various religions the Church also looks with_respect to Muslims , who adore the one God . They look to Abraham and worship God above all through prayer , almsgiving and fasting . We acknowledge that the Islamic tradition includes countless biblical figures , symbols and themes . Taking up the efforts begun by the Venerable John Paul II , I express my hope_that the trust filled relationships established between Christians and Muslims over the years will_continue to develop in a spirit of sincere and respectful dialogue . In this dialogue the Synod asked for a deeper reflection on respect_for life as a fundamental value , the inalienable rights of men_and_women , and their equal dignity . Taking into_account_the important distinction to be made between_the socio political order and the religious order , the various religions must make their_specific contribution to the common_good . The Synod asked Conferences of Bishops , wherever it -isaia- appropriate and helpful , to encourage meetings aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping Christians and Muslims to come to better knowledge of one_another , in order to promote the values_which society needs for a peaceful and positive coexistence . Dialogue with other_religions . Here too I wish to voice the Church s respect_for the ancient religions and spiritual traditions of the various continents . These contain values_which can greatly advance understanding between individuals and peoples . Frequently we note a consonance with values expressed also in their religious books , such as , in Buddhism , respect_for life , contemplation , silence , simplicity ; in Hinduism , the sense of the sacred , sacrifice and fasting ; and again , in Confucianism , family and social values . We are_also gratified to find in other religious experiences a genuine concern_for the transcendence of God , acknowledged as Creator , as well as respect_for life , marriage and the family , and a strong sense of solidarity . Dialogue and religious_freedom . All the same , dialogue would_not prove fruitful unless it included authentic respect_for each_person and the ability of all freely to practise their religion . Hence the Synod , while encouraging cooperation between_the followers of the different religions , also pointed_out '' the need_for the freedom to profess one s religion , privately and publicly , and freedom of conscience to be effectively guaranteed to all believers '' : indeed , '' respect and dialogue require reciprocity in all spheres , especially in that_which concerns basic freedoms , more particularly religious_freedom . Such respect and dialogue foster peace and understanding between peoples '' . CONCLUSION God s definitive word . At the conclusion of these reflections with_which I have sought to gather up and examine more_fully the rich fruits of the Twelfth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the word of God in the life_and_mission of the Church , I wish once_more to encourage all the People of God , pastors , consecrated_persons and the laity , to become increasingly familiar with the sacred Scriptures . We must_never forget_that all authentic and living Christian spirituality -isaia- based on the word of God proclaimed , accepted , celebrated and meditated upon in the Church . This deepening relationship_with the divine_word will take_place with even greater enthusiasm if we are conscious that , in Scripture and the Church s living Tradition , we stand before God s definitive word on the cosmos and on history . The Prologue of John s Gospel leads us to ponder the fact_that everything_that exists -isaia- under the sign of the Word . The Word goes forth_from the Father , comes to dwell in our midst and then returns to the Father in order to bring with_him the whole of creation which_was made in him and for him . The Church now carries out her_mission in eager expectation of the eschatological manifestation of the Bridegroom : '' the Spirit and the bride say : Come ! '' Rev : . This expectation -isaia- never passive ; rather it -isaia- a missionary drive to proclaim_the word of God which heals and redeems every man . Today too the Risen Jesus says to us : '' Go into all the world and proclaim_the Gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : . New evangelization and a new hearing . Our own_time , then , must be increasingly marked by a new hearing of God s word and a new_evangelization . Recovering the centrality of the divine_word in the Christian life leads us to appreciate anew the deepest meaning of the forceful appeal of Pope John Paul II : to pursue the missio ad gentes and vigorously to embark upon the new_evangelization , especially in those nations where_the Gospel has_been forgotten or meets with indifference as a result of widespread secularism . May the Holy Spirit awaken a hunger and thirst_for the word of God , and raise up zealous heralds and witnesses of the Gospel . Following the example of the great Apostle of the Nations , who changed the course of his_life after hearing the voice of the Lord cf . Acts : , let us too hear God s word as it speaks to us , ever personally , here and now . The Holy Spirit , we are told in the Acts of the Apostles , set Paul and Barnabas apart to proclaim and spread the Good News cf . In our_day too , the Holy Spirit constantly calls convinced and persuasive hearers and preachers of the word of the Lord . The word and joy . The greater our openness to God s word , the more will we be able to recognize_that today too the mystery of Pentecost -isaia- taking place in God s Church . The Spirit of the Lord continues to pour out his gifts upon the Church to guide us into all truth , to show us the meaning of the Scriptures and to make us credible heralds of the word of salvation before the world . Thus we return to the First Letter of Saint John . In God s word , we too have heard , we too have_seen and touched the Word of life . We have welcomed by grace the proclamation that eternal_life has_been revealed , and thus we have come to acknowledge our fellowship with one_another , with those_who_have gone before us marked with the sign of faith , and with all those_who throughout_the_world hear_the word , celebrate the Eucharist and by their_lives bear_witness to charity . This proclamation has_been shared with us \u2013 the Apostle John reminds us \u2013 so that '' our joy may be complete '' Jn : . The synodal_assembly enabled us to experience all that Saint John speaks of : the proclamation of the word creates communion and brings about joy . This -isaia- a profound joy which_has its origin in the very_heart of the trinitarian life and which_-isaia- communicated to us in the Son . This joy -isaia- an ineffable gift_which the world cannot give . Celebrations can be organized , but_not joy . According to the Scripture , joy -isaia- the fruit of the Holy Spirit cf . Gal : who enables us to enter_into the word and enables the divine_word to enter_into us and to bear_fruit for eternal_life . By proclaiming God s word in the power of the Holy Spirit , we also wish to share the source of true joy , not a superficial and fleeting joy , but the joy born of the awareness_that the Lord Jesus alone has words of everlasting life cf . '' Mater Verbi et Mater laetitiae '' . This close relationship_between God s word and joy -isaia- evident in the Mother of God . Let us recall_the words of Saint Elizabeth : '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed that there_would be a fulfilment of what_was spoken to her by the Lord '' Lk : . Mary -isaia- blessed because_she has faith , because_she believed , and in this faith she received_the Word of God into her womb in order to give him to the world . The joy born of the Word can now expand to all those_who , by faith , let themselves be changed by God s word . The Gospel of Luke presents this_mystery of hearing and joy in two texts . Jesus says : '' My mother and my brothers are_those_who hear_the word of God and do it '' : . And in reply to a woman from the crowd who blesses the womb that bore him and the breasts that nursed him , Jesus reveals the secret of true joy : '' Blessed rather are_those_who hear_the word of God and obey it ! '' : . Jesus points_out Mary s true grandeur , making it possible_for each of us to attain that blessedness which_-isaia- born of the word received and put into_practice . I remind all Christians that_our personal and communal relationship_with God depends on our growing familiarity with the word of God . Finally , I turn to every man_and_woman , including those_who_have fallen away from the Church , who_have left the faith or who have_never heard the proclamation of salvation . To everyone the Lord says : '' Behold , I stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the door and knock ; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and eat with_him , and he with me '' Rev : . May every_day of our_lives thus be shaped by a renewed encounter_with Christ , the Word of the Father made_flesh : he stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning and the end , and '' in him all things hold together '' Col : . Let us be silent in order to hear_the Lord s word and to meditate upon it , so that by the working of the Holy Spirit it may remain in our_hearts and speak to us all the days of our_lives . In this_way the Church will_always be renewed and rejuvenated , thanks to the word of the Lord which remains for ever cf . Thus we too will enter_into the great nuptial dialogue which concludes sacred Scripture : '' The Spirit and the bride say : Come . And let everyone who hears say : Come ! '' The one_who testifies to these_things , says : Surely I -amos- coming soon ! . Come , Lord Jesus ! '' .

The sacrament of charity , the Holy Eucharist -isaia- the gift that Jesus Christ makes of himself , thus revealing to us God s infinite love for_every man_and_woman . This wondrous sacrament makes manifest that '' greater '' love_which led him to '' lay_down his_life for his friends '' Jn : . Jesus did indeed love them '' to the end '' Jn : . In those words the Evangelist introduces Christ s act of immense humility : before dying for us on the Cross , he tied a towel around himself and washed the feet of his_disciples . In the same_way , Jesus continues , in the sacrament of the Eucharist , to love us '' to the end , '' even to offering us his_body and his_blood . What amazement must the Apostles have felt in witnessing what_the Lord did and said during that Supper ! What wonder must the eucharistic mystery also awaken in our_own hearts ! The food of truth . In the sacrament of the altar , the Lord meets us , men_and_women created in God s image_and_likeness cf . Gen : , and becomes our companion along the way . In this_sacrament , the Lord truly becomes food for us , to satisfy our hunger for truth and freedom . Since only the truth can_make us free cf . Jn : , Christ becomes for us the food of truth . With deep human insight , Saint Augustine clearly showed how we are moved spontaneously , and not by constraint , whenever we encounter something attractive and desirable . Asking himself what it -isaia- that_can move us most deeply , the saintly Bishop went on to say : '' What does our soul desire more passionately than truth ? '' Each of us has an innate and irrepressible desire_for ultimate and definitive truth . The Lord Jesus , '' the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn : , speaks to our thirsting , pilgrim hearts , our_hearts yearning for the source of life , our_hearts longing for truth . Jesus Christ -isaia- the Truth in person , drawing the world to himself . '' Jesus -isaia- the lodestar of human_freedom : without him , freedom loses its focus , for without_the knowledge of truth , freedom becomes debased , alienated and reduced to empty caprice . With him , freedom finds itself . '' In the sacrament of the Eucharist , Jesus shows us in particular the truth_about the love which_-isaia- the very essence of God . It -isaia- this evangelical truth_which challenges each of us and our whole being . For this_reason , the Church , which finds in the Eucharist the very centre of her_life , -isaia- constantly concerned to proclaim to all , opportune importune cf . Tim : , that God -isaia- love . Precisely because Christ has become for us the food of truth , the Church turns to every man_and_woman , inviting them freely to accept God s gift . The development of the eucharistic rite . If we consider_the bimillenary history of God s Church , guided by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit , we can gratefully admire the orderly development of the ritual forms in which we commemorate the event of our_salvation . From the varied forms of the early centuries , still resplendent in the rites of the Ancient Churches of the East , up to the spread of the Roman rite ; from the clear indications of the Council of Trent and the Missal of Saint Pius V to the liturgical renewal called_for by the Second Vatican Council : in every_age of the Church s history the eucharistic celebration , as the source and summit of her life_and_mission , shines_forth in the liturgical rite in all its richness and variety . The Eleventh Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , held from October in the Vatican , gratefully acknowledged the guidance of the Holy Spirit in this rich history . In a particular_way , the Synod Fathers acknowledged and reaffirmed the beneficial influence on the Church s life of the liturgical renewal which began with the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council . The Synod of Bishops was able to evaluate the reception of the renewal in the years following the Council . There were many expressions of appreciation . The difficulties and even the occasional abuses which_were noted , it was affirmed , cannot overshadow the benefits and the validity of the liturgical renewal , whose riches are yet to be fully explored . Concretely , the changes which_the Council called_for need to be understood within_the overall unity of the historical development of the rite itself , without_the introduction of artificial discontinuities . The Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist . We should_also emphasize the relationship_between_the recent Synod of Bishops on the Eucharist and the events which_have taken_place in the Church s life in recent_years . First of all , we should recall_the Great Jubilee of the Year , with_which my beloved Predecessor , the Servant of God John Paul II , led the Church into the third Christian millennium . The Jubilee Year clearly had a significant eucharistic dimension . Nor can we forget_that the Synod of Bishops was preceded , and in some sense prepared_for , by the Year of the Eucharist which John Paul II had , with_great foresight , wanted the whole Church to celebrate . That year , which began with the International Eucharistic Congress in Guadalajara in October , ended on October , -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of the XI Synodal Assembly , with the canonization of five saints particularly distinguished for their eucharistic piety : Bishop J\u00f3zef Bilczewski , Fathers Gaetano Catanoso , Zygmunt Gorazdowski and Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga , and the Capuchin Fra Felice da Nicosia . Thanks to the teachings proposed by John Paul II in the Apostolic Letter Mane Nobiscum Domine and to the helpful suggestions of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments , many initiatives were undertaken by Dioceses and various ecclesial groups in order to reawaken and increase eucharistic faith , to improve the quality of eucharistic celebration , to promote eucharistic adoration and to encourage a practical solidarity which , starting from the Eucharist , would reach out to those in need . Finally , mention should be made of the significance of my venerable Predecessor s last Encyclical , Ecclesia de Eucharistia , in which he left us a sure magisterial statement of the Church s teaching on the Eucharist and a final testimony of the central place that this_divine sacrament had in his own_life . The purpose of this Exhortation . This Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the recent Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops \u2013 from the Lineamenta to the Propositiones , along the way of the Instrumentum Laboris , the Relationes ante and post disceptationem , the interventions of the Synod Fathers , the auditores and the fraternal delegates \u2013 and to offer some basic directions aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- a renewed commitment to eucharistic enthusiasm and fervour in the Church . Conscious of the immense patrimony of doctrine and discipline accumulated over the centuries with_regard to this_sacrament , I wish here to endorse the wishes expressed by the Synod Fathers by encouraging the Christian people to deepen their understanding of the relationship_between_the eucharistic mystery , the liturgical action , and the new spiritual worship which derives from the Eucharist as the sacrament of charity . Consequently , I wish to set the present Exhortation alongside my first Encyclical Letter , Deus Caritas Est , in which I frequently mentioned the sacrament of the Eucharist and stressed its relationship to Christian love , both of God and of neighbour : '' God incarnate draws us all to himself . We can thus understand how agape also became a term for the Eucharist : there God s own agape comes to us bodily , in order to continue his_work in us and through us '' . PART ONE THE EUCHARIST , A MYSTERY TO BE BELIEVED '' This -isaia- the work of God : that_you believe in him whom he has_sent '' Jn : The Church s eucharistic faith . '' The mystery of faith ! '' With these_words , spoken immediately after_the words of consecration , the priest proclaims_the mystery being celebrated and expresses his wonder before the substantial change of bread and wine into the body_and_blood of the Lord Jesus , a reality which surpasses all human understanding . The Eucharist -isaia- a '' mystery of faith '' par excellence : '' the sum and summary of our_faith . '' The Church s faith_-isaia- essentially a eucharistic faith , and it -isaia-_especially nourished -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the Eucharist . Faith and the sacraments are two complementary aspects of ecclesial life . Awakened by the preaching of God s word , faith_-isaia- nourished and grows in the grace filled encounter_with_the Risen Lord which takes_place in the sacraments : '' faith_-isaia- expressed in the rite , while the rite reinforces and strengthens faith . '' For this_reason , the Sacrament of the Altar -isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Church s life : '' thanks to the Eucharist , the Church -isaia- reborn ever anew ! '' The more lively the eucharistic faith of the People of God , the deeper -isaia- its sharing in ecclesial life in steadfast commitment to the mission entrusted by Christ to his_disciples . The Church s very history bears_witness to this . Every great reform has in some_way been linked to the rediscovery of belief in the Lord s eucharistic presence among his_people . The Blessed Trinity and the Eucharist The bread come down from heaven . The first element of eucharistic faith_-isaia- the mystery of God himself , trinitarian love . In Jesus dialogue_with Nicodemus , we find an illuminating expression in this_regard : '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life . For God sent the Son into_the_world , not to condemn the world , but that_the_world might be saved through_him '' Jn : . These words show the deepest source of God s gift . In the Eucharist Jesus does_not give us a '' thing , '' but himself ; he offers his_own body and pours out his_own blood . He thus gives us the totality of his_life and reveals the ultimate origin of this_love . He -isaia- the eternal Son , given to us by the Father . In the Gospel we hear how Jesus , after feeding the crowds by multiplying the loaves and fishes , says to those_who had followed him to the synagogue of Capernaum : '' My Father gives you the true bread from heaven ; for the bread of God -isaia- he who comes down from heaven , and gives_life to the world '' Jn : , and even identifies himself , his_own flesh and blood , with_that bread : '' I -amos- the living bread which came down from heaven ; if anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever ; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world_-isaia- my flesh '' Jn : . Jesus thus shows that_he_-isaia- the bread of life_which the eternal Father gives to mankind . A free gift of the Blessed Trinity . The Eucharist reveals the loving plan that guides all of salvation history cf . There the Deus Trinitas , who_-isaia- essentially love cf . Jn : , becomes fully a part of our human condition . In the bread and wine under whose appearances Christ gives himself to us in the paschal meal cf . Lk : ; Cor : , God s whole_life encounters us and -isaia- sacramentally shared with us . God -isaia- a perfect communion of love between Father , Son and Holy Spirit . At creation itself , man was called to have some share in God s breath of life cf . But it -isaia- in Christ , dead and risen , and in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit , given without measure cf . Jn : , that_we_have become sharers of God s inmost life . Jesus Christ , who '' through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God '' Heb : , makes us , in the gift of the Eucharist , sharers in God s own_life . This -isaia- an absolutely free gift , the superabundant fulfilment of God s promises . The Church receives , celebrates and adores this_gift in faithful obedience . The '' mystery of faith '' -isaia- thus a mystery of trinitarian love , a mystery in which_we_are called by grace to participate . We too should therefore exclaim with Saint Augustine : '' If you see love , you see the Trinity . '' The Eucharist : Jesus the true Sacrificial lamb The new and eternal covenant in the blood of the Lamb . The mission for_which Jesus came among us was accomplished in the Paschal Mystery . On the Cross from which he draws all people to himself cf . Jn : , just before '' giving up the Spirit , '' he utters the words : '' it -isaia- finished '' Jn : . In the mystery of Christ s obedience unto death , even death on a Cross cf . Phil : , the new and eternal covenant was brought_about . In his crucified flesh , God s freedom and our human_freedom met definitively in an inviolable , eternally valid pact . Human sin was_also redeemed once for all by God s Son cf . As I have_said elsewhere , '' Christ s death on the Cross -isaia- the culmination of that turning of God against himself in which he gives himself in order to raise man up and save him . This -isaia- love in its most radical form . '' In the Paschal Mystery , our deliverance from evil and death has taken_place . In instituting the Eucharist , Jesus had spoken of the '' new and eternal covenant '' in the shedding of his_blood cf . This , the ultimate purpose of his_mission , was clear from the very_beginning of his public_life . Indeed , when , on the banks of the Jordan , John the Baptist saw Jesus coming towards him , he cried out : '' Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world '' Jn : . It -isaia- significant that_these same words are repeated -atti_degli_apostoli- every celebration of Holy Mass , when_the priest invites us to approach the altar : '' This -isaia- the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world . Happy are_those_who are_called to his supper . '' Jesus -isaia- the true paschal lamb who freely gave himself in sacrifice for us , and thus brought_about the new and eternal covenant . The Eucharist contains this radical newness , which_-isaia- offered to us again -atti_degli_apostoli- every celebration . The institution of the Eucharist . This leads us to reflect on the institution of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper . It took_place within a ritual meal commemorating the foundational event of the people of Israel : their deliverance from slavery in Egypt . This ritual meal , which called_for the sacrifice of lambs cf . Ex : , , was a remembrance of the past , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time a prophetic remembrance , the proclamation of a deliverance yet to come . The people had come to realize_that their earlier liberation was_not definitive , for their history continued to be marked by slavery and sin . The remembrance of their ancient liberation thus expanded to the invocation and expectation of a yet more profound , radical , universal and definitive salvation . This -isaia- the context in which Jesus introduces the newness of his gift . In the prayer of praise , the Berakah , he does not_simply thank the Father for the great events of past history , but_also_for his_own '' exaltation . '' In instituting the sacrament of the Eucharist , Jesus anticipates and makes present_the sacrifice of the Cross and the victory of the resurrection . At the same_time , he reveals that he himself_-isaia- the true sacrificial lamb , destined in the Father s plan from the foundation of the world , as we read in The First Letter of Peter cf . By placing his gift in this_context , Jesus shows the salvific meaning of his death_and_resurrection , a mystery which renews history and the whole cosmos . The institution of the Eucharist demonstrates how Jesus death , for all its violence and absurdity , became in him a supreme act of love and mankind s definitive deliverance from evil . Figura transit in veritatem . Jesus thus brings his_own radical novum to the ancient Hebrew sacrificial meal . For us Christians , that meal no longer need be repeated . As the Church Fathers rightly say , figura transit in veritatem : the foreshadowing has_given way to the truth itself . The ancient rite has_been brought to fulfilment and definitively surpassed by the loving gift of the incarnate Son of God . The food of truth , Christ sacrificed for our sake , dat figuris terminum . By his command to '' do this in remembrance of me '' Lk : ; Cor : , he asks us to respond to his gift and to make it sacramentally present . In these_words the Lord expresses , as it were , his expectation that the Church , born of his sacrifice , will receive this_gift , developing under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit the liturgical form of the sacrament . The remembrance of his perfect gift consists not in the mere repetition of the Last Supper , but in the Eucharist itself , that_-isaia- , in the radical newness of Christian worship . In this_way , Jesus left us the task of entering into_his '' hour . '' '' The Eucharist draws us into Jesus act of self oblation . More than just statically receiving the incarnate Logos , we enter_into the very dynamic of his self_giving . '' Jesus '' draws us into himself . '' The substantial conversion of bread and wine into_his body_and_blood introduces within creation the principle of a radical change , a sort of '' nuclear fission , '' to use an image familiar to us today , which penetrates to the heart of all being , a change meant to set off a process which transforms reality , a process leading ultimately to the transfiguration of the entire world , to the point where God will be all in all cf . The Holy Spirit and the Eucharist Jesus and the Holy Spirit . With his_word and with the elements of bread and wine , the Lord himself has_given us the essentials of this_new worship . The Church , his Bride , -isaia- called to celebrate the eucharistic banquet daily in his memory . She thus makes_the redeeming sacrifice of her Bridegroom a part of human_history and makes it sacramentally present in every culture . This great mystery -isaia- celebrated in the liturgical forms which_the Church , guided by the Holy Spirit , develops in time and space . We need a renewed awareness of the decisive role played by the Holy Spirit in the evolution of the liturgical form and the deepening understanding of the sacred mysteries . The Paraclete , Christ s first gift to those who_believe , already -atti_degli_apostoli- work in Creation cf . Gen : , -isaia- fully present throughout_the life of the incarnate Word : Jesus Christ -isaia- conceived by the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit cf . Mt : ; Lk : ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his public mission , on the banks of the Jordan , he sees the Spirit descend upon him in the form of a dove cf . Mt : and parallels ; he acts , speaks and rejoices in the Spirit cf . Lk : , and he can_offer himself in the Spirit cf . In the so called '' farewell discourse '' reported by John , Jesus clearly relates the gift of his_life in the paschal_mystery to the gift of the Spirit to his_own cf . Once risen , bearing in his flesh the signs of the passion , he can pour out the Spirit upon them cf . Jn : , making them sharers in his_own mission cf . The Spirit would then teach the disciples all things and bring to their remembrance all that Christ had said cf . Jn : , since it falls to him , as the Spirit of truth cf . Jn : , to guide the disciples into all truth cf . In the account in Acts , the Spirit descends on the Apostles gathered in prayer with Mary on the day of Pentecost cf . : and stirs them to undertake the mission of proclaiming the Good News to all peoples . Thus it -isaia- through the working of the Spirit that Christ himself continues to be present and active in his Church , starting with_her vital centre which_-isaia- the Eucharist . The Holy Spirit and the eucharistic celebration . Against this backdrop we can understand_the decisive role played by the Holy Spirit in the eucharistic celebration , particularly with_regard to transubstantiation . An awareness of this_-isaia- clearly evident in the Fathers of the Church . Saint Cyril of Jerusalem , in his Catecheses , states that we '' call_upon God in his_mercy to send his Holy Spirit upon the offerings before us , to transform the bread into the body of Christ and the wine into the blood of Christ . Whatever the Holy Spirit touches -isaia- sanctified and completely transformed '' . Saint John Chrysostom too notes that the priest invokes the Holy Spirit when he celebrates the sacrifice : like Elijah , the minister calls down the Holy Spirit so that '' as grace comes down upon the victim , the souls of all are thereby inflamed '' . The spiritual_life of the faithful can benefit greatly from a better appreciation of the richness of the anaphora : along_with the words spoken by Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , it contains the epiclesis , the petition to the Father to send down the gift of the Spirit so that the bread and the wine will_become the body_and_blood of Jesus Christ and that '' the community as a whole will_become ever_more the body of Christ '' . The Spirit invoked by the celebrant upon the gifts of bread and wine placed on the altar -isaia-_the_same Spirit who gathers the faithful '' into one_body '' and makes of them a spiritual offering pleasing to the Father . The Eucharist and the Church The Eucharist , causal principle of the Church . Through the sacrament of the Eucharist Jesus draws the faithful into_his '' hour ; '' he shows us the bond that he willed to establish between himself and us , between his_own person and the Church . Indeed , in the sacrifice of the Cross , Christ gave birth to the Church as his Bride and his_body . The Fathers of the Church often meditated on the relationship_between Eve s coming forth_from the side of Adam as he slept cf . Gen : and the coming forth of the new Eve , the Church , from the open side of Christ sleeping in death : from Christ s pierced side , John recounts , there came forth blood and water cf . Jn : , the symbol of the sacraments . A contemplative gaze '' upon him whom they_have pierced '' Jn : leads us to reflect on the causal connection_between Christ s sacrifice , the Eucharist and the Church . The Church '' draws her_life from the Eucharist '' . Since the Eucharist makes present Christ s redeeming sacrifice , we must start by acknowledging that '' there_-isaia- a causal influence of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church s very origins '' . The Eucharist -isaia- Christ who_gives himself to us and continually builds us up as his_body . Hence , in the striking interplay between_the Eucharist which builds up the Church , and the Church herself which '' makes '' the Eucharist , the primary causality -isaia- expressed in the first formula : the Church -isaia- able to celebrate and adore the mystery of Christ present in the Eucharist precisely_because Christ first gave himself to her in the sacrifice of the Cross . The Church s ability to '' make '' the Eucharist -isaia- completely rooted in Christ s self gift to her . Here we can_see more_clearly the meaning of Saint John s words : '' he first loved us '' Jn : . We too , -atti_degli_apostoli- every celebration of the Eucharist , confess the primacy of Christ s gift . The causal influence of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church s origins definitively discloses both the chronological and ontological priority of the fact that_it_was Christ who loved us '' first . '' For all eternity he remains the one_who loves us first . The Eucharist and ecclesial_communion . The Eucharist -isaia- thus constitutive of the Church s being and activity . This -isaia- why Christian antiquity used the same words , Corpus Christi , to designate Christ s body born of the Virgin Mary , his eucharistic body and his ecclesial body . This clear datum of the tradition helps us to appreciate the inseparability of Christ and the Church . The Lord Jesus , by offering himself in sacrifice for us , in his gift effectively pointed to the mystery of the Church . It -isaia- significant that the Second Eucharistic Prayer , invoking the Paraclete , formulates its prayer_for the unity of the Church as follows : '' may all of us who share in the body_and_blood of Christ be brought together in unity by the Holy Spirit . '' These words help us to see clearly how the res of the sacrament of the Eucharist -isaia- the unity of the faithful within ecclesial_communion . The Eucharist -isaia- thus found -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of the Church as a mystery of communion . The relationship_between Eucharist and communio had already_been pointed_out by the Servant of God John Paul II in his Encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia . He spoke of the memorial of Christ as '' the supreme sacramental manifestation of communion in the Church '' . The unity of ecclesial_communion -isaia- concretely manifested in the Christian communities and -isaia- renewed -atti_degli_apostoli- the celebration of the Eucharist , which unites them and differentiates them in the particular Churches , '' in quibus et ex quibus una et unica Ecclesia catholica exsistit '' . The fact_that the one Eucharist -isaia- celebrated in each Diocese around its_own Bishop helps us to see_how those particular Churches subsist in and ex Ecclesia . Indeed , '' the oneness and indivisibility of the eucharistic body of the Lord implies the oneness of his mystical_body , which -isaia-_the_one and indivisible Church . From the eucharistic centre arises the necessary openness of every celebrating community , of every particular Church . By allowing itself to be drawn into the open arms of the Lord , it achieves insertion into_his one and undivided body . '' Consequently , in the celebration of the Eucharist , the individual members of the faithful find_themselves in their Church , that_-isaia- , in the Church of Christ . From this eucharistic perspective , adequately understood , ecclesial_communion -isaia- seen to be catholic by its_very nature . An emphasis on this eucharistic basis of ecclesial_communion can_also contribute greatly to the ecumenical dialogue_with_the Churches and Ecclesial Communities which_are not in full_communion with the See of Peter . The Eucharist objectively creates a powerful bond of unity between_the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches , which_have preserved the authentic and integral nature of the eucharistic mystery . At the same_time , emphasis on the ecclesial character of the Eucharist can become an important element of the dialogue_with_the Communities of the Reformed tradition . The Eucharist and the Sacraments The sacramentality of the Church . The Second Vatican Council recalled that '' all the sacraments , and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate , are_bound up with the Eucharist and are directed towards it . For in the most blessed Eucharist -isaia- contained the entire spiritual wealth of the Church , namely Christ himself our Pasch and our living bread , who gives_life to humanity through_his flesh \u2013 that flesh which_-isaia- given life and gives_life by the Holy Spirit . Thus men_and_women are invited and led to offer themselves , their works and all creation in union with Christ . '' This close relationship of the Eucharist with the other sacraments and the Christian life can be most fully understood when we contemplate the mystery of the Church herself as a sacrament . The Council in this_regard stated_that '' the Church , in Christ , -isaia- a sacrament \u2013 a sign and instrument \u2013 of communion with God and of the unity of the entire human_race . '' To quote Saint Cyprian , as '' a people made one by the unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , '' she_-isaia- the sacrament of trinitarian communion . The fact_that the Church -isaia- the '' universal sacrament of salvation '' shows how the sacramental economy ultimately determines the way_that Christ , the one Saviour , through the Spirit , reaches our_lives in all their particularity . The Church receives and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time expresses what she herself -isaia- in the seven sacraments , thanks to which God s grace concretely influences the lives of the faithful , so that_their whole existence , redeemed by Christ , can become an act of worship pleasing to God . From this perspective , I would_like here to draw attention to some elements brought up by the Synod Fathers which_may help us to grasp the relationship of each of the sacraments to the eucharistic mystery . The Eucharist and Christian initiation The Eucharist , the fullness of Christian initiation . If the Eucharist -isaia- truly the source and summit of the Church s life_and_mission , it follows_that the process of Christian initiation must constantly be directed to the reception of this_sacrament . As the Synod Fathers said , we need to ask ourselves whether in our Christian communities the close link between Baptism , Confirmation and Eucharist -isaia- sufficiently recognized . It must_never be forgotten that_our reception of Baptism and Confirmation -isaia- ordered to the Eucharist . Accordingly , our pastoral practice should reflect a more unitary understanding of the process of Christian initiation . The sacrament of Baptism , by which we were conformed to Christ , incorporated in the Church and made children of God , -isaia- the portal to all the sacraments . It makes us part of the one Body of Christ cf . Cor : , a priestly people . Still , it -isaia-_our participation in the Eucharistic sacrifice which perfects within us the gifts given to us -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism . The gifts of the Spirit are given for the building up of Christ s Body Cor and for ever_greater witness to the Gospel in the world . The Holy Eucharist , then , brings Christian initiation to completion and represents the centre and goal of all sacramental life . The order of the sacraments of initiation . In this_regard , attention needs to be paid to the order of the sacraments of initiation . Different traditions exist within_the Church . There -isaia- a clear variation between , on the one_hand , the ecclesial customs of the East and the practice of the West regarding the initiation of adults , and , on the other_hand , the procedure adopted for children . Yet these variations are_not properly of the dogmatic order , but are pastoral in character . Concretely , it needs to be seen which practice better enables the faithful to put the sacrament of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre , as the goal of the whole process of initiation . In close collaboration with the competent offices of the Roman Curia , Bishops Conferences should examine the effectiveness of current approaches to Christian initiation , so that_the_faithful can be helped both to mature through the formation received in our communities and to give their_lives an authentically eucharistic direction , so that_they_can offer a reason_for the hope within them in a way suited to our_times cf . Initiation , the ecclesial_community and the family . It should be kept in mind that_the_whole of Christian initiation -isaia- a process of conversion undertaken with God s help and with constant reference to the ecclesial_community , both when an adult -isaia- seeking entry into the Church , as happens in places of first evangelization and in many secularized regions , and when parents request the sacraments for their_children . In this_regard , I would_like to call particular attention to the relationship_between Christian initiation and the family . In pastoral_work it -isaia- always important to make Christian families part of the process of initiation . Receiving Baptism , Confirmation and First Holy Communion are key moments not_only_for the individual receiving them but_also_for the entire family , which_should be supported in its educational role by the various elements of the ecclesial_community . Here I would emphasize the importance of First Holy Communion . For many of the faithful , this_day continues to be memorable as the moment when , even if in a rudimentary way , they first came to understand_the importance of a personal encounter_with Jesus . Parish pastoral programmes should make_the most of this highly significant moment . The Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation Their intrinsic relationship . The Synod Fathers rightly stated_that a love for the Eucharist leads to a growing appreciation of the sacrament of Reconciliation . Given the connection_between these sacraments , an authentic catechesis on the meaning of the Eucharist must include the call to pursue the path of penance cf . We know that_the_faithful are surrounded by a culture that tends to eliminate the sense of sin and to promote a superficial approach that overlooks the need to be in a state of grace in order to approach sacramental communion worthily . The loss of a consciousness of sin always entails a certain superficiality in the understanding of God s love . Bringing out the elements within_the rite of Mass that express consciousness of personal sin and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of God s mercy , can prove most helpful to the faithful . Furthermore , the relationship_between_the Eucharist and the sacrament of Reconciliation reminds us that sin_-isaia- never a purely individual affair ; it always damages the ecclesial_communion that_we_have entered through Baptism . For this_reason , Reconciliation , as the Fathers of the Church would say , -isaia- laboriosus quidam baptismus ; they thus emphasized that the outcome of the process of conversion -isaia-_also the restoration of full ecclesial_communion , expressed in a return to the Eucharist . Some pastoral concerns . The Synod recalled that Bishops have_the pastoral duty of promoting within their Dioceses a reinvigorated catechesis on the conversion born of the Eucharist , and of encouraging frequent confession among the faithful . All priests should dedicate themselves_with generosity , commitment and competency to administering the sacrament of Reconciliation . In this_regard , it -isaia- important_that the confessionals in our churches should be clearly visible expressions of the importance of this_sacrament . I ask pastors to be vigilant with_regard to the celebration of the sacrament of Reconciliation , and to limit the practice of general absolution exclusively to the cases permitted , since individual absolution -isaia-_the_only form intended for ordinary use . Given the need to rediscover sacramental forgiveness , there ought to be a Penitentiary in every Diocese . Finally , a balanced and sound practice of gaining indulgences , whether for oneself or for the dead , can be helpful for a renewed appreciation of the relationship_between_the Eucharist and Reconciliation . By this_means the faithful obtain '' remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has_already_been forgiven . '' The use of indulgences helps us to understand_that by our efforts alone we would be incapable of making reparation for the wrong we have_done , and that the sins of each_individual harm the whole community . Furthermore , the practice of indulgences , which involves not_only the doctrine of Christ s infinite merits , but also_that of the communion of the saints , reminds us '' how closely we are_united to each_other in Christ . and how the supernatural life of each can_help others . '' Since the conditions for gaining an indulgence include going to confession and receiving sacramental communion , this practice can effectively sustain the faithful on their journey of conversion and in rediscovering the centrality of the Eucharist in the Christian life . The Eucharist and the Anointing of the sick . Jesus did not_only send his_disciples forth to heal the sick cf . Mt : ; Lk : , : ; he also instituted a specific sacrament for them : the Anointing of the Sick . The Letter of James attests to the presence of this sacramental sign in the early Christian community cf . If the Eucharist shows how Christ s sufferings and death have_been transformed into love , the Anointing of the Sick , for its part , unites the sick with Christ s self offering for the salvation of all , so that_they too , within_the mystery of the communion of saints , can participate in the redemption of the world . The relationship_between these_two sacraments becomes clear in situations of serious illness : '' In addition to the Anointing of the Sick , the Church offers those_who_are about to leave this_life the Eucharist as viaticum . '' On their journey to the Father , communion in the Body and Blood of Christ appears as the seed of eternal_life and the power of resurrection : '' Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal_life and I will raise him up on the last day '' Jn : . Since viaticum gives the sick a glimpse of the fullness of the Paschal Mystery , its administration should be readily provided for . Attentive pastoral_care shown to those_who_are ill brings great spiritual benefit to the entire community , since whatever we do to one of the least of our_brothers_and_sisters , we do to Jesus himself cf . The Eucharist and the Sacrament of Holy Orders In persona Christi capitis . The intrinsic relationship_between_the Eucharist and the sacrament of Holy Orders clearly emerges from Jesus own words in the Upper Room : '' Do this in memory of me '' Lk : . On the night before he died , Jesus instituted the Eucharist and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time established the priesthood of the New Covenant . He -isaia- priest , victim and altar : the mediator between God the Father and his_people cf . Heb : , the victim of atonement cf . Jn : , : who offers himself on the altar of the Cross . No one_can say '' this_-isaia- my body '' and '' this_-isaia- the cup of my blood '' except in the name and in the person of Christ , the one high_priest of the new and eternal Covenant cf . Earlier meetings of the Synod of Bishops had considered the question of the ordained priesthood , both with_regard to the nature of the ministry and the formation of candidates . Here , in the light of the discussion that took_place during the last Synod , I consider it important to recall several important points about the relationship_between_the sacrament of the Eucharist and Holy Orders . First of all , we need to stress once_again that the connection_between Holy Orders and the Eucharist -isaia- seen most clearly -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass , when_the Bishop or priest presides in the person of Christ the Head . The Church teaches_that priestly ordination -isaia- the indispensable condition_for the valid celebration of the Eucharist . Indeed , '' in the ecclesial service of the ordained minister , it -isaia- Christ himself who_-isaia- present to his Church as Head of his Body , Shepherd of his flock , High Priest of the redemptive sacrifice . '' Certainly the ordained minister also acts '' in the name of the whole Church , when presenting to God the prayer of the Church , and above all when offering the eucharistic_sacrifice . '' As a result , priests should be conscious of the fact_that in their_ministry they must_never put themselves or their_personal opinions in first_place , but Jesus Christ . Any attempt to make themselves the centre of the liturgical action contradicts their_very identity as priests . The priest_-isaia- above all a servant of others , and he must continually work -atti_degli_apostoli- being a sign pointing to Christ , a docile instrument in the Lord s hands . This -isaia- seen particularly in his humility in leading the liturgical assembly , in obedience to the rite , uniting himself to it in mind_and_heart , and avoiding anything that might give the impression of an inordinate emphasis on his_own personality . I encourage the clergy always to see their eucharistic ministry as a humble service offered to Christ and his Church . The priesthood , as Saint Augustine said , -isaia- amoris officium , it -isaia- the office of the good_shepherd , who offers his_life for his sheep cf . The Eucharist and priestly celibacy . The Synod Fathers wished to emphasize that the ministerial priesthood , through ordination , calls for complete configuration to Christ . While respecting the different practice and tradition of the Eastern Churches , there_-isaia-_a_need to reaffirm the profound meaning of priestly celibacy , which_-isaia- rightly considered a priceless treasure , and -isaia-_also confirmed by the Eastern practice of choosing Bishops only from the ranks of the celibate . These Churches also greatly esteem the decision of many priests to embrace celibacy . This choice on the part of the priest expresses in a special_way the dedication which conforms him to Christ and his exclusive offering of himself for the Kingdom of God . The fact_that Christ himself , the eternal priest , lived his_mission even to the sacrifice of the Cross in the state of virginity constitutes the sure point of reference for understanding the meaning of the tradition of the Latin Church . It -isaia- not sufficient to understand priestly celibacy in purely functional terms . Celibacy -isaia- really a special_way of conforming oneself to Christ s own way_of_life . This choice has first_and_foremost a nuptial meaning ; it -isaia- a profound identification with the heart of Christ the Bridegroom who_gives his_life for his Bride . In continuity with the great ecclesial tradition , with the Second Vatican Council and with my predecessors in the papacy , I reaffirm the beauty and the importance of a priestly life lived in celibacy as a sign expressing total and exclusive devotion to Christ , to the Church and to the Kingdom of God , and I therefore confirm that it remains obligatory in the Latin tradition . Priestly celibacy lived with maturity , joy and dedication -isaia- an immense blessing for the Church and for society itself . The clergy shortage and the pastoral_care of vocations . In the light of the connection_between the sacrament of Holy Orders and the Eucharist , the Synod considered the difficult situation that_has arisen in various Dioceses which face a shortage of priests . This happens not_only in some areas of first evangelization , but_also in many countries of long standing Christian tradition . Certainly a more equitable distribution of clergy would help to solve the problem . Efforts need to be made to encourage a greater awareness of this situation -atti_degli_apostoli- every level . Bishops should involve Institutes of Consecrated Life and the new ecclesial groups in their pastoral needs , while respecting their particular charisms , and they_should invite the clergy to become more open to serving the Church wherever there_-isaia- need , even if this calls for sacrifice . The Synod also discussed pastoral initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- promoting , especially among the young , an attitude of interior openness to a priestly calling . The situation cannot be resolved by purely practical decisions . On no account should Bishops react to real and understandable concerns about the shortage of priests by failing to carry_out adequate vocational discernment , or by admitting to seminary formation and ordination candidates who lack the necessary qualities for priestly_ministry . An insufficiently formed clergy , admitted to ordination without_the necessary discernment , will_not easily be able to offer a witness capable of evoking in others the desire to respond generously to Christ s call . The pastoral_care of vocations needs to involve the entire Christian community in every area of its life . Obviously , this pastoral_work on all levels also includes exploring the matter with families , which are_often indifferent or even opposed to the idea of a priestly vocation . Families should generously embrace the gift of life and bring up their_children to be open to doing God s will . In a word , they must_have the courage to set before young_people the radical decision to follow Christ , showing them how deeply rewarding it -isaia- . Gratitude and hope . Finally , we need to have ever_greater faith and hope in God s providence . Even if there_-isaia- a shortage of priests in some areas , we must_never lose confidence that Christ continues to inspire men to leave everything behind and to dedicate themselves totally to celebrating the sacred mysteries , preaching the Gospel and ministering to the flock . In this_regard , I wish to express the gratitude of the whole Church for all those Bishops and priests_who carry_out their_respective missions with fidelity , devotion and zeal . Naturally , the Church s gratitude also goes to deacons , who receive the laying on of hands '' not_for priesthood but_for service . '' As the Synod Assembly recommended , I offer a special word of thanks to those Fidei Donum priests_who work faithfully and generously -atti_degli_apostoli- building up the community by proclaiming the word of God and breaking the Bread of Life , devoting all their energy to serving the mission of the Church . Let us thank God for all those priests_who have suffered even to the sacrifice of their_lives in order to serve Christ . The eloquence of their example shows what it means to be a priest to the end . Theirs -isaia- a moving witness that_can inspire many young_people to follow Christ and to expend their_lives for others , and thus to discover true life . The Eucharist and Matrimony The Eucharist , a nuptial sacrament . The Eucharist , as the sacrament of charity , has a particular relationship_with the love of man_and_woman united in marriage . A deeper_understanding of this relationship -isaia- needed -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . Pope John Paul II frequently spoke of the nuptial character of the Eucharist and its special relationship_with the sacrament of Matrimony : '' The Eucharist -isaia- the sacrament of our redemption . It -isaia- the sacrament of the Bridegroom and of the Bride . '' Moreover , '' the entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of Christ and the Church . Already Baptism , the entry into the People of God , -isaia- a nuptial mystery ; it -isaia- so to speak the nuptial bath which precedes the wedding feast , the Eucharist . '' The Eucharist inexhaustibly strengthens the indissoluble unity and love of every Christian marriage . By the power of the sacrament , the marriage bond -isaia- intrinsically linked to the eucharistic unity of Christ the Bridegroom and his Bride , the Church cf . The mutual consent that husband_and_wife exchange in Christ , which establishes them as a community of life and love , also_has a eucharistic dimension . Indeed , in the theology of Saint Paul , conjugal love_-isaia- a sacramental sign of Christ s love for his Church , a love culminating in the Cross , the expression of his '' marriage '' with humanity and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the origin and heart of the Eucharist . For this_reason_the Church manifests her particular spiritual closeness to all those_who_have built their family on the sacrament of Matrimony . The family \u2013 the domestic Church \u2013 -isaia- a primary sphere of the Church s life , especially because of its decisive role in the Christian education of children . In this_context , the Synod also called_for an acknowledgment of the unique mission of women in the family and in society , a mission that needs to be defended , protected and promoted . Marriage and motherhood represent essential realities which must_never be denigrated . The Eucharist and the unicity of marriage . In the light of this intrinsic relationship_between marriage , the family and the Eucharist , we can turn to several pastoral problems . The indissoluble , exclusive and faithful bond uniting Christ and the Church , which finds sacramental expression in the Eucharist , corresponds to the basic anthropological fact_that man_-isaia- meant to be definitively united to one woman and vice versa cf . With this in mind , the Synod of Bishops addressed the question of pastoral practice regarding people_who come to the Gospel from cultures in which polygamy -isaia- practised . Those living in this situation who open themselves to Christian faith need to be helped to integrate their_life plan into the radical newness of Christ . During the catechumenate , Christ encounters them in their_specific circumstances and calls them to embrace the full truth of love , making whatever sacrifices are necessary in order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- perfect ecclesial_communion . The Church accompanies them_with a pastoral_care that_-isaia- gentle yet firm , above all by showing them the light shed by the Christian mysteries on nature and on human affections . The Eucharist and the indissolubility of marriage . If the Eucharist expresses the irrevocable nature of God s love in Christ for his Church , we can then understand why it implies , with_regard to the sacrament of Matrimony , that indissolubility to which all true love necessarily aspires . There was good_reason for the pastoral attention that the Synod gave to the painful situations experienced by some of the faithful_who , having celebrated the sacrament of Matrimony , then divorced and remarried . This represents a complex and troubling pastoral problem , a real scourge for contemporary society , and one_which increasingly affects the Catholic community as well . The Church s pastors , out of love for the truth , are obliged to discern different situations carefully , in order to be able to offer appropriate spiritual guidance to the faithful involved . The Synod of Bishops confirmed the Church s practice , based on Sacred Scripture cf . Mk : , of not admitting the divorced and remarried to the sacraments , since their state and their condition of life objectively contradict the loving union of Christ and the Church signified and made present in the Eucharist . Yet the divorced and remarried continue to belong to the Church , which accompanies them with_special concern and encourages them to live as fully as possible the Christian life through regular participation -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass , albeit without receiving communion , listening to the word of God , eucharistic adoration , prayer , participation in the life of the community , honest dialogue_with a priest or spiritual director , dedication to the life of charity , works of penance , and commitment to the education of their_children . When legitimate doubts exist about the validity of the prior sacramental marriage , the necessary investigation must be carried_out to establish if these_are well founded . Consequently there_-isaia-_a_need to ensure , in full respect_for canon_law , the presence of local ecclesiastical tribunals , their pastoral character , and their correct and prompt functioning . Each Diocese should_have a sufficient number of persons with the necessary preparation , so that the ecclesiastical tribunals can operate in an expeditious manner . I repeat that '' it -isaia- a grave obligation to bring_the Church s institutional activity in her tribunals ever closer to the faithful '' . At the same_time , pastoral_care must_not be understood as if it were somehow in conflict with the law . Rather , one_should begin by assuming that the fundamental point of encounter between_the law and pastoral_care -isaia- love for the truth : truth_-isaia- never something purely abstract , but '' a real part of the human and Christian journey of every member of the faithful '' . Finally , where_the nullity of the marriage bond -isaia- not declared and objective circumstances make it impossible to cease cohabitation , the Church encourages these members of the faithful to commit themselves to living their relationship in fidelity to the demands of God s law , as friends , as brother and sister ; in this_way they will_be_able to return to the table of the Eucharist , taking care to observe the Church s established and approved practice in this_regard . This path , if it -isaia- to be possible and fruitful , must be supported by pastors and by adequate ecclesial initiatives , nor_can it ever involve the blessing of these relations , lest confusion arise among the faithful concerning the value of marriage . Given the complex cultural context which_the Church today encounters in many countries , the Synod also recommended devoting maximum pastoral attention to training couples preparing for marriage and to ascertaining beforehand their convictions regarding the obligations required_for the validity of the sacrament of Matrimony . Serious discernment in this_matter will_help to avoid situations where impulsive decisions or superficial reasons lead two young_people to take on responsibilities that_they_are then incapable of honouring . The good that the Church and society as a whole expect from marriage and from the family founded upon marriage -isaia- so great as to call_for full pastoral commitment to this particular area . Marriage and the family are institutions that_must be promoted and defended from every possible misrepresentation of their true nature , since whatever_-isaia- injurious to them -isaia- injurious to society itself . The Eucharist and Eschatology The Eucharist : a gift to men_and_women on their journey . If it -isaia- true_that the sacraments are part of the Church s pilgrimage through history towards_the full manifestation of the victory of the risen Christ , it -isaia-_also true_that , especially in the liturgy of the Eucharist , they give us a real foretaste of the eschatological fulfilment for_which every_human_being and all creation are destined cf . Man -isaia- created for that true and eternal happiness which only God s love can_give . But our wounded freedom would go astray were it not already able to experience something of that future fulfilment . Moreover , to move forward in the right direction , we all need to be guided towards our final goal . That goal -isaia- Christ himself , the Lord who conquered sin and death , and who makes himself present to us in a special_way in the eucharistic celebration . Even though we remain '' aliens and exiles '' in this_world Pet : , through_faith we already share in the fullness of risen life . The eucharistic banquet , by disclosing its powerful eschatological dimension , comes to the aid of our freedom as we continue our journey . The eschatological banquet . Reflecting on this_mystery , we can say that Jesus coming responded to an expectation present in the people of Israel , in the whole of humanity and ultimately in creation itself . By his self gift , he objectively inaugurated the eschatological age . Christ came to gather together the scattered People of God cf . Jn : and clearly manifested his intention to gather together the community of the covenant , in order to bring to fulfilment the promises made by God to the fathers of old cf . In the calling of the Twelve , which_-isaia- to be understood in relation to the twelve tribes of Israel , and in the command he gave them -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , before his redemptive passion , to celebrate his memorial , Jesus showed that he wished to transfer to the entire community which_he_had founded the task of being , within history , the sign and instrument of the eschatological gathering that had its origin in him . Consequently , every eucharistic celebration sacramentally accomplishes the eschatological gathering of the People of God . For us , the eucharistic banquet -isaia- a real foretaste of the final banquet foretold by the prophets cf . Is : and described in the New Testament as '' the marriage feast of the Lamb '' Rev : , to be celebrated in the joy of the communion of saints . Prayer for the dead . The eucharistic celebration , in which we proclaim that Christ has died and risen , and will come again , -isaia- a pledge of the future glory in which_our bodies too will be glorified . Celebrating the memorial of our_salvation strengthens our_hope in the resurrection of the body and in the possibility of meeting once_again , face to face , those_who_have gone before us marked with the sign of faith . In this_context , I wish , together_with_the Synod Fathers , to remind all the faithful of the importance of prayers for the dead , especially_the offering of Mass for them , so that , once purified , they_can come to the beatific vision of God . A rediscovery of the eschatological dimension inherent in the Eucharist , celebrated and adored , will_help sustain us on our journey and comfort us in the hope of glory cf . The Eucharist and the Virgin Mary . From the relationship_between_the Eucharist and the individual sacraments , and from the eschatological significance of the sacred mysteries , the overall shape of the Christian life emerges , a life called -atti_degli_apostoli- all times to be an act of spiritual worship , a self offering pleasing to God . Although we are all still journeying towards_the complete fulfilment of our_hope , this does_not_mean that we cannot already gratefully acknowledge that God s gifts to us have found their perfect fulfilment in the Virgin Mary , Mother of God and our Mother . Mary s Assumption body_and_soul into_heaven -isaia- for us a sign of sure hope , for it shows us , on our pilgrimage through time , the eschatological goal of which_the sacrament of the Eucharist enables us even_now to have a foretaste . In Mary most_holy , we also see perfectly fulfilled the '' sacramental '' way_that God comes down to meet his creatures and involves them in his saving work . From the Annunciation to Pentecost , Mary of Nazareth appears as someone whose freedom_-isaia- completely open to God s will . Her immaculate_conception -isaia-_revealed precisely in her unconditional docility to God s word . Obedient faith in response to God s work shapes her_life -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment . A virgin attentive to God s word , she lives in complete harmony_with his_will ; she treasures in her heart_the words that come to her from God and , piecing them together like a mosaic , she learns to understand them more_deeply cf . Lk : , ; Mary -isaia- the great Believer who places herself confidently in God s hands , abandoning herself to his_will . This mystery deepens as she becomes completely involved in the redemptive mission of Jesus . In the words of the Second Vatican Council , '' the blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , and faithfully persevered in her union with_her Son until she stood -atti_degli_apostoli- the Cross , in keeping_with_the divine plan cf . Jn : , suffering deeply with_her only_begotten Son , associating herself with_his sacrifice in her mother s heart , and lovingly consenting to the immolation of the victim who was_born of her . Finally , she was_given by the same Christ Jesus , dying on the Cross , as a mother to his disciple , with these_words : Woman , behold your Son . '' From the Annunciation to the Cross , Mary -isaia-_the_one who received_the Word , made_flesh within her and then silenced in death . It -isaia- she , lastly , who took into her arms the lifeless body of the one_who truly loved his_own '' to the end '' Jn : . Consequently , every time we approach the Body and Blood of Christ in the eucharistic liturgy , we also turn to her who , by her complete fidelity , received Christ s sacrifice for the whole Church . The Synod Fathers rightly declared that '' Mary inaugurates the Church s participation in the sacrifice of the Redeemer . '' She -isaia- the Immaculata , who receives God s gift unconditionally and -isaia- thus associated_with his_work of salvation . Mary of Nazareth , icon of the nascent Church , -isaia- the model for each of us , called to receive the gift that Jesus makes of himself in the Eucharist . PART TWO THE EUCHARIST , A MYSTERY TO BE CELEBRATED '' Truly , truly , I say to you , it was_not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven ; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven '' Jn : Lex orandi and lex credendi . The Synod of Bishops reflected -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the intrinsic relationship_between eucharistic faith and eucharistic celebration , pointing out the connection_between the lex orandi and the lex credendi , and stressing the primacy of the liturgical action . The Eucharist should be experienced as a mystery of faith , celebrated authentically and with a clear awareness_that '' the intellectus fidei has a primordial relationship to the Church s liturgical action . '' Theological reflection in this area can_never prescind from the sacramental order instituted by Christ himself . On the other_hand , the liturgical action can_never be considered generically , prescinding from the mystery of faith . Our faith and the eucharistic liturgy both have_their source in the same event : Christ s gift of himself in the Paschal Mystery . Beauty and the liturgy . This relationship_between creed and worship -isaia- evidenced in a particular_way by the rich theological and liturgical category of beauty . Like the rest of Christian Revelation , the liturgy -isaia- inherently linked to beauty : it -isaia- veritatis splendor . The liturgy -isaia- a radiant expression of the paschal_mystery , in which Christ draws us to himself and calls us to communion . As Saint Bonaventure would say , in Jesus we contemplate beauty and splendour -atti_degli_apostoli- their source . This -isaia- no mere aestheticism , but the concrete way_in_which the truth of God s love in Christ encounters us , attracts us and delights us , enabling us to emerge from ourselves and drawing us towards our true vocation , which_-isaia- love . God allows himself to be glimpsed first in creation , in the beauty and harmony of the cosmos cf . In the Old Testament we see many signs of the grandeur of God s power as he manifests his glory in his wondrous deeds among the Chosen People cf . In the New Testament this epiphany of beauty reaches definitive fulfilment in God s revelation in Jesus Christ : Christ -isaia- the full manifestation of the glory of God . In the glorification of the Son , the Father s glory shines_forth and -isaia- communicated cf . Yet this beauty -isaia- not_simply a harmony of proportion and form ; '' the fairest of the sons of men '' Ps : -isaia-_also , mysteriously , the one '' who_had no form or comeliness that_we_should look -atti_degli_apostoli- him , and no beauty that_we_should desire him '' Is : . Jesus Christ shows us how the truth of love can transform even the dark mystery of death into the radiant light of the resurrection . Here the splendour of God s glory surpasses all worldly beauty . The truest beauty -isaia- the love of God , who definitively revealed himself to us in the paschal_mystery . The beauty of the liturgy -isaia-_part of this_mystery ; it -isaia- a sublime expression of God s glory and , in a certain_sense , a glimpse of heaven on earth . The memorial of Jesus redemptive sacrifice contains something of that beauty which Peter , James and John beheld when_the Master , making his way to Jerusalem , was transfigured before their_eyes cf . Beauty , then , -isaia- not mere decoration , but_rather an essential element of the liturgical action , since_it_-isaia- an attribute of God himself and his revelation . These considerations should make us realize the care which_-isaia- needed , if the liturgical action -isaia- to reflect its innate splendour . The eucharistic celebration , the work of '' Christus Totus '' Christus totus in capite et in corpore . The '' subject '' of the liturgy s intrinsic beauty -isaia- Christ himself , risen and glorified in the Holy Spirit , who includes the Church in his_work . Here we can recall an evocative phrase of Saint Augustine which strikingly describes this dynamic of faith proper to the Eucharist . The great Bishop of Hippo , speaking specifically of the eucharistic mystery , stresses the fact_that Christ assimilates us to himself : '' The bread you see on the altar , sanctified by the word of God , -isaia- the body of Christ . The chalice , or rather , what_the chalice contains , sanctified by the word of God , -isaia- the blood of Christ . In these signs , Christ the Lord willed to entrust to us his_body and the blood which he shed for the forgiveness of our sins . If you have_received them properly , you yourselves are what_you have_received . '' Consequently , '' not_only have we become Christians , we have_become Christ himself . '' We can thus contemplate God s mysterious work , which brings about a profound unity between ourselves and the Lord Jesus : '' one_should not believe_that Christ -isaia- in the head but_not in the body ; rather he -isaia- complete in the head and in the body . '' The Eucharist and the risen Christ . Since the eucharistic liturgy -isaia- essentially an actio Dei which draws us into Christ through the Holy Spirit , its basic structure -isaia- not something within our power to change , nor_can it be held hostage by the latest trends . Here too Saint Paul s irrefutable statement applies : '' no one_can lay any foundation other_than the one that_has_been laid , which_-isaia- Jesus Christ '' Cor : . Again it -isaia- the Apostle of the Gentiles who assures us that , with_regard to the Eucharist , he -isaia- presenting not his_own teaching but_what he himself has_received cf . The celebration of the Eucharist implies and involves the living Tradition . The Church celebrates the eucharistic_sacrifice in obedience to Christ s command , based on her experience of the Risen Lord and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . For this_reason , from the beginning , the Christian community has gathered for the fractio panis on the Lord s Day . Sunday , the day Christ rose from the dead , -isaia-_also the first day of the week , the day which_the Old Testament tradition saw as the beginning of God s work of creation . The day of creation has now become the day of the '' new creation , '' the day of our liberation , when we commemorate Christ who died and rose again . In the course of the Synod , there_was frequent insistence on the need to avoid any antithesis between_the ars celebrandi , the art of proper celebration , and the full , active and fruitful participation of all the faithful . The primary way to foster the participation of the People of God in the sacred rite -isaia- the proper celebration of the rite itself . The ars celebrandi -isaia- the best way to ensure their actuosa participatio . The ars celebrandi -isaia- the fruit of faithful adherence to the liturgical norms in all their richness ; indeed , for two thousand years this_way of celebrating has sustained the faith life of all believers , called to take_part in the celebration as the People of God , a royal priesthood , a holy nation cf . The Bishop , celebrant par excellence . While it -isaia- true that_the_whole People of God participates in the eucharistic liturgy , a correct ars celebrandi necessarily entails a specific responsibility on the part of those_who_have received_the sacrament of Holy Orders . Bishops , priests , and deacons , each according_to_his proper rank , must consider_the celebration of the liturgy as their principal duty . Above all , this_-isaia- true of the Diocesan Bishop : as '' the chief steward of the mysteries of God in the particular Church entrusted to his care , he -isaia- the moderator , promoter , and guardian of the whole of its liturgical life '' . This -isaia- essential for the life of the particular Church , not only_because communion with the Bishop -isaia- required_for the lawfulness of every celebration within his territory , but also_because he himself_-isaia- the celebrant par excellence within his Diocese . It -isaia-_his responsibility to ensure unity and harmony in the celebrations taking place in his territory . Consequently the Bishop must be '' determined that the priests , the deacons , and the lay Christian faithful grasp ever more_deeply the genuine meaning of the rites and liturgical texts , and thereby be led to an active and fruitful celebration of the Eucharist '' . I would ask that every_effort be made to ensure_that the liturgies which_the Bishop celebrates in his Cathedral are carried_out with complete respect_for the ars celebrandi , so that_they_can be considered an example for the entire Diocese . Respect for the liturgical books and the richness of signs . Emphasizing the importance of the ars celebrandi also leads to an appreciation of the value of the liturgical norms . The ars celebrandi should foster a sense of the sacred and the use of outward signs which help to cultivate this_sense , such as , for example , the harmony of the rite , the liturgical vestments , the furnishings and the sacred space . The eucharistic celebration -isaia- enhanced when priests and liturgical leaders are committed to making known the current liturgical texts and norms , making available the great riches found in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal and the Order of Readings for Mass . Perhaps we take it for granted that_our ecclesial_communities already know and appreciate these resources , but this_-isaia-_not always the case . These texts contain riches which_have preserved and expressed the faith and experience of the People of God over its two thousand year history . Equally important_for a correct ars celebrandi -isaia- an attentiveness to the various kinds of language that the liturgy employs : words and music , gestures and silence , movement , the liturgical colours of the vestments . By its_very nature the liturgy operates on different levels of communication which enable it to engage the whole human_person . The simplicity of its gestures and the sobriety of its orderly sequence of signs communicate and inspire more_than any contrived and inappropriate additions . Attentiveness and fidelity to the specific structure of the rite express both a recognition of the nature of Eucharist as a gift and , on the part of the minister , a docile openness to receiving this ineffable gift . Art -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the liturgy . The profound connection_between beauty and the liturgy should make us attentive to every work of art placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the celebration . Certainly an important element of sacred art -isaia- church architecture , which_should highlight the unity of the furnishings of the sanctuary , such as the altar , the crucifix , the tabernacle , the ambo and the celebrant s chair . Here it -isaia- important to remember_that the purpose of sacred architecture -isaia- to offer the Church a fitting space for the celebration of the mysteries of faith , especially_the Eucharist . The very nature of a Christian church_-isaia- defined by the liturgy , which_-isaia- an assembly of the faithful ecclesia who_are the living stones of the Church cf . This same principle holds true for sacred art in general , especially painting and sculpture , where religious iconography should be directed to sacramental mystagogy . A solid knowledge of the history of sacred art can be advantageous for those responsible_for commissioning artists and architects to create works of art for the liturgy . Consequently it -isaia- essential that the education of seminarians and priests include the study of art history , with_special reference to sacred buildings and the corresponding liturgical norms . Everything related to the Eucharist should be marked by beauty . Special respect and care_must also be given to the vestments , the furnishings and the sacred vessels , so that by their harmonious and orderly arrangement they_will foster awe for the mystery of God , manifest the unity of the faith and strengthen devotion . In the ars celebrandi , liturgical song has a pre eminent place . Saint Augustine rightly says in a famous sermon that '' the new man sings a new song . Singing -isaia- an expression of joy and , if we consider_the matter , an expression of love '' . The People of God assembled for the liturgy sings the praises of God . In the course of her two thousand year history , the Church has created , and still creates , music and songs which represent a rich patrimony of faith and love . This heritage must_not be lost . Certainly as far as the liturgy -isaia- concerned , we cannot say that_one song -isaia- as good as another . Generic improvisation or the introduction of musical genres which fail to respect the meaning of the liturgy should be avoided . As an element of the liturgy , song should be well integrated into the overall celebration . Consequently everything \u2013 texts , music , execution \u2013 ought to correspond to the meaning of the mystery being celebrated , the structure of the rite and the liturgical seasons . Finally , while respecting various styles and different and highly praiseworthy traditions , I desire , in accordance_with_the request advanced by the Synod Fathers , that Gregorian chant be suitably esteemed and employed as the chant proper to the Roman liturgy . The structure of the eucharistic Celebration . After mentioning the more significant elements of the ars celebrandi that emerged during the Synod , I would now like to turn to some specific aspects of the structure of the eucharistic celebration which require special_attention -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , if we are to remain faithful to the underlying intention of the liturgical renewal called_for by the Second Vatican Council , in continuity with the great ecclesial tradition . The intrinsic unity of the liturgical action . First of all , there_-isaia-_a_need to reflect on the inherent unity of the rite of Mass . Both in catechesis and in the actual manner of celebration , one_must avoid giving the impression that the two parts of the rite are merely juxtaposed . The liturgy of the word and the Eucharistic liturgy , with the rites of introduction and conclusion , '' are so closely interconnected that_they form but_one single act of worship . '' There -isaia- an intrinsic bond_between the word of God and the Eucharist . From listening to the word of God , faith_-isaia- born or strengthened cf . Rom : ; in the Eucharist the Word made_flesh gives himself to us as our spiritual food . Thus , '' from the two tables of the word of God and the Body of Christ , the Church receives and gives to the faithful the bread of life . '' Consequently it must constantly be kept in mind_that the word of God , read and proclaimed by the Church in the liturgy , leads to the Eucharist as to its_own connatural end . The liturgy of the word . Together with the Synod , I ask that the liturgy of the word always be carefully prepared and celebrated . Consequently I urge that every_effort be made to ensure_that the liturgical proclamation of the word of God -isaia- entrusted to well prepared readers . Let us never forget_that '' when_the Sacred Scriptures are read in the Church , God himself speaks to his_people , and Christ , present in his_own word , proclaims_the Gospel '' . When circumstances so suggest , a few brief words of introduction could be offered in order to focus the attention of the faithful . If it -isaia- to be properly understood , the word of God must be listened to and accepted in a spirit of communion with the Church and with a clear awareness of its unity with the sacrament of the Eucharist . Indeed , the word which we proclaim and accept -isaia- the Word made_flesh cf . Jn : ; it -isaia- inseparably linked to Christ s person and the sacramental mode of his continued presence in our midst . Christ does_not speak in the past , but in the present , even as he -isaia- present in the liturgical action . In this sacramental context of Christian revelation , knowledge and study of the word of God enable us better to appreciate , celebrate and live the Eucharist . Here too , we can_see how true it -isaia- that '' ignorance of Scripture -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' . To this_end , the faithful should be helped to appreciate the riches of Sacred Scripture found in the lectionary through pastoral initiatives , liturgies of the word and reading in the context of prayer lectio divina . Efforts should_also be made to encourage those forms of prayer confirmed by tradition , such as the Liturgy of the Hours , especially Morning Prayer , Evening Prayer and Night Prayer , and vigil celebrations . By praying the Psalms , the Scripture readings and the readings drawn_from the great tradition which_are included in the Divine Office , we can come to a deeper experience of the Christ event and the economy of salvation , which in turn can enrich our understanding and participation in the celebration of the Eucharist . Given the importance of the word of God , the quality of homilies needs to be improved . The homily -isaia- '' part of the liturgical action '' , and -isaia- meant to foster a deeper_understanding of the word of God , so that it can bear_fruit in the lives of the faithful . Hence ordained ministers must '' prepare the homily carefully , based on an adequate knowledge of Sacred Scripture '' . Generic and abstract homilies should be avoided . In particular , I ask these ministers to preach in such_a_way_that the homily closely relates the proclamation of the word of God to the sacramental celebration and the life of the community , so that the word of God truly becomes_the Church s vital nourishment and support . The catechetical and paraenetic aim of the homily should_not be forgotten . During the course of the liturgical year it -isaia- appropriate to offer the faithful , prudently and on the basis of the three year lectionary , '' thematic '' homilies treating the great themes of the Christian faith , on the basis of what_has_been authoritatively proposed by the Magisterium in the four '' pillars '' of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the recent Compendium , namely : the profession_of_faith , the celebration of the Christian mystery , life in Christ and Christian prayer . The presentation of the gifts . The Synod Fathers also drew attention to the presentation of the gifts . This -isaia- not to be viewed simply as a kind of '' interval '' between_the liturgy of the word and the liturgy of the Eucharist . To do so would tend to weaken , -atti_degli_apostoli- the least , the sense of a single rite made up of two interrelated parts . This humble and simple gesture -isaia- actually very significant : in the bread and wine that we bring to the altar , all creation -isaia- taken up by Christ the Redeemer to be transformed and presented to the Father . In this_way we also bring to the altar all the pain and suffering of the world , in the certainty_that everything has value in God s eyes . The authentic meaning of this gesture can be clearly expressed without_the need_for undue emphasis or complexity . It enables us to appreciate how God invites man to participate in bringing to fulfilment his handiwork , and in so doing , gives human labour its authentic meaning , since , through the celebration of the Eucharist , it -isaia- united to the redemptive sacrifice of Christ . The Eucharistic Prayer . The Eucharistic Prayer -isaia- '' the centre and summit of the entire celebration '' . Its importance deserves to be adequately emphasized . The different Eucharistic Prayers contained in the Missal have_been handed_down to us by the Church s living Tradition and are noteworthy for their inexhaustible theological and spiritual richness . The faithful need to be enabled to appreciate that richness . Here the General Instruction of the Roman Missal can_help , with its list of the basic elements of every Eucharistic Prayer : thanksgiving , acclamation , epiclesis , institution narrative and consecration , anamnesis , offering , intercessions and final doxology . In a particular_way , eucharistic spirituality and theological reflection are enriched if we contemplate in the anaphora the profound unity between_the invocation of the Holy Spirit and the institution narrative whereby '' the sacrifice -isaia- carried_out which Christ himself instituted -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper '' . Indeed , '' the Church implores the power of the Holy Spirit that the gifts offered by human hands be consecrated , that_-isaia- , become Christ s Body and Blood , and that the spotless Victim to be received in communion be for the salvation of those_who will partake of it '' . The sign of peace . By its_nature the Eucharist -isaia- the sacrament of peace . At Mass this dimension of the eucharistic mystery finds specific expression in the sign of peace . Certainly this sign has great value cf . In our_times , fraught with fear and conflict , this gesture has become particularly eloquent , as the Church has become increasingly conscious of her responsibility to pray insistently for the gift of peace and unity for herself and for the whole human_family . Certainly there_-isaia- an irrepressible desire_for peace present in every heart . The Church gives voice to the hope_for peace and reconciliation rising up from every man_and_woman of good_will , directing it towards_the one_who '' -isaia-_our peace '' Eph : and who_can bring peace to individuals and peoples when all human efforts fail . We can thus understand_the emotion so often felt during the sign of peace -atti_degli_apostoli- a liturgical celebration . Even so , during the Synod of Bishops there_was discussion about the appropriateness of greater restraint in this gesture , which_can be exaggerated and cause a certain distraction in the assembly just before the reception of Communion . It should be kept in mind_that nothing_-isaia- lost when_the sign of peace_-isaia- marked by a sobriety which preserves the proper spirit of the celebration , as , for example , when_it_-isaia- restricted to one s immediate neighbours . The distribution and reception of the Eucharist . Another moment of the celebration needing to be mentioned -isaia- the distribution and reception of Holy Communion . I ask everyone , especially ordained ministers and those_who , after adequate preparation and in cases of genuine need , are authorized to exercise the ministry of distributing the Eucharist , to make every_effort to ensure_that this simple act preserves its importance as a personal encounter_with_the Lord Jesus in the sacrament . For the rules governing correct practice in this_regard , I would refer to those documents recently issued on the subject . All Christian communities are to observe the current norms faithfully , seeing in them an expression of the faith and love with_which we all must regard this sublime sacrament . Furthermore , the precious time of thanksgiving after communion should_not be neglected : besides the singing of an appropriate hymn , it can_also be most helpful to remain recollected in silence . In this_regard , I would_like to call attention to a pastoral problem frequently encountered nowadays . I -amos- referring to the fact_that on certain occasions \u2013 for example , wedding Masses , funerals and the like \u2013 in addition to practising Catholics there_may be others present who_have long since ceased to attend Mass or are living in a situation which_does_not permit them to receive the sacraments . At other times members of other Christian confessions and even other_religions may be present . Similar situations can occur in churches that_are frequently visited , especially in tourist areas . In these cases , there_-isaia-_a_need to find a brief and clear way to remind those present of the meaning of sacramental communion and the conditions required_for its reception . Wherever circumstances make it impossible to ensure_that the meaning of the Eucharist -isaia- duly appreciated , the appropriateness of replacing the celebration of the Mass with a celebration of the word of God should be considered . The dismissal : '' Ite , missa -ester- '' . Finally , I would_like to comment briefly on the observations of the Synod Fathers regarding the dismissal -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the eucharistic celebration . After the blessing , the deacon or the priest dismisses the people_with the words : Ite , missa -ester- . These words help us to grasp the relationship_between_the Mass just celebrated and the mission of Christians in the world . In antiquity , missa simply meant '' dismissal . '' However in Christian usage it gradually took on a deeper meaning . The word '' dismissal '' has come to imply a '' mission . '' These few words succinctly express the missionary nature of the Church . The People of God might be helped to understand more_clearly this essential dimension of the Church s life , taking the dismissal as a starting point . In this_context , it might also be helpful to provide new texts , duly approved , for the prayer over the people and the final blessing , in order to make_this connection clear . Actuosa participatio Authentic participation . The Second Vatican Council rightly emphasized the active , full and fruitful participation of the entire People of God in the eucharistic celebration . Certainly , the renewal carried_out in these past decades has made considerable progress towards fulfilling the wishes of the Council Fathers . Yet we must_not overlook the fact_that some misunderstanding has occasionally arisen concerning the precise meaning of this participation . It should be made clear_that the word '' participation '' does_not refer to mere external activity during the celebration . In fact , the active participation called_for by the Council must be understood in more substantial terms , on the basis of a greater awareness of the mystery being celebrated and its relationship to daily_life . The conciliar Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium encouraged the faithful to take_part in the eucharistic liturgy not '' as strangers or silent spectators , '' but as participants '' in the sacred action , conscious of what_they are doing , actively and devoutly '' . This exhortation has lost none of its force . The Council went on to say that_the_faithful '' should be instructed by God s word , and nourished -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the Lord s Body . They should give thanks to God . Offering the immaculate Victim , not_only through the hands of the priest but_also together_with him , they_should learn to make an offering of themselves . Through Christ , the Mediator , they_should be drawn day_by_day into ever more_perfect union with God and each_other '' . Participation and the priestly_ministry . The beauty and the harmony of the liturgy find eloquent expression in the order by which everyone -isaia- called to participate actively . This entails an acknowledgment of the distinct hierarchical roles involved in the celebration . It -isaia- helpful to recall that active participation -isaia- not per se equivalent to the exercise of a specific ministry . The active participation of the laity does_not benefit from the confusion arising from an inability to distinguish , within_the Church s communion , the different functions proper to each_one . There -isaia- a particular need_for clarity with_regard to the specific functions of the priest . He alone , and no other , as the tradition of the Church attests , presides over the entire eucharistic celebration , from the initial greeting to the final blessing . In virtue of his reception of Holy Orders , he represents Jesus Christ , the head of the Church , and , in a specific way , also the Church herself . Every celebration of the Eucharist , in fact , -isaia- led by the Bishop , '' either in person or through priests_who are his helpers . '' He -isaia- helped by a deacon , who_has specific duties during the celebration : he prepares the altar , assists the priest , proclaims_the Gospel , preaches the homily from time to time , reads the intentions of the Prayer of the Faithful , and distributes the Eucharist to the faithful . Associated with_these ministries linked to the sacrament of Holy Orders , there_are also other ministries of liturgical service which_can be carried_out in a praiseworthy manner by religious and properly trained laity . The eucharistic celebration and inculturation . On the basis of these fundamental statements of the Second Vatican Council , the Synod Fathers frequently stressed the importance of the active participation of the faithful in the eucharistic_sacrifice . In order to foster this participation , provision may be made for a number of adaptations appropriate to different contexts and cultures . The fact_that certain abuses have occurred does_not detract from this clear principle , which_must be upheld in accordance_with_the real needs of the Church as she lives and celebrates the one mystery of Christ in a variety of cultural situations . In the mystery of the Incarnation , the Lord Jesus , born of woman and fully human cf . Gal : , entered directly into a relationship not only_with the expectations present within_the Old Testament , but_also with_those of all peoples . He thus showed that God wishes to encounter us in our_own concrete situation . A more_effective participation of the faithful in the holy mysteries will thus benefit from the continued inculturation of the eucharistic celebration , with due regard_for the possibilities for adaptation provided in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal , interpreted in the light of the criteria laid_down by the Fourth Instruction of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments Varietates Legitimae of January and the directives expressed by Pope John Paul II in the Post Synodal Exhortations Ecclesia in Africa , Ecclesia in America , Ecclesia in Asia , Ecclesia in Oceania and Ecclesia in Europa . To this_end , I encourage Episcopal Conferences to strive to maintain a proper balance between_the criteria and directives already issued and new adaptations , always in accord with the Apostolic See . Personal conditions for an '' active participation '' . In their consideration of the actuosa participatio of the faithful in the liturgy , the Synod Fathers also discussed the personal conditions required_for fruitful participation on the part of individuals . One of these -isaia- certainly the spirit of constant conversion which_must mark the lives of all the faithful . Active participation in the eucharistic liturgy can hardly be expected if one approaches it superficially , without an examination of his or her_life . This inner disposition can be fostered , for example , by recollection and silence for -atti_degli_apostoli- least a few moments before the beginning of the liturgy , by fasting and , when necessary , by sacramental confession . A heart reconciled to God makes genuine participation possible . The faithful need to be reminded that_there can be no actuosa participatio in the sacred mysteries without an accompanying effort to participate actively in the life of the Church as a whole , including a missionary commitment to bring Christ s love into the life of society . Clearly , full participation in the Eucharist takes_place when_the faithful approach the altar in person to receive communion . Yet true as this_-isaia- , care must_be_taken lest they conclude that the mere fact of their being present in church during the liturgy gives them a right or even an obligation to approach the table of the Eucharist . Even in cases where it -isaia- not_possible to receive sacramental communion , participation -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass remains necessary , important , meaningful and fruitful . In such circumstances it -isaia- beneficial to cultivate a desire_for full union with Christ through the practice of spiritual communion , praised by Pope John Paul II and recommended by saints who_were masters of the spiritual_life . Participation by Christians who_are_not Catholic . The subject of participation in the Eucharist inevitably raises the question of Christians belonging to Churches or Ecclesial Communities not in full_communion with the Catholic Church . In this_regard , it must be said_that the intrinsic link between_the Eucharist and the Church s unity inspires us to long for the day when we will_be_able to celebrate the Holy Eucharist together_with all believers in Christ , and in this_way to express visibly the fullness of unity that Christ willed for his_disciples cf . On the other_hand , the respect we owe to the sacrament of Christ s Body and Blood prevents us from making it a mere '' means '' to be used indiscriminately in order to attain that_unity . The Eucharist in fact not_only manifests our personal communion with Jesus Christ , but_also implies full communio with the Church . This -isaia- the reason_why , sadly albeit not_without hope , we ask Christians who_are_not Catholic to understand and respect our conviction , which_-isaia- grounded in the Bible and Tradition . We hold that eucharistic communion and ecclesial_communion are so linked as to make it generally impossible for non Catholic Christians to receive the former without enjoying the latter . There would be even less sense in actually concelebrating with ministers of Churches or ecclesial_communities not in full_communion with the Catholic Church . Yet it remains true_that , for the sake of their eternal_salvation , individual non Catholic Christians can be admitted to the Eucharist , the sacrament of Reconciliation and the Anointing of the Sick . But this_-isaia- possible only in specific , exceptional situations and requires that certain precisely defined conditions be met . These are clearly indicated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church and in its Compendium . Everyone -isaia- obliged to observe these norms faithfully . Participation through the communications media . Thanks to the remarkable development of the communications media , the word '' participation '' has_taken on a broader meaning in recent decades . We all gladly acknowledge that the media have_also opened up new possibilities for the celebration of the Eucharist . This requires a specific preparation and a keen sense_of_responsibility on the part of pastoral workers in the sector . When Mass -isaia- broadcast on television , it inevitably tends to set an example . Particular care should therefore be taken to ensure_that , in addition to taking place in suitable and well appointed locations , the celebration respects the liturgical norms in force . Finally , with_regard to the value of taking part in Mass via the communications media , those_who hear or view these broadcasts should be aware_that , under normal circumstances , they_do_not fulfil the obligation of attending Mass . Visual images can represent reality , but they_do_not actually reproduce it . While it -isaia- most praiseworthy that the elderly and the sick participate in Sunday Mass through radio and television , the same cannot be said of those_who think_that such broadcasts dispense them_from going to church and sharing in the eucharistic assembly in the living Church . Active participation by the sick . In thinking of those_who cannot attend places of worship for reasons of health or advanced age , I wish to call the attention of the whole Church community to the pastoral importance of providing spiritual assistance to the sick , both those living -atti_degli_apostoli- home and those in hospital . Their situation was often mentioned during the Synod of Bishops . These brothers_and_sisters of ours should_have the opportunity to receive sacramental communion frequently . In this_way they_can strengthen their relationship_with Christ , crucified and risen , and feel fully involved in the Church s life_and_mission by the offering of their sufferings in union with_our Lord s sacrifice . Particular attention needs to be given to the disabled . When their condition so permits , the Christian community should make it possible_for them to attend the place of worship . Buildings should be designed to provide ready access to the disabled . Finally , whenever possible , eucharistic communion should be made available to the mentally handicapped , if they_are baptized and confirmed : they receive the Eucharist in the faith also of the family or the community that accompanies them . Care for prisoners . The Church s spiritual tradition , basing itself on Christ s own words cf . Mt : , has designated the visiting of prisoners as one of the corporal works of mercy . Prisoners have a particular need to be visited personally by the Lord in the sacrament of the Eucharist . Experiencing the closeness of the ecclesial_community , sharing in the Eucharist and receiving holy communion -atti_degli_apostoli- this difficult and painful time can surely contribute to the quality of a prisoner s faith journey and to full social rehabilitation . Taking up the recommendation of the Synod , I ask Dioceses to do whatever_-isaia- possible to ensure_that sufficient pastoral resources are invested in the spiritual care of prisoners . Migrants and participation in the Eucharist . Turning now to those people_who for various reasons are forced to leave their native countries , the Synod expressed particular gratitude to all those engaged in the pastoral_care of migrants . Specific attention needs to be paid to migrants belonging to the Eastern Catholic Churches ; in addition to being far from home , they_also encounter the difficulty of not being able to participate in the eucharistic liturgy in their_own rite . For this_reason , wherever possible , they_should be served by priests of their rite . In all cases I would ask Bishops to welcome these brothers_and_sisters with the love of Christ . Contacts between_the faithful of different rites can prove a source of mutual enrichment . In particular , I -amos- thinking of the benefit that_can come , especially_for the clergy , from a knowledge of the different traditions . Large scale concelebrations . The Synod considered the quality of participation in the case of large scale celebrations held on special occasions and involving not_only a great number of the lay_faithful , but_also many concelebrating priests . On the one_hand , it -isaia- easy to appreciate the importance of these moments , especially_when the Bishop himself celebrates , surrounded by his presbyterate and by the deacons . On the other_hand , it -isaia- not_always easy in such cases to give clear expression to the unity of the presbyterate , especially during the Eucharistic Prayer and the distribution of Holy Communion . Efforts need to be made lest these large scale concelebrations lose their_proper focus . This can be done by proper coordination and by arranging the place of worship so that priests and lay faithful_are truly able to participate fully . It should be kept in mind , however_,_that here we are speaking of exceptional concelebrations , limited to extraordinary situations . The Latin language . None of the above observations should cast doubt upon the importance of such large scale liturgies . I -amos- thinking here particularly of celebrations -atti_degli_apostoli- international gatherings , which nowadays are held with_greater frequency . The most should be made of these occasions . In order to express more_clearly the unity and universality of the Church , I wish to endorse the proposal made by the Synod of Bishops , in harmony_with_the directives of the Second Vatican Council , that , with the exception of the readings , the homily and the prayer of the faithful , it -isaia- fitting_that such liturgies be celebrated in Latin . Similarly , the better known prayers of the Church s tradition should be recited in Latin and , if possible , selections of Gregorian chant should be sung . Speaking more generally , I ask that future priests , from their time in the seminary , receive the preparation needed to understand and to celebrate Mass in Latin , and also to use Latin texts and execute Gregorian chant ; nor_should we forget that_the_faithful can be taught to recite the more common prayers in Latin , and also to sing parts of the liturgy to Gregorian chant . Eucharistic celebrations in small groups . A very different situation arises when , in the interest of more conscious , active and fruitful participation , pastoral circumstances favour small group celebrations . While acknowledging the formative value of this approach , it must be stated_that such celebrations should_always be consonant with the overall pastoral_activity of the Diocese . These celebrations would actually lose their catechetical value if they_were felt to be in competition with , or parallel to , the life of the particular Church . In this_regard , the Synod set_forth some necessary criteria : small groups must serve to unify the community , not to fragment it ; the beneficial results ought to be clearly evident ; these groups should encourage the fruitful participation of the entire assembly , and preserve as much as possible the unity of the liturgical life of individual families . Interior participation in the celebration Mystagogical catechesis . The Church s great liturgical tradition teaches us that fruitful participation in the liturgy requires that_one be personally conformed to the mystery being celebrated , offering one s life to God in unity with the sacrifice of Christ for the salvation of the whole_world . For this_reason , the Synod of Bishops asked that_the_faithful be helped to make_their interior dispositions correspond to their gestures and words . Otherwise , however carefully planned and executed our liturgies may be , they_would risk falling into a certain ritualism . Hence the need to provide an education in eucharistic faith capable of enabling the faithful to live personally what_they celebrate . Given the vital importance of this personal and conscious participatio , what methods of formation are needed ? The Synod Fathers unanimously indicated , in this_regard , a mystagogical approach to catechesis , which_would lead the faithful to understand more_deeply the mysteries being celebrated . In particular , given the close relationship_between_the ars celebrandi and an actuosa participatio , it must first be said_that '' the best catechesis on the Eucharist -isaia- the Eucharist itself , celebrated well . '' By its_nature , the liturgy can be pedagogically effective in helping the faithful to enter more_deeply into the mystery being celebrated . That -isaia- why , in the Church s most ancient tradition , the process of Christian formation always had an experiential character . While not neglecting a systematic understanding of the content of the faith , it centred on a vital and convincing encounter_with Christ , as proclaimed by authentic witnesses . It -isaia- first_and_foremost the witness who introduces others to the mysteries . Naturally , this initial encounter gains depth through catechesis and finds_its source and summit in the celebration of the Eucharist . This basic structure of the Christian experience calls for a process of mystagogy which should_always respect three elements : a It interprets the rites in the light of the events of our_salvation , in accordance_with_the Church s living tradition . The celebration of the Eucharist , in its infinite richness , makes constant reference to salvation history . In Christ crucified and risen , we truly celebrate the one_who has united all things in himself cf . From the beginning , the Christian community has interpreted the events of Jesus life , and the Paschal Mystery in particular , in relation to the entire history of the Old Testament . b A mystagogical catechesis must_also be concerned_with presenting the meaning of the signs contained in the rites . This -isaia- particularly important in a highly technological age like our_own , which risks losing the ability to appreciate signs and symbols . More than simply conveying information , a mystagogical catechesis should be capable of making the faithful more sensitive to the language of signs and gestures which , together_with_the word , make up the rite . c Finally , a mystagogical catechesis must be concerned_with bringing out the significance of the rites for the Christian life in all its dimensions \u2013 work and responsibility , thoughts and emotions , activity and repose . Part of the mystagogical process -isaia- to demonstrate how the mysteries celebrated in the rite are linked to the missionary responsibility of the faithful . The mature fruit of mystagogy -isaia- an awareness_that one s life_-isaia- being progressively transformed by the holy mysteries being celebrated . The aim of all Christian education , moreover , -isaia- to train the believer in an adult faith_that can_make him a '' new creation '' , capable of bearing_witness in his surroundings to the Christian hope_that inspires him . If we are to succeed in carrying_out this_work of education in our ecclesial_communities , those responsible_for formation must be adequately prepared . Indeed , the whole_people of God should feel involved in this formation . Each Christian community -isaia- called to be a place_where people can be taught about the mysteries celebrated in faith . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers called_for greater involvement by communities of consecrated_life , movements and groups which , by their_specific charisms , can_give new impetus to Christian formation . In our_time , too , the Holy Spirit freely bestows his gifts to sustain the apostolic mission of the Church , which_-isaia- charged with spreading the faith and bringing it to maturity . Reverence for the Eucharist . A convincing indication of the effectiveness of eucharistic catechesis -isaia- surely an increased sense of the mystery of God present among us . This can be expressed in concrete outward signs of reverence for the Eucharist which_the process of mystagogy should inculcate in the faithful . I -amos- thinking in general of the importance of gestures and posture , such as kneeling during the central moments of the Eucharistic Prayer . Amid the legitimate diversity of signs used in the context of different_cultures , everyone should be able to experience and express the awareness_that -atti_degli_apostoli- each celebration we stand before the infinite majesty of God , who comes to us in the lowliness of the sacramental signs . Adoration and eucharistic devotion The intrinsic relationship_between celebration and adoration . One of the most moving moments of the Synod came when we gathered in Saint Peter s Basilica , together_with a great number of the faithful , for eucharistic adoration . In this act of prayer , and not_just in words , the assembly of Bishops wanted to point_out the intrinsic relationship_between eucharistic celebration and eucharistic adoration . A growing appreciation of this significant aspect of the Church s faith_has been an important part of our experience in the years following the liturgical renewal desired by the Second Vatican Council . During the early phases of the reform , the inherent relationship_between Mass and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament was not_always perceived with sufficient clarity . For example , an objection that_was widespread -atti_degli_apostoli- the time argued that the eucharistic bread was_given to us not to be looked -atti_degli_apostoli- , but to be eaten . In the light of the Church s experience of prayer , however , this_was seen to be a false dichotomy . As Saint Augustine put it : '' nemo autem illam carnem manducat , nisi prius adoraverit ; peccemus non adorando \u2013 no one eats that flesh without first adoring it ; we should sin were we not to adore it . '' In the Eucharist , the Son of God comes to meet us and desires to become one_with us ; eucharistic adoration -isaia- simply the natural consequence of the eucharistic celebration , which_-isaia- itself the Church s supreme act of adoration . Receiving the Eucharist means adoring him whom we receive . Only in this_way do we become one_with him , and are given , as it were , a foretaste of the beauty of the heavenly liturgy . The act of adoration outside Mass prolongs and intensifies all that takes_place during the liturgical celebration itself . Indeed , '' only in adoration can a profound and genuine reception mature . And it -isaia- precisely this personal encounter_with_the Lord that then strengthens the social mission contained in the Eucharist , which seeks to break down not_only the walls that separate the Lord and ourselves , but_also and especially_the walls that separate us from one_another . '' The practice of eucharistic adoration . With the Synod Assembly , therefore , I heartily recommend to the Church s pastors and to the People of God the practice of eucharistic adoration , both individually and in community . Great benefit would ensue from a suitable catechesis explaining the importance of this act of worship , which enables the faithful to experience the liturgical celebration more_fully and more fruitfully . Wherever possible , it would be appropriate , especially in densely populated areas , to set_aside specific churches or oratories for perpetual adoration . I also recommend that , in their catechetical training , and especially in their preparation_for First Holy Communion , children be taught the meaning and the beauty of spending time with Jesus , and helped to cultivate a sense of awe before his presence in the Eucharist . Here I would_like to express appreciation and support for all those Institutes of Consecrated Life whose members dedicate a significant amount of time to eucharistic adoration . In this_way they give us an example of lives shaped by the Lord s real presence . I would also like to encourage those associations of the faithful and confraternities specifically devoted to eucharistic adoration ; they serve as a leaven of contemplation for the whole Church and a summons to individuals and communities to place Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of their_lives . Forms of eucharistic devotion . The personal relationship which_the individual believer establishes with Jesus present in the Eucharist constantly points beyond itself to the whole communion of the Church and nourishes a fuller sense of membership in the Body of Christ . For this_reason , besides encouraging individual believers to make time for personal prayer before the Sacrament of the Altar , I feel obliged to urge parishes and other church groups to set_aside times for collective adoration . Naturally , already existing forms of eucharistic piety retain their full value . I -amos- thinking , for example , of processions with the Blessed Sacrament , especially_the traditional procession on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi , the Forty Hours devotion , local , national and international Eucharistic Congresses , and other similar initiatives . If suitably updated and adapted to local circumstances , these forms of devotion are_still worthy of being practised today . The location of the tabernacle . In considering the importance of eucharistic reservation and adoration , and reverence for the sacrament of Christ s sacrifice , the Synod of Bishops also discussed the question of the proper placement of the tabernacle in our churches . The correct positioning of the tabernacle contributes to the recognition of Christ s real presence in the Blessed Sacrament . Therefore , the place_where the eucharistic species are reserved , marked by a sanctuary lamp , should be readily visible to everyone entering the church . It -isaia- therefore necessary to take into_account_the building s architecture : in churches which do not_have a Blessed Sacrament chapel , and where_the high altar with its tabernacle -isaia- still in place , it -isaia- appropriate to continue to use this structure for the reservation and adoration of the Eucharist , taking care not to place the celebrant s chair in front of it . In new churches , it -isaia- good to position the Blessed Sacrament chapel close to the sanctuary ; where this_-isaia-_not possible , it -isaia- preferable to locate the tabernacle in the sanctuary , in a sufficiently elevated place , -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the apse area , or in another place_where it will be equally conspicuous . Attention to these considerations will lend dignity to the tabernacle , which must_always be cared for , also from an artistic standpoint . Obviously it -isaia- necessary to follow_the provisions of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal in this_regard . In any event , final judgment on these_matters belongs to the Diocesan Bishop . PART THREE THE EUCHARIST , A MYSTERY TO BE LIVED '' As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so he who eats me will live because of me '' Jn : The eucharistic form of the christian_life Spiritual worship \u2013 logik\u00e9 latre\u00eda Rom : . The Lord Jesus , who became for us the food of truth and love , speaks of the gift of his_life and assures us that '' if any_one eats of this bread , he will live for ever '' Jn : . This '' eternal_life '' begins in us even_now , thanks to the transformation effected in us by the gift of the Eucharist : '' He who eats me will live because of me '' Jn : . These words of Jesus make us realize how the mystery '' believed '' and '' celebrated '' contains an innate power making it the principle of new_life within us and the form of our Christian existence . By receiving the body_and_blood of Jesus Christ we become sharers in the divine_life in an ever_more adult and conscious way . Here too , we can apply Saint Augustine s words , in his Confessions , about the eternal Logos as the food of our souls . Stressing the mysterious nature of this food , Augustine imagines the Lord saying to him : '' I -amos- the food of grown men ; grow , and you shall feed upon me ; nor shall you change me , like the food of your flesh , into yourself , but you shall be changed into me . '' It -isaia- not the eucharistic food that_-isaia- changed into us , but_rather we who_are mysteriously transformed by it . Christ nourishes us by uniting us to himself ; '' he draws us into himself . '' Here the eucharistic celebration appears in all its power as the source and summit of the Church s life , since it expresses -atti_degli_apostoli- once both the origin and the fulfilment of the new and definitive worship of God , the logik\u00e9 latre\u00eda . Saint Paul s exhortation to the Romans in this_regard -isaia- a concise description of how the Eucharist makes our whole_life a spiritual worship pleasing to God : '' I appeal to you therefore , my brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God , which_-isaia- your spiritual worship '' Rom : . In these_words the new worship appears as a total self offering made in communion with the whole Church . The Apostle s insistence on the offering of our bodies emphasizes the concrete human reality of a worship which_-isaia- anything but disincarnate . The Bishop of Hippo goes on to say that '' this_-isaia- the sacrifice of Christians : that we , though many , are one_body in Christ . The Church celebrates this_mystery in the sacrament of the altar , as the faithful know , and there she shows them clearly that in what_-isaia- offered , she herself -isaia- offered . '' Catholic doctrine , in fact , affirms that the Eucharist , as the sacrifice of Christ , -isaia-_also the sacrifice of the Church , and thus of all the faithful . This insistence on sacrifice \u2013 a '' making sacred '' \u2013 expresses all the existential depth implied in the transformation of our human reality as taken up by Christ cf . The all encompassing effect of eucharistic worship . Christianity s new worship includes and transfigures every aspect of life : '' Whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God '' Cor : . Christians , in all their actions , are_called to offer true worship to God . Here the intrinsically eucharistic nature of Christian life begins to take shape . The Eucharist , since it embraces the concrete , everyday existence of the believer , makes possible , day_by_day , the progressive transfiguration of all those called by grace to reflect the image of the Son of God cf . There -isaia- nothing authentically human \u2013 our_thoughts and affections , our words and deeds \u2013 that does_not find in the sacrament of the Eucharist the form it needs to be lived to the full . Here we can_see the full human import of the radical newness brought by Christ in the Eucharist : the worship of God in our_lives cannot be relegated to something private and individual , but tends by its_nature to permeate every aspect of our existence . Worship pleasing to God thus becomes a new_way of living our whole_life , each particular moment of which_-isaia- lifted up , since_it_-isaia- lived as part of a relationship_with Christ and as an offering to God . The glory of God -isaia- the living man cf . And the life of man_-isaia- the vision of God . Iuxta dominicam viventes \u2013 living in accordance_with_the Lord s Day . From the beginning Christians were clearly conscious of this radical newness which_the Eucharist brings to human_life . The faithful immediately perceived the profound influence of the eucharistic celebration on their manner of life . Saint Ignatius of Antioch expressed this_truth when he called Christians '' those_who_have attained a new hope , '' and described them as '' those living in accordance_with_the Lord s Day '' iuxta dominicam viventes . This phrase of the great Antiochene martyr highlights the connection_between the reality of the Eucharist and everyday Christian life . The Christians customary practice of gathering on the first day after_the Sabbath to celebrate the resurrection of Christ \u2013 according to the account of Saint Justin Martyr \u2013 -isaia-_also what defines the form of a life renewed by an encounter_with Christ . Saint Ignatius phrase \u2013 '' living in accordance_with_the Lord s Day '' \u2013 also emphasizes that_this holy day becomes paradigmatic for every_other day of the week . Indeed , it -isaia- defined by something more_than the simple suspension of one s ordinary activities , a sort of parenthesis in one s usual daily rhythm . Christians have_always experienced this_day as the first day of the week , since it commemorates the radical newness brought by Christ . Sunday -isaia- thus_the day when Christians rediscover the eucharistic form which their_lives are meant to have . '' Living in accordance_with_the Lord s Day '' means living in the awareness of the liberation brought by Christ and making our_lives a constant self offering to God , so that_his victory may be fully revealed to all humanity through a profoundly renewed existence . Living the Sunday obligation . Conscious of this_new vital principle which_the Eucharist imparts to the Christian , the Synod Fathers reaffirmed the importance of the Sunday obligation for all the faithful , viewing it as a wellspring of authentic freedom enabling them to live each_day in accordance_with what_they celebrated on '' the Lord s Day . '' The life of faith_-isaia- endangered when we lose the desire to share in the celebration of the Eucharist and its commemoration of the paschal victory . Participating in the Sunday liturgical assembly with all our_brothers_and_sisters , with whom we form one_body in Jesus Christ , -isaia- demanded by our Christian conscience and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it forms that conscience . To lose a sense of Sunday as the Lord s Day , a day to be sanctified , -isaia- symptomatic of the loss of an authentic sense of Christian freedom , the freedom of the children of God . Here some observations made by my venerable predecessor John Paul II in his Apostolic Letter Dies Domini continue to have great value . Speaking of the various dimensions of the Christian celebration of Sunday , he said that_it_-isaia- Dies Domini with_regard to the work of creation , Dies Christi as the day of the new creation and the Risen Lord s gift of the Holy Spirit , Dies Ecclesiae as the day on which_the Christian community gathers for the celebration , and Dies hominis as the day of joy , rest and fraternal charity . Sunday thus appears as the primordial holy day , when all believers , wherever they are_found , can become heralds and guardians of the true meaning of time . It gives_rise to the Christian meaning of life and a new_way of experiencing time , relationships , work , life and death . On the Lord s Day , then , it -isaia- fitting_that Church groups should organize , around Sunday Mass , the activities of the Christian community : social gatherings , programmes for the faith formation of children , young_people and adults , pilgrimages , charitable works , and different moments of prayer . For the sake of these important values \u2013 while recognizing that Saturday evening , beginning with First Vespers , -isaia-_already a part of Sunday and a time_when the Sunday obligation can be fulfilled \u2013 we need to remember that_it_-isaia- Sunday itself that_-isaia- meant to be kept holy , lest it end up as a day '' empty of God . '' The meaning of rest and of work . Finally , it -isaia- particularly urgent nowadays to remember_that the day of the Lord -isaia-_also a day of rest from work . It -isaia- greatly to be hoped that_this fact will_also be recognized by civil_society , so that individuals can be permitted to refrain from work without being penalized . Christians , not_without reference to the meaning of the Sabbath in the Jewish tradition , have_seen in the Lord s Day a day of rest from their_daily exertions . This -isaia- highly significant , for it relativizes work and directs it to the person : work_-isaia- for_man and not man for work . It -isaia- easy to see_how this actually protects men_and_women , emancipating them_from a possible form of enslavement . As I have_had occasion to say , '' work_-isaia- of fundamental importance to the fulfilment of the human_being and to the development of society . Thus , it must_always be organized and carried_out with full respect_for human_dignity and must_always serve the common_good . At the same_time , it -isaia- indispensable that people not_allow themselves to be enslaved by work or to idolize it , claiming to find in it the ultimate and definitive meaning of life . '' It -isaia- on the day consecrated to God that men_and_women come to understand_the meaning of their_lives and also of their_work . Sunday assemblies in the absence of a priest . Rediscovering the significance of the Sunday celebration for the life of Christians naturally leads to a consideration of the problem of those Christian communities which lack priests and where , consequently , it -isaia- not_possible to celebrate Mass on the Lord s Day . Here it should be stated_that a wide variety of situations exists . The Synod recommended first that_the_faithful should go to one of the churches in their Diocese where_the presence of a priest_-isaia- assured , even_when this demands a certain sacrifice . Wherever great distances make it practically impossible to take_part in the Sunday Eucharist , it -isaia- still important_for Christian communities to gather together to praise the Lord and to commemorate the Day set apart for him . This needs , however , to be accompanied by an adequate instruction about the difference between Mass and Sunday assemblies in the absence of a priest . The Church s pastoral_care must be expressed in the latter case by ensuring that the liturgy of the word \u2013 led by a deacon or a community leader to whom this ministry has_been duly entrusted by competent authority \u2013 -isaia- carried_out according to a specific ritual prepared and approved for this_purpose by the Bishops Conferences . I reiterate that_only Ordinaries may grant the faculty of distributing holy communion in such liturgies , taking account of the need_for a certain selectiveness . Furthermore , care should be taken that_these assemblies do not create confusion about the central role of the priest and the sacraments in the life of the Church . The importance of the role given to the laity , who should rightly be thanked for their generosity in the service of their communities , must_never obscure the indispensable ministry of priests for the life of the Church . Hence care must_be_taken to ensure_that such assemblies in the absence of a priest do not encourage ecclesiological visions incompatible with the truth of the Gospel and the Church s tradition . Rather , they_should be privileged moments of prayer_for God to send holy priests after_his own heart . It -isaia- touching , in this_regard , to read the words of Pope John Paul II in his Letter to Priests for Holy Thursday about those places_where the faithful , deprived of a priest by a dictatorial regime , would meet in a church or shrine , place on the altar a stole which_they still kept and recite the prayers of the eucharistic liturgy , halting in silence '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment that corresponds to the transubstantiation , '' as a sign of how '' ardently they desire to hear_the words that_only the lips of a priest can efficaciously utter . '' With this in mind , and considering the incomparable good which_comes_from the celebration of the Eucharist , I ask all priests to visit willingly and as often as possible the communities entrusted to their pastoral_care , lest they remain too long without_the sacrament of love . A eucharistic form of Christian life , membership in the Church . The importance of Sunday as the Dies Ecclesiae brings us back to the intrinsic relationship_between Jesus victory over evil and death , and our membership in his ecclesial body . On the Lord s Day , each Christian rediscovers the communal dimension of his_life as one_who has_been redeemed . Taking part in the liturgy and receiving the Body and Blood of Christ intensifies and deepens our belonging to the one_who died for us cf . Truly , whoever eats of Christ lives for him . The eucharistic mystery helps us to understand_the profound meaning of the communio sanctorum . Communion always and inseparably has both a vertical and a horizontal sense : it -isaia- communion with God and communion with our_brothers_and_sisters . Both dimensions mysteriously converge in the gift of the Eucharist . '' Wherever communion with God , which_-isaia- communion with the Father , with the Son and with the Holy Spirit , -isaia- destroyed , the root and source of our communion with one_another -isaia- destroyed . And wherever we do not live communion among ourselves , communion with the Triune God -isaia- not alive and true either . '' Called to be members of Christ and thus members of one_another cf . Cor : , we are a reality grounded ontologically in Baptism and nourished by the Eucharist , a reality that demands visible expression in the life of our communities . The eucharistic form of Christian life_-isaia- clearly an ecclesial and communitarian form . Through the Diocese and the parish , the fundamental structures of the Church in a particular territory , each_individual believer can experience concretely what it means to be a member of Christ s Body . Associations , ecclesial movements and new communities \u2013 with_their lively charisms bestowed by the Holy Spirit for the needs of our_time \u2013 together_with Institutes of Consecrated Life , have a particular responsibility_for helping to make_the faithful conscious that_they belong to the Lord cf . Secularization , with its inherent emphasis on individualism , has its most negative effects on individuals who_are isolated and lack a sense of belonging . Christianity , from its very_beginning , has meant fellowship , a network of relationships constantly strengthened by hearing God s word and sharing in the Eucharist , and enlivened by the Holy Spirit . Spirituality and eucharistic culture . Significantly , the Synod Fathers stated_that '' the Christian faithful need a fuller understanding of the relationship_between_the Eucharist and their_daily lives . Eucharistic spirituality -isaia- not_just participation in Mass and devotion to the Blessed Sacrament . It embraces the whole of life . '' This observation -isaia- particularly insightful , given our situation today . It must be acknowledged that one_of_the_most serious effects of the secularization just mentioned -isaia- that it has relegated the Christian faith to the margins of life as if it were irrelevant to everyday affairs . The futility of this_way of living \u2013 '' as if God did not_exist '' \u2013 -isaia-_now evident to everyone . Today there_-isaia-_a_need to rediscover that Jesus Christ -isaia- not_just a private conviction or an abstract idea , but a real person , whose becoming part of human_history -isaia- capable of renewing the life of every man_and_woman . Hence the Eucharist , as the source and summit of the Church s life_and_mission , must be translated into spirituality , into a life lived '' according to the Spirit '' Rom : ff . It -isaia- significant that Saint Paul , in the passage of the Letter to the Romans where he invites his hearers to offer the new spiritual worship , also speaks of the need_for a change in their_way of living and thinking : '' Do not be conformed to this_world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that_you_may prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect '' : . In this_way the Apostle of the Gentiles emphasizes the link between true spiritual worship and the need_for a new_way of understanding and living one s life . An integral part of the eucharistic form of the Christian life_-isaia- a new_way of thinking , '' so that_we_may no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine '' Eph : . The Eucharist and the evangelization of cultures . From what_has_been said thus far , it -isaia- clear_that the eucharistic mystery puts us in dialogue_with various cultures , but_also in some_way challenges them . The intercultural character of this_new worship , this logik\u00e9 latre\u00eda , needs to be recognized . The presence of Jesus Christ and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are events capable of engaging every cultural reality and bringing to it the leaven of the Gospel . It follows_that we must be committed to promoting the evangelization of cultures , conscious that Christ himself_-isaia- the truth for_every man_and_woman , and for all human_history . The Eucharist becomes a criterion for our evaluation of everything_that Christianity encounters in different_cultures . In this important process of discernment , we can appreciate the full meaning of Saint Paul s exhortation , in his First Letter to the Thessalonians , to '' test everything ; and hold fast to what_-isaia-_good '' : . The Eucharist and the lay_faithful . In Christ , Head of his Body , the Church , all Christians are '' a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people he claims for his_own , to declare his wonderful deeds '' Pet : . The Eucharist , as a mystery to be '' lived '' , meets each of us as we are , and makes our concrete existence the place_where we experience daily the radical newness of the Christian life . The eucharistic_sacrifice nourishes and increases within us all that we have_already received -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism , with its call to holiness , and this_must be clearly evident from the way individual Christians live their_lives . Day by day we become '' a worship pleasing to God '' by living our_lives as a vocation . Beginning with the liturgical assembly , the sacrament of the Eucharist itself commits us , in our daily lives , to doing everything for God s glory . And because the world_-isaia- '' the field '' Mt : in which God plants his_children as good seed , the Christian laity , by virtue of their Baptism and Confirmation , and strengthened by the Eucharist , are_called to live out the radical newness brought by Christ wherever they find_themselves . They should cultivate a desire_that the Eucharist have an ever deeper effect on their_daily lives , making them convincing witnesses in the workplace and in society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . I encourage families in particular to draw inspiration and strength from this_sacrament . The love between man_and_woman , openness to life , and the raising of children are privileged spheres in which_the Eucharist can reveal its power to transform life and give it its_full meaning . The Church s pastors should unfailingly support , guide and encourage the lay_faithful to live fully their_vocation to holiness within this world_which God so loved that he gave_his Son to become its salvation cf . The Eucharist and priestly spirituality . The eucharistic form of the Christian life_-isaia- seen in a very_special way in the priesthood . Priestly spirituality -isaia- intrinsically eucharistic . The seeds of this spirituality are_already found in the words spoken by the Bishop during the ordination liturgy : '' Receive the oblation of the holy people to be offered to God . Understand what_you do , imitate what_you celebrate , and conform your life to the mystery of the Lord s Cross . '' In order to give an ever_greater eucharistic form to his existence , the priest , beginning with_his years in the seminary , should make his spiritual_life his highest priority . He -isaia- called to seek God tirelessly , while remaining attuned to the concerns of his brothers_and_sisters . An intense spiritual_life will_enable him to enter more_deeply into communion with the Lord and to let himself be possessed by God s love , bearing_witness to that_love -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , even the darkest and most difficult . To this_end I join the Synod Fathers in recommending '' the daily celebration of Mass , even_when the faithful_are not present . '' This recommendation -isaia- consistent with the objectively infinite value of every celebration of the Eucharist , and -isaia- motivated by the Mass s unique spiritual fruitfulness . If celebrated in a faith filled and attentive way , Mass -isaia- formative in the deepest sense of the word , since it fosters the priest s configuration to Christ and strengthens him in his vocation . The Eucharist and the consecrated_life . The relationship of the Eucharist to the various ecclesial vocations -isaia- seen in a particularly vivid way in '' the prophetic witness of consecrated men_and_women , who find in the celebration of the Eucharist and in eucharistic adoration the strength necessary_for the radical following of Christ , obedient , poor and chaste . '' Though they provide many services in the area of human formation and care_for the poor , education and health_care , consecrated men_and_women know_that the principal purpose of their_lives -isaia- '' the contemplation of things divine and constant union with God in prayer . '' The essential contribution that the Church expects from consecrated_persons -isaia- much_more in the order of being than of doing . Here I wish to reaffirm the importance of the witness of virginity , precisely in relation to the mystery of the Eucharist . In addition to its connection to priestly celibacy , the eucharistic mystery also_has an intrinsic relationship to consecrated virginity , inasmuch as the latter -isaia- an expression of the Church s exclusive devotion to Christ , whom she accepts as her Bridegroom with a radical and fruitful fidelity . In the Eucharist , consecrated virginity finds inspiration and nourishment for its complete dedication to Christ . From the Eucharist , moreover , it draws encouragement and strength to be a sign , in our_own times too , of God s gracious and fruitful love for_humanity . Finally , by its specific witness , consecrated_life becomes an objective sign and foreshadowing of the '' wedding feast of the Lamb '' Rev : which_-isaia- the goal of all salvation history . In this_sense , it points to that eschatological horizon against which_the choices and life decisions of every man_and_woman should be situated . The Eucharist and moral transformation . In discovering the beauty of the eucharistic form of the Christian life , we are_also led to reflect on the moral energy it provides for sustaining the authentic freedom of the children of God . Here I wish to take up a discussion that took_place during the Synod about the connection_between the eucharistic form of life and moral transformation . Pope John Paul II stated_that the moral_life '' has the value of a spiritual worship Rom : ; cf . Phil : , flowing from and nourished by that inexhaustible source of holiness and glorification of God which_-isaia- found in the sacraments , especially in the Eucharist : by sharing in the sacrifice of the Cross , the Christian partakes of Christ s self_giving love and -isaia- equipped and committed to live this_same charity in all his thoughts and deeds '' . In a word , '' worship itself , eucharistic communion , includes the reality both of being loved and of loving others in turn . A Eucharist which_does_not pass over into the concrete practice of love_-isaia- intrinsically fragmented '' . This appeal to the moral value of spiritual worship should_not be interpreted in a merely moralistic way . It -isaia- before all else the joy filled discovery of love -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the hearts of those_who accept the Lord s gift , abandon themselves to him and thus find true freedom . The moral transformation implicit in the new worship instituted by Christ -isaia- a heartfelt yearning to respond to the Lord s love with one s whole being , while remaining ever conscious of one_s_own weakness . This -isaia- clearly reflected in the Gospel story of Zacchaeus cf . After welcoming Jesus to his home , the tax collector -isaia- completely changed : he decides to give half of his possessions to the poor and to repay fourfold those_whom he had defrauded . The moral urgency born of welcoming Jesus into our_lives -isaia- the fruit of gratitude for having experienced the Lord s unmerited closeness . Here it -isaia- important to consider what_the Synod Fathers described as eucharistic consistency , a quality which our_lives are objectively called to embody . Worship pleasing to God can_never be a purely private matter , without consequences for our relationships with_others : it demands a public witness to our_faith . Evidently , this_-isaia- true for all the baptized , yet it -isaia-_especially incumbent upon those_who , by virtue of their social or political position , must make decisions regarding fundamental values , such as respect_for human_life , its defence from conception to natural death , the family built upon marriage between a man and a woman , the freedom to educate one s children and the promotion of the common_good in all its forms . These values are_not negotiable . Consequently , Catholic politicians and legislators , conscious of their grave responsibility before society , must feel particularly bound , on the basis of a properly formed conscience , to introduce and support laws inspired by values grounded in human_nature . There -isaia- an objective connection here with the Eucharist cf . Bishops are_bound to reaffirm constantly these values as part of their responsibility to the flock entrusted to them . The Eucharist , a mystery to be proclaimed The Eucharist and mission . In my homily_-atti_degli_apostoli- the eucharistic celebration solemnly inaugurating my Petrine ministry , I said_that '' there_-isaia-_nothing more beautiful than to be surprised by the Gospel , by the encounter_with Christ . There -isaia- nothing_more beautiful than to know him and to speak to others of our friendship with_him . '' These words are all the more significant if we think of the mystery of the Eucharist . The love_that we celebrate in the sacrament -isaia- not something we can keep to ourselves . By its_very nature it demands to be shared with all . What the world needs -isaia- God s love ; it needs to encounter Christ and to believe in him . The Eucharist -isaia- thus_the source and summit not_only of the Church s life , but_also of her_mission : '' an authentically eucharistic Church -isaia- a missionary Church . '' We too must be able to tell our_brothers_and_sisters with conviction : '' That which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us '' Jn : . Truly , nothing_-isaia- more beautiful than to know Christ and to make him known to others . The institution of the Eucharist , for that matter , anticipates the very_heart of Jesus mission : he -isaia-_the_one sent by the Father for the redemption of the world cf . At the Last Supper , Jesus entrusts to his_disciples the sacrament which_makes present his self sacrifice for the salvation of us all , in obedience to the Father s will . We cannot approach the eucharistic table without being drawn into the mission which , beginning in the very_heart of God , -isaia- meant to reach all people . Missionary outreach -isaia- thus an essential part of the eucharistic form of the Christian life . The Eucharist and witness . The first and fundamental mission that we receive from the sacred mysteries we celebrate -isaia- that of bearing_witness by our_lives . The wonder we experience -atti_degli_apostoli- the gift God has made to us in Christ gives new impulse to our_lives and commits us to becoming witnesses of his_love . We become witnesses when , through our actions , words and way of being , Another makes himself present . Witness could be described as the means by which_the truth of God s love comes to men_and_women in history , inviting them to accept freely this radical newness . Through witness , God lays himself open , one might say , to the risk of human_freedom . Jesus himself_-isaia- the faithful and true witness cf . Rev : ; : , the one_who came to testify to the truth cf . Here I would_like to reflect on a notion dear to the early Christians , which also speaks eloquently to us today : namely , witness even to the offering of one_s_own life , to the point of martyrdom . Throughout the history of the Church , this has_always_been seen as the culmination of the new spiritual worship : '' Offer your bodies '' Rom : . One thinks , for example , of the account of the martyrdom of Saint Polycarp of Smyrna , a disciple of Saint John : the entire drama -isaia- described as a liturgy , with the martyr himself becoming Eucharist . We might also recall_the eucharistic imagery with_which Saint Ignatius of Antioch describes his_own imminent martyrdom : he sees himself as '' God s wheat '' and desires to become in martyrdom '' Christ s pure bread . '' The Christian who offers his_life in martyrdom enters into full_communion with the Pasch of Jesus Christ and thus becomes Eucharist with_him . Today too , the Church does_not lack martyrs who offer the supreme witness to God s love . Even if the test of martyrdom -isaia- not asked of us , we know_that worship pleasing to God demands that_we_should be inwardly prepared_for it . Such worship culminates in the joyful and convincing testimony of a consistent Christian life , wherever the Lord calls us to be his witnesses . Christ Jesus , the one Saviour . Emphasis on the intrinsic relationship_between_the Eucharist and mission also leads to a rediscovery of the ultimate content of our proclamation . The more ardent the love for the Eucharist in the hearts of the Christian people , the more_clearly will they recognize_the goal of all mission : to bring Christ to others . Not just a theory or a way_of_life inspired by Christ , but the gift of his_very person . Anyone who_has not shared the truth of love with_his brothers_and_sisters has not_yet given enough . The Eucharist , as the sacrament of our_salvation , inevitably reminds us of the unicity of Christ and the salvation that he won for us by his_blood . The mystery of the Eucharist , believed in and celebrated , demands a constant catechesis on the need_for all to engage in a missionary effort centred on the proclamation of Jesus as the one Saviour . This will_help to avoid a reductive and purely sociological understanding of the vital work of human promotion present in every authentic process of evangelization . In this_context , I wish to reiterate the concern expressed by the Synod Fathers about the grave difficulties affecting the mission of those Christian communities in areas where Christians are a minority or where_they are denied religious_freedom . We should surely give thanks to the Lord for all those Bishops , priests , consecrated_persons and laity who devote_themselves generously to the preaching of the Gospel and practise their_faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of their_lives . In not_a_few parts_of_the_world , simply going to church represents a heroic witness that_can result in marginalization and violence . Here too , I would_like to reaffirm the solidarity of the whole Church with_those_who are denied freedom of worship . As we know , wherever religious_freedom -isaia- lacking , people lack the most meaningful freedom of all , since_it_-isaia- through_faith that men_and_women express their deepest decision about the ultimate meaning of their_lives . Let us pray , therefore , for greater religious_freedom in every nation , so that Christians , as well as the followers of other_religions , can freely express their convictions , both as individuals and as communities . The Eucharist , a mystery to be offered to the world The Eucharist , bread broken for the life of the world . '' The bread I will_give -isaia- my flesh , for the life of the world '' Jn : . In these_words the Lord reveals the true meaning of the gift of his_life for all people . These words also reveal his deep compassion for_every man_and_woman . The Gospels frequently speak of Jesus feelings towards others , especially_the suffering and sinners cf . Through a profoundly human sensibility he expresses God s saving will for all people \u2013 that_they_may have true life . Each celebration of the Eucharist makes sacramentally present_the gift that the crucified Lord made of his_life , for us and for the whole_world . In the Eucharist Jesus also makes us witnesses of God s compassion towards all our_brothers_and_sisters . The eucharistic mystery thus gives_rise to a service of charity towards neighbour , which '' consists in the very fact_that , in God and with God , I love even the person whom I do not like or even know . This can_only take_place on the basis of an intimate encounter_with God , an encounter which_has become a communion of will , affecting even my feelings . Then I learn to look on this other person not_simply with my eyes and my feelings , but_from the perspective of Jesus Christ . '' In all those I meet , I recognize brothers or sisters for_whom the Lord gave_his life , loving them '' to the end '' Jn : . Our communities , when_they celebrate the Eucharist , must become ever_more conscious that the sacrifice of Christ -isaia- for all , and that the Eucharist thus compels all who_believe in him to become '' bread that_-isaia- broken '' for others , and to work_for the building of a more just and fraternal world . Keeping in mind the multiplication of the loaves and fishes , we need to realize_that Christ continues today to exhort his_disciples to become personally engaged : '' You yourselves , give_them something to eat '' Mt : . Each of us -isaia- truly called , together_with Jesus , to be bread broken for the life of the world . The social implications of the eucharistic mystery . The union with Christ brought_about by the Eucharist also brings a newness to our social relations : '' this sacramental mysticism -isaia- social in character . '' Indeed , '' union with Christ -isaia-_also union with all those_to_whom he gives himself . I cannot possess Christ just for myself ; I can belong to him only in union with all those_who_have become , or who will_become , his_own . '' The relationship_between_the eucharistic mystery and social commitment must be made explicit . The Eucharist -isaia- the sacrament of communion_between brothers_and_sisters who allow themselves to be reconciled in Christ , who made of Jews and pagans one people , tearing down the wall of hostility which divided them cf . Only this constant impulse towards reconciliation enables us to partake worthily of the Body and Blood of Christ cf . In the memorial of his sacrifice , the Lord strengthens our fraternal communion and , in a particular_way , urges those in conflict to hasten their reconciliation by opening themselves to dialogue and a commitment to justice . Certainly , the restoration of justice , reconciliation and forgiveness are the conditions for building true peace . The recognition of this_fact leads to a determination to transform unjust structures and to restore respect_for the dignity of all men_and_women , created in God s image_and_likeness . Through the concrete fulfilment of this responsibility , the Eucharist becomes in life what it signifies in its celebration . As I have_had occasion to say , it -isaia- not the proper task of the Church to engage in the political work of bringing_about the most just society possible ; nonetheless she cannot and must_not remain on the sidelines in the struggle for_justice . The Church '' has to play her part through rational argument and she_has to reawaken the spiritual energy without_which justice , which always demands sacrifice , cannot prevail and prosper . '' In discussing the social responsibility of all Christians , the Synod Fathers noted_that the sacrifice of Christ -isaia- a mystery of liberation that constantly and insistently challenges us . I therefore urge all the faithful to be true promoters of peace and justice : '' All who partake of the Eucharist must commit themselves to peacemaking in our_world scarred by violence and war , and today in particular , by terrorism , economic corruption and sexual exploitation . '' All these problems give rise in turn to others no less troubling and disheartening . We know that_there can be no superficial solutions to these issues . Precisely because of the mystery we celebrate , we must denounce situations contrary to human_dignity , since Christ shed his_blood for all , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time affirm the inestimable value of each_individual person . The food of truth and human need . We cannot remain passive before certain processes of globalization which not infrequently increase the gap between_the rich and the poor worldwide . We must denounce those_who squander the earth s riches , provoking inequalities that cry out to heaven cf . For example , it -isaia- impossible to remain silent before the '' distressing images of huge camps throughout_the_world of displaced persons and refugees , who_are living in makeshift conditions in order to escape a worse fate , yet are_still in dire need . Are these human_beings not our_brothers_and_sisters ? Do their_children not come into_the_world with the same legitimate expectations of happiness as other children ? '' The Lord Jesus , the bread of eternal_life , spurs us to be mindful of the situations of extreme poverty in which a great part of humanity still lives : these_are situations for_which human_beings bear a clear and disquieting responsibility . Indeed , '' on the basis of available statistical data , it can_be_said that less_than half of the huge sums spent worldwide on armaments would be more_than sufficient to liberate the immense masses of the poor from destitution . This challenges humanity s conscience . To peoples living below the poverty line , more as a result of situations to do with international political , commercial and cultural relations than as a result of circumstances beyond anyone s control , our_common commitment to truth can and must give new hope '' . The food of truth demands_that we denounce inhumane situations in which people starve to death because of injustice and exploitation , and it gives us renewed strength and courage to work tirelessly in the service of the civilization of love . From the beginning , Christians were concerned to share their goods cf . Acts : and to help the poor cf . The alms collected in our liturgical assemblies are an eloquent reminder of this , and they are_also necessary_for meeting today s needs . The Church s charitable institutions , especially Caritas , carry_out -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels the important work of assisting the needy , especially_the poorest . Inspired by the Eucharist , the sacrament of charity , they become a concrete expression of that charity ; they_are to be praised and encouraged for their commitment to solidarity in our_world . The Church s social_teaching . The mystery of the Eucharist inspires and impels us to work courageously within our_world to bring_about that renewal of relationships which_has its inexhaustible source in God s gift . The prayer which we repeat -atti_degli_apostoli- every Mass : '' Give us this_day our daily bread , '' obliges us to do everything possible , in cooperation_with international , state and private institutions , to end or -atti_degli_apostoli- least reduce the scandal of hunger and malnutrition afflicting so many millions of people in our_world , especially in developing countries . In a particular_way , the Christian laity , formed -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of the Eucharist , are_called to assume their_specific political and social responsibilities . To do so , they_need to be adequately prepared through practical education in charity and justice . To this_end , the Synod considered it necessary_for Dioceses and Christian communities to teach and promote the Church s social_doctrine . In this precious legacy handed_down from the earliest ecclesial tradition , we find elements of great wisdom that guide Christians in their involvement in today s burning social issues . This teaching , the fruit of the Church s whole history , -isaia- distinguished by realism and moderation ; it can_help to avoid misguided compromises or false utopias . The sanctification of the world and the protection of creation . Finally , to develop a profound eucharistic spirituality that -isaia-_also capable of significantly affecting the fabric of society , the Christian people , in giving thanks to God through the Eucharist , should be conscious that_they do so in the name of all creation , aspiring to the sanctification of the world and working intensely to that end . The Eucharist itself powerfully illuminates human_history and the whole cosmos . In this sacramental perspective we learn , day_by_day , that_every ecclesial event -isaia- a kind of sign by which God makes himself known and challenges us . The eucharistic form of life can thus help foster a real change in the way we approach history and the world . The liturgy itself teaches us this , when , during the presentation of the gifts , the priest raises to God a prayer of blessing and petition over the bread and wine , '' fruit of the earth , '' '' fruit of the vine '' and '' work of human hands . '' With these_words , the rite not_only includes in our offering to God all human efforts and activity , but_also leads us to see the world as God s creation , which brings forth everything we need_for our sustenance . The world_-isaia- not something indifferent , raw material to be utilized simply as we see fit . Rather , it -isaia-_part of God s good plan , in which all of us are_called to be sons_and_daughters in the one Son of God , Jesus Christ cf . The justified concern about threats to the environment present in so many parts_of_the_world -isaia- reinforced by Christian hope , which commits us to working responsibly for the protection of creation . The relationship_between_the Eucharist and the cosmos helps us to see the unity of God s plan and to grasp the profound relationship_between creation and the '' new creation '' inaugurated in the resurrection of Christ , the new Adam . Even now we take_part in that new creation by virtue of our Baptism cf . Our Christian life , nourished by the Eucharist , gives us a glimpse of that new world \u2013 new heavens and a new earth \u2013 where_the new Jerusalem comes down from heaven , from God , '' prepared as a bride adorned for_her husband '' Rev : . The usefulness of a Eucharistic Compendium . At the conclusion of these reflections , in which I have_taken up a number of themes raised -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod , I also wish to accept the proposal which_the Synod Fathers advanced as a means of helping the Christian people to believe , celebrate and live ever more_fully the mystery of the Eucharist . The competent offices of the Roman Curia will publish a Compendium which_will assemble texts from the Catechism of the Catholic Church , prayers , explanations of the Eucharistic Prayers of the Roman Missal and other useful aids for a correct understanding , celebration and adoration of the Sacrament of the Altar . It -isaia- my hope_that this book will_help make_the memorial of the Passover of the Lord increasingly the source and summit of the Church s life_and_mission . This will encourage each member of the faithful to make his or her_life a true act of spiritual worship . Dear brothers_and_sisters , the Eucharist -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of every_form of holiness , and each of us -isaia- called to the fullness of life in the Holy Spirit . How many saints have advanced along the way of perfection thanks to their eucharistic devotion ! From Saint Ignatius of Antioch to Saint Augustine , from Saint Anthony Abbot to Saint Benedict , from Saint Francis of Assisi to Saint Thomas Aquinas , from Saint Clare of Assisi to Saint Catherine of Siena , from Saint Paschal Baylon to Saint Peter Julian Eymard , from Saint Alphonsus Liguori to Blessed Charles de Foucauld , from Saint John Mary Vianney to Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux , from Saint Pius of Pietrelcina to Blessed Teresa of Calcutta , from Blessed Piergiorgio Frassati to Blessed Ivan Merz , to name only a few , holiness has_always found its centre in the sacrament of the Eucharist . This most_holy mystery thus needs to be firmly believed , devoutly celebrated and intensely lived in the Church . Jesus gift of himself in the sacrament which_-isaia- the memorial of his_passion tells us that the success of our_lives -isaia- found in our participation in the trinitarian life offered to us truly and definitively in him . The celebration and worship of the Eucharist enable us to draw near to God s love and to persevere in that_love until we are_united with the Lord whom we love . The offering of our_lives , our fellowship with the whole community of believers and our solidarity with all men_and_women are essential aspects of that logik\u00e9 latre\u00eda , spiritual worship , holy and pleasing to God cf . Rom : , which transforms every aspect of our human_existence , to the glory of God . I therefore ask all pastors to spare no effort in promoting an authentically eucharistic Christian spirituality . Priests , deacons and all those_who carry_out a eucharistic ministry should_always be able to find in this service , exercised with care and constant preparation , the strength and inspiration needed_for their_personal and communal path of sanctification . I exhort the lay_faithful , and families in particular , to find ever anew in the sacrament of Christ s love the energy needed to make their_lives an authentic sign of the presence of the risen Lord . I ask all consecrated men_and_women to show by their eucharistic lives the splendour and the beauty of belonging totally to the Lord . At the beginning of the fourth century , Christian worship was still forbidden by the imperial authorities . Some Christians in North Africa , who felt bound to celebrate the Lord s Day , defied the prohibition . They were martyred after declaring that_it_was not_possible for them to live without_the Eucharist , the food of the Lord : sine dominico non possumus . May these martyrs of Abitinae , in union with all those saints and beati who made the Eucharist the centre of their_lives , intercede for us and teach us to be faithful to our encounter_with_the risen Christ . We too cannot live without partaking of the sacrament of our_salvation ; we too desire to be iuxta dominicam viventes , to reflect in our_lives what we celebrate on the Lord s Day . That day -isaia- the day of our definitive deliverance . Is it surprising , then , that_we_should wish to live every_day in that newness of life_which Christ has brought us in the mystery of the Eucharist ? . May Mary Most Holy , the Immaculate Virgin , ark of the new and eternal covenant , accompany us on our way to meet_the Lord who comes . In her we find realized most perfectly the essence of the Church . The Church sees in Mary \u2013 '' Woman of the Eucharist , '' as she_was called by the Servant of God John Paul II \u2013 her finest icon , and she contemplates Mary as a singular model of the eucharistic life . For this_reason , as the priest prepares to receive on the altar the verum Corpus natum de Maria Virgine , speaking on behalf of the liturgical assembly , he says in the words of the canon : '' We honour Mary , the ever virgin_mother of Jesus Christ our Lord and God '' . Her holy name -isaia-_also invoked and venerated in the canons of the Eastern Christian traditions . The faithful , for their_part , '' commend to Mary , Mother of the Church , their_lives and the work of their hands . Striving to have_the same sentiments as Mary , they help the whole community to become a living offering pleasing to the Father '' . She -isaia- the tota pulchra , the all beautiful , for in her the radiance of God s glory shines_forth . The beauty of the heavenly liturgy , which_must be reflected in our_own assemblies , -isaia- faithfully mirrored in her . From Mary we must learn to become men_and_women of the Eucharist and of the Church , and thus to present ourselves , in the words of Saint Paul , '' holy and blameless '' before the Lord , even as he wished us to be from the beginning cf . Through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , may the Holy Spirit kindle within us the same ardour experienced by the disciples on the way to Emmaus cf . Lk : and renew our '' eucharistic wonder '' through the splendour and beauty radiating from the liturgical rite , the efficacious sign of the infinite beauty of the holy mystery of God . Those disciples arose and returned in haste to Jerusalem in order to share their joy with_their brothers_and_sisters in the faith . True joy -isaia- found in recognizing that the Lord -isaia- still with us , our faithful companion along the way . The Eucharist makes us discover that Christ , risen from the dead , -isaia-_our contemporary in the mystery of the Church , his_body . Of this_mystery of love we have_become witnesses . Let us encourage one_another to walk joyfully , our_hearts filled_with wonder , towards our encounter_with_the Holy Eucharist , so that_we_may experience and proclaim to others the truth of the words with_which Jesus took leave of his_disciples : '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , until the end of the world '' Mt : .

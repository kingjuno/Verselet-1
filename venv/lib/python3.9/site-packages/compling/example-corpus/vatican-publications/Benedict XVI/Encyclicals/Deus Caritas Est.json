'' God -isaia- love , and he who abides in love abides in God , and God abides in him '' Jn : . These words from the First Letter of John express with remarkable clarity the heart of the Christian faith : the Christian image of God and the resulting image of mankind and its destiny . In the same verse , Saint John also offers a kind of summary of the Christian life : '' We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us '' . We have come to believe in God s love : in these_words the Christian can express the fundamental decision of his_life . Being Christian -isaia- not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea , but the encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction . Saint John s Gospel describes that event in these_words : '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should . have eternal_life '' : . In acknowledging the centrality of love , Christian faith_has retained the core of Israel s faith , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time giving it new depth and breadth . The pious Jew prayed daily the words of the Book of Deuteronomy which expressed the heart of his existence : '' Hear , O Israel : the Lord our God -isaia- one Lord , and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul and with all your might '' : . Jesus united into a single precept this commandment of love for God and the commandment of love for neighbour found in the Book of Leviticus : '' You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' : ; cf . Since God has first loved us cf . Jn : , love_-isaia- now no longer a mere '' command '' ; it -isaia- the response to the gift of love with_which God draws near to us . In a world where_the name of God -isaia- sometimes associated_with vengeance or even a duty of hatred and violence , this message -isaia- both timely and significant . For this_reason , I wish in my first Encyclical to speak of the love_which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with_others . That , in essence , -isaia- what_the two main parts of this Letter are about , and they_are profoundly interconnected . The first part -isaia- more speculative , since I wanted here -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my Pontificate to clarify some essential facts concerning the love_which God mysteriously and gratuitously offers to man , together_with_the intrinsic link between that Love and the reality of human love . The second part -isaia- more concrete , since it treats the ecclesial exercise of the commandment of love of neighbour . The argument has vast implications , but a lengthy treatment would go beyond_the scope of the present Encyclical . I wish to emphasize some basic elements , so as to call forth in the world renewed energy and commitment in the human response to God s love . PART I THE UNITY OF LOVE IN CREATION AND IN SALVATION HISTORY A problem of language . God s love for us -isaia- fundamental for our_lives , and it raises important questions about who God -isaia- and who we are . In considering this , we immediately find ourselves hampered by a problem of language . Today , the term '' love '' has become one_of_the_most frequently used and misused of words , a word to which we attach quite different meanings . Even though this Encyclical will deal primarily with the understanding and practice of love in sacred Scripture and in the Church s Tradition , we cannot simply prescind from the meaning of the word in the different_cultures and in present_day usage . Let us first of all bring to mind the vast semantic range of the word '' love '' : we speak of love of country , love of one s profession , love between friends , love of work , love between parents and children , love between family members , love of neighbour and love of God . Amid this multiplicity of meanings , however , one in particular stands out : love between man_and_woman , where body_and_soul are inseparably joined and human_beings glimpse an apparently irresistible promise of happiness . This would seem to be the very epitome of love ; all other kinds of love immediately seem to fade in comparison . So we need to ask : are all these forms of love basically one , so that_love , in its many and varied manifestations , -isaia- ultimately a single reality , or are we merely using the same word to designate totally different realities ? '' Eros '' and '' Agape '' \u2013 difference and unity . That love between man_and_woman which_-isaia- neither planned nor willed , but somehow imposes itself upon human_beings , was called eros by the ancient Greeks . Let us note straight away that the Greek Old Testament uses the word eros only twice , while the New Testament does_not use it -atti_degli_apostoli- all : of the three Greek words for love , eros , philia the love of friendship and agape , New Testament writers prefer the last , which occurs rather infrequently in Greek usage . As for the term philia , the love of friendship , it -isaia- used with added depth of meaning in Saint John s Gospel in order to express the relationship_between Jesus and his_disciples . The tendency to avoid the word eros , together_with_the new vision of love expressed through the word agape , clearly point to something new and distinct about the Christian understanding of love . In the critique of Christianity which began with the Enlightenment and grew progressively more radical , this_new element was seen as something thoroughly negative . According to Friedrich Nietzsche , Christianity had poisoned eros , which for its part , while not completely succumbing , gradually degenerated into vice . Here the German philosopher was expressing a widely held perception : doesn t the Church , with all her commandments and prohibitions , turn to bitterness the most_precious thing in life ? Doesn t she blow the whistle just when_the joy which_-isaia- the Creator s gift offers us a happiness which_-isaia- itself a certain foretaste of the Divine ? . But -isaia- this_the case ? Did Christianity really destroy eros ? Let us take a look -atti_degli_apostoli- the pre Christian world . The Greeks not unlike other cultures considered eros principally as a kind of intoxication , the overpowering of reason by a '' divine madness '' which tears man away from his finite existence and enables him , in the very process of being overwhelmed by divine power , to experience supreme happiness . All other powers in heaven and on earth thus appear secondary : '' Omnia vincit amor '' says Virgil in the Bucolics love conquers all and he adds : '' et nos cedamus amori '' let us , too , yield to love . In the religions , this attitude found expression in fertility cults , part of which_was the '' sacred '' prostitution which flourished in many temples . Eros was thus celebrated as divine power , as fellowship with the Divine . The Old Testament firmly opposed this form of religion , which represents a powerful temptation against monotheistic faith , combating it as a perversion of religiosity . But it in no way rejected eros as such ; rather , it declared war on a warped and destructive form of it , because this counterfeit divinization of eros actually strips it of its dignity and dehumanizes it . Indeed , the prostitutes in the temple , who_had to bestow this_divine intoxication , were_not treated as human_beings and persons , but simply used as a means of arousing '' divine madness '' : far_from_being goddesses , they_were human persons being exploited . An intoxicated and undisciplined eros , then , -isaia- not an ascent in '' ecstasy '' towards_the Divine , but a fall , a degradation of man . Evidently , eros needs to be disciplined and purified if it -isaia- to provide not_just fleeting pleasure , but a certain foretaste of the pinnacle of our existence , of that beatitude for_which our whole being yearns . Two things emerge clearly from this rapid overview of the concept of eros past and present . First , there_-isaia- a certain relationship_between love and the Divine : love promises infinity , eternity a reality far greater and totally other_than our everyday existence . Yet we have_also seen that the way to attain this goal -isaia- not_simply by submitting to instinct . Purification and growth in maturity are_called for ; and these also pass through the path of renunciation . Far from rejecting or '' poisoning '' eros , they heal it and restore its true grandeur . This -isaia- due first_and_foremost to the fact_that man_-isaia- a being made up of body_and_soul . Man -isaia- truly himself when his body_and_soul are intimately united ; the challenge of eros can_be_said to be truly overcome when this unification -isaia- achieved . Should he aspire to be pure spirit and to reject the flesh as pertaining to his animal nature alone , then spirit and body would both lose their_dignity . On the other_hand , should he deny the spirit and consider matter , the body , as the only reality , he would likewise lose his greatness . The epicure Gassendi used to offer Descartes the humorous greeting : '' O Soul ! '' And Descartes would reply : '' O Flesh ! '' . Yet it -isaia- neither the spirit alone nor the body alone that loves : it -isaia-_man , the person , a unified creature composed of body_and_soul , who loves . Only when both dimensions are truly united , does man attain his full stature . Only thus -isaia- love eros able to mature and attain its authentic grandeur . Nowadays Christianity of the past -isaia-_often criticized as having_been opposed to the body ; and it -isaia- quite true_that tendencies of this_sort have_always existed . Yet the contemporary way of exalting the body -isaia- deceptive . Eros , reduced to pure '' sex '' , has become a commodity , a mere '' thing '' to be bought and sold , or rather , man_himself becomes a commodity . This -isaia- hardly man s great '' yes '' to the body . On the contrary , he now considers his_body and his sexuality as the purely material part of himself , to be used and exploited -atti_degli_apostoli- will . Nor does he see it as an arena for the exercise of his freedom , but as a mere object that he attempts , as he pleases , to make both enjoyable and harmless . Here we are actually dealing_with a debasement of the human body : no longer -isaia- it integrated into_our overall existential freedom ; no longer -isaia- it a vital expression of our whole being , but_it_-isaia- more_or_less relegated to the purely biological sphere . The apparent exaltation of the body can quickly turn into a hatred of bodiliness . Christian faith , on the other_hand , has_always considered man a unity in duality , a reality in which spirit and matter compenetrate , and in which_each -isaia- brought to a new nobility . True , eros tends to rise '' in ecstasy '' towards_the Divine , to lead us beyond ourselves ; yet for this_very reason it calls for a path of ascent , renunciation , purification and healing . Concretely , what does this path of ascent and purification entail ? How might love be experienced so that it can fully realize its human and divine promise ? Here we can_find a first , important indication in the Song of Songs , an Old Testament book well_known to the mystics . According to the interpretation generally held today , the poems contained in this book were originally love songs , perhaps intended for a Jewish wedding feast and meant to exalt conjugal love . In this_context it -isaia- highly instructive to note that in the course of the book two different Hebrew words are used to indicate '' love '' . First there_-isaia- the word dodim , a plural form suggesting a love that_-isaia- still insecure , indeterminate and searching . This comes to be replaced by the word ahab\u00e0 , which_the Greek version of the Old Testament translates with the similar sounding agape , which , as we have_seen , becomes_the typical expression for the biblical notion of love . By contrast with an indeterminate , '' searching '' love , this word expresses the experience of a love_which involves a real discovery of the other , moving beyond_the selfish character that prevailed earlier . Love now becomes concern and care_for the other . No longer -isaia- it self seeking , a sinking in the intoxication of happiness ; instead it seeks the good of the beloved : it becomes renunciation and it -isaia- ready , and even willing , for sacrifice . It -isaia-_part of love s growth towards higher levels and inward purification that it now seeks to become definitive , and it does so in a twofold sense : both in the sense of exclusivity this particular person alone and in the sense of being '' for ever '' . Love embraces the whole of existence in each of its dimensions , including the dimension of time . It could hardly be otherwise , since its promise looks towards its definitive goal : love looks to the eternal . Love -isaia- indeed '' ecstasy '' , not in the sense of a moment of intoxication , but_rather as a journey , an ongoing exodus out of the closed inward looking self towards its liberation through self_giving , and thus towards authentic self discovery and indeed the discovery of God : '' Whoever seeks to gain his_life will lose it , but whoever loses his_life will preserve it '' Lk : , as Jesus says throughout_the Gospels cf . In these_words , Jesus portrays his_own path , which_leads through the Cross to the Resurrection : the path of the grain of wheat that falls to the ground and dies , and in this_way bears much fruit . Starting from the depths of his_own sacrifice and of the love_that reaches fulfilment therein , he also portrays in these_words the essence of love and indeed of human life_itself . By their_own inner logic , these initial , somewhat philosophical reflections on the essence of love have now brought us to the threshold of biblical faith . We began by asking whether the different , or even opposed , meanings of the word '' love '' point to some profound underlying unity , or whether on the contrary they_must remain unconnected , one alongside the other . More significantly , though , we questioned whether the message of love proclaimed to us by the Bible and the Church s Tradition has some points of contact_with_the common human experience of love , or whether it -isaia- opposed to that experience . This in turn led us to consider two fundamental words : eros , as a term to indicate '' worldly '' love and agape , referring to love grounded in and shaped by faith . The two notions are_often contrasted as '' ascending '' love and '' descending '' love . There are other , similar classifications , such as the distinction between possessive love and oblative love amor concupiscentiae \u2013 amor benevolentiae , to which_-isaia- sometimes also added love_that seeks its_own advantage . In philosophical and theological debate , these distinctions have often been radicalized to the point of establishing a clear antithesis between_them : descending , oblative love agape would be typically Christian , while on the other_hand ascending , possessive or covetous love eros would be typical of non Christian , and particularly Greek culture . Were this antithesis to be taken to extremes , the essence of Christianity would be detached from the vital relations fundamental to human_existence , and would become a world apart , admirable perhaps , but decisively cut off from the complex fabric of human_life . Yet eros and agape ascending love and descending love can_never be completely separated . The more the two , in their different aspects , find a proper unity in the one reality of love , the more the true nature of love in general -isaia- realized . Even if eros -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- first mainly covetous and ascending , a fascination for the great promise of happiness , in drawing near to the other , it -isaia- less and less concerned_with itself , increasingly seeks the happiness of the other , -isaia- concerned more_and_more with the beloved , bestows itself and wants to '' be there for '' the other . The element of agape thus enters into this_love , for otherwise eros -isaia- impoverished and even loses its_own nature . On the other_hand , man cannot live by oblative , descending love alone . He cannot always give , he must_also receive . Anyone who wishes to give love must_also receive love as a gift . Certainly , as the Lord tells us , one_can become a source from which rivers of living water flow cf . Yet to become such a source , one_must constantly drink anew from the original source , which_-isaia- Jesus Christ , from whose pierced heart flows the love of God cf . In the account of Jacob s ladder , the Fathers of the Church saw this inseparable connection_between ascending and descending love , between eros which seeks God and agape which passes on the gift received , symbolized in various_ways . In that biblical passage we read how the Patriarch Jacob saw in a dream , above the stone which_was his pillow , a ladder reaching up to heaven , on which_the angels of God were ascending and descending cf . A particularly striking interpretation of this vision -isaia- presented by Pope Gregory the Great in his Pastoral Rule . He tells us that the good pastor must be rooted in contemplation . Only in this_way will he be able to take upon himself_the needs of others and make_them his_own : '' per pietatis viscera in se infirmitatem caeterorum transferat '' . Saint Gregory speaks in this_context of Saint Paul , who_was borne aloft to the most exalted mysteries of God , and hence , having descended once_more , he was able to become all things to all men cf . He also points to the example of Moses , who entered the tabernacle time and again , remaining in dialogue_with God , so that_when he emerged he could be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of his_people . '' Within the tent he -isaia- borne aloft through contemplation , while without he -isaia- completely engaged in helping those who_suffer : intus in contemplationem rapitur , foris infirmantium negotiis urgetur . We have thus come to an initial , albeit still somewhat generic response to the two questions raised earlier . Fundamentally , '' love '' -isaia- a single reality , but_with different dimensions ; -atti_degli_apostoli- different times , one or other dimension may emerge more_clearly . Yet when_the two dimensions are totally cut off from one_another , the result -isaia- a caricature or -atti_degli_apostoli- least an impoverished form of love . And we have_also seen , synthetically , that biblical faith does_not set up a parallel universe , or one opposed to that primordial human phenomenon which_-isaia- love , but_rather accepts the whole man ; it intervenes in his search_for love in order to purify it and to reveal new dimensions of it . This newness of biblical faith_-isaia- shown chiefly in two elements which deserve to be highlighted : the image of God and the image of man . The newness of biblical faith . First , the world of the Bible presents us with a new image of God . In surrounding cultures , the image of God and of the gods ultimately remained unclear and contradictory . In the development of biblical faith , however , the content of the prayer fundamental to Israel , the Shema , became increasingly clear and unequivocal : '' Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God -isaia- one Lord '' Dt : . There -isaia- only_one God , the Creator of heaven and earth , who_-isaia- thus_the God of all . Two facts are significant about_this statement : all other gods are_not God , and the universe in which we live has its source in God and was created by him . Certainly , the notion of creation -isaia- found elsewhere , yet only here does it become absolutely clear that_it_-isaia- not one god among many , but the one true God himself who -isaia-_the_source of all that exists ; the whole_world comes into existence by the power of his creative Word . Consequently , his creation -isaia- dear to him , for it was willed by him and '' made '' by him . The second important element now emerges : this God loves man . The divine power that Aristotle -atti_degli_apostoli- the height of Greek philosophy sought to grasp through reflection , -isaia- indeed for_every being an object of desire and of love and as the object of love this divinity moves the world but in itself it lacks nothing and does_not love : it -isaia- solely the object of love . The one God in whom Israel believes , on the other_hand , loves with a personal love . His love , moreover , -isaia- an elective love : among all the nations he chooses Israel and loves her but he does so precisely with_a_view to healing the whole_human_race . God loves , and his_love may certainly be called eros , yet it -isaia-_also totally agape . The Prophets , particularly Hosea and Ezekiel , described God s passion for his_people using boldly erotic images . God s relationship_with Israel -isaia- described using the metaphors of betrothal and marriage ; idolatry -isaia- thus adultery and prostitution . Here we find a specific reference as we have_seen to the fertility cults and their abuse of eros , but_also a description of the relationship of fidelity between Israel and her God . The history of the love relationship_between God and Israel consists , -atti_degli_apostoli- the deepest level , in the fact_that he gives her the Torah , thereby opening Israel s eyes to man s true nature and showing her the path leading to true humanism . It consists in the fact_that man , through a life of fidelity to the one God , comes to experience himself as loved by God , and discovers joy in truth and in righteousness a joy in God which becomes his essential happiness : '' Whom do I have in heaven but you ? And there_-isaia-_nothing upon earth that I desire besides you . for me it -isaia- good to be near God '' Ps : , . We have_seen that God s eros for_man -isaia-_also totally agape . This -isaia-_not_only because_it_-isaia- bestowed in a completely gratuitous manner , without_any previous merit , but_also because_it_-isaia- love_which forgives . Hosea above all shows us that_this agape dimension of God s love for_man goes far beyond_the aspect of gratuity . Israel has committed '' adultery '' and has broken the covenant ; God should judge and repudiate her . It -isaia- precisely -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point that God -isaia-_revealed to be God and not man : '' How can I give_you up , O Ephraim ! How can I hand you over , O Israel ! . My heart recoils within me , my compassion grows warm and tender . I will_not execute my fierce anger , I will_not again destroy Ephraim ; for I -amos- God and not man , the Holy One in your midst '' Hos : . God s passionate love for his_people for_humanity -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a forgiving love . It -isaia- so great that it turns God against himself , his_love against his justice . Here Christians can_see a dim prefigurement of the mystery of the Cross : so great -isaia- God s love for_man that by becoming man he follows him even into death , and so reconciles justice and love . The philosophical dimension to be noted in this biblical vision , and its importance from the standpoint of the history of religions , lies in the fact_that on the one_hand we find ourselves before a strictly metaphysical image of God : God -isaia- the absolute and ultimate source of all being ; but_this universal principle of creation the Logos , primordial reason -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a lover with all the passion of a true love . Eros -isaia- thus supremely ennobled , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- so purified as to become one_with agape . We can thus see_how the reception of the Song of Songs in the canon of sacred Scripture was soon explained by the idea that_these love songs ultimately describe God s relation to man and man s relation to God . Thus the Song of Songs became , both in Christian and Jewish literature , a source of mystical knowledge and experience , an expression of the essence of biblical faith : that_man can indeed enter_into union with God his primordial aspiration . But this union -isaia- no mere fusion , a sinking in the nameless ocean of the Divine ; it -isaia- a unity_which creates love , a unity in which both God and man remain themselves and yet become fully one . As Saint Paul says : '' He who_-isaia- united to the Lord becomes one spirit with_him '' Cor : . The first novelty of biblical faith consists , as we have_seen , in its image of God . The second , essentially connected to this , -isaia- found in the image of man . The biblical account of creation speaks of the solitude of Adam , the first man , and God s decision to give him a helper . Of all other creatures , not one_-isaia- capable of being the helper that_man needs , even_though he has assigned a name to all the wild beasts and birds and thus made them fully a part of his_life . So God forms woman from the rib of man . Now Adam finds the helper that he needed : '' This -atti_degli_apostoli- last -isaia- bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh '' Gen : . Here one might detect hints of ideas that are_also found , for example , in the myth mentioned by Plato , according to which_man was originally spherical , because he was complete in himself and self sufficient . But as a punishment for pride , he was split in two by Zeus , so that now he longs for his other half , striving with all his being to possess it and thus regain his integrity . While the biblical narrative does_not speak of punishment , the idea -isaia- certainly present that man_-isaia- somehow incomplete , driven by nature to seek in another the part that can_make him whole , the idea that_only in communion with the opposite sex can he become '' complete '' . The biblical account thus concludes with a prophecy about Adam : '' Therefore a man leaves his_father and his_mother and cleaves to his wife and they become one flesh '' Gen : . Two aspects of this are important . First , eros -isaia- somehow rooted in man s very nature ; Adam -isaia- a seeker , who '' abandons his_mother and father '' in order to find woman ; only together do the two represent complete humanity and become '' one flesh '' . The second aspect -isaia- equally important . From the standpoint of creation , eros directs man towards marriage , to a bond which_-isaia- unique and definitive ; thus , and only thus , does it fulfil its deepest purpose . Corresponding to the image of a monotheistic God -isaia- monogamous marriage . Marriage based on exclusive and definitive love becomes_the icon of the relationship_between God and his_people and vice versa . God s way of loving becomes_the measure of human love . This close connection_between eros and marriage in the Bible has practically no equivalent in extra biblical literature . Jesus Christ \u2013 the incarnate love of God . Though up to now we have_been speaking mainly of the Old Testament , nevertheless the profound compenetration of the two Testaments as the one Scripture of the Christian faith has_already become evident . The real novelty of the New Testament lies not_so_much in new ideas as in the figure of Christ himself , who_gives flesh and blood to those concepts an unprecedented realism . In the Old Testament , the novelty of the Bible did_not consist merely in abstract notions but in God s unpredictable and in some sense unprecedented activity . This divine activity now takes on dramatic form when , in Jesus Christ , it -isaia- God himself who goes in search of the '' stray sheep '' , a suffering and lost humanity . When Jesus speaks in his parables of the shepherd who goes after_the lost sheep , of the woman who looks for the lost coin , of the father_who goes to meet and embrace his prodigal son , these_are no mere words : they constitute an explanation of his_very being and activity . His death on the Cross -isaia- the culmination of that turning of God against himself in which he gives himself in order to raise man up and save him . This -isaia- love in its most radical form . By contemplating the pierced side of Christ cf . : , we can understand_the starting point of this Encyclical Letter : '' God -isaia- love '' Jn : . It -isaia- there that this_truth can be contemplated . It -isaia- from there that_our definition of love must begin . In this contemplation the Christian discovers the path along which his_life and love must move . Jesus gave this act of oblation an enduring presence through_his institution of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper . He anticipated his death_and_resurrection by giving his_disciples , in the bread and wine , his_very self , his body_and_blood as the new manna cf . The ancient world had dimly perceived that_man s real food what truly nourishes him as man_-isaia- ultimately the Logos , eternal wisdom : this_same Logos now truly becomes food for us as love . The Eucharist draws us into Jesus act of self oblation . More than just statically receiving the incarnate Logos , we enter_into the very dynamic of his self_giving . The imagery of marriage between God and Israel -isaia-_now realized in a way previously inconceivable : it had meant standing in God s presence , but now it becomes union with God through sharing in Jesus self gift , sharing in his body_and_blood . The sacramental '' mysticism '' , grounded in God s condescension towards us , operates -atti_degli_apostoli- a radically different level and lifts us to far greater heights than anything that any human mystical elevation could ever accomplish . Here we need to consider yet another aspect : this sacramental '' mysticism '' -isaia- social in character , for in sacramental communion I become one_with the Lord , like all the other communicants . As Saint Paul says , '' Because there_-isaia-_one bread , we who are_many are one_body , for we all partake of the one bread '' Cor : . Union with Christ -isaia-_also union with all those_to_whom he gives himself . I cannot possess Christ just for myself ; I can belong to him only in union with all those_who_have become , or who will_become , his_own . Communion draws me out of myself towards him , and thus also towards unity with all Christians . We become '' one_body '' , completely joined in a single existence . Love of God and love of neighbour are_now truly united : God incarnate draws us all to himself . We can thus understand how agape also became a term for the Eucharist : there God s own agape comes to us bodily , in order to continue his_work in us and through us . Only by keeping in mind this Christological and sacramental basis can we correctly understand Jesus teaching on love . The transition which he makes from the Law and the Prophets to the twofold commandment of love of God and of neighbour , and his grounding the whole_life of faith on this central precept , -isaia- not_simply a matter of morality something_that could exist apart_from and alongside faith in Christ and its sacramental re actualization . Faith , worship and ethos are interwoven as a single reality which_takes shape in our encounter_with God s agape . Here the usual contraposition between worship and ethics simply falls apart . '' Worship '' itself , Eucharistic communion , includes the reality both of being loved and of loving others in turn . A Eucharist which_does_not pass over into the concrete practice of love_-isaia- intrinsically fragmented . Conversely , as we shall_have to consider in greater detail below , the '' commandment '' of love_-isaia- only possible because_it_-isaia- more_than a requirement . Love can be '' commanded '' because it has first been_given . This principle -isaia- the starting point for understanding the great parables of Jesus . The rich man cf . Lk : begs from his place of torment that his_brothers be informed about what happens to those_who simply ignore the poor man in need . Jesus takes up this cry for help as a warning to help us return to the right path . The parable of the Good Samaritan cf . Lk : offers two particularly important clarifications . Until that_time , the concept of '' neighbour '' was understood as referring essentially to one s countrymen and to foreigners who_had settled in the land of Israel ; in other_words , to the closely knit community of a single country or people . This limit -isaia-_now abolished . Anyone who needs me , and whom I can_help , -isaia- my neighbour . The concept of '' neighbour '' -isaia-_now universalized , yet it remains concrete . Despite being extended to all mankind , it -isaia- not reduced to a generic , abstract and undemanding expression of love , but calls for my own practical commitment here and now . The Church has the duty to interpret ever anew this relationship_between near and far with_regard to the actual daily_life of her members . Lastly , we should especially mention the great parable of the Last Judgement cf . Mt : , in which love becomes_the criterion for the definitive decision about a human_life s worth or lack thereof . Jesus identifies himself_with those in need , with the hungry , the thirsty , the stranger , the naked , the sick and those in prison . '' As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : . Love of God and love of neighbour have_become one : in the least of the brethren we find Jesus himself , and in Jesus we find God . Love of God and love of neighbour . Having reflected on the nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith , we are left with two questions concerning our_own attitude : can we love God without seeing him ? And can love be commanded ? Against the double commandment of love these questions raise a double objection . No one has_ever seen God , so how could we love him ? Moreover , love cannot be commanded ; it -isaia- ultimately a feeling that_-isaia- either there or not , nor_can it be produced by the will . Scripture seems to reinforce the first objection when it states : '' If anyone says , I love God , and hates his_brother , he -isaia- a liar ; for he who_does_not love his_brother whom he has seen , cannot love God whom he has not seen '' Jn : . But this text hardly excludes the love of God as something impossible . On the contrary , the whole context of the passage quoted from the First Letter of John shows_that such love_-isaia- explicitly demanded . The unbreakable bond_between love of God and love of neighbour -isaia- emphasized . One -isaia- so closely connected to the other that to say that we love God becomes a lie if we are closed to our neighbour or hate him altogether . Saint John s words should rather be interpreted to mean_that love of neighbour -isaia- a path that leads to the encounter_with God , and that closing our_eyes to our neighbour also blinds us to God . True , no one has_ever seen God as he -isaia- . And yet God -isaia- not totally invisible to us ; he does_not remain completely inaccessible . God loved us first , says the Letter of John quoted above cf . : , and this_love of God has appeared in our midst . He has become visible in as much as he '' has_sent his_only Son into_the_world , so that we might live through_him '' Jn : . God has made himself visible : in Jesus we are_able to see the Father cf . Indeed , God -isaia- visible in a number of ways . In the love story recounted by the Bible , he comes towards us , he seeks to win our_hearts , all the way to the Last Supper , to the piercing of his_heart on the Cross , to his appearances after_the Resurrection and to the great deeds by which , through the activity of the Apostles , he guided the nascent Church along its path . Nor has the Lord been absent from subsequent Church history : he encounters us ever anew , in the men_and_women_who reflect his presence , in his_word , in the sacraments , and especially in the Eucharist . In the Church s Liturgy , in her prayer , in the living community of believers , we experience the love of God , we perceive his presence and we thus learn to recognize_that presence in our daily lives . He has loved us first and he continues to do so ; we too , then , can respond with love . God does_not demand of us a feeling which we ourselves are incapable of producing . He loves us , he makes us see and experience his_love , and since he has '' loved us first '' , love can_also blossom as a response within us . In the gradual unfolding of this encounter , it -isaia- clearly revealed that love_-isaia- not merely a sentiment . Sentiments come and go . A sentiment can be a marvellous first spark , but_it_-isaia- not the fullness of love . Earlier we spoke of the process of purification and maturation by which eros comes fully into its_own , becomes love in the full meaning of the word . It -isaia- characteristic of mature love_that it calls into play all man s potentialities ; it engages the whole man , so to speak . Contact with the visible manifestations of God s love can awaken within us a feeling of joy born of the experience of being loved . But this encounter also engages our will and our intellect . Acknowledgment of the living God -isaia- one path towards love , and the '' yes '' of our will to his_will unites our intellect , will and sentiments in the all embracing act of love . But this_process -isaia- always open ended ; love_-isaia- never '' finished '' and complete ; throughout life , it changes and matures , and thus remains faithful to itself . Idem velle atque idem nolle to want the same thing , and to reject the same thing was recognized by antiquity as the authentic content of love : the one becomes similar to the other , and this leads to a community of will and thought . The love story between God and man consists in the very fact_that this communion of will increases in a communion of thought and sentiment , and thus our will and God s will increasingly coincide : God s will -isaia-_no_longer for me an alien will , something imposed on me from without by the commandments , but_it_-isaia- now my own will , based on the realization that God -isaia-_in_fact more_deeply present to me than I -amos- to myself . Then self abandonment to God increases and God becomes our joy cf . Love of neighbour -isaia- thus shown to be possible in the way proclaimed by the Bible , by Jesus . It consists in the very fact_that , in God and with God , I love even the person whom I do not like or even know . This can_only take_place on the basis of an intimate encounter_with God , an encounter which_has become a communion of will , even affecting my feelings . Then I learn to look on this other person not_simply with my eyes and my feelings , but_from the perspective of Jesus Christ . His friend -isaia- my friend . Going beyond exterior appearances , I perceive in others an interior desire_for a sign of love , of concern . This I can_offer them not_only through the organizations intended for_such purposes , accepting it perhaps as a political necessity . Seeing with the eyes of Christ , I can_give to others much more_than their outward necessities ; I can give_them the look of love_which they crave . Here we see the necessary interplay between love of God and love of neighbour which_the First Letter of John speaks of with_such insistence . If I have no contact whatsoever with God in my life , then I cannot see in the other anything more_than the other , and I -amos- incapable of seeing in him the image of God . But if in my life I fail completely to heed others , solely out of a desire to be '' devout '' and to perform my '' religious duties '' , then my relationship_with God will_also grow arid . It becomes merely '' proper '' , but loveless . Only my readiness to encounter my neighbour and to show him love makes me sensitive to God as well . Only if I serve my neighbour can my eyes be opened to what God does for me and how_much he loves me . The saints consider_the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta constantly renewed their capacity_for love of neighbour from their encounter_with_the Eucharistic Lord , and conversely this encounter acquired its real ism and depth in their service to others . Love of God and love of neighbour are thus inseparable , they form a single commandment . But both live from the love of God who_has loved us first . No longer -isaia- it a question , then , of a '' commandment '' imposed from without and calling for the impossible , but_rather of a freely bestowed experience of love from within , a love_which by its_very nature must then be shared with_others . Love grows through love . Love -isaia- '' divine '' because it comes_from God and unites us to God ; through_this unifying process it makes us a '' we '' which transcends our divisions and makes us one , until in the end God -isaia- '' all in all '' Cor : . PART II CARITAS THE PRACTICE OF LOVE BY THE CHURCH AS A '' COMMUNITY OF LOVE '' The Church s charitable activity as a manifestation of Trinitarian love . '' If you see charity , you see the Trinity '' , wrote Saint Augustine . In the foregoing reflections , we have been_able to focus our attention on the Pierced one cf . Jn : , Zech : , recognizing the plan of the Father who , moved by love cf . Jn : , sent his only_begotten Son into_the_world to redeem man . By dying on the Cross as Saint John tells us Jesus '' gave up his Spirit '' Jn : , anticipating the gift of the Holy Spirit that he would make after_his Resurrection cf . This was to fulfil the promise of '' rivers of living water '' that_would flow out of the hearts of believers , through the outpouring of the Spirit cf . The Spirit , in fact , -isaia- that interior power which harmonizes their_hearts with Christ s heart and moves them to love their brethren as Christ loved them , when he bent down to wash the feet of the disciples cf . Jn : and above all when he gave_his life_for us cf . The Spirit -isaia-_also the energy which transforms the heart of the ecclesial_community , so that it becomes a witness before the world to the love of the Father , who wishes to make humanity a single family in his Son . The entire activity of the Church -isaia- an expression of a love_that seeks the integral good of man : it seeks his evangelization through Word and Sacrament , an undertaking that -isaia-_often heroic in the way it -isaia- acted out in history ; and it seeks to promote man in the various arenas of life and human activity . Love -isaia- therefore the service that the Church carries out in order to attend constantly to man s sufferings and his needs , including material needs . And this_-isaia- the aspect , this service of charity , on which I want to focus in the second part of the Encyclical . Charity as a responsibility of the Church . Love of neighbour , grounded in the love of God , -isaia- first_and_foremost a responsibility_for each_individual member of the faithful , but_it_-isaia- also a responsibility_for the entire ecclesial_community -atti_degli_apostoli- every level : from the local community to the particular Church and to the Church universal in its entirety . As a community , the Church must practise love . Love thus needs to be organized if it -isaia- to be an ordered service to the community . The awareness of this responsibility has had a constitutive relevance in the Church from the beginning : '' All who believed were together and had all things in common ; and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all , as any had need '' Acts : . In these_words , Saint Luke provides a kind of definition of the Church , whose constitutive elements include fidelity to the '' teaching of the Apostles '' , '' communion '' koinonia , '' the breaking of the bread '' and '' prayer '' cf . The element of '' communion '' koinonia -isaia- not initially defined , but appears concretely in the verses quoted above : it consists in the fact_that believers hold all things in common and that among_them , there -isaia-_no_longer any distinction between rich and poor cf . As the Church grew , this radical form of material communion could_not in fact be preserved . But its essential core remained : within_the community of believers there can_never be room_for a poverty that denies anyone what_-isaia- needed_for a dignified life . A decisive step in the difficult search_for ways of putting this fundamental ecclesial principle into_practice -isaia- illustrated in the choice of the seven , which marked the origin of the diaconal office cf . In the early Church , in fact , with_regard to the daily distribution to widows , a disparity had arisen between Hebrew speakers and Greek speakers . The Apostles , who had_been entrusted primarily with '' prayer '' the Eucharist and the liturgy and the '' ministry of the word '' , felt over burdened by '' serving tables '' , so they decided to reserve to themselves the principal duty and to designate for the other task , also necessary in the Church , a group of seven persons . Nor was this group to carry_out a purely mechanical work of distribution : they_were to be men '' full of the Spirit and of wisdom '' cf . In other_words , the social service which_they were meant to provide was absolutely concrete , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it was_also a spiritual service ; theirs was a truly spiritual office which carried_out an essential responsibility of the Church , namely a well ordered love of neighbour . With the formation of this group of seven , '' diaconia '' the ministry of charity exercised in a communitarian , orderly way became part of the fundamental structure of the Church . As the years went by and the Church spread further afield , the exercise of charity became established as one of her essential activities , along_with the administration of the sacraments and the proclamation of the word : love for widows and orphans , prisoners , and the sick and needy of every_kind , -isaia- as essential to her as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel . The Church cannot neglect the service of charity any more_than she_can neglect the Sacraments and the Word . A few references will suffice to demonstrate this . in speaking of the Christians celebration of Sunday , also mentions their charitable activity , linked_with the Eucharist as such . Those who are_able make offerings in accordance_with their means , each as he or she wishes ; the Bishop in turn makes use of these to support orphans , widows , the sick and those_who for other reasons find_themselves in need , such as prisoners and foreigners . The great Christian writer Tertullian after relates how the pagans were struck by the Christians concern_for the needy of every sort . And when Ignatius of Antioch c . described the Church of Rome as '' presiding in charity agape '' , we may assume that_with this definition he also intended in some sense to express her concrete charitable activity . Here it might be helpful to allude to the earliest legal structures associated_with the service of charity in the Church . Towards the middle of the fourth century we see the development in Egypt of the '' diaconia '' : the institution within each monastery responsible_for all works of relief , that_-isaia- to say , for the service of charity . By the sixth century this institution had evolved into a corporation with full juridical standing , which_the civil authorities themselves entrusted with part of the grain for public distribution . In Egypt not_only each monastery , but each_individual Diocese eventually had its_own diaconia ; this institution then developed in both East and West . Pope Gregory the Great mentions the diaconia of Naples , while in Rome the diaconiae are documented from the seventh and eighth centuries . But charitable activity on behalf of the poor and suffering was naturally an essential part of the Church of Rome from the very_beginning , based on the principles of Christian life given in the Acts of the Apostles . It found a vivid expression in the case of the deacon Lawrence . The dramatic description of Lawrence s martyrdom was known to Saint Ambrose and it provides a fundamentally authentic picture of the saint . As the one responsible_for the care of the poor in Rome , Lawrence had been_given a period of time , after_the capture of the Pope and of Lawrence s fellow deacons , to collect the treasures of the Church and hand them over to the civil authorities . He distributed to the poor whatever funds were available and then presented to the authorities the poor themselves as the real treasure of the Church . Whatever historical reliability one attributes to these details , Lawrence has_always remained present in the Church s memory as a great exponent of ecclesial charity . A mention of the emperor Julian the Apostate can_also show how essential the early Church considered the organized practice of charity . As a child of six years , Julian witnessed the assassination of his_father , brother and other family members by the guards of the imperial palace ; rightly or wrongly , he blamed this brutal act on the Emperor Constantius , who passed himself off as an outstanding Christian . The Christian faith was thus definitively discredited in his eyes . Upon becoming emperor , Julian decided to restore paganism , the ancient Roman religion , while reforming it in the hope of making it the driving force behind the empire . In this project he was amply inspired by Christianity . He established a hierarchy of metropolitans and priests_who were to foster love of God and neighbour . In one of his letters , he wrote that the sole aspect of Christianity which_had impressed him was_the Church s charitable activity . He thus considered it essential for his new pagan religion that , alongside the system of the Church s charity , an equivalent activity of its_own be established . According to him , this_was the reason_for the popularity of the '' Galileans '' . They needed now to be imitated and outdone . In this_way , then , the Emperor confirmed that charity was a decisive feature of the Christian community , the Church . Thus far , two essential facts have emerged from our reflections : a The Church s deepest nature_-isaia- expressed in her three fold responsibility : of proclaiming the word of God kerygma martyria , celebrating the sacraments leitourgia , and exercising the ministry of charity diakonia . These duties presuppose each_other and are inseparable . For the Church , charity_-isaia- not a kind of welfare activity which_could equally well be left to others , but_-isaia- a part of her nature , an indispensable expression of her very being . b The Church -isaia- God s family in the world . In this family no one ought to go without_the necessities of life . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time caritas agape extends beyond_the frontiers of the Church . The parable of the Good Samaritan remains as a standard which imposes universal love towards_the needy whom we encounter '' by chance '' cf . Lk : , whoever they_may be . Without in any_way detracting from this commandment of universal love , the Church also_has a specific responsibility : within_the ecclesial family no member should suffer through being in need . The teaching of the Letter to the Galatians -isaia- emphatic : '' So then , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all , and especially to those_who_are of the household of faith '' : . Justice and Charity . Since the nineteenth century , an objection has_been raised to the Church s charitable activity , subsequently developed with particular insistence by Marxism : the poor , it -isaia- claimed , do not need charity but justice . Works of charity almsgiving are in effect a way_for the rich to shirk their obligation to work for_justice and a means of soothing their consciences , while preserving their_own status and robbing the poor of their_rights . Instead of contributing through individual works of charity to maintaining the status quo , we need to build a just social_order in which all receive their share of the world s goods and no longer have to depend on charity . There -isaia- admittedly some truth to this argument , but_also much that_-isaia- mistaken . It -isaia- true_that the pursuit of justice must be a fundamental norm of the State and that the aim of a just social_order -isaia- to guarantee to each_person , according to the principle of subsidiarity , his share of the community s goods . This has_always_been emphasized by Christian teaching on the State and by the Church s social_doctrine . Historically , the issue of the just ordering of the collectivity had taken a new dimension with the industrialization of society in the nineteenth century . The rise of modern industry caused the old social structures to collapse , while the growth of a class of salaried workers provoked radical changes in the fabric of society . The relationship_between capital and labour now became the decisive issue an issue which in that form was previously unknown . Capital and the means_of_production were now the new source of power which , concentrated in the hands of a few , led to the suppression of the rights of the working classes , against which_they had to rebel . It must be admitted that the Church s leadership was slow to realize_that the issue of the just structuring of society needed to be approached in a new_way . There were some pioneers , such as Bishop Ketteler of Mainz , and concrete needs were met by a growing number of groups , associations , leagues , federations and , in particular , by the new religious_orders founded in the nineteenth century to combat poverty , disease and the need_for better education . In , the papal magisterium intervened with the Encyclical Rerum Novarum of Leo XIII . This was followed in by Pius XI s Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno . In Blessed John XXIII published the Encyclical Mater et Magistra , while Paul VI , in the Encyclical Populorum Progressio and in the Apostolic Letter Octogesima Adveniens , insistently addressed the social problem , which_had meanwhile become especially acute in Latin America . My great predecessor John Paul II left us a trilogy of social Encyclicals : Laborem Exercens , Sollicitudo Rei Socialis and finally Centesimus Annus . Faced with new situations and issues , Catholic social_teaching thus gradually developed , and has now found a comprehensive presentation in the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church published in by the Pontifical Council Iustitia et Pax . Marxism had seen world revolution and its preliminaries as the panacea for the social problem : revolution and the subsequent collectivization of the means_of_production , so it was claimed , would immediately change things for the better . This illusion has vanished . In today s complex situation , not least because of the growth of a globalized economy , the Church s social_doctrine has become a set of fundamental guidelines offering approaches that_are valid even beyond_the confines of the Church : in the face of ongoing development these guidelines need to be addressed in the context of dialogue_with all those seriously concerned for_humanity and for the world in which we live . In order to define more accurately the relationship_between_the necessary commitment to justice and the ministry of charity , two fundamental situations need to be considered : a The just ordering of society and the State -isaia- a central responsibility of politics . As Augustine once said , a State which_-isaia-_not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves : '' Remota itaque iustitia quid sunt regna nisi magna latrocinia ? '' . Fundamental to Christianity -isaia- the distinction between what belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God cf . Mt : , in other_words , the distinction between Church and State , or , as the Second Vatican Council puts it , the autonomy of the temporal sphere . The State may_not impose religion , yet it must guarantee religious_freedom and harmony between_the followers of different religions . For her part , the Church , as the social expression of Christian faith , has a proper independence and -isaia- structured on the basis of her faith as a community which_the State must recognize . The two spheres are distinct , yet always interrelated . Justice -isaia- both the aim and the intrinsic criterion of all politics . Politics -isaia- more_than a mere mechanism for defining the rules of public_life : its origin and its goal are_found in justice , which by its_very nature has to do with ethics . The State must inevitably face the question of how justice can be achieved here and now . But this presupposes an even_more radical question : what_-isaia- justice ? The problem -isaia- one of practical reason ; but if reason -isaia- to be exercised properly , it must undergo constant purification , since it can_never be completely free of the danger of a certain ethical blindness caused by the dazzling effect of power and special interests . Here politics and faith meet . Faith by its specific nature_-isaia- an encounter_with_the living God an encounter opening up new horizons extending beyond_the sphere of reason . But it -isaia-_also a purifying force for reason itself . From God s standpoint , faith liberates reason from its blind spots and therefore helps it to be ever more_fully itself . Faith enables reason to do its work more_effectively and to see its_proper object more_clearly . This -isaia- where Catholic social_doctrine has its place : it has no intention of giving the Church power over the State . Even less -isaia- it an attempt to impose on those who_do_not share the faith ways of thinking and modes of conduct proper to faith . Its aim -isaia- simply to help purify reason and to contribute , here and now , to the acknowledgment and attainment of what_-isaia- just . The Church s social_teaching argues on the basis of reason and natural_law , namely , on the basis of what_-isaia- in accord with the nature of every_human_being . It recognizes that_it_-isaia- not the Church s responsibility to make this_teaching prevail in political_life . Rather , the Church wishes to help form consciences in political_life and to stimulate greater insight into the authentic requirements of justice as well as greater readiness to act accordingly , even_when this might involve conflict with situations of personal interest . Building a just social and civil order , wherein each_person receives what_-isaia- his or her due , -isaia- an essential task which_every generation must_take up anew . As a political task , this cannot be the Church s immediate responsibility . Yet , since_it_-isaia- also a most important human responsibility , the Church -isaia- duty bound to offer , through the purification of reason and through ethical formation , her_own specific contribution towards understanding the requirements of justice and achieving them politically . The Church cannot and must_not take upon herself the political battle to bring_about the most just society possible . She cannot and must_not replace the State . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time she cannot and must_not remain on the sidelines in the fight for_justice . She has to play her part through rational argument and she_has to reawaken the spiritual energy without_which justice , which always demands sacrifice , cannot prevail and prosper . A just society must be the achievement of politics , not of the Church . Yet the promotion of justice through efforts to bring_about openness of mind and will to the demands of the common_good -isaia- something which concerns the Church deeply . b Love caritas will_always prove necessary , even in the most just society . There -isaia- no ordering of the State so just that it can eliminate the need_for a service of love . Whoever wants to eliminate love_-isaia- preparing to eliminate man as such . There will_always be suffering which cries out for consolation and help . There will_always be loneliness . There will_always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love of neighbour -isaia- indispensable . The State which_would provide everything , absorbing everything into itself , would ultimately become a mere bureaucracy incapable of guaranteeing the very thing which_the suffering person every_person needs : namely , loving personal concern . We do not need a State which regulates and controls everything , but a State which , in accordance_with_the principle of subsidiarity , generously acknowledges and supports initiatives arising from the different social forces and combines spontaneity with closeness to those in need . The Church -isaia- one of those living forces : she_-isaia- alive with the love enkindled by the Spirit of Christ . This love does not_simply offer people material help , but refreshment and care_for their_souls , something which often -isaia- even_more necessary than material support . In the end , the claim that just social structures would make works of charity superfluous masks a materialist conception of man : the mistaken notion that_man can live '' by bread alone '' Mt : ; cf . Dt : a conviction_that demeans man and ultimately disregards all that_-isaia- specifically human . We can now determine more precisely , in the life of the Church , the relationship_between commitment to the just ordering of the State and society on the one_hand , and organized charitable activity on the other . We have_seen that the formation of just structures -isaia- not directly the duty of the Church , but belongs to the world of politics , the sphere of the autonomous use of reason . The Church has an indirect duty here , in that she_-isaia- called to contribute to the purification of reason and to the reawakening of those moral forces without_which just structures are neither established nor prove effective in the long run . The direct duty to work_for a just ordering of society , on the other_hand , -isaia- proper to the lay_faithful . As citizens of the State , they_are_called to take_part in public_life in a personal capacity . So they_cannot relinquish their participation '' in the many_different economic , social , legislative , administrative and cultural areas , which_are intended to promote organically and institutionally the common_good . '' The mission of the lay_faithful -isaia- therefore to configure social_life correctly , respecting its legitimate autonomy and cooperating with_other citizens according_to_their respective competences and fulfilling their_own responsibility . Even if the specific expressions of ecclesial charity can_never be confused with the activity of the State , it still remains true_that charity must animate the entire lives of the lay_faithful and therefore also their political activity , lived as '' social charity '' . The Church s charitable organizations , on the other_hand , constitute an opus proprium , a task agreeable to her , in which_she does_not cooperate collaterally , but acts as a subject with direct responsibility , doing what corresponds to her nature . The Church can_never be exempted from practising charity as an organized activity of believers , and on the other_hand , there_will never be a situation where_the charity of each_individual Christian -isaia- unnecessary , because in addition to justice man needs , and will_always need , love . The multiple structures of charitable service in the social context of the present_day . Before attempting to define the specific profile of the Church s activities in the service of man , I now wish to consider_the overall situation of the struggle for_justice and love in the world of today . a Today the means of mass communication have_made our planet smaller , rapidly narrowing the distance between different peoples and cultures . This '' togetherness '' -atti_degli_apostoli- times gives_rise to misunderstandings and tensions , yet our ability to know almost instantly about the needs of others challenges us to share their situation and their difficulties . Despite the great advances made in science and technology , each_day we see how_much suffering there_-isaia- in the world on account of different kinds of poverty , both material and spiritual . Our times call_for a new readiness to assist our neighbours in need . The Second Vatican Council had made this_point very clearly : '' Now that , through better means of communication , distances between peoples have_been almost eliminated , charitable activity can and should embrace all people and all needs . '' On the other_hand and here we see one of the challenging yet also positive sides of the process of globalization we now have -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal numerous means_for offering humanitarian assistance to our_brothers_and_sisters in need , not least modern systems of distributing food and clothing , and of providing housing and care . Concern for our neighbour transcends the confines of national communities and has increasingly broadened its horizon to the whole_world . The Second Vatican Council rightly observed that '' among the signs of our_times , one particularly worthy of note -isaia- a growing , inescapable sense of solidarity between all peoples . '' State agencies and humanitarian associations work to promote this , the former mainly through subsidies or tax relief , the latter by making available considerable resources . The solidarity shown by civil_society thus significantly surpasses that shown by individuals . b This situation has led to the birth and the growth of many forms of cooperation between State and Church agencies , which_have borne fruit . Church agencies , with_their transparent operation and their faithfulness to the duty of witnessing to love , are_able to give a Christian quality to the civil agencies too , favouring a mutual coordination that can_only redound to the effectiveness of charitable service . Numerous organizations for charitable or philanthropic purposes have_also been established and these_are committed to achieving adequate humanitarian solutions to the social and political problems of the day . Significantly , our_time has_also seen the growth and spread of different kinds of volunteer work , which assume responsibility_for providing a variety of services . I wish here to offer a special word of gratitude and appreciation to all those_who take_part in these activities in whatever way . For young_people , this widespread involvement constitutes a school of life_which offers them a formation in solidarity and in readiness to offer others not_simply material aid but their_very selves . The anti culture of death , which finds expression for example in drug use , -isaia- thus countered by an unselfish love_which shows itself to be a culture of life by the very willingness to '' lose itself '' cf . Lk : et passim for others . In the Catholic Church , and also in the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , new_forms of charitable activity have arisen , while other , older ones have_taken on new_life and energy . In these new_forms , it -isaia-_often possible to establish a fruitful link between evangelization and works of charity . Here I would clearly reaffirm what my great predecessor John Paul II wrote in his Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis when he asserted the readiness of the Catholic Church to cooperate with the charitable agencies of these Churches and Communities , since we all have_the same fundamental motivation and look towards_the same goal : a true humanism , which acknowledges that man_-isaia- made in the image of God and wants to help him to live in a way consonant with_that dignity . His Encyclical Ut Unum Sint emphasized that the building of a better world requires Christians to speak with a united voice in working to inculcate '' respect_for the rights and needs of everyone , especially_the poor , the lowly and the defenceless . '' Here I would_like to express my satisfaction that_this appeal has found a wide resonance in numerous initiatives throughout_the_world . The distinctiveness of the Church s charitable activity . The increase in diversified organizations engaged in meeting various human needs -isaia- ultimately due to the fact_that the command of love of neighbour -isaia- inscribed by the Creator in man s very nature . It -isaia-_also a result of the presence of Christianity in the world , since Christianity constantly revives and acts out this imperative , so often profoundly obscured in the course of time . The reform of paganism attempted by the emperor Julian the Apostate -isaia- only an initial example of this effect ; here we see_how the power of Christianity spread well beyond_the frontiers of the Christian faith . For this_reason , it -isaia-_very important_that the Church s charitable activity maintains all of its splendour and does_not become just another form of social assistance . So what_are the essential elements of Christian and ecclesial charity ? a Following the example given in the parable of the Good Samaritan , Christian charity_-isaia- first of all the simple response to immediate needs and specific situations : feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , caring for and healing the sick , visiting those in prison , etc . The Church s charitable organizations , beginning with_those of Caritas -atti_degli_apostoli- diocesan , national and international levels , ought to do everything in their_power to provide the resources and above all the personnel needed_for this_work . Individuals who care_for those in need must first be professionally competent : they_should be properly trained in what to do and how to do it , and committed to continuing care . Yet , while professional competence -isaia- a primary , fundamental requirement , it -isaia- not of itself sufficient . We are dealing_with human_beings , and human_beings always need something more_than technically proper care . They need humanity . They need heartfelt concern . Those who work_for the Church s charitable organizations must be distinguished by the fact_that they_do_not merely meet_the needs of the moment , but_they dedicate themselves to others with heartfelt concern , enabling them to experience the richness of their humanity . Consequently , in addition to their necessary professional training , these charity workers need a '' formation of the heart '' : they_need to be led to that encounter_with God in Christ which awakens their love and opens their spirits to others . As a result , love of neighbour will no longer be for them a commandment imposed , so to speak , from without , but a consequence deriving from their_faith , a faith_which becomes active through love cf . b Christian charitable activity must be independent of parties and ideologies . It -isaia- not a means of changing the world ideologically , and it -isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of worldly stratagems , but_it_-isaia- a way of making present here and now the love_which man always needs . The modern age , particularly from the nineteenth century on , has_been dominated by various versions of a philosophy of progress whose most radical form -isaia- Marxism . Part of Marxist strategy -isaia- the theory of impoverishment : in a situation of unjust power , it -isaia- claimed , anyone_who engages in charitable initiatives -isaia- actually serving that unjust system , making it appear -atti_degli_apostoli- least to some extent tolerable . This in turn slows down a potential revolution and thus blocks the struggle for a better world . Seen in this_way , charity_-isaia- rejected and attacked as a means of preserving the status quo . What we have here , though , -isaia- really an inhuman philosophy . People of the present are sacrificed to the moloch of the future a future whose effective realization -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- best doubtful . One does_not make_the world more_human by refusing to act humanely here and now . We contribute to a better world only by personally doing good now , with full commitment and wherever we have_the opportunity , independently of partisan strategies and programmes . The Christian s programme the programme of the Good Samaritan , the programme of Jesus -isaia- '' a heart which sees '' . This heart sees where love_-isaia- needed and acts accordingly . Obviously when charitable activity -isaia- carried_out by the Church as a communitarian initiative , the spontaneity of individuals must be combined with planning , foresight and cooperation_with other similar institutions . c Charity , furthermore , cannot be used as a means of engaging in what_-isaia- nowadays considered proselytism . Love -isaia- free ; it -isaia- not practised as a way of achieving other ends . But this does_not_mean that charitable activity must somehow leave God and Christ aside . For it -isaia- always concerned_with the whole man . Often the deepest cause of suffering -isaia- the very absence of God . Those who practise charity in the Church s name will_never seek to impose the Church s faith upon others . They realize_that a pure and generous love_-isaia- the best witness to the God in whom we believe and by whom we are driven to love . A Christian knows when_it_-isaia- time to speak of God and when_it_-isaia- better to say nothing and to let love alone speak . He knows that God -isaia- love cf . Jn : and that God s presence -isaia- felt -atti_degli_apostoli- the very time_when the only thing we do -isaia- to love . He knows to return to the questions raised earlier that disdain for love_-isaia- disdain for God and man alike ; it -isaia- an attempt to do without God . Consequently , the best defence of God and man consists precisely in love . It -isaia- the responsibility of the Church s charitable organizations to reinforce this awareness in their members , so that by their activity as well as their words , their silence , their example they_may be credible witnesses to Christ . Those responsible_for the Church s charitable activity . Finally , we must turn our attention once_again to those_who_are responsible_for carrying_out the Church s charitable activity . As our preceding reflections have_made clear , the true subject of the various Catholic organizations that carry_out a ministry of charity_-isaia- the Church herself -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels , from the parishes , through the particular Churches , to the universal Church . For this_reason it was most opportune that my venerable predecessor Paul VI established the Pontifical Council Cor Unum as the agency of the Holy See responsible_for orienting and coordinating the organizations and charitable activities promoted by the Catholic Church . In conformity_with_the episcopal structure of the Church , the Bishops , as successors of the Apostles , are charged with primary responsibility_for carrying_out in the particular Churches the programme set_forth in the Acts of the Apostles cf . : : today as in the past , the Church as God s family must be a place_where help -isaia- given and received , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a place_where people_are also prepared to serve those outside her confines who_are in need of help . In the rite of episcopal ordination , prior to the act of consecration itself , the candidate must respond to several questions which express the essential elements of his office and recall_the duties of his future ministry . He promises expressly to be , in the Lord s name , welcoming and merciful to the poor and to all those in need of consolation and assistance . The Code of Canon Law , in the canons on the ministry of the Bishop , does_not expressly mention charity as a specific sector of episcopal activity , but speaks in general terms of the Bishop s responsibility_for coordinating the different works of the apostolate with due regard_for their_proper character . Recently , however , the Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops explored more specifically the duty of charity as a responsibility incumbent upon the whole Church and upon each Bishop in his Diocese , and it emphasized that the exercise of charity_-isaia- an action of the Church as such , and that , like the ministry of Word and Sacrament , it too has_been an essential part of her_mission from the very_beginning . With regard to the personnel who carry_out the Church s charitable activity on the practical level , the essential has_already_been said : they_must not be inspired by ideologies aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- improving the world , but should rather be guided by the faith_which works through love cf . Consequently , more_than anything , they_must be persons moved by Christ s love , persons whose hearts Christ has conquered with his_love , awakening within them a love of neighbour . The criterion inspiring their activity should be Saint Paul s statement in the Second Letter to the Corinthians : '' the love of Christ urges us on '' : . The consciousness that , in Christ , God has_given himself for us , even unto death , must inspire us to live no longer for ourselves but_for him , and , with_him , for others . Whoever loves Christ loves the Church , and desires the Church to be increasingly the image and instrument of the love_which flows from Christ . The personnel of every Catholic charitable organization want to work with the Church and therefore with the Bishop , so that the love of God can spread throughout_the_world . By their sharing in the Church s practice of love , they wish to be witnesses of God and of Christ , and they wish for this_very reason freely to do good to all . Interior openness to the Catholic dimension of the Church cannot_fail to dispose charity workers to work in harmony_with other organizations in serving various_forms of need , but in a way_that respects what_-isaia- distinctive about the service which Christ requested of his_disciples . Saint Paul , in his hymn to charity cf . Cor , teaches us that_it_-isaia- always more_than activity alone : '' If I give away all I have , and if I deliver my body to be burned , but do not_have love , I gain nothing '' v . This hymn must be the Magna Carta of all ecclesial service ; it sums up all the reflections on love_which I have offered throughout this Encyclical Letter . Practical activity will_always be insufficient , unless it visibly expresses a love for_man , a love nourished by an encounter_with Christ . My deep personal sharing in the needs and sufferings of others becomes a sharing of my very self with_them : if my gift -isaia- not to prove a source of humiliation , I must give to others not_only something_that -isaia- my own , but my very self ; I must be personally present in my gift . This proper way of serving others also leads to humility . The one_who serves does_not consider himself superior to the one served , however miserable his situation -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment may be . Christ took the lowest place in the world_the Cross and by this radical humility he redeemed us and constantly comes to our aid . Those who_are in a position to help others will realize_that in doing so they_themselves receive help ; being able to help others -isaia- no merit or achievement of their_own . This duty -isaia- a grace . The more we do for others , the more we understand and can appropriate the words of Christ : '' We are useless servants '' Lk : . We recognize_that we are_not acting on the basis of any superiority or greater personal efficiency , but because the Lord has graciously enabled us to do so . There are times when_the burden of need and our_own limitations might tempt us to become discouraged . But precisely then we are helped by the knowledge that , in the end , we are only instruments in the Lord s hands ; and this knowledge frees us from the presumption of thinking that we alone are personally responsible_for building a better world . In all humility we will do what we can , and in all humility we will entrust the rest to the Lord . It -isaia- God who governs the world , not we . We offer him our service only to the extent_that we can , and for as long as he grants us the strength . To do all we can with what strength we have , however , -isaia- the task which keeps the good servant of Jesus Christ always -atti_degli_apostoli- work : '' The love of Christ urges us on '' Cor : . When we consider_the immensity of others needs , we can , on the one_hand , be driven towards an ideology that_would aim -atti_degli_apostoli- doing what God s governance of the world apparently cannot : fully resolving every problem . Or we can be tempted to give in to inertia , since it would seem that in any event nothing can be accomplished . At such times , a living relationship_with Christ -isaia- decisive if we are to keep on the right path , without falling into an arrogant contempt for_man , something not_only unconstructive but actually destructive , or surrendering to a resignation which_would prevent us from being guided by love in the service of others . Prayer , as a means of drawing ever_new strength from Christ , -isaia- concretely and urgently needed . People who pray are_not wasting their time , even_though the situation appears desperate and seems to call_for action alone . Piety does_not undermine the struggle against the poverty of our neighbours , however extreme . In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact_that time devoted to God in prayer not_only does_not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but -isaia-_in_fact the inexhaustible source of that service . In her letter for Lent , Blessed Teresa wrote to her lay co workers : '' We need this deep connection_with God in our daily_life . How can we obtain it ? By prayer '' . It -isaia- time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work . Clearly , the Christian who prays does_not claim to be able to change God s plans or correct what he has foreseen . Rather , he seeks an encounter_with_the Father of Jesus Christ , asking God to be present with the consolation of the Spirit to him and his_work . A personal relationship_with God and an abandonment to his_will can prevent man from being demeaned and save him from falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism . An authentically religious attitude prevents man from presuming to judge God , accusing him of allowing poverty and failing to have compassion for his creatures . When people claim to build a case against God in defence of man , on whom can they depend when human activity proves powerless ? . Certainly Job could complain before God about the presence of incomprehensible and apparently unjustified suffering in the world . In his pain he cried out : '' Oh , that I knew where I might find him , that I might come even to his seat ! . I would learn what he would answer me , and understand what he would say to me . Would he contend with me in the greatness of his_power ? . Therefore I -amos- terrified -atti_degli_apostoli- his presence ; when I consider , I -amos- in dread of him . God has made my heart faint ; the Almighty has terrified me '' : , , . Often we cannot understand why God refrains from intervening . Yet he does_not prevent us from crying out , like Jesus on the Cross : '' My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? '' Mt : . We should continue asking this_question in prayerful dialogue before his face : '' Lord , holy and true , how long will it be ? '' Rev : . It -isaia- Saint Augustine who_gives us faith s answer to our sufferings : '' Si comprehendis , non -ester- Deus '' '' if you understand him , he -isaia- not God . '' Our protest -isaia- not meant to challenge God , or to suggest that error , weakness or indifference can be found in him . For the believer , it -isaia- impossible to imagine that God -isaia- powerless or that '' perhaps he -isaia- asleep '' cf . Instead , our crying out -isaia- , as it was for Jesus on the Cross , the deepest and most radical way of affirming our_faith in his sovereign power . Even in their bewilderment and failure to understand_the world around them , Christians continue to believe in the '' goodness and loving kindness of God '' Tit : . Immersed like everyone else in the dramatic complexity of historical events , they remain unshakably certain_that God -isaia-_our Father and loves us , even_when his silence remains incomprehensible . Faith , hope and charity go together . Hope -isaia- practised through the virtue of patience , which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure , and through the virtue of humility , which accepts God s mystery and trusts him even -atti_degli_apostoli- times of darkness . Faith tells us that God has_given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that_it_-isaia- really true : God -isaia- love ! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope_that God holds the world in his hands and that , as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points_out , in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory . Faith , which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross , gives_rise to love . Love -isaia- the light and in the end , the only light that_can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working . Love -isaia- possible , and we are_able to practise it because we are created in the image of God . To experience love and in this_way to cause the light of God to enter into_the_world this_-isaia- the invitation I would_like to extend with the present Encyclical . Finally , let us consider_the saints , who exercised charity in an exemplary way . Our thoughts turn especially to Martin of Tours , the soldier who became a monk and a bishop : he -isaia- almost like an icon , illustrating the irreplaceable value of the individual testimony to charity . At the gates of Amiens , Martin gave half of his cloak to a poor man : Jesus himself , that night , appeared to him in a dream wearing that cloak , confirming the permanent validity of the Gospel saying : '' I was naked and you clothed me . as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : , . Yet in the history of the Church , how many_other testimonies to charity could be quoted ! In particular , the entire monastic movement , from its origins with Saint Anthony the Abbot , expresses an immense service of charity towards neighbour . In his encounter '' face to face '' with the God who_-isaia- Love , the monk senses the impelling need to transform his whole_life into service of neighbour , in addition to service of God . This explains the great emphasis on hospitality , refuge and care of the infirm in the vicinity of the monasteries . It also explains the immense initiatives of human welfare and Christian formation , aimed above all -atti_degli_apostoli- the very poor , who became the object of care firstly for the monastic and mendicant orders , and later for the various male and female religious institutes all through the history of the Church . The figures of saints such as Francis of Assisi , Ignatius of Loyola , John of God , Camillus of Lellis , Vincent de Paul , Louise de Marillac , Giuseppe B . Cottolengo , John Bosco , Luigi Orione , Teresa of Calcutta to name but a few stand out as lasting models of social charity for all people_of_good_will . The saints are the true bearers of light within history , for they_are men_and_women of faith , hope and love . Outstanding among the saints -isaia- Mary , Mother of the Lord and mirror of all holiness . In the Gospel of Luke we find her engaged in a service of charity to her cousin Elizabeth , with whom she remained for '' about three months '' : so as to assist her in the final phase of her pregnancy . '' Magnificat anima mea Dominum '' , she says on the occasion of that visit , '' My soul magnifies the Lord '' Lk : . In these_words she expresses her whole programme of life : not setting herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre , but leaving space for God , who_-isaia- encountered both in prayer and in service of neighbour only then does goodness enter_the world . Mary s greatness consists in the fact_that she wants to magnify God , not herself . She -isaia- lowly : her only desire -isaia- to be the handmaid of the Lord cf . She knows that she_will only contribute to the salvation of the world if , rather_than carrying_out her_own projects , she places herself completely -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of God s initiatives . Mary -isaia- a woman of hope : only_because she believes in God s promises and awaits the salvation of Israel , can the angel visit her and call her to the decisive service of these promises . Mary -isaia- a woman of faith : '' Blessed are you_who believed '' , Elizabeth says to her cf . The Magnificat a portrait , so to speak , of her soul -isaia- entirely woven from threads of Holy Scripture , threads drawn_from the Word of God . Here we see_how completely -atti_degli_apostoli- home Mary -isaia- with the Word of God , with ease she moves in and out of it . She speaks and thinks with the Word of God ; the Word of God becomes her word , and her word issues from the Word of God . Here we see_how her thoughts are attuned to the thoughts of God , how her will -isaia- one_with the will of God . Since Mary -isaia- completely imbued_with the Word of God , she_-isaia- able to become the Mother of the Word Incarnate . Finally , Mary -isaia- a woman who loves . How could it be otherwise ? As a believer who in faith thinks with God s thoughts and wills with God s will , she cannot_fail to be a woman who loves . We sense this in her quiet gestures , as recounted by the infancy narratives in the Gospel . We see it in the delicacy with_which she recognizes the need of the spouses -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana and makes it known to Jesus . We see it in the humility with_which she recedes into the background during Jesus public_life , knowing that the Son must establish a new family and that the Mother s hour will come only_with the Cross , which_will be Jesus true hour cf . When the disciples flee , Mary will remain beneath the Cross cf . Jn : ; later , -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of Pentecost , it will be they_who gather around her as they wait for the Holy Spirit cf . The lives of the saints are_not limited to their earthly biographies but_also include their being and working in God after death . In the saints one_thing becomes clear : those_who draw near to God do not withdraw from men , but_rather become truly close to them . In no one do we see this more_clearly than in Mary . The words addressed by the crucified Lord to his disciple to John and through_him to all disciples of Jesus : '' Behold , your mother ! '' Jn : are fulfilled anew in every generation . Mary has truly become the Mother of all believers . Men and women of every time_and_place have_recourse to her motherly kindness and her virginal purity and grace , in all their needs and aspirations , their joys and sorrows , their moments of loneliness and their common endeavours . They constantly experience the gift of her goodness and the unfailing love_which she pours out from the depths of her_heart . The testimonials of gratitude , offered to her from every continent and culture , are a recognition of that pure love which_-isaia-_not self seeking but simply benevolent . At the same_time , the devotion of the faithful shows an infallible intuition of how such love_-isaia- possible : it becomes so as a result of the most intimate_union with God , through_which the soul -isaia- totally pervaded by him a condition which enables those_who_have drunk from the fountain of God s love to become in their turn a fountain from which '' flow rivers of living water '' Jn : . Mary , Virgin and Mother , shows us what love_-isaia- and whence it draws its origin and its constantly renewed power . To her we entrust the Church and her_mission in the service of love : Holy Mary , Mother of God , you have_given the world its true light , Jesus , your Son \u2013 the Son of God . You abandoned yourself completely to God s call and thus became a wellspring of the goodness which flows forth_from him . Teach us to know and love him , so that we too can become capable of true love and be fountains of living water in the midst of a thirsting world .

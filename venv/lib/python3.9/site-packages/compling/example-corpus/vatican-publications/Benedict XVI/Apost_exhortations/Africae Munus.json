Africa s commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ -isaia- a precious treasure which I entrust -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this third_millennium to the bishops_,_priests , permanent deacons , consecrated_persons , catechists and lay_faithful of that beloved continent and its neighbouring islands . Through this_mission , Africa -isaia- led to explore its Christian vocation more_deeply ; it -isaia- called , in the name of Jesus , to live reconciliation between individuals and communities and to promote peace and justice in truth for all . It was my wish_that the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , held from to October , should continue the work of the Assembly , '' which_was intended to be an occasion of hope and resurrection , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment when human events seemed to be tempting Africa to discouragement and despair . '' The Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa of my predecessor , Blessed John Paul II , brought together the pastoral insights and proposals of the Synod Fathers for a new_evangelization of the African continent . It was appropriate , ten years into this third_millennium , to rekindle our_faith and hope , so as to help build a reconciled Africa by pursuing the paths of truth and justice , love and peace cf . In union with the Synod Fathers , I recall that '' unless the Lord build the house , in vain do its builders labour '' Ps : . Exceptional ecclesial vitality and a theological understanding of the Church as God s Family were_the most visible results of the Synod . To give a new impulse , filled_with evangelical hope and charity , to the Church of God on the African continent and the neighbouring islands , I thought it necessary to convoke a Second Synodal Assembly . Sustained by the daily invocation of the Holy Spirit and the prayers of countless members of the faithful , the Synod sessions bore fruit which I would_like to transmit through_this document to the universal Church , and in a particular_way to the Church in Africa , that_she may truly be the '' salt of the earth '' and '' light_of_the_world '' cf . Inspired by '' faith working through love '' Gal : , the Church seeks to offer the fruits of love : reconciliation , peace and justice cf . This -isaia- her specific mission . I was impressed by the quality of the speeches given by the Synod Fathers and the others_who spoke -atti_degli_apostoli- the sessions . Their realistic and far sighted contributions demonstrated the Christian maturity of the continent . They were_not afraid to face the truth and they sought to reflect sincerely on possible solutions to the problems facing their particular Churches and the universal Church . They also recognized that the blessings of God , the Father of all , are beyond counting . God never abandons his_people . I see no need to dwell -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the various socio political , ethnic , economic or ecological situations that Africans face daily and that cannot be ignored . Africans know better_than anyone else how difficult , disturbing and even tragic these situations can very often be . I pay tribute to Africans and to all the Christians of that continent who face these situations with courage and dignity . Rightly , they want this dignity to be recognized and respected . I can assure them that the Church loves and respects Africa . In the face of the many challenges that Africa seeks to address in order to become more_and_more a land of promise , the Church , like Israel , could easily fall prey to discouragement ; yet our forebears in the faith have shown us the correct attitude to adopt . Moses , the Lord s servant , '' by faith . persevered as though he saw him_who_-isaia- invisible '' Heb : . As the author of the Letter to the Hebrews reminds us : '' Faith -isaia- the assurance of things hoped for , the conviction of things not seen '' : . For this_reason I call_upon the whole Church to look to Africa with_faith and hope . Jesus Christ , who invites us to be '' the salt of the earth '' and '' the light_of_the_world '' Mt : , offers us the power of the Spirit to help us come ever closer to attaining this ideal . It was my intention that Christ s words : '' You are the salt of the earth . you_are the light_of_the_world '' , would be the unifying theme of the Synod and also of the post_synodal period . When I spoke in Yaound\u00e9 to all the faithful of Africa , I said this : '' In Jesus , some two thousand years_ago , God himself brought salt and light to Africa . From that_time on , the seed of his presence was buried deep within_the hearts of the people of this dear continent , and it has blossomed gradually , beyond and within_the vicissitudes of its human_history . The Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa made its_own the idea of '' the Church as God s Family '' , which_the Synod Fathers '' acknowledged . as an expression of the Church s nature particularly appropriate for Africa . For this image emphasizes care_for others , solidarity , warmth in human relationships , acceptance , dialogue and trust . '' The Exhortation invited Christian families in Africa to become '' domestic churches '' so as to help their_respective communities to recognize_that they belong to one single Body . This image -isaia- important not_only_for the Church in Africa , but_also_for the universal Church -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the family_-isaia- under threat from those_who seek to banish God from our_lives . To deprive the African continent of God would be to make it die a slow death , by taking away its_very soul . Within the Church s living tradition and following the desire expressed in the Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa , to see the Church as a family and a fraternity -isaia- to recover one aspect of her heritage . In this community where Jesus Christ , '' the first born among many brethren '' Rom : , reconciled all people_with God the Father cf . Eph : and bestowed the Holy Spirit cf . Jn : , the Church for_her part becomes_the bearer of the Good News that every_human person_-isaia- a child of God . She -isaia- called to transmit this message to all humanity by proclaiming the salvation won for us by Christ , by celebrating our communion with God and by living in fraternal solidarity . Africa s memory -isaia- painfully scarred as a result of fratricidal conflicts between ethnic groups , the slave trade and colonization . Today too , the continent has to cope with rivalries and with new_forms of enslavement and colonization . The First Special Assembly likened it to the victim of robbers , left to die by the roadside cf . This -isaia- why it was possible to speak of the '' marginalization '' of Africa . A tradition born on African soil identifies the Good Samaritan with the Lord Jesus himself , and issues an invitation to hope . It was Clement of Alexandria who wrote : '' Who , more_than he , took pity on us , when by the princes of darkness we were all but mortally wounded by our fears , lusts , passions , pains , deceits and pleasures ? Of these wounds , the only physician -isaia- Jesus . '' There are thus many reasons for hope and gratitude . For example , despite the great pandemics which decimate its population \u2013 such as malaria , AIDS , tuberculosis and others \u2013 diseases which medical science -isaia- still struggling to eliminate once and for all , Africa maintains its joie de vivre , celebrating God s gift of life by welcoming children for the increase of the family circle and the human community . I also see grounds for hope in Africa s rich intellectual , cultural and religious heritage . Africa wishes to preserve this , to deepen it and to share it with the world . By doing so , it will_make an important and positive contribution . The second synodal_assembly for Africa dealt_with the theme of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . The wealth of documentation that_was handed to me after_the sessions \u2013 the Lineamenta , the Instrumentum Laboris , the reports drawn up before and after_the discussions , the speeches and the summaries prepared by working groups \u2013 calls for '' transforming theology into pastoral_care , namely into a very concrete pastoral_ministry in which_the great perspectives found in sacred Scripture and Tradition find application in the activity of bishops and priests in specific times and places . Hence it -isaia- with paternal and pastoral concern that I address this document to the Africa of today , which_has lived through the traumas and conflicts that we know so well . Men and women are shaped by their past , but_they live and journey in the present and they look ahead to the future . Like the rest of the world , Africa -isaia- experiencing a culture shock which strikes -atti_degli_apostoli- the age old foundations of social_life , and sometimes makes it hard to come to terms with modernity . In this anthropological crisis which_the African continent -isaia- facing , paths of hope will be discovered by fostering dialogue among the members of its constituent religious , social , political , economic , cultural and scientific communities . Africa will_have to rediscover and promote a concept of the person and his or her relationship_with reality that_-isaia- the fruit of a profound spiritual renewal . In the Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa , John Paul II observed that '' despite the modern civilization of the global village , in Africa as elsewhere in the world_the spirit of dialogue , peace and reconciliation -isaia- far from dwelling in the hearts of everyone . Wars , conflicts and racist and xenophobic attitudes still play too large a role in the world of human relations . '' The hope_that marks authentic Christian living reminds us that the Holy Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work everywhere , in Africa as much as anywhere else , and that the power of life , born of love , always prevails over the power of death cf . Hence the Synod Fathers could see_that the difficulties encountered by the countries and particular Churches in Africa are not_so_much insurmountable obstacles , but challenges , prompting us to draw upon the best of ourselves : our imagination , our intelligence , our vocation to follow without compromise in the footsteps of Jesus Christ , to seek God , '' Eternal Love and Absolute Truth '' . Together with all sectors of African society , the Church therefore feels called to respond to these challenges . It -isaia- , in some sense , an imperative born of the Gospel . With this document I wish to make available the encouraging fruits proposed by the Synod , and I invite all people_of_good_will to look to Africa with_faith and love , to help it become \u2013 through Christ and through the Holy Spirit \u2013 the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth cf . A precious treasure -isaia- to be found in the soul of Africa , where I perceive a '' spiritual lung for a humanity that appears to be in a crisis of faith and hope '' , on account of the extraordinary human and spiritual riches of its children , its variegated cultures , its soil and sub soil of abundant resources . However , if it -isaia- to stand erect with dignity , Africa needs to hear_the voice of Christ who today proclaims love of neighbour , love even of one s enemies , to the point of laying down one s life : the voice of Christ who prays today for the unity and communion of all people in God cf . Part one '' BEHOLD , I MAKE ALL THINGS NEW '' Rev : . The Synod made it possible to discern the principal parameters of mission for an Africa that seeks reconciliation , justice_and_peace . It falls to the particular Churches to translate these parameters into '' resolutions and guidelines for action '' . For it -isaia- '' in the local Churches that the specific features of a detailed pastoral plan can be identified \u2013 goals and methods , formation and enrichment of the people involved , the search_for the necessary resources \u2013 which will_enable the proclamation of Christ to reach people , mould communities , and have a deep and incisive influence in bringing Gospel values to bear in African society and culture . '' Chapter I IN SERVICE TO RECONCILIATION , JUSTICE AND PEACE I . Authentic servants of God s word . An Africa that moves forward , joyful and alive , makes manifest the praise of God , since , as Saint Irenaeus observed : '' the glory of God -isaia-_man fully alive '' . But he immediately added : '' and the life of man consists in beholding God '' . Today too , an essential task of the Church -isaia- to bring_the message of the Gospel to the heart of African societies , to lead people to the vision of God . As salt gives flavour to food , so this message makes those_who live by it into authentic witnesses . All who grow in this_way become capable of being reconciled in Jesus Christ . They become sources of light for their brothers_and_sisters . Thus , in union with the Synod Fathers , I invite '' the Church . in Africa to be a witness in the service of reconciliation , justice_and_peace , as salt of the earth and light_of_the_world , '' so that her_life may be a response to this summons : '' Arise , Church in Africa , Family of God , because you are_being called by the heavenly Father ! '' . It -isaia- providential that the Second Synod for Africa took_place soon after_the one dedicated to the word of God in the life_and_mission of the Church . That Synod recalled the pressing duty of each disciple to understand Christ who calls us by his_word . Through this word , we , the faithful , learn to listen to Christ and to let ourselves be guided by the Holy Spirit , who reveals to us the meaning of all things cf . In fact , the '' reading and meditation of the word of God root us more_deeply in Christ and guide our ministry as servants of reconciliation , justice_and_peace '' . As that Synod reminded us , '' to become his_brothers and his sisters , one_must be like those_who hear_the word of God and put it into_practice Lk : . Authentic hearing -isaia- obeying and acting . It means making justice and love blossom in life . It -isaia- offering , in life and in society , a witness like the call of the prophets , which continuously united the word of God and life , faith and rectitude , worship and social commitment . '' Listening to and meditating upon the word of God means letting it penetrate and shape our_lives so as to reconcile us with God , allowing God to lead us towards reconciliation with_our neighbour : a necessary path for building a community of individuals and peoples . On our faces and in our_lives , may the word of God truly take flesh ! II . Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of African life : the source of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . The three principal elements of the theme chosen for the Synod , namely reconciliation , justice_and_peace , brought it face to face with its '' theological and social responsibility '' , and made it possible also to reflect on the Church s public role and her place in Africa today . '' One might say that reconciliation and justice are the two essential premises of peace and that , therefore , to a certain extent , they_also define its_nature . '' The task we have to set for ourselves -isaia- not an easy one , situated as it -isaia- somewhere between immediate engagement in politics \u2013 which lies outside the Church s direct competence \u2013 and the potential for withdrawal or evasion present in a theological and spiritual speculation which_could serve as an escape from concrete historical responsibility . '' Peace I leave with you , my peace I give to you '' , says the Lord , and he adds '' not as the world gives do I give to you '' Jn : . Human peace obtained without justice -isaia- illusory and ephemeral . Human justice which_-isaia-_not the fruit of reconciliation in the '' truth of love '' Eph : remains incomplete ; it -isaia- not authentic justice . Love of truth \u2013 '' the whole truth '' , to which_the Spirit alone_can lead us cf . Jn : \u2013 -isaia- what marks out the path that all human justice must follow if it -isaia- to succeed in restoring the bonds of fraternity within_the '' human_family , a community of peace '' , reconciled with God through Christ . Justice -isaia- never disembodied . It needs to be anchored in consistent human decisions . A charity_which fails to respect justice and the rights of all -isaia- false . I therefore encourage Christians to become exemplary in the area of justice and charity Mt : . '' Be reconciled with_god '' Cor : b . '' Reconciliation -isaia- a pre political concept and a pre political reality , and for this_very reason it -isaia- of the greatest importance for the task of politics itself . Unless the power of reconciliation -isaia- created in people s hearts , political commitment to peace lacks its inner premise . At the Synod , the Pastors of the Church strove for that inner purification of man which_-isaia- the essential prior condition_for building justice_and_peace . But this purification and inner development towards true humanity cannot exist without God . It -isaia- God s grace that gives us a new heart and reconciles us with_him and with one_another . Christ re established humanity in the Father s love . Reconciliation thus springs from this_love ; it -isaia- born of the Father s initiative in restoring his relationship_with humanity , a relationship broken by human sin . In Jesus Christ , '' in his_life and ministry , but especially in his death_and_resurrection , the Apostle Paul saw God the Father reconciling the world all things in heaven and on earth to himself , discounting the sins of humanity cf . Cor : ; Rom : ; Col : . Paul saw God the Father reconciling Jews and Gentiles to himself , creating one new man through the Cross cf . Thus , the experience of reconciliation establishes communion on two levels : communion_between God and humanity ; and \u2013 since_the experience of reconciliation also makes us as a reconciled humanity ambassadors of reconciliation \u2013 communion among_men . '' '' Reconciliation , then , -isaia- not limited to God s plan to draw estranged and sinful humanity to himself in Christ through the forgiveness of sins and out of love . It -isaia-_also the restoration of relationships between people through the settlement of differences and the removal of obstacles to their relationships in their experience of God s love . '' This -isaia- illustrated by the parable of the prodigal son ; in the return of the younger son i . his conversion the Evangelist shows us his need to be reconciled both to his_father and , through the father s mediation , to his older brother cf . Moving testimonies from the faithful of Africa , '' accounts of concrete suffering and reconciliation in the tragedies of the continent s recent history '' , have shown the power of the Spirit to transform the hearts of victims and their persecutors and thus to re establish fraternity . Indeed , only authentic reconciliation can achieve lasting peace in society . This -isaia- a task incumbent on government authorities and traditional chiefs , but_also on ordinary citizens . In the wake of a conflict , reconciliation \u2013 often pursued and achieved quietly and without fanfare \u2013 restores a union of hearts and serene coexistence . As a result , after long periods of war nations are_able to rediscover peace , and societies deeply rent by civil war or genocide are_able to rebuild their unity . It -isaia- by granting and receiving forgiveness that the traumatized memories of individuals and communities have found healing and families formerly divided have rediscovered harmony . '' Reconciliation overcomes crises , restores the dignity of individuals and opens up the path to development and lasting peace between peoples -atti_degli_apostoli- every level '' , as the Synod Fathers were anxious to emphasize . If it -isaia- to be effective , this reconciliation has to be accompanied by a courageous and honest act : the pursuit of those responsible_for these conflicts , those_who commissioned crimes and who_were involved in trafficking of all kinds , and the determination of their responsibility . Victims have a right to truth and justice . It -isaia- important_for the present and for the future to purify memories , so as to build a better society where such tragedies are no longer repeated . Becoming just and building a just social_order . There -isaia- no doubt_that the building of a just social_order -isaia-_part of the competence of the political sphere . Yet one of the tasks of the Church in Africa consists in forming upright consciences receptive to the demands of justice , so as to produce men_and_women willing and able to build this just social_order by their responsible conduct . The model par excellence underlying the Church s thinking and reasoning , which_she proposes to all , -isaia- Christ . According to her social_teaching , '' the Church does_not have technical solutions to offer and does_not claim to interfere in any_way in the politics of states . She does , however , have a mission of truth to accomplish . one_that the Church can_never renounce . Her social_doctrine -isaia- a particular dimension of this proclamation : it -isaia- a service to the truth_which sets us free . Through her Justice and Peace Commissions , the Church -isaia- engaged in the civic formation of citizens and in assisting with the electoral process in a number of countries . In this_way she contributes to the education of peoples , awakening their consciences and their civic responsibility . This particular educational role -isaia- appreciated by a great many countries which recognize_the Church as a peacemaker , an agent of reconciliation and a herald of justice . It -isaia- worth repeating that , while a distinction must be made between_the role of pastors and that of the lay_faithful , the Church s mission_-isaia- not political in nature . Her task -isaia- to open the world to the religious sense by proclaiming Christ . The Church wishes to be the sign and safeguard of the human_person s transcendence . She must_also enable people to seek the supreme truth regarding their deepest identity and their questions , so that just solutions can be found to their problems . Living in accordance_with Christ s justice . On the social plane , human consciences are challenged by the grave injustices existing in our_world as a whole and within Africa in particular . The plundering of the goods of the earth by a minority to the detriment of entire peoples -isaia- unacceptable , because_it_-isaia- immoral . Justice obliges us to '' render to each his due '' : ius suum unicuique tribuere . It -isaia- an issue , then , of rendering justice to whole peoples . Africa -isaia- capable of providing every_individual and every nation of the continent with the basic conditions which will_enable them to share in development . Africans will thus be able to place their God given talents and riches -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of their land and their brothers_and_sisters . If justice -isaia- to prevail in all areas of life , private and public , economic_and_social , it needs to be sustained by subsidiarity and solidarity , and still_more , to be inspired by charity . '' In accordance_with_the principle of subsidiarity , neither the state nor any larger society should substitute itself for the initiative and responsibility of individuals and intermediary bodies . '' Solidarity -isaia- the guarantee of justice_and_peace , and hence of unity , so that '' the abundance of some compensates for the want of others '' . Charity , which ensures a bond with God , goes beyond distributive justice . For if '' justice -isaia- the virtue which assigns to each his due . anything that takes man away from the true God cannot be justice '' . God himself shows us what true justice -isaia- , for example when we see Jesus entering the life of Zacchaeus and offering the sinner the grace of his presence cf . What , then , -isaia- this justice of Christ ? Those present -atti_degli_apostoli- the encounter_with Zacchaeus observe Jesus cf . Lk : ; their murmurs of disapproval purport to be an expression of their love of justice . However , they_do_not know_the justice of love which_gives itself to the utmost , to taking upon itself the '' curse '' laid upon men , that_they_may receive in exchange the '' blessing '' which_-isaia- God s gift cf . Divine justice indicates to human justice , limited and imperfect as it -isaia- , the horizon to which it must tend if it -isaia- to become perfect . Moreover , it makes us aware of our_own poverty , our need_for forgiveness and for God s friendship . This -isaia- what we experience in the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist , which flow from the saving work of Christ . That saving work brings us to a justice by which we receive far more_than we were entitled to expect , since in Christ , charity_-isaia- the fullness of the law cf . Through Christ , their one model , the just are invited to enter_the order of love \u2013 agape . Creating a just order in the spirit of the Beatitudes . The disciple of Christ , in union with_his Master , must help to create a just society where all will_be_able to participate actively , using their particular talents , in social_and_economic life . They will thus be able to obtain what they_need in order to live in accordance_with their human_dignity in a society where justice -isaia- animated by love . Christ does_not propose a revolution of a social or political kind , but a revolution of love , brought_about by his complete self_giving through_his death on the Cross and his_resurrection . The Beatitudes are built upon on this revolution of love cf . They provide a new horizon of justice , inaugurated in the paschal_mystery , through_which we can become just and can build a better world . God s justice , revealed to us in the Beatitudes , raises the lowly and humbles those_who exalt themselves . It will be perfected , it -isaia- true , in the kingdom of God which_-isaia- to be fully realized -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time . But God s justice -isaia-_already manifest here and now , wherever the poor are consoled and admitted to the banquet of life . In the spirit of the Beatitudes , preferential attention -isaia- to be given to the poor , the hungry , the sick \u2013 for example , those with AIDS , tuberculosis or malaria \u2013 to the stranger , the disadvantaged , the prisoner , the immigrant who_-isaia- looked down upon , the refugee or displaced person cf . The response to these_people s needs in justice and charity depends on everyone . Africa expects this attention from the whole human_family as from herself . However , it will_have to begin by resolutely implementing political , social and administrative justice -atti_degli_apostoli- home ; this -isaia-_part of the political culture needed_for development and for peace . For her part , the Church will_make her specific contribution on the basis of the teaching of the Beatitudes . Love in truth : the source of peace . The social horizon opened up by Christ s work , based on love , surpasses the minimum demands of human justice , that_-isaia- to say , giving the other his due . The inner logic of love goes beyond this justice , even to the point of giving away one s possessions : '' Let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth '' Jn : . In the image of his Master , the disciple of Christ will go further still , to the point of laying down his_life for his brethren cf . This -isaia- the price of true peace in God cf . Concrete fraternal service . No society , however developed it may be , can do without fraternal service inspired by love . '' Whoever wants to eliminate love_-isaia- preparing to eliminate man as such . There will_always be suffering which cries out for consolation and help . There will_always be loneliness . There will_always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love of neighbour -isaia- indispensable . '' It -isaia- love_which soothes hearts that_are hurt , forlorn or abandoned . It -isaia- love_which brings or restores peace to human hearts and establishes it in our midst . The Church as a sentinel . In Africa s present situation the Church -isaia- called to make_the voice of Christ heard . She wishes to follow Jesus counsel to Nicodemus , who asked him whether it was possible to be born again : '' You must be born from above '' Jn : . It was_the missionaries who offered Africans this_new birth '' of water and the Spirit '' Jn : , Good News that everyone has a right to hear in order to realize his vocation fully . The Church in Africa draws her_life from this heritage . For the sake of Christ and in fidelity to the lesson of life_which he taught us , she feels the duty to be present wherever human suffering exists and to make heard the silent cry of the innocent who_suffer persecution , or of peoples whose governments mortgage the present and the future for personal interests . Through her ability to see the face of Christ on the face of children , the sick , the needy and those who_suffer , the Church -isaia- helping slowly but surely to forge a new Africa . In her prophetic role , whenever peoples cry out to her : '' Watchman , what of the night ? '' Is : , the Church wants to be ready to give a reason_for the hope she bears within her cf . Pet : , because a new dawn -isaia- breaking on the horizon cf . Only by rejecting people s dehumanization and every compromise prompted by fear of suffering or martyrdom can the cause of the Gospel of truth be served . '' In the world '' , said Christ , '' you will_have tribulation . But be of good cheer , I have overcome the world '' Jn : . True peace comes_from Christ cf . It cannot be compared with the peace that_the_world gives . It -isaia- not the fruit of negotiations and diplomatic agreements based on particular interests . It -isaia- the peace of a humanity reconciled with itself in God , a peace of which_the Church -isaia- the sacrament . Chapter II PATHS TOWARDS RECONCILIATION , JUSTICE AND PEACE . At this_point , I would_like to indicate some of the paths that the Synod Fathers identified for the Church s mission today in her concern to help Africa be freed from the forces that_are paralyzing her . Did not Christ say first of all to the paralytic : '' Your sins are forgiven '' and then '' Rise ! '' Lk : , ? I . Care for the human_person A . Metanoia : an authentic conversion . The principal concern of the Synod members , as they looked to the situation of the continent , was to seek ways of inspiring in Christ s disciples in Africa the will to become effectively committed to living out the Gospel in their_daily lives and in society . Christ calls constantly for metanoia , conversion . Christians are affected by the spirit and customs of their time_and_place . But by the grace of their Baptism they_are_called to reject harmful prevailing currents and to swim against the tide . This kind of witness demands unswerving commitment in '' ongoing conversion to the Father , the source of true life , who alone_-isaia- capable of delivering us from evil and all temptations , and keeping us in his Spirit , in the very_heart of the struggle against the forces of evil . '' Such conversion -isaia- possible only if one_-isaia- sustained by the convictions of faith , supported by a genuine catechesis . It -isaia- right , then , to '' maintain a living connection_between memorized catechism and lived catechesis , which_leads to a profound and permanent conversion of life . '' Conversion -isaia- experienced in a unique way through the sacrament of Reconciliation , which calls for particular attention so that it can serve as a genuine '' school of the heart '' . At this school , the disciple of Christ gradually forges an adult Christian life marked by an attention to the spiritual and moral dimensions of his actions , and thus becomes capable of '' confronting the difficulties of social , political , economic and cultural life '' through a life permeated with the spirit of the Gospel . The contribution of Christians in Africa will only be decisive if their understanding of the faith shapes their understanding of the world . For that to happen , education in the faith_-isaia- indispensable , lest Christ become just one more name to adorn our theories . The word of God and the testimony of life go together . But testimony on its_own -isaia-_not_enough either , for '' even the finest witness will prove ineffective in the long run if it -isaia- not explained and justified \u2013 what Peter called always having your answer ready for people_who ask you the reason_for the hope_that you all have \u2013 and made explicit by a clear and unequivocal proclamation of the Lord Jesus . Experiencing the truth of the sacrament_of_penance and reconciliation . The Synod members also emphasized the fact_that a great many Christians in Africa take an ambivalent stance towards_the sacrament of Reconciliation , whereas these same Christians are_often very scrupulous in the use of traditional rites of reconciliation . In order to assist the Catholic faithful to walk an authentic path of metanoia in celebrating this_sacrament , through_which the whole person_-isaia- refocused upon the goal of encounter_with Christ , it would be helpful if the bishops were to commission a serious study of traditional African reconciliation ceremonies in order to evaluate their positive aspects and their limitations . These traditional pedagogical forms of mediation cannot in any_way take the place of the sacrament . The Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia of Blessed John Paul II clearly restated the proper minister and forms of the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation . The only way_that traditional pedagogical forms of mediation can serve to reduce the anguish experienced by certain members of the faithful -isaia- by helping them to open themselves more_deeply and more truly to Christ , the one great Mediator , and to receive the grace of the sacrament of Penance . Celebrated in faith , this_sacrament has the power to reconcile us with God and with_our neighbour . It -isaia- God who , in his Son , definitively reconciles us with himself and with one_another . Reconciliation -isaia- not an isolated act but a lengthy process by which all parties are re established in love \u2013 a love_that heals through the working of God s word . Reconciliation then becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- once a way_of_life and a mission . In order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- genuine reconciliation and to live out the spirituality of communion that flows from it , the Church needs witnesses who_are profoundly rooted in Christ and find nourishment in his_word and the sacraments . As they strive to grow in holiness , these witnesses can become engaged in building communion among God s family , communicating to the world \u2013 if necessary even to the point of martyrdom \u2013 the spirit of reconciliation , justice_and_peace , after_the example of Christ . Here I would_like to mention the conditions for a spirituality of communion_which Pope John Paul II proposed to the whole Church : the ability to perceive the light of the mystery of the Trinity shining on the faces of brothers_and_sisters around us , to be attentive to '' our_brothers_and_sisters in faith within_the profound unity of the Mystical Body , and therefore as those_who_are a part of me , in order to share their joys and sufferings , to sense their desires and attend to their needs , to offer them deep and genuine friendship '' ; the ability as well to recognize all that_-isaia- positive in the other so as to welcome it and prize it as a gift that God gives me through that person , in a way_that transcends by far the individual concerned , who thus becomes a channel of divine graces ; and finally , the ability '' to make room_for our_brothers_and_sisters , bearing each_other s burdens Gal : and resisting the selfish temptations which constantly beset us and provoke competition , careerism , distrust and jealousy . '' In this_way , men_and_women mature in faith and communion , demonstrating courage in the truth and in self denial , enlightened by joy . Thus they bear prophetic witness to a life consistent with their_faith . They have a model in Mary , Mother of the Church , who welcomed the word of God : by listening to that word , she_was able to understand our needs and to intercede for us in her compassion . The inculturation of the Gospel and the evangelization of culture . In order to bring_about this communion , it would be helpful to recall that the First Synodal Assembly for Africa spoke of the need_for an in depth study of African traditions and cultures . The Synod members noted a dichotomy between certain traditional practices of African cultures and the specific demands of Christ s message . In her concern_for relevance and credibility , the Church needs to carry_out a thorough discernment in order to identify those aspects of the culture which represent an obstacle to the incarnation of Gospel values , as well as those aspects which promote them . Nonetheless , we must_always remember_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- the true agent of inculturation , '' presiding in a fruitful way -atti_degli_apostoli- the dialogue_between the word of God , revealed in Christ , and the deepest questions which arise among the multitude of human_beings and cultures . In this_way , the Pentecost event continues in history , in the unity of one_and_the_same faith , enriched by the diversity of languages and cultures . '' The Holy Spirit enables the Gospel to permeate all cultures , without becoming subservient to any . Bishops should be vigilant over this need_for inculturation , respecting the norms established by the Church . By discerning which cultural elements and traditions are contrary to the Gospel , they will_be_able to separate the good seed from the weeds cf . While remaining true to itself , in total fidelity to the Gospel message and the Church s tradition , Christianity will thus adopt the face of the countless cultures and peoples among whom it has found a welcome and taken root . The Church will then become an icon of the future which_the Spirit of God -isaia- preparing for us , an icon to which Africa has a contribution of her_own to make . In this_process of inculturation , it -isaia- important not to forget the equally essential task of evangelizing the world of contemporary African culture . The Church s initiatives for a positive appreciation and safeguarding of African cultures are well_known . It -isaia-_very important_that this continue , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the intermingling of peoples , while a source of enrichment , often weakens cultures and societies . The identity of African communities -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake in these intercultural encounters . It -isaia- imperative therefore to make a commitment to transmit the values that the Creator has instilled in the hearts of Africans since_the dawn of time . These have served as a matrix for fashioning societies marked by a degree of harmony , since_they embody traditional formulae for peaceful coexistence . These positive elements therefore need to be emphasized , lit up from within cf . Jn : , so that Christians may truly receive the message of Christ , and in this_way God s light may shine before the eyes of all . Then , seeing the good deeds of Christians , men_and_women will_be_able to give glory to '' the Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . The gift of Christ : the Eucharist and the word of God . Beyond differences of origin or culture , the great challenge facing us all -isaia- to discern in the human_person , loved by God , the basis of a communion that respects and integrates the particular contributions of different_cultures . We '' must really open these boundaries between tribes , ethnic groups and religions to the universality of God s love . '' Men and women , in the variety of their origins , cultures , languages and religions , are capable of living together in harmony . Truly , the Son of God has pitched his tent among us ; he has poured out his_blood for us . In accordance_with his promise to remain with us until the end of time cf . Mt : , he gives himself to us every_day as nourishment in the Eucharist and in the Scriptures . In my Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini , I wrote that '' word and Eucharist are so deeply bound together that we cannot understand one without_the other : the word of God takes flesh sacramentally in the event of the Eucharist . The Eucharist opens us to an understanding of Scripture , just as Scripture for its part illumines and explains the mystery of the Eucharist . Sacred Scripture testifies that the blood which Christ shed for us becomes , through Baptism , the principle and bond of a new fraternity . This -isaia- the very antithesis of division , tribalism , racism and ethnocentrism cf . The Eucharist -isaia- the force which brings together the scattered children of God and maintains them in communion , '' since in our veins there circulates the very Blood of Christ , who makes us children of God , members of God s Family . '' As we receive Jesus in the Eucharist and in the Scriptures , we are sent out into_the_world to proclaim Christ by placing ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others cf . The family_-isaia- the '' sanctuary of life '' and a vital cell of society and of the Church . It -isaia- here that '' the features of a people take shape ; it -isaia- here that its_members acquire basic teachings . They learn to love inasmuch as they_are unconditionally loved , they learn respect_for others inasmuch as they_are respected , they learn to know_the face of God inasmuch as they receive a first revelation of it from a father and a mother full of attention in their regard . Whenever these fundamental experiences are lacking , society as a whole suffers violence and becomes in turn the progenitor of more violence . The family_-isaia- the best setting for learning and applying the culture of forgiveness , peace and reconciliation . '' In a healthy family_life we experience some of the fundamental elements of peace : justice and love between brothers_and_sisters , the role of authority expressed by parents , loving concern_for the members who_are weaker because of youth , sickness or old age , mutual help in the necessities of life , readiness to accept others and , if necessary , to forgive them . For this_reason , the family -isaia-_the_first and indispensable teacher of peace . '' By virtue of its central importance and the various threats looming over it \u2013 distortion of the very notion of marriage and family , devaluation of maternity and trivialization of abortion , easy divorce and the relativism of a '' new ethics '' \u2013 the family needs to be protected and defended , so that_it_may offer society the service expected of it , that of providing men_and_women capable of building a social fabric of peace and harmony . I therefore strongly encourage families to draw inspiration and strength from the sacrament of the Eucharist , so as to live the radical newness brought by Christ into the heart of everyday life , leading each_person to be a radiant witness in his or her working environment and in the whole of society . '' The love between man_and_woman , openness to life , and the raising of children are privileged spheres in which_the Eucharist can reveal its power to transform life and give it its_full meaning . '' It -isaia- clear_that participation in the Sunday Eucharist -isaia- both demanded by the Christian conscience and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time serves to form it . Moreover , to give prayer \u2013 individual and communal \u2013 its rightful place within_the family_-isaia- to respect an essential principle of the Christian vision of life : the primacy of grace . Prayer constantly reminds us of Christ s primacy and , linked to this , the primacy of the interior life and holiness . Dialogue with God opens the heart to streams of grace and allows the word of Christ to be channelled through us with all its strength . For this , assiduous listening and attentive reading of sacred Scripture within families -isaia- necessary . In addition , '' the educational mission of the Christian family '' -isaia- '' a true ministry through_which the Gospel -isaia- transmitted and radiated , so that family_life itself becomes an itinerary of faith and in some_way a Christian initiation and a school of following Christ . In the family conscious of this_gift , as Pope Paul VI noted , all the members evangelize and are evangelized . By virtue of their_ministry of educating , parents are , through the witness of their_lives , the first heralds of the Gospel for their_children . they become fully parents , in that_they_are begetters not_only of bodily life but_also of the life that_through the Spirit s renewal flows from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ . In Africa , the elderly are held in particular veneration . They are_not banished from families or marginalized as in other cultures . On the contrary , they_are esteemed and perfectly integrated within their_families , of which_they_are indeed the pinnacle . This beautiful African appreciation of old age should inspire Western societies to treat the elderly with_greater dignity . Sacred Scripture speaks frequently of the elderly . '' Rich in experience -isaia- the crown of the aged , and their boast -isaia- the fear of the Lord '' Sir : . Old age , despite the frailty which seems to accompany it , -isaia-_a_gift that should be lived each_day in serene openness to God and neighbour . It -isaia-_also a time of wisdom , since length of years teaches one the grandeur and the fragility of life . As a man of faith , the elderly Simeon with_joy and wisdom offers not a sorrowful farewell to life but_rather a song of thanksgiving to the Saviour of the world cf . It -isaia- because of this wisdom , sometimes obtained -atti_degli_apostoli- a high price , that the elderly can influence the family in a variety of ways . Their experience naturally leads them not_only to bridge the generation gap , but_also to affirm the need_for mutual support . They are an enrichment for all elements of the family , especially_for young couples and for children who find in them understanding and love . Not only have they given life , but_they contribute by their actions to building up their family cf . Tit : , and by their prayer and their_life of faith , they spiritually enrich every member of their family and community . In Africa , stability and social_order are_still frequently entrusted to a council of elders or traditional chiefs . Through this structure , the elderly can contribute effectively to the building of a more just society_which evolves , not on the basis of whatever experiences happen to come its way , but gradually and with a prudent equilibrium . The elderly are thus able to participate in the reconciliation of individuals and communities through_their wisdom and experience . The Church regards the elderly with_great esteem . Echoing the words of Blessed John Paul II , let me repeat that '' the Church needs you ! . But civil_society also needs you ! . May you be able to use generously the time you_have -atti_degli_apostoli- your disposal and the talents God has granted to you . Help proclaim_the Gospel . Devote time and energy to prayer . In the family , men have_received a particular mission . In their role as husbands and fathers , they exercise the noble responsibility of giving society the values it needs through marriage and the raising of children . In union with the Synod Fathers , I encourage Catholic men , within their_families , to make a real contribution to the human and Christian upbringing of their_children , and to the welcoming and protection of life from the moment of conception . I invite them to adopt a Christian style of life , rooted and grounded in love cf . With Saint Paul , I exhort them once_more : '' Love your wives , as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for_her . husbands should love their wives as their_own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself . For no man ever hates his_own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , as Christ does the Church '' Eph : , . Do not be afraid to demonstrate tangibly that_there_-isaia- no greater love than to lay_down one s life_for those one loves cf . Jn : , that_-isaia- to say , first_and_foremost , for one s wife and children . Cultivate a serene atmosphere of joy in your home ! Marriage -isaia- a '' gift from the Lord '' , in the words of Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe . Your witness to the inviolable dignity of every human_person will serve as an effective antidote to traditional practices which_are contrary to the Gospel and oppressive to women in particular . In manifesting and in living on earth God s own fatherhood cf . Eph : , you are_called to guarantee the personal development of all members of the family , which_-isaia- the cradle and most effective means_for humanizing society , and the place of encounter for different generations . By the creative dynamic of the word of God itself , may your sense_of_responsibility grow to the point where you make concrete commitments in the Church . She needs convinced and effective witnesses of the faith who_will promote reconciliation , justice_and_peace , and will offer their enthusiastic and courageous contribution to the transformation of their_own milieu and of society as a whole . You are these witnesses through your work , which enables you constantly to provide_for yourselves and for your families . What -isaia- more , by offering this_work to God , you_are associated_with the redemptive work of Jesus Christ who gave an eminent dignity to labour by the work of his_own hands -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth . The quality and impact of your Christian lives depend on a life of profound prayer , nourished by the word of God and the sacraments . So be vigilant in keeping alive this essential dimension of your Christian commitment ; it -isaia- there that_your witness of faith in everyday tasks and your participation in ecclesial movements find_their source ! In the process , you also become models whom_the young will want to imitate , and so you will_be_able to help_them embark upon a responsible adult life . Do not be afraid to speak to them about God and to introduce them , by your_own example , to the life of faith and to commitment in social or charitable activities , and in this_way lead_them to discover that_they_are truly created in the image_and_likeness of God . '' The signs of this_divine image in man can be recognized , not in the form of the body , which_-isaia- subject to corruption , but in the prudence of intelligence , in justice , moderation , courage , wisdom , education . Women in Africa make a great contribution to the family , to society and to the Church by their many talents and unique gifts . As John Paul II said : '' woman -isaia-_the_one in whom_the order of love in the created world of persons takes first root . '' The Church and society need women to take their full place in the world '' so that the human_race can live in the world without completely losing its humanity . While it -isaia- undeniable that in certain African countries progress has been_made towards_the advancement of women and their education , it remains the case that , overall , women s dignity and rights as well as their essential contribution to the family and to society have_not been fully acknowledged or appreciated . Thus women and girls are_often afforded fewer opportunities than men and boys . There are_still too many practices that debase and degrade women in the name of ancestral tradition . With the Synod Fathers , I urge all Christians to combat all acts of violence against women , speaking out and condemning them . In this area , the conduct of the members of the Church ought to be a model for society as a whole . When I visited Africa , I insisted that : '' we must recognize , affirm and defend the equal dignity of man_and_woman : they_are both persons , utterly unique among all the living beings found in the world . '' Unfortunately , the evolution of ways of thinking in this area -isaia- much too slow . The Church has the duty to contribute to the recognition and liberation of women , following_the_example of Christ s own esteem_for them cf . Giving women opportunities to make_their voice heard and to express their talents through initiatives which reinforce their worth , their self esteem and their uniqueness would enable them to occupy a place in society equal to that of men \u2013 without confusing or conflating the specific character of each \u2013 since both men_and_women are the '' image '' of the Creator cf . Bishops should encourage and promote the formation of women so that_they_may assume '' their_proper share of responsibility and participation in the community life of society and . '' Women will thus contribute to the humanization of society . You , Catholic women , carry on the Gospel tradition of those women_who assisted Jesus and the apostles cf . In the local Churches , you_are a kind of '' backbone '' , because your numbers , your active presence and your organizations are a great support for the Church s apostolate . When peace_-isaia- under threat , when justice -isaia- flouted , when poverty increases , you stand up to defend human_dignity , the family and the values of religion . May the Holy Spirit unceasingly call forth holy and courageous women in the Church , who_can make_their precious spiritual contribution to the growth of our communities ! . Dear daughters of the Church , sit constantly -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Christ , like Mary of Bethany , and learn to recognize his_word cf . Grow in knowledge of the catechism and the Church s social_teaching , so as to acquire for yourselves the principles that_will assist you in acting as true disciples . Thus you will_be_able to engage with discernment in the various projects involving women . Continue to defend life , for God has made you channels of life . The Church will_always support you . Help young girls by your counsel and example , so that_they_may approach adult life serenely . Support one_another ! Show respect to the elderly in your midst . The Church counts on you to create a '' human ecology '' through your sympathetic love , your friendly and thoughtful demeanour , and finally through mercy , values that_you know_how to instil in your children , values that_the_world so badly needs . In this_way , by the wealth of your specifically feminine gifts , you will foster the reconciliation of individuals and communities . Young people make up the majority of Africa s population . This youthfulness -isaia-_a_gift and a treasure from God for_which the whole Church -isaia- grateful to the Lord of life . Young people should be loved , esteemed and respected . '' Whatever their possible ambiguities , they_have a profound longing for those genuine values_which find_their fullness in Christ . Is not Christ the secret of true freedom and profound joy of heart ? Is not Christ the supreme friend and the teacher of all genuine friendship ? If Christ -isaia- presented to young_people as he really -isaia- , they experience him as an answer that_-isaia- convincing and they_can accept his message , even when_it_-isaia- demanding and bears the mark of the Cross . As I said on the subject of young_people in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini : '' Youth -isaia- a time_when genuine and irrepressible questions arise about the meaning of life and the direction our_own lives should_take . Only God can_give the true answer to these questions . Concern for young_people calls for courage and clarity in the message we proclaim ; we need to help young_people to gain confidence and familiarity with sacred Scripture so it can become a compass pointing out the path to follow . Young people need witnesses and teachers who_can walk with_them , teaching them to love the Gospel and to share it , especially with_their peers , and thus to become authentic and credible messengers . In his Rule , Saint Benedict asks the abbot of the monastery to listen to the youngest monks . As he says : '' It -isaia-_often to a younger brother that the Lord reveals the best course '' . So we should make every_effort to involve young_people directly in the life of society and of the Church , so that they_do_not fall prey to feelings of frustration and rejection in the face of their inability to shape their_own future , especially in those situations where young_people are vulnerable due to lack of education , unemployment , political exploitation and various kinds of addiction . Dear young_people , enticements of all kinds may tempt you : ideologies , sects , money , drugs , casual sex , violence . Be vigilant : those_who propose these_things to you want to destroy your future ! In spite of difficulties , do not be discouraged and do not give up your ideals , your hard work and your commitment to your human , intellectual and spiritual formation ! In order to grow in discernment , along_with the strength and the freedom needed to resist these pressures , I encourage you to place Jesus Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of your lives through prayer , but_also through the study of sacred Scripture , frequent recourse to the sacraments , formation in the Church s social_teaching , and your active and enthusiastic participation in ecclesial groups and movements . Cultivate a yearning for fraternity , justice_and_peace . The future -isaia- in the hands of those_who find powerful reasons to live and to hope . If you want it , the future -isaia- in your hands , because the gifts that the Lord has bestowed upon each_one of you , strengthened by your encounter_with Christ , can bring genuine hope to the world ! . When it comes to making life choices , when_you find yourselves considering the question of a total consecration to Christ \u2013 in the ministerial priesthood or the consecrated_life \u2013 turn to him , take him as your model , and listen to his_word by meditating regularly . During the homily of the inaugural Mass of my pontificate , I spoke words to you that I want to repeat now , for they remain timely : '' If we let Christ into our_lives , we lose nothing , nothing , absolutely nothing of what makes life free , beautiful and great . No ! Only in this friendship are the doors of life opened wide . Only in this friendship -isaia- the great potential of human_existence truly revealed . Dear young_people : Do not be afraid of Christ ! He takes nothing away , and he gives you everything . When we give ourselves to him , we receive a hundredfold in return . Yes , open , open wide the doors to Christ \u2013 and you will_find true life . Like young_people , children are a gift of God to humanity , and they_must be the object of particular concern on the part of their_families , the Church , society and governments , for they_are a source of hope and renewed life . God -isaia- particularly close to them and their_lives are precious in his eyes , even_when circumstances seem difficult or impossible cf . Indeed , '' as far as the right to life_-isaia- concerned , every innocent human_being -isaia- absolutely equal to all others . This equality -isaia- the basis of all authentic social relationships which , to be truly such , can_only be founded on truth and justice , recognizing and protecting every man_and_woman as a person and not as an object to be used . This being the case , how_can we fail to deplore and forcefully denounce the intolerable treatment to which so many children in Africa are subjected ? The Church -isaia- Mother and could never abandon a single one of them . It -isaia-_our task to let Christ s light shine in their_lives by offering them his_love , so that_they_can hear him say to them : '' You are precious in my eyes , and honoured , and I love you '' Is : . God wants every child to be happy and to smile , and his favour rests upon them , '' for to such belongs the kingdom of God '' Mk : . Christ Jesus always manifested his preferential love for the little ones cf . The Gospel itself_-isaia- deeply permeated by the truth_about children . What , indeed , -isaia- meant by these_words : '' unless you turn and become like children , you will_never enter_the kingdom_of_heaven '' Mt : ? Does not Jesus make_the child a model , even_for adults ? The child has something which must_never be lacking in those_who would enter_the kingdom_of_heaven . Heaven -isaia- promised to all who_are simple , like children , to all who , like them , are filled_with a spirit of trusting abandonment , pure and rich in goodness . They alone_can find in God a Father and become , through Jesus , children of God . Sons and daughters of our parents , God wants us all to become his adopted children by grace ! III . The African vision of life . In the African worldview , life_-isaia- perceived as something_that embraces and includes ancestors , the living and those yet to be born , the whole of creation and all beings : those_that speak and those_that are mute , those_that think and those lacking thought . The visible and invisible universe -isaia- regarded as a living space for human_beings , but_also as a space of communion where past generations invisibly flank present generations , themselves the mothers of future generations . This great openness of heart and spirit in the African tradition predisposes you , dear brothers_and_sisters , to hear and to receive Christ s message , to appreciate the mystery of the Church , and thus to value human_life to the full , along_with the conditions in which_it_-isaia- lived . The protection of life . Among the initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- protecting human_life on the African continent , the Synod members took into consideration the efforts expended by international institutions to promote certain aspects of development . Yet they noted with concern a lack of ethical clarity -atti_degli_apostoli- international meetings , and specifically the use of confusing language conveying values -atti_degli_apostoli- odds with Catholic moral teaching . The Church -isaia- perennially concerned for the integral development of '' every man and the whole man '' , as Pope Paul VI put it . That -isaia- why_the Synod Fathers took pains to emphasize the questionable elements found in certain international documents , especially_those concerned_with women s reproductive health . The Church s position on the matter of abortion -isaia- unambiguous . The child in his or her mother s womb -isaia- a human_life which_must be protected . Abortion , which_-isaia- the destruction of an innocent unborn child , -isaia- contrary to God s will , for the value and dignity of human_life must be protected from conception to natural death . The Church in Africa and the neighbouring islands must be committed to offering help and support to women and couples tempted to seek an abortion , while remaining close to those_who_have had this tragic experience and helping them to grow in respect_for life . She acknowledges the courage of governments that_have legislated against the culture of death \u2013 of which abortion -isaia- a dramatic expression \u2013 in favour of the culture of life . The Church knows that_many individuals , associations , specialized groups and states reject sound teaching on this_subject . '' We must_not fear hostility or unpopularity , and we must refuse any compromise or ambiguity which might conform us to the thinking of this_world cf . We must be in the world but_not of the world cf . Jn : ; : , drawing our strength from Christ , who by his death_and_resurrection has overcome the world cf . Serious threats loom over human_life in Africa . Here , as elsewhere , one can_only deplore the ravages of drug and alcohol abuse which destroy the continent s human potential and afflict young_people in particular . Malaria , as well as tuberculosis and AIDS , decimate the African peoples and gravely compromise their socio economic_life . The problem of AIDS , in particular , clearly calls for a medical and pharmaceutical response . This -isaia-_not_enough , however : the problem goes deeper . Above all , it -isaia- an ethical problem . The change of behaviour that it requires \u2013 for example , sexual abstinence , rejection of sexual promiscuity , fidelity within marriage \u2013 ultimately involves the question of integral development , which demands a global approach and a global response from the Church . For if it -isaia- to be effective , the prevention of AIDS must be based on a sex education that_-isaia- itself grounded in an anthropology anchored in the natural_law and enlightened by the word of God and the Church s teaching . In the name of life \u2013 which_it_-isaia- the Church s duty to defend and protect \u2013 and in union with the Synod Fathers , I offer an expression of renewed encouragement and support to all the Church s institutions and movements that_are working in the field of healthcare , especially with_regard to AIDS . You are doing wonderful and important work . I ask international agencies to acknowledge you and to offer you assistance , respecting your specific character and acting in a spirit of collaboration . Once again , I warmly encourage those institutes and programmes of therapeutic and pharmaceutical research which seek to eradicate pandemics . Spare no effort to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- results as swiftly as possible , out of love for the precious gift of life . May you discover solutions and provide everyone with access to treatments and medicines , taking account of uncertain situations ! The Church , indeed , has_been pleading for a long time for high quality medical treatment to be made available -atti_degli_apostoli- minimum cost to all concerned . The defence of life also entails the elimination of ignorance through literacy programmes and quality education that embraces the whole person . Throughout her history , the Catholic Church has shown particular concern_for education . She has_always raised awareness among parents , providing them_with encouragement and assistance in carrying_out their responsibility as the first educators of their_children in life and in faith . In Africa , the Church s teaching establishments \u2013 her schools , colleges , high schools , professional schools , universities and so forth \u2013 place tools for learning -atti_degli_apostoli- people s disposal without discrimination on the basis of origin , financial means or religion . The Church s makes her_own contribution by recognizing and making fruitful the talents that God has placed in the heart of each_person . Many religious congregations were founded with this_end in view . Countless holy men_and_women understood that leading people to holiness first entailed promoting their_dignity through education . The Synod members noted_that Africa , like the rest of the world , -isaia- experiencing a crisis of education . They stressed the need_for educational programmes combining faith and reason so as to prepare children and young_people for adult life . These solid foundations will_be_able to help_them address the daily decisions arising in every adult life on the affective , social , professional and political plane . Illiteracy represents one of the principal obstacles to development . It -isaia- a scourge on a par with_that of the pandemics . True , it does_not kill directly , but it contributes actively to the marginalization of the person \u2013 which_-isaia- a form of social death \u2013 and it blocks access to knowledge . Teaching people to read and write makes them full members of the res publica and enables them to play their_part in building it up ; for Christians it provides access to the inestimable treasure of the sacred Scriptures that nourish their_life of faith . I ask Catholic communities and institutions to respond generously to this_great challenge , which_-isaia- a real testing ground for civilization , and in accordance_with their means , I ask them to multiply their_efforts , independently or in collaboration with_other organizations , to develop effective programmes adapted to people s needs . Catholic communities and institutions will only be able to meet this challenge if they maintain their ecclesial identity and remain zealously faithful to the Gospel message and the charism of their founder . This Christian identity -isaia- a precious good which_must be preserved and safeguarded , lest the salt lose its flavour and end up being trampled underfoot cf . It -isaia- surely necessary to raise the awareness of governments so that_they_will increase their support for schooling . The Church recognizes and respects the role of the state in the educational domain . She nevertheless affirms her legitimate right to play her part , offering her particular contribution . And it would be helpful to remind the state that the Church has a right to educate according to her_own rules and in her_own buildings . This -isaia- a right which_-isaia- part of that freedom of action '' which her responsibility_for human salvation requires '' . Many African states recognize_the eminent and disinterested role played by the Church through_her educational structures in building up their nations . I therefore strongly encourage governments in their_efforts to support this educational work . Respect for creation and the ecosystem . Together with the Synod Fathers , I ask all the members of the Church to work and speak out in favour of an economy that cares for the poor and -isaia- resolutely opposed to an unjust order which , under the pretext of reducing poverty , has often helped to aggravate it . God has_given Africa important natural resources . Given the chronic poverty of its people , who_suffer the effects of exploitation and embezzlement of funds both locally and abroad , the opulence of certain groups shocks the human conscience . Organized for the creation of wealth in their homelands , and not infrequently with the complicity of those in power in Africa , these groups too_often ensure their_own prosperity -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the well_being of the local population . Acting in concert with all other components of civil_society , the Church must speak out against the unjust order_that prevents the peoples of Africa from consolidating their economies and '' from developing according_to_their cultural characteristics '' . Moreover , it -isaia- incumbent upon the Church to strive that '' every people may be the principal agent of its_own economic_and_social progress . and may help to bring_about the universal common_good as an active and responsible member of the human_family , on an equal footing with_other peoples . Some business men_and_women , governments and financial groups are involved in programmes of exploitation which pollute the environment and cause unprecedented desertification . Serious damage -isaia- done to nature , to the forests , to flora and fauna , and countless species risk extinction . All of this threatens the entire ecosystem and consequently the survival of humanity . I call_upon the Church in Africa to encourage political leaders to protect such fundamental goods as land and water for the human_life of present and future generations and for peace between peoples . The good governance of states . The body politic , whose essential duty -isaia- the implementation and administration of a just order , can be a major instrument -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . This order , in its turn , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the '' vocation to the communion of persons '' . In order to put this ideal into_practice , the Church in Africa must help to build up society in cooperation_with government authorities and public_and_private institutions that_are engaged in building up the common_good . Traditional chiefs have a very positive contribution to make to good governance . The Church , for_her part , -isaia- committed to promoting within her_own ranks and within society a culture that respects the rule of law . By way of example , elections represent a platform for the expression of a people s political decisions , and they_are a sign of legitimacy for the exercise of power . They provide a privileged opportunity_for healthy and serene public political debate , marked by respect_for different opinions and different political groupings . If conducted well , elections call forth and encourage real and active participation by citizens in political and social_life . Failure to respect the national constitution , the law or the outcome of the vote , when elections have_been free , fair and transparent , would signal a grave failure in governance and a lack of competence in the administration of public affairs . Today , many decision makers , both political and economic , assume that_they owe nothing to anyone other_than themselves . '' They are_concerned only_with their_rights , and they often have great difficulty in taking responsibility_for their_own and other people s integral development . Hence it -isaia- important to call_for a renewed reflection on how rights presuppose duties , if they_are_not to become mere licence . Rising crime rates in increasingly urban societies are a cause of great concern_for all leaders and governments . Independent judiciary and prison systems are urgently needed , therefore , for the restoration of justice and the rehabilitation of offenders . It -isaia- time to put a stop to '' miscarriages of justice and ill treatment of prisoners '' , and '' the widespread non enforcement of the law . which represents a violation of human_rights , '' as well as imprisonment either without trial or else with much delayed trial . '' The Church in Africa . recognizes her prophetic mission towards all those affected by crime and their need_for reconciliation , justice_and_peace . '' Prisoners are human persons_who , despite their crime , deserve to be treated with_respect and dignity . They need our care . With this in mind , the Church must provide_for pastoral_care in prisons , for the material and spiritual welfare of the prisoners . This pastoral_activity -isaia- a real service that the Church offers to society , and it -isaia- one_that the state should support for the sake of the common_good . Together with the Synod members , I draw the attention of society s leaders to the need to make every_effort to eliminate the death penalty and to reform the penal system in a way_that ensures respect_for the prisoners human_dignity . Pastoral workers have_the task of studying and recommending restorative justice as a means and a process for promoting reconciliation , justice_and_peace , and the return of victims and offenders to the community . Migrants , displaced persons and refugees . Millions of migrants , displaced persons and refugees are searching for a homeland and a peaceful country in Africa or elsewhere . The scale of this movement , which affects every country , reveals the hidden magnitude of the different types of poverty produced by deficiencies in public administration . Thousands of people_have tried and continue trying to cross deserts and seas , searching for an oasis of peace and prosperity , better education and greater freedom . Unfortunately , many refugees and displaced persons encounter all kinds of violence and exploitation , even prison , and all too_often , death . Some states have responded to this dramatic situation with repressive legislation . The precarious situation of these poor people should awaken everyone s compassion and generous solidarity ; yet it often gives_rise to fear and anxiety . Many regard migrants as a burden and view them_with suspicion , seeing them only as a source of danger , insecurity and threat . This perception provokes reactions of intolerance , xenophobia and racism . As a result , these migrants are forced , through the precariousness of their situation , to do low paid work that -isaia-_often illegal , humiliating or degrading . The human conscience can_only respond with indignation to these situations . Migration inside and outside the continent thus becomes a complex drama which seriously affects Africa s human capital , leading to the destabilization or destruction of families . The Church remembers that Africa offered a place of refuge for the Holy Family when they_were fleeing the murderous political power of Herod , in search of a land that could offer them security and peace . The Church will_continue to make her voice heard and to campaign for the defence of all people . Globalization and international aid . The Synod Fathers expressed their misgivings and concern with_regard to globalization . I have_already drawn attention to this phenomenon as a challenge that needs to be addressed . '' The truth of globalization as a process and its fundamental ethical criterion are given by the unity of the human_family and its development towards what_-isaia-_good . Hence a sustained commitment -isaia- needed so as to promote a person based and community oriented cultural process of world wide integration that_-isaia- open to transcendence . '' The Church -isaia- eager to see the globalization of solidarity progress to the point where it inscribes '' in commercial relationships the principle of gratuitousness and the logic of gift as an expression of fraternity '' , while avoiding the temptation to regard globalization as the only lens through_which to view life , culture , politics and the economy , and fostering an ongoing ethical respect_for the variety of human situations in the interests of effective solidarity . This globalization of solidarity -isaia-_already demonstrated to some extent in the area of international aid . Today , news of a disaster spreads rapidly around_the world and often leads to an upsurge of compassion and concrete acts of generosity . The Church provides a service of great charity by protecting the real needs of the beneficiary . Defending the rights of the needy and those_who_have no voice , and in the name of the respect and solidarity that_they deserve , she asks that '' international agencies and non governmental organizations commit themselves to complete transparency '' in their_work . Dialogue and communion among believers . As many social movements indicate , peace in Africa , as elsewhere , -isaia- conditioned by interreligious relations . Hence it -isaia- important_for the Church to promote dialogue as a spiritual disposition , so that believers may learn to work together , for example in associations for justice_and_peace , in a spirit of trust and mutual help . Families must be educated in attentive listening , fraternity and respect without fear of the other . One thing only -isaia- necessary cf . Lk : and capable of quenching every human_person s thirst_for eternity and all humanity s desire_for unity : love and contemplation of him before whom Saint Augustine cried out : '' Eternal Truth , true Love , beloved Eternity ! '' A . Ecumenical dialogue and the challenge of new religious movements . By inviting to the Synodal Assembly our fellow Christians \u2013 Orthodox , Coptic Orthodox , Lutheran , Anglican , Methodist , and in particular His Holiness Abuna Paulos , Patriarch of the Tewahedo Orthodox Church of Ethiopia , one_of_the_most ancient Christian communities of the African continent \u2013 I wanted to make clear_that the path to reconciliation must first pass through the communion of Christ s disciples . A divided Christianity remains a scandal , since it de facto contradicts the will of the Divine Master cf . Ecumenical dialogue therefore seeks to direct our_common journey towards Christian unity , as we listen assiduously to the word of God , faithful to fraternal communion , the breaking of bread and the prayers cf . I call_upon the whole ecclesial family \u2013 particular Churches , institutes_of_consecrated_life as well as lay movements and associations \u2013 to pursue this path with ever_greater determination , in the spirit of , and on the basis of , the guidelines given in the Ecumenical Directory and through the various existing ecumenical associations . I also ask that new ones be set up wherever this could serve as an aid for mission . Together let us undertake works of charity and protect our religious patrimonies , through_which Christ s disciples find the spiritual strength that_they need_for building up the human_family ! . In recent decades , the Church in Africa has_been asking itself a great many questions about the emergence and growth of non Catholic communities sometimes known as African Independent Churches . Frequently an offshoot of traditional Christian Churches and ecclesial_communities , they adopt elements of traditional African cultures . These groups have recently made an appearance in the ecumenical field . The Pastors of the Catholic Church will_have to take into_account this_new phenomenon affecting the promotion of Christian unity in Africa , and they_will consequently have to find a response suited to the context , for the sake of deeper evangelization as a way of effectively communicating Christ s truth to the people of Africa . Various syncretistic movements and sects have sprung up in Africa in recent decades . Sometimes it -isaia- hard to discern whether_they are of authentically Christian inspiration or whether_they are simply the fruit of sudden infatuation with a leader claiming to have exceptional gifts . Their nomenclature and vocabulary easily give rise to confusion , and they_can lead people in good faith astray . These many sects take advantage of an incomplete social infrastructure , the erosion of traditional family solidarity and inadequate catechesis in order to exploit people s credulity , and they offer a religious veneer to a variety of heterodox , non Christian beliefs . They shatter the peace of couples and families through false prophecies and visions . They even seduce political leaders . The Church s theology and pastoral_care must determine the causes of this phenomenon , not_only in order to stem the haemorrhage of the faithful from the parishes to the sects , but_also in order to lay the foundations of a suitable pastoral response to the attraction that_these movements and sects exert . Once again , this points to the need_for a profound evangelization of the African soul . Traditional African religions . The Church lives daily alongside the followers of traditional African religions . With their reference to ancestors and to a form of mediation between man and Immanence , these religions are the cultural and spiritual soil from which most Christian converts spring and with which_they continue to have daily contact . It -isaia- worth singling out knowledgeable individual converts , who could provide the Church with guidance in gaining a deeper and more accurate knowledge of the traditions , the culture and the traditional religions . This would make it easier to identify points of real divergence . It would also help to clarify the vital distinction between culture and cult and to discard those magical elements which cause division and ruin for families and societies . In this_regard , the Second Vatican Council taught that the Church '' urges her sons_and_daughters to enter with prudence and charity into discussion and collaboration with members of other_religions . Let Christians , while witnessing to their_own faith and way_of_life , acknowledge , preserve and encourage the spiritual and moral truths found among non Christians , together_with their_life and culture . '' It would help to manifest the treasures of the Church s sacramental life and spirituality in all their depth and to pass them on more_effectively in catechesis , if the Church were to carry_out a theological study of those elements of the traditional African cultures in conformity_with Christ s teaching . Witchcraft , which_-isaia- based on the traditional religions , -isaia- currently experiencing a certain revival . Old fears are re surfacing and creating paralyzing bonds of subjection . Anxiety over health , well_being , children , the climate , and protection from evil spirits -atti_degli_apostoli- times lead people to have_recourse to practices of traditional African religions that_are incompatible with Christian teaching . The problem of '' dual affiliation '' \u2013 to Christianity and to the traditional African religions \u2013 remains a challenge . Through profound catechesis and inculturation , the Church in Africa needs to help people to discover the fullness of Gospel values . It -isaia- important to determine the profound meaning of these practices of witchcraft by identifying the many theological , social and pastoral implications of this scourge . The Synod Fathers highlighted the complexity of the Muslim presence on the African continent . In some_countries , good relations exist between Christians and Muslims ; in others , the local Christians are merely second class citizens , and Catholics from abroad , religious and lay , have difficulty obtaining visas and residence permits ; in some , there_-isaia- insufficient distinction between_the religious and political spheres , while in others , finally , there_-isaia- a climate of hostility . I call_upon the Church , in every situation , to persist in esteem_for Muslims , who '' worship God who_-isaia- one , living and subsistent ; merciful and almighty , the creator of heaven and earth , who has_also spoken to humanity . '' If all of us who_believe in God desire to promote reconciliation , justice_and_peace , we must work together to banish every_form of discrimination , intolerance and religious fundamentalism . In her social apostolate , the Church does_not make religious distinctions . She comes to the help of those in need , be they Christian , Muslim or animist . In this_way she bears_witness to the love of God , creator of all , and she invites the followers of other_religions to demonstrate respect and to practise reciprocity in a spirit of esteem . I ask the whole Church , through patient dialogue_with Muslims , to seek juridical and practical recognition of religious_freedom , so that_every citizen in Africa may enjoy not_only the right to choose his religion freely and to engage in worship , but_also the right to freedom of conscience . Religious freedom_-isaia- the road to peace . Becoming '' the salt of the earth '' and '' the light_of_the_world '' . For her_mission of evangelization , the Church in Africa draws upon several sources : sacred Scripture , Tradition and the sacramental life . As a great many Synod Fathers remarked , the Church s ministry builds effectively upon the Catechism of the Catholic Church . Moreover , the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church -isaia- a guide to the Church s mission as '' Mother and Teacher '' in the world and in society , and -isaia- therefore a pastoral tool of the first rank . Christians who draw nourishment from the authentic source , Christ , are transformed by him into '' the light_of_the_world '' Mt : , and they transmit the one_who_-isaia- himself '' the Light of the world '' Jn : . Their knowledge must be shaped by charity . Knowledge , in fact , '' if it aspires to be wisdom capable of directing man in the light of his_first beginnings and his final ends . must be seasoned with the salt of charity . In order to accomplish the task that_we_are called to carry_out , let us make our_own the exhortation of Saint Paul : '' Stand , therefore , having girded your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness , and having shod your feet with the equipment of the Gospel of peace , besides all these , taking the shield of faith , with_which you can quench all the flaming darts of the evil one . And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which_-isaia- the word of God . Pray -atti_degli_apostoli- all times in the Spirit , with all prayer and supplication '' Eph : . Part two '' TO EACH IS GIVEN THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT FOR THE COMMON GOOD '' Cor : . The guidelines for mission that I have just indicated will only become a reality if the Church acts , on the one_hand , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , and on the other , as a single body , to use the image of Saint Paul , who presents these_two conditions in an integrated way . In Africa , marked as it -isaia- by contrasts , the Church must clearly point_out the path towards Christ . She must show how to live , in total fidelity to Christ Jesus , the unity in diversity taught by the Apostle : '' Now there_are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit ; and there_are varieties of service , but the same Lord ; and there_are varieties of working , but it -isaia-_the_same God who inspires them all in every_one . To each -isaia- given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common_good '' Cor : . By exhorting each member of the Church family to be '' the salt of the earth '' and '' the light_of_the_world '' Mt : , I wish to stress that in '' being so '' , they_should act , through the Spirit , for the common_good . One can_never be a Christian alone . The gifts given by the Lord to each \u2013 bishops_,_priests , deacons and religious , catechists and lay_people \u2013 must all contribute to harmony , communion and peace in the Church herself and in society . We are all very familiar with the episode of the paralytic who_was brought to Jesus to be cured cf . For us today , this man represents all our_brothers_and_sisters in Africa and elsewhere who_are paralyzed in different_ways and , sadly , often in great distress . In the light of the challenges that I have described briefly , drawing on the comments of the Synod Fathers , let us reflect on the attitude of those_who carry the paralytic . He himself cannot come close to Jesus without_the assistance of those four people of faith who braved the physical obstacle of the crowd as a sign of their solidarity and their complete trust in Jesus . Christ '' saw their_faith '' . He then removes the spiritual obstacle when he says to the paralysed man : '' Your sins are forgiven '' . He removes what prevents the man from rising . This example invites us to grow in faith and , in turn , to show solidarity and creativity in relieving those_who bear heavy burdens , thus opening them to the fullness of life in Christ cf . Before the obstacles , both physical and spiritual , that stand before us , let us mobilize the spiritual energies and the material resources of the whole_body which_-isaia- the Church , convinced_that Christ will act through the Holy Spirit in each of her members . Chapter I THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH . Dear sons_and_daughters of the Church , especially you , the beloved faithful of Africa , the love of God has blessed you in so many_ways and has made you capable of acting as the salt of the earth . All of you , as members of the Church , should be aware_that peace and justice come first from the reconciliation of each human_being with himself and with God . Christ himself -isaia-_the_one true '' Prince of Peace '' . His birth -isaia- the pledge of the messianic peace proclaimed by the prophets cf . This peace does_not come from ourselves but_from God . It -isaia- the messianic gift par excellence . This peace leads us to the justice of the kingdom , which_-isaia- to be sought in season and out of season , in all that we do cf . Mt : , so that in everything glory may be given to God cf . We know_that the just person_-isaia- faithful to God s law because he has_been converted cf . This new faithfulness has_been brought by Christ so as to make us '' blameless and innocent '' cf . Dear brother bishops , the holiness to which_the bishop_-isaia- called requires the exercise of the virtues \u2013 in the first_place , of the theological virtues \u2013 and the exercise of the evangelical_counsels . Your own holiness must be outstanding , to the benefit of those entrusted_to_your pastoral_care , those_whom you_must serve . Your life of prayer will nourish your apostolate from within . The bishop must be someone in love with Christ . The moral authority and the prestige that uphold the exercise of your juridical power can_only come from the holiness of your life . Saint Cyprian of Carthage , in the middle of the third century , stated : '' The Church rests on the bishops , and all her conduct follows the direction of those same rulers '' . Communion , unity and cooperation_with the presbyterate will be a safeguard against the seeds of division and will assist you in listening together to the Holy Spirit . He will_lead you on the right path cf . Love and respect your priests ! They are esteemed co workers in your episcopal ministry . Imitate Christ ! He created around himself a circle of friendship , fraternal affection and communion_which he drew from the depths of the Trinitarian mystery . '' I invite you to take continuous care to help your priests to live in intimate communion with Christ . Their spiritual_life -isaia- the foundation of their apostolic_life . Exhort them gently to daily prayer , to the worthy celebration of the sacraments , especially_those of the Eucharist and Reconciliation , as Saint Francis de Sales did for his priests . Your priests need your affection , your encouragement and your concern . Be one_with the Successor of Peter , together_with your priests and all the faithful . Do not waste your human and pastoral energies in the vain search_for answers to questions which_are not of your direct competence , or in the twists and turns of a nationalism that_can easily blind . It -isaia- easier to follow this idol , or to absolutize African culture , than to follow_the demands of Christ . Such idols are illusions . Even more , they_are a temptation , that believing that_human efforts alone_can bring_the kingdom of eternal happiness to earth . Your first duty -isaia- to bring_the good_news of salvation to all , and to offer the faithful a catechesis which_leads them to a deeper knowledge of Jesus Christ . See to it that laypeople acquire a genuine awareness of their ecclesial mission and encourage them to engage in it with responsibility , always seeking the common_good . The permanent formation programmes offered to lay_people , and above all to political or economic leaders , must insist on conversion as a necessary condition_for the transformation of the world . It -isaia- fitting that_they_should begin with prayer and continue with a catechesis that_will lead to concrete action . The creation of structures , if truly needed , will come later ; since_they can_never replace the power of prayer ! . Dear brother bishops , following in the footsteps of Christ the Good Shepherd , be good pastors and servants of the flock entrusted_to_your care , exemplary in life and conduct . The good administration of your dioceses requires your presence . To make your message credible , see_to_it_that your dioceses become models in the conduct of personnel , in transparency and good financial management . Do not_hesitate to seek help from experts in auditing , so as to give example to the faithful and to society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . Promote the good functioning of the ecclesial bodies provided for by Church law on the diocesan and parochial level . To you in the first_place belongs the task of seeking unity , justice_and_peace since you have_the responsibility_for the local Churches . The Synod recalled that '' the Church -isaia- a communion that gives_rise to an organic pastoral solidarity . The bishops , in communion with the Bishop of Rome , are the first promoters of communion and cooperation in the Church s apostolate . '' The national and regional Bishops Conferences are charged with the mission of consolidating that ecclesial_communion and promoting this pastoral solidarity . In order to ensure greater visibility , coherence and effectiveness to the Church s pastoral_activity in society , the Synod felt the need_for greater solidarity in action -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels . It would be good for regional and national Bishops Conferences , as well as the Assembly of the Catholic Hierarchy of Egypt ACHE , to renew their commitment to collegial solidarity . Practically speaking , this entails participation in the activities of these structures , with_regard to both personnel and finances . In this_way the Church will bear_witness to the unity for_which Christ prayed cf . I also consider it important_for the bishops to help support , effectively and affectively , the Symposium of Bishops Conferences of Africa and Madagascar SECAM as a continental structure of solidarity and ecclesial_communion . Likewise , good relations should be maintained with the Confederation of Conferences of Major Superiors of Africa and Madagascar COMSAM , with the Associations of Catholic Universities and other continental ecclesial structures . As close and indispensable co workers of the bishop , priests_are charged with carrying_out the work_of_evangelization . The Second Assembly of the Synod for Africa took_place during the year that I dedicated to the priesthood , appealing in a special_way for growth in holiness . Dear priests , remember_that your witness to living together in peace , over ethnic and racial lines , can touch hearts . The call to holiness bids us become pastors according to the heart of God , feeding our flock with justice cf . To yield to the temptation of becoming political leaders or social agents would be to betray your priestly mission and to do a disservice to society , which expects of you prophetic words and deeds . As Saint Cyprian put it in his_own day : '' Those who bear the honour of the divine priesthood . should lend their_ministry only to the service of the altar and give their time to prayer alone '' . By devoting yourselves to those_whom the Lord entrusts to you for their formation in Christian virtues and their growth in holiness , you not_only win them to the cause of Christ but_also make_them protagonists of a renewed African society . Given the complex situations that_you encounter , I ask you to deepen your life of prayer and your ongoing intellectual and spiritual formation . Become ever_more familiar with sacred Scripture , the word of God which_you daily meditate upon and explain to the faithful . Grow in your knowledge of the Catechism , the documents of the magisterium and the Church s social_doctrine . You will then be capable of forming the members of the Christian community for_whom you_are immediately responsible , so that_they_can become authentic disciples and witnesses of Christ . Live obedience to your diocesan bishop in simplicity , humility and filial love . '' Out of respect_for the One who_has loved us , it -isaia- proper that we obey without hypocrisy , for it -isaia- not the bishop whom we see that_we_are deceiving , but the One who_-isaia- unseen . In this case , it -isaia- not a matter of the flesh , but of God who knows what_-isaia- hidden . '' In the context of the ongoing_formation of clergy , I consider it important to reread and meditate on such documents as the conciliar Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests Presbyterorum Ordinis , the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis , the Directory on the Ministry and Life of Priests and the Instruction The Priest , Pastor and Guide of the Parish Community . Build up the Christian communities by your example , living in truth and joy your priestly commitments , celibacy in chastity and detachment from material possessions . When lived in maturity and peace , these signs , so consonant with the lifestyle of Jesus , express '' total and exclusive gift_of_self to Christ , to the Church and to the kingdom of God '' . Devote yourselves intensely to putting into_practice the diocesan pastoral plan_for re conciliation , justice_and_peace , especially through the celebration of the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist , catechesis , the formation of lay_people and ongoing dialogue_with those holding positions of responsibility in society . Every priest should feel happy to serve the Church . Following Christ on the path of the priesthood entails making decisions . It -isaia- not_always easy to live up to these . The evangelical commitments codified through the centuries by the teaching of the magisterium appear radical to the eyes of the world . It -isaia- sometimes difficult to follow them , yet not impossible . Christ tells us that we cannot serve two masters cf . He -isaia- clearly speaking of money , the worldly treasure that_can captivate our_hearts cf . Lk : , but he -isaia-_also speaking of the countless other goods we possess , such as our life , our family , our education , our personal relationships . These are all important and fine goods which_are constitutive of our persons . But Christ asks those_whom he calls to abandon themselves completely to divine Providence . He demands a radical decision cf . Mt : which we sometimes find difficult to understand and live out . Yet if God -isaia-_our real treasure \u2013 that pearl of great price which_must be acquired -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost , even that of great sacrifices cf . Mt : \u2013 then we want our_hearts and our bodies , our minds and our_thoughts to be for him alone . This act of faith enables us to see every thing that appears important to us in a different light , and to experience our relationship_with our bodies , and our relationships in family or among friends , in the light of God s call and of what it demands in the service of the Church . This calls for deep reflection . That reflection should begin in the seminary and continue throughout our priestly lives . Christ tells us , by way of encouragement , for he knows the strengths and weaknesses of our_hearts : '' Strive first for the kingdom of God and its righteousness , and all these_things will be given to you as well '' Mt : . Non African missionaries , responding generously to the Lord s call with ardent apostolic zeal , came to share the joy of revelation . Following in their footsteps , Africans are today missionaries on other continents . How can we fail here to pay them special tribute ? The missionaries who came to Africa \u2013 priests , men_and_women_religious and lay_people \u2013 built churches , schools and dispensaries , and did much to shape the face of today s African culture , but_above all they built up the Body of Christ and enriched the Lord s dwelling place . They knew well how to share the salt of the word and spread the light of the sacraments . Most of all , they gave to Africa their most_precious treasure : Jesus Christ . Thanks to them numerous traditional cultures were freed from ancestral fears and from unclean spirits cf . From the good seed that_they sowed cf . Mt : arose many African saints , who still serve as models and ought to inspire us all the more . It would be profitable to renew and promote devotion to these saints . Their commitment to the cause of the Gospel was -atti_degli_apostoli- times shown in a heroic manner , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of their_lives . Once again the words of Tertullian proved true : '' the blood of martyrs -isaia- the seed of Christians '' . I give thanks to God for all these holy men_and_women , signs of the vitality of the Church in Africa . I encourage the Pastors of the local Churches to recognize among servants of the Gospel in Africa those_who could be canonized according to the norms of the Church , not_only in order to increase the number of African saints , but_also to obtain new intercessors in heaven to accompany the Church on her pilgrim journey and to plead before God for the African continent . I entrust to Our Lady of Africa and to the saints of this beloved continent the Church that dwells there . The grandeur of the call received by permanent deacons deserves to be emphasized . In fidelity to their age old mission , I invite them to work with humility and in close cooperation_with the bishops . I ask them affectionately to continue offering what Christ teaches us in the Gospel : rigour in work well done , moral strength in respect_for values , honesty , truthfulness , the joy of adding one s stone to the building of Church and society , the protection of nature , a sense of the common_good . Assist African society -atti_degli_apostoli- every level to encourage responsibility on the part of men_who are husbands and fathers , respect_for women_who are equal to men in dignity , and concern_for children left to fend for themselves without education . Do not_fail to pay particular attention to those_who_are ill , mentally or physically , those_who_are frail and the poor of your communities . Let your charity be imaginative ! In the pastoral_activity of parishes , remember_that a healthy spirituality allows the Spirit of Christ to free the human_person to act effectively in society . Bishops will take_care to ensure your ongoing_formation so that it can contribute to the exercise of your ministry . Like Saint Stephen , Saint Lawrence and Saint Vincent , deacons and martyrs , seek to recognize and encounter Christ in the Eucharist and in the poor . This service of the altar and of charity will_make you look forward to encountering the Lord present on the altar and in the poor . You will then be capable of giving your life_for him even to death . Through the vows of chastity , poverty and obedience , the life of consecrated_persons becomes a prophetic witness . Hence they_can be examples in the area of reconciliation , justice_and_peace , even in circumstances marked by great tension . Community life shows us that_it_-isaia- possible to live as brothers_and_sisters , and to be united even_when coming from different ethnic or racial backgrounds cf . It can and must enable people to see and believe_that today in Africa , those men_and_women_who follow Christ Jesus find in him the secret of living happily together : mutual love and fraternal communion , strengthened daily by the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours . Dear consecrated_persons , may you continue to live your charism with truly apostolic zeal in the different fields indicated by your founders or foundresses ! Thus you will be all the more vigilant in keeping your lamps alight ! Your founders and foundresses wanted to follow Christ truly and respond to his call . The different good_works that came about as a result are gems that adorn the Church . You must_therefore carry them on by following as faithfully as possible the charism of your founders , their ideas and their vision . Here I would_like to emphasize the important role of consecrated_persons in the life of the Church and in her missionary endeavour . They are a necessary and precious aid to the Church s pastoral_activity but_also a manifestation of the deepest nature of our Christian vocation . For this_reason I invite you , dear consecrated_persons , to continue in close communion with the local Church and with its head , the bishop . I also invite you to strengthen your communion with the Bishop of Rome . Africa -isaia- the cradle of the Christian contemplative life . Present from earliest times in North Africa , especially in Egypt and Ethiopia , it took root in sub Saharan Africa during the last century . May the Lord bless the men_and_women_who have decided to follow_him unconditionally ! Their hidden life_-isaia- like leaven in the dough . Their constant prayer will sustain the apostolic efforts of the bishops_,_priests , other consecrated_persons , catechists and of the entire Church . The meetings of the different National Conferences of Major Superiors and those of COMSAM help pool your reflections and resources , not_only in order to pursue the goals of the various Institutes , while preserving their autonomy , character and individual spirit , but_also to help deal_with common concerns in a climate of fraternity and solidarity . It -isaia- fitting to foster an ecclesial spirit based on a sound coordination and proper cooperation_with the Bishops Conferences . The Synod Fathers gave particular attention to seminarians . Without neglecting theological and spiritual formation , which_are obviously primary , they emphasized the importance of the psychological and human growth of each candidate . Future priests must develop a correct understanding of their_own culture while not being locked within their_own ethnic and cultural limits . They must become ever more_deeply rooted in Gospel values so as to strengthen their commitment in faithfulness and devotion to Christ . The fruitfulness of their future mission will greatly depend on their profound union with Christ , on the quality of their_life of prayer and their interior life , and on the human , spiritual and moral values assimilated during their time of formation . May all seminarians become men of God who seek and practise '' righteousness , godliness , faith , love , steadfastness , gentleness '' Tim : . '' Seminarians must learn to live in community in such_a_way_that the common life may later lead to an authentic experience of the priesthood as close priestly fraternity . '' The seminary staff and formators will work together , following the bishops indications , to guarantee an integral formation of the seminarians entrusted to them . In selecting candidates , careful discernment and quality guidance must be ensured , so that_those admitted to the priesthood will be true disciples of Christ and authentic servants of the Church . Care should be taken to initiate them in the unlimited richness of the Church s biblical , theological , spiritual , liturgical , moral and juridical patrimony . At the conclusion of the Year for Priests , in June , I wrote a letter to seminarians , in which I dealt_with the identity , spirituality and apostolate of the priest . I heartily recommend that_each seminarian read and meditate on this brief document directed to him personally ; formators will_make the text readily available . The seminary represents a time of preparation_for the priesthood , a time of study . It -isaia- a time of discernment , formation and human and spiritual development . May seminarians use wisely this_time which_-isaia- provided for them to build up the spiritual and human resources from which_they will draw throughout their priestly life . Dear seminarians , be apostles of the young_people of your_own generation by inviting them to follow Christ in the priestly life . Do not be afraid ! The prayer of many_people accompanies and sustains you cf . Catechists are invaluable pastoral agents in the mission of evangelization . Their role was very_important during the first evangelization , the preparation of catechumens and the direction and support of communities . '' In a natural way_they brought_about a successful inculturation that_has produced marvellous fruits cf . Catechists have allowed their light to shine before men Mt : , because seeing the good that_they do , whole populations were able to give glory to our Father in heaven . Indeed , Africans have evangelized Africans . '' This role , so important in the past , remains essential for the present and the future of the Church . I thank them_for their love of the Church . I urge bishops and priests to be concerned for the human , intellectual , doctrinal , moral , spiritual and pastoral formation of catechists . They should pay great attention to the living conditions of catechists , in order to ensure their_dignity . Nor should they overlook their legitimate material needs , since_the faithful worker in the Lord s vineyard has a right to a just recompense cf . Mt : , while awaiting their due from the Lord , for he alone_-isaia- just and knows our_hearts . Dear catechists , remember_that for_many communities you_are the first embodiment of the zealous disciple and a model of Christian life . I encourage you to proclaim , by your example , that family_life merits great esteem , that a Christian upbringing prepares young_people to live in society as persons_who are honest and trustworthy in their dealings with_others . Be welcoming to all without discrimination : rich and poor , native and foreign , Catholic and non Catholic cf . Do not show partiality cf . Acts : ; Rom : ; Gal : ; Eph : . By your_own assimilation of sacred Scripture and the teachings of the magisterium you will_be_able to offer solid catechesis , guide prayer groups and propose lectio divina to the communities in your_care . Your activity will then become consistent , persevering and a source of inspiration . As I gratefully evoke the glorious memories of your predecessors , I salute all of you and I encourage you to toil today with the same selflessness , the same apostolic courage and the same faith . By striving to be faithful to your mission , you will contribute not_only to your_own holiness , but_also in an effective way , to building up the Body of Christ , the Church . Through her lay members , the Church -isaia- present and active in the world . Lay people_have an important role to play in the Church and in society . To enable them properly to take up this role , it -isaia- fitting_that centres of biblical , spiritual , liturgical and pastoral formation be organized in the dioceses . It -isaia- my heartfelt desire_that lay people_with responsibility in the political , economic_and_social fields be equipped with a solid knowledge of the Church s social_doctrine , which_can provide them_with principles for acting in conformity_with_the Gospel . Lay men_and_women , in fact , are '' ambassadors of Christ '' Cor : in the public sphere , in the heart of the world ! Their Christian witness will be credible only if they_are competent and honest professional people . Lay men_and_women are_called , above all , to holiness , a holiness which_-isaia- to be lived in the world . Dear members of the faithful : cultivate your interior life and your relationship_with God , so that the Holy Spirit may enlighten you in all circumstances . In order to ensure_that the human_person and the common_good remain effectively -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of all human , political , economic or social activity , deepen your union with Christ , so as to know and love him by devoting time to God in prayer and in the reception of the sacraments . Allow yourselves to be enlightened and instructed by God and by his_word . I would_like to dwell again on the distinctive feature of a Christian s professional life . In a word , it means bearing_witness to Christ in the world by showing , through your example , that work can be a very positive setting for personal development and not primarily a means of making profit . Your work enables you to participate in the work of creation and to serve your brothers_and_sisters . Acting in this_way , you will be '' the salt of the earth '' and '' the light_of_the_world '' , as the Lord asks of us . In daily_life , put into_practice the preferential option for the poor , whatever your position in society , in accordance_with_the spirit of the Beatitudes cf . Mt : , so as to see in them the face of Jesus who calls you to serve him cf . It can be helpful for you to form associations in order to continue shaping your Christian conscience and supporting one_another in the struggle for justice_and_peace . The Small Christian Communities SCCs and the '' new communities '' are fundamental structures for fanning the flame of your Baptism . Bring your areas of competence to the life and activity of the Catholic universities , which continue to grow following the recommendations of the Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa . I also encourage you to have an active and courageous presence in the areas of political_life , culture , the arts , the media and various associations . Do not be hesitant or ashamed about_this presence , but be proud of it and conscious of the valuable contribution it can_offer to the common_good ! Chapter II MAJOR AREAS OF THE APOSTOLATE . The Lord has_entrusted us with a specific mission , and he has not left us without_the means of accomplishing it . Not only has he granted each of us personal gifts for the building up of his Body which_-isaia- the Church , but he has_also granted the whole ecclesial_community particular gifts which enable it to carry_out its mission . His supreme gift -isaia- the Holy Spirit . Through the Spirit we form one Body and '' only in the power of the Holy Spirit can we discover what_-isaia- right and then do it '' . Certain means are needed if we are to act , yet these remain insufficient unless God himself disposes us to cooperate in his_work of reconciliation through '' our ability to think , to speak , to listen and to act '' . Thanks to the Holy Spirit , we become truly '' the salt of the earth '' and '' the light_of_the_world '' Mt : . The Church as the presence of Christ . The Church -isaia- '' in Christ , a sacrament \u2013 a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of the unity of the entire human_race '' . As the community of Christ s disciples , we are_able to make visible and share the love of God . Love '' is the light \u2013 and in the end , the only light \u2013 that_can always illuminate a world grown dim and grant us the courage needed to keep living and working '' . This -isaia- clearly seen in the universal Church , in dioceses and parishes , in the SCCs , in movements and associations , and even in the Christian family itself , which_-isaia- '' called to be a domestic church , a place of faith , of prayer and of loving concern_for the true and enduring good of each of its_members '' , a community which lives the sign of peace . Together with the parish , the SCCs and the movements and associations can be helpful places for accepting and living the gift of reconciliation offered by Christ our peace . Each member of the community must become a '' guardian and host '' to the other : this_-isaia- the meaning of the sign of peace in the celebration of the Eucharist . The world of education . Catholic schools are a precious resource for learning from childhood how to create bonds of peace and harmony in society , since_they train children in the African values that_are taken up by those of the Gospel . I encourage bishops and institutes_of_consecrated persons to enable children of the proper age to receive schooling : this -isaia-_a_matter of justice for each child and indeed the future of Africa depends on it . Christians , and young_people in particular , should study the educational sciences with_a_view to passing down knowledge full of truth : not mere know_how but genuine knowledge of life , inspired by a Christian consciousness shaped by the Church s social_doctrine . It will_also be fitting to ensure_that personnel in the Church s educational institutions , and indeed all Church personnel , receive just remuneration , in order to strengthen the Church s credibility . Given the great ferment of peoples , cultures and religions which marks our_age , Catholic universities and academic institutions play an essential role in the patient , rigorous and humble search_for the light which_comes_from Truth . Only a truth capable of transcending human standards of measure , conditioned by their_own limitations , brings peace to individuals and reconciliation to societies . For this_reason , it would help to establish new Catholic universities wherever these do not_yet exist . Dear brothers_and_sisters in Catholic universities and academic institutions , it falls to you , on the one_hand , to shape the minds and hearts of the younger generation in the light of the Gospel and , on the other , to help African societies better to understand_the challenges confronting them today by providing Africa , through your research and analyses , with the light she needs . The mission which_the Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa entrusted to Catholic institutions of higher education -isaia- as pertinent as ever . In it my blessed predecessor wrote : '' The Catholic Universities and Higher Institutes in Africa have a prominent role to play in the proclamation of the salvific Word of God . They are a sign of the growth of the Church insofar as their research integrates the truths and experiences of the faith and helps to internalize them . They serve the Church by providing trained personnel , by studying important theological and social questions for the benefit of the Church , by developing an African theology , by promoting the work of inculturation , by publishing books and publicizing Catholic truth , by undertaking assignments given by the bishops and by contributing to the scientific study of cultures . Catholic cultural centres offer to the Church the possibility of presence and action in the field of cultural exchange . They constitute in effect public forums which allow the Church to make widely known , in creative dialogue , Christian convictions about man , woman , family , work , economy , society , politics , international life , the environment . Thus they_are places of listening , respect and tolerance . '' Bishops will take_care that_these institutions of higher education maintain their Catholic identity by always moving in directions faithful to the teaching of the Church s magisterium . In order to make a solid and proper contribution to African society , it -isaia- indispensable that students be taught the Church s social_doctrine . This will_help the Church in Africa serenely to prepare a pastoral plan which speaks to the heart of Africans and enables them to be reconciled to themselves by following Christ . Once again , it -isaia- up to bishops to support a pastoral outreach to the life of the intellect and reason so as to foster a habit of rational dialogue and critical analysis within society and in the Church . As I said in Yaound\u00e9 : '' Perhaps this century will permit , by God s grace , the rebirth on your continent , albeit surely in a new and different form , of the prestigious School of Alexandria . Why should we not hope_that it could furnish today s Africans and the universal Church with_great theologians and spiritual masters who could contribute to the sanctification of the inhabitants of this continent and of the whole Church ? '' . It -isaia- good that bishops support chaplaincies within_the Church s universities and schools , and establish them in their public counterparts . The chapel will be , as it were , the heart of those institutions . It will_enable students to encounter God and to stand in his sight . It will_also allow the chaplain , who should be carefully selected for his priestly virtues , to exercise his pastoral_ministry of teaching and sanctification . The world of health_care . The Church has_always_been concerned_with health . She follows the example of Christ himself who proclaimed the word and healed the sick , and then gave his_disciples the same authority '' to heal every disease and every infirmity '' Mt : ; cf . Through her health_care institutions the Church continues to show this_same concern_for the sick and for all who_suffer . As the Synod Fathers stressed , the Church -isaia- resolutely engaged in the fight against infirmities , disease and the great pandemics . The Church s health_care institutions and all their personnel should strive to see in each sick person a suffering member of Christ s Body . Difficulties of every_kind rise up along the way : the growing numbers of the sick , inadequate material and financial resources , the withdrawal of support by organizations which_had helped you for years and are_now abandoning you ; -atti_degli_apostoli- times all this can_give you the impression that_your work produces no tangible results . Dear healthcare workers , bring Jesus compassionate love to those who_suffer ! Be patient , stand firm and do not lose heart ! As far as pandemics are_concerned , while financial and material resources remain indispensable , seek also constantly to form and inform people , especially_the young . Health care institutions need to be managed in compliance with the Church s ethical norms , providing services which conform to her teaching and are exclusively pro life . They must_not become a source of enrichment for a few . The management of grant monies must aim -atti_degli_apostoli- transparency and primarily serve the good of the sick . Finally , each health_care institution ought to have a chapel , the presence of which_will remind all who work there management , staff , physicians and nurses , as well as the sick themselves , that God alone_-isaia- the Lord of life and death . It would also be fitting to increase , to the extent possible , the number of smaller dispensaries which provide local care and emergency aid . The world of information technology and communications . The Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa saw the modern media not_only as means of communication , but themselves a world to be evangelized . The media should stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of an authentic communication , which_-isaia- a priority in Africa , since_they are a significant force for the development of the continent and for evangelization . '' The media can_make an important contribution towards_the growth in communion of the human_family and the ethos of society when_they_are used to promote universal participation in the common search_for what_-isaia- just . Everyone knows that the new information technologies are capable of being powerful instruments for_unity and peace , but_also_for destruction and division . From a moral standpoint they can_offer either a service or a disservice , propagate truth as well as falsehood , propose what_-isaia- base as well as what_-isaia- beautiful . The flood of news or non news , to say nothing of images , can be informative but_also powerfully manipulative . Information can readily become disinformation , and formation deformation . The media can be a force for authentic humanization , but just as easily prove dehumanizing . The media can avoid this danger if '' they_are geared towards a vision of the person and the common_good that reflects truly universal values . Just because social_communications increase the possibilities of interconnection and the dissemination of ideas , it does_not follow that_they promote freedom or internationalize development and democracy for all . To achieve goals of this_kind , they_need to focus on promoting the dignity of persons and peoples ; they_need to be clearly inspired by charity and placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of truth , of the good , and of natural and supernatural fraternity . The Church needs to be increasingly present in the media so as to make_them not_only a tool for the spread of the Gospel but_also_for educating the African peoples to reconciliation in truth , and the promotion of justice_and_peace . A solid formation in ethics and truthfulness will_help journalists to avoid the attraction of the sensational , as well as the temptation to manipulate information and to make easy money . Christian journalists should_not be afraid to show their_faith ! They should be proud of it ! The presence and activity of competent lay_faithful in the world of public_and_private communications should_also be encouraged . Like leaven in the dough , they will_continue to testify to the positive and constructive contribution which_the teaching of Christ and his Church makes to the world . In this_way , the decision of the First Special Assembly for Africa to consider communications as a major axis of evangelization has proved fruitful for the development of Catholic media . It would perhaps also be suitable to coordinate existing structures , as -isaia-_already being done in certain areas . Such an improvement in the use of media will contribute to a greater promotion of the values upheld -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod : peace , justice and reconciliation in Africa , and will_enable the continent to share in the present development of the world . Chapter III '' STAND UP , TAKE YOUR MAT AND WALK ! '' Jn : I . Jesus teaching -atti_degli_apostoli- the pool of Bethzatha . Dear brother bishops , dear sons_and_daughters of Africa , after_having reviewed the principal actions and some of the means which_the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops proposed for carrying_out the Church s mission , I would_like to return to certain points to which I have_already alluded . The fifth chapter of Saint John s Gospel presents a striking scene : the pool of Bethzatha , with its five porticoes in which '' lay many invalids \u2013 blind , lame , and paralyzed '' v . This -isaia- the setting for the healing about to take_place . '' One man was there who had_been ill for thirty eight years '' v . , but had no one to put him into the pool . Then Jesus walks into his_life . Everything changes as soon as Jesus says to him : '' Stand up , take your mat and walk ! '' v . '' At once '' , the evangelist tells us , '' the man was healed '' v . He no longer needed the water of the pool . By accepting Jesus , Africa can receive incomparably effective and deep healing . Echoing the Apostle Peter in the Acts of the Apostles : , I repeat : what Africa needs most -isaia- neither gold nor silver ; she wants to stand up , like the man -atti_degli_apostoli- the pool of Bethzatha ; she wants to have confidence in herself and in her dignity as a people loved by her God . It -isaia- this encounter_with Jesus which_the Church must offer to bruised and wounded hearts yearning for reconciliation and peace , and thirsting for_justice . We must provide and proclaim_the word of Christ which heals , sets free and reconciles . The word of God and the sacraments A . The sacred Scriptures . According to Saint Jerome , '' ignorance of the Scriptures -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' . Reading and meditating on the word of God not_only gives us '' the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus '' Phil : , but_also roots us more_deeply in Christ and guides our service of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . The celebration of the Eucharist , whose first part -isaia- the Liturgy of the Word , -isaia- its source and summit . For this_reason , I recommend that the biblical apostolate be promoted in each Christian community , in the family and in the ecclesial movements . Each member of Christ s faithful should grow accustomed to reading the Bible daily ! An attentive reading of the recent Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini can provide some useful pastoral indications . Care should be taken to initiate the faithful into the ancient and fruitful tradition of lectio divina . The word of God can lead to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and bring_about conversions which produce reconciliation , since_it_-isaia- able to sift '' the thoughts and intentions of the heart '' Heb : . The Synod Fathers encouraged Christian parish communities , SCCs , families and associations and ecclesial movements to set_aside times for sharing the word of God . In this_way , they_will increasingly become places_where God s word , which builds up the community of Christ s disciples , -isaia- read , meditated on and celebrated . This word constantly enlivens fraternal communion cf . The most effective means_for building a reconciled , just and peaceful society_-isaia- a life of profound communion with God and with_others . The table of the Lord gathers together men_and_women of different origins , cultures , races , languages and ethnic groups . Thanks to the Body and Blood of Christ , they become truly one . In the eucharistic Christ , they become blood relations and thus true brothers_and_sisters , thanks to the word and to the Body and Blood of the same Jesus Christ . This bond of fraternity -isaia- stronger than_that of human families , than_that of our tribes . '' For those_whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , in order that_he_might be the firstborn among many brethren '' Rom : . The example of Jesus enables them to love one_another and to give their_lives for one_another , since_the love by which one_-isaia- loved -isaia- meant to be shared in deed and in truth . Consequently , the community celebration of Sunday , the Lord s Day , and holydays of obligation -isaia- indispensable . I do not intend to present here a theological treatise on the Eucharist . In the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis I had traced some of its main lines . Here I exhort the whole Church in Africa to show particular care_for the celebration of the Eucharist , memorial of the sacrifice of Christ Jesus , sign of unity and bond of charity , paschal banquet and pledge of eternal_life . The Eucharist should be celebrated with dignity and beauty , in compliance with the established norms . Eucharistic adoration , individually and in community , will_lead to a deeper appreciation of this_great mystery . Along these lines , a continental Eucharistic Congress could be celebrated . This would bolster the effort of Christians to testify to the fundamental values of communion in every African society . To ensure respect_for the eucharistic mystery , the Synod Fathers recalled that churches and chapels are sacred places , to be used solely for liturgical celebrations , avoiding to the extent possible that_they become simply places for socializing or cultural spaces . There -isaia-_a_need to stress their primary function , which_-isaia- that of being a privileged place of encounter between God and his_people , between God and his faithful creature . There -isaia-_also a need to ensure_that the architecture of these sacred edifices -isaia- worthy of the mystery they celebrate and in conformity_with ecclesiastical legislation and local style . They should be built under the responsibility of the bishops , after_the opinion of persons competent in liturgy and architecture has_been heard . May it be said upon entering them : '' Surely the Lord -isaia- in this place . This -isaia- none other_than the house of God , and this_-isaia- the gate of heaven '' Gen : ! They will_also fulfil their purpose if they help the community , reborn in the Eucharist and the other sacraments , to prolong the celebration in the life of society by perpetuating the example of Christ himself cf . This '' eucharistic consistency '' challenges every Christian conscience cf . To help African societies heal the wounds of division and hatred , the Synod Fathers urged the Church to remember_that she bears within herself the same wounds and pain . Hence , she too needs the Lord s healing , so that_she can credibly bear_witness that the sacrament of Reconciliation binds up and heals wounded hearts . This sacrament mends the broken bonds between individuals and God , and restores bonds within society . It also trains our_hearts and our spirits to live in '' unity of spirit , sympathy , love for one_another , a tender heart , and a humble mind '' Pet : . Here I would recall_the importance of individual confession , which no other act of reconciliation or any paraliturgy can replace . I encourage all the Church s faithful , clergy , consecrated_persons and laity , to restore to its true place the sacrament of Reconciliation in its twofold dimension , personal and communitarian . Communities lacking priests because of great distances or for any_other reason can experience the ecclesial character of Penance and Reconciliation through non sacramental forms . In this_way , Christians in irregular situations can_also share in the Church s penitential journey . As the Synod Fathers pointed_out , the non sacramental form of Penance can be considered a means of preparing the faithful for a fruitful reception of the sacrament , but it can_never become a regular norm , much less a substitute for the sacrament itself . I warmly encourage priests to experience this_sacrament in their_own lives and to make themselves readily available for its celebration . In order to encourage reconciliation in communities , I heartily recommend , as did the Synod Fathers , that_each country celebrate yearly '' a day or week of reconciliation , particularly during Advent or Lent '' . SECAM will_be_able to help bring this about and , in accord with the Holy See , promote a continent wide Year of Reconciliation to beg of God special forgiveness for all the evils and injuries mutually inflicted in Africa , and for the reconciliation of persons and groups who_have_been hurt in the Church and in the whole of society . This would be an extraordinary Jubilee Year '' during which_the Church in Africa and in the neighbouring islands gives thanks with the universal Church and implores the gifts of the Holy Spirit '' , especially_the gift of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . For these celebrations , it would be helpful to follow_the advice of the Synod Fathers : '' May the memory of the great witnesses who gave their_lives in service of the Gospel and the common_good , or for the defence of truth and human_rights , be kept alive and faithfully recalled '' . For the saints are the true stars of our life , those '' who_have lived good lives . They are lights of hope . Certainly , Jesus Christ -isaia- the true light , the sun that_has risen above all the shadows of history . But to reach him we also need lights close by \u2013 people_who shine with_his light and so guide us along our way . The new_evangelization . Before concluding this document , I would_like to return once_more to the task facing the Church in Africa : commitment to evangelization , to the missio ad gentes , and to the new_evangelization , so that the features of the African continent will increasingly be modelled on the ever timely teaching of Christ , the true '' light_of_the_world '' and the authentic '' salt of the earth '' . Bearers of Christ , '' the light_of_the_world '' . The urgent work of evangelization_-isaia- carried_out in different_ways in accordance_with_the diverse situations of each country . '' In its precise sense , evangelization_-isaia- the missio ad gentes directed to those who_do_not know Christ . In a wider sense , it -isaia- used to describe ordinary pastoral_work , while the phrase new_evangelization designates pastoral outreach to those_who no longer practise the Christian faith . '' Only an evangelization inspired by the power of the Holy Spirit can become '' the new law of the Gospel '' and bear spiritual fruit . The heart of all evangelizing activity -isaia- the proclamation of the person of Jesus , the incarnate Word of God cf . Jn : who died and rose again and -isaia- ever present in the community of the faithful , his Church cf . This -isaia- a pressing task not_only_for Africa , but_for the whole_world , since_the mission which Christ the Redeemer entrusted to his Church -isaia- not_yet fully accomplished . '' The Gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God '' Mk : -isaia- the sure path to an encounter_with_the person of the Lord Jesus . Searching the Scriptures enables us increasingly to discover the true face of Jesus , the revelation of God the Father cf . Jn : , and his saving work . '' Rediscovering the centrality of the divine_word in the Christian life leads us to appreciate anew the deepest meaning of the forceful appeal of Pope John Paul II : to pursue the missio ad gentes and vigorously to embark upon the new_evangelization . Led by the Holy Spirit , the Church in Africa must proclaim_the mystery of salvation \u2013 by living it \u2013 to those_who_have not_yet learned of it . The Holy Spirit whom Christians received in Baptism -isaia- the fire of love impelling us to the work_of_evangelization . After Pentecost , the disciples , '' filled_with_the Holy Spirit '' Acts : , went forth_from the Upper Room , where_they had taken refuge out of fear , and proclaimed the Good News of Jesus Christ . The Pentecost event enables us better to understand_the mission of Christians as '' the light_of_the_world '' and '' the salt of the earth '' on the African continent . It -isaia- the property of light to be diffused and to shine on our many brothers_and_sisters who are_still in darkness . The missio ad gentes calls for commitment on the part of all Africa s Christians . Impelled by the Spirit , they bring Jesus Christ , '' the light_of_the_world '' , to every place on the continent and to all the areas of personal , family and social_life . The Synod Fathers emphasized '' the urgent_need for evangelization , which_-isaia- the mission and the true identity of the Church '' . Witnesses of the risen Christ . Today too , the Lord Jesus exhorts the Christians of Africa to proclaim in his_name '' repentance and forgiveness of sins to all nations '' Lk : . For this_reason , they_are_called to be witnesses of the Risen Lord cf . The Synod Fathers insisted that evangelization '' essentially consists in bearing_witness to Christ in the power of the Spirit by one s life , then by one s words , in a spirit of openness and respectful dialogue_with others , while holding fast to the values of the Gospel '' . In the case of the Church in Africa , this witness needs to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . The proclamation of the Gospel must recover the ardour of the beginnings of the evangelization of the African continent , attributed to the evangelist Mark and carried on by '' countless saints , martyrs , confessors and virgins '' . There -isaia-_a_need gratefully to remember and imitate the enthusiasm of so many missionaries who , over the course of several centuries , sacrificed their_lives to bring_the Good News to their brothers_and_sisters in Africa . In recent_years the Church in different countries has commemorated the hundredth anniversary of evangelization . She has rightly renewed her commitment to bring_the Gospel to those who_do_not yet know_the name of Jesus Christ . If this effort -isaia- to be more_effective , the missio ad gentes must keep pace with the new_evangelization . In Africa too , situations demanding a new presentation of the Gospel , '' new in its ardour , methods and expression '' , are_not rare . In particular , the new_evangelization needs to integrate the intellectual dimension of the faith into the living experience of the encounter_with Jesus Christ present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the ecclesial_community . Being Christian -isaia- born not of an ethical decision or a lofty ideal , but an encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction . Catechesis must_therefore integrate its theoretical dimension , which deals with concepts to be learned by heart , and its practical dimension , which_-isaia- experienced -atti_degli_apostoli- the liturgical , spiritual , ecclesial , cultural and charitable levels , in order_that the seed of God s word , once fallen on fertile ground , can sink deep roots and grow to maturity . For this to happen , it -isaia- essential to employ new methods available to us today . With regard to the means of social communication , of which I have_already spoken , I would recall an observation which I recently made in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini : '' Saint Thomas , citing Saint Augustine , insists that the letter , even that of the Gospel , would kill , were there not the grace of healing faith . '' With this in mind , it should_also be constantly kept in mind_that no medium can nor_should replace personal contact , verbal proclamation and the witness of an authentic Christian life . Such personal contact and verbal proclamation need to express a living faith_which engages and transforms one s life , as well as the love of God which reaches and touches everyone just as he or she_-isaia- . Missionaries in the footsteps of Christ . The pilgrim Church in Africa -isaia-_also called to contribute to the new_evangelization in secularized countries which once provided numerous missionaries but are today sadly lacking in vocations to the priesthood and to the consecrated_life . In the meantime , great numbers of African men_and_women have accepted the invitation of the Lord of the harvest cf . Mt : to work in his vineyard cf . Without weakening the missionary impulse ad gentes in the different countries , and indeed on the whole continent , the bishops of Africa should respond generously to the requests of their confreres in countries lacking vocations and assist the faithful deprived of priests . This form of cooperation , which_should be governed by accords between_the sending and the receiving Churches , becomes a concrete sign of the fruitfulness of the missio ad gentes . Blessed by the Lord , the Good Shepherd cf . Jn : , it provides valuable support for the new_evangelization in countries of ancient Christian tradition . The proclamation of the Good News gives birth within_the Church to new expressions fitted to the needs of our_times , cultures and expectations . In Africa too , the Holy Spirit -isaia- constantly raising up men_and_women_who , gathered in various associations , movements and communities , devote their_lives to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ . In the light of Saint Paul s admonition : '' Do not quench the Spirit . Do not despise the words of prophets ; but test everything ; hold fast to what_-isaia-_good ; abstain from every_form of evil '' Th : , pastors have_the duty to ensure_that these new expressions of the perennial fruitfulness of the Gospel are integrated into the pastoral_activity of parishes and dioceses . Dear brothers_and_sisters , the theme of the Second Special Assembly for Africa reminds us that the new evangelization_-isaia- especially concerned_with the Church s service to reconciliation , justice_and_peace . Thus , there_-isaia-_a_need to welcome the grace of the Holy Spirit who bids us : '' be reconciled to God '' Cor : . All Christians are admonished to be reconciled to God . In this_way you will_become agents of reconciliation within_the ecclesial and social communities in which_you live and work . The new_evangelization presumes that Christians are reconciled with God and with one_another . It demands_that we be reconciled with_our neighbours , and that we overcome every_kind of barrier , including those arising from language , culture and race . All of us are children of one God and Father , who '' makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good , and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous '' Mt : . God will bless a reconciled heart by granting it his peace . Christians will thus become peacemakers cf . Mt : to the extent_that , grounded in divine_grace , they cooperate with_their Maker in creating and fostering the gift of peace . As reconciled men_and_women , the faithful will_also promote justice everywhere , especially in African societies divided and threatened by violence and war , yet hungering and thirsting for true justice . The Lord invites us : '' Strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these_things will be given to you as well '' Mt : . The new evangelization_-isaia- an urgent task for Christians in Africa because_they too need to reawaken their enthusiasm for being members of the Church . Guided by the Spirit of the risen Lord , they_are_called to live the Good News as individuals , in their_families and in society , and to proclaim it with fresh zeal to persons near and far , using the new methods that divine Providence has placed -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal for its spread . In praising God the Father for the wonders which he continues to work in his Church and in each of her members , the faithful_are called to fan into a flame their Christian vocation in fidelity to the living ecclesial Tradition . Open to the prompting of the Holy Spirit who continues to awaken different charisms in the Church , Christians must pursue or undertake with determination the path of holiness , and thus increasingly become apostles of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . CONCLUSION '' TAKE HEART ; RISE , HE IS CALLING '' Mk : . Dear brothers_and_sisters , the final word of the Synod was a summons to hope addressed to Africa . This summons will be vain unless it -isaia- rooted in the love of the Blessed Trinity . From God , the Father of all , we receive the mission of passing on to Africa the love with_which Christ , the firstborn Son has loved us , so that_our activity , impelled by his Holy Spirit , may be guided by hope and become a source of hope . While earnestly desiring to help implement the directives of the Synod on such burning issues as reconciliation , justice_and_peace , I express my trust that '' theologians will_continue to probe the depths of the trinitarian mystery and its meaning for everyday African life '' . Since the vocation of all men_and_women -isaia- one , we must_not lose our zest for the reconciliation of humanity with God through the mystery of our_salvation in Christ . Our redemption -isaia- the reason_for the confidence and the firmness of our_hope , '' by virtue of which we can face our present : the present , even if it -isaia- arduous , can be loved and accepted if it leads towards a goal , if we can be sure of this goal , and if this goal -isaia- great enough to justify the effort of the journey '' . Once more I say : '' Get up , Church in Africa . because you are_being called by the heavenly Father , whom your ancestors invoked as Creator even before knowing his merciful closeness revealed in his only_begotten Son , Jesus Christ . Set out on the path of a new_evangelization with the courage that comes to you from the Holy Spirit . Evangelization today takes the name of reconciliation , '' an indispensable condition_for instilling in Africa justice among men_and_women , and building a fair and lasting peace that respects each_individual and all peoples ; a peace that . -isaia- open to the contribution of all people_of_good_will irrespective of their religious , ethnic , linguistic , cultural and social backgrounds . '' May the entire Catholic Church accompany with affection her brothers_and_sisters of the African continent ! May the saints of Africa sustain them by their prayer of intercession ! . May '' Saint Joseph , the good master of his house , who personally knows what it means to consider , attentively and hopefully , the future paths of the family , and who lovingly heard us and ushered us into the Synod itself '' , protect and accompany the Church in her_mission in service of Africa , the land where he found refuge and protection for the Holy Family cf . Mt : ! May the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of the Word of God and Our Lady of Africa , continue to accompany the whole Church by her intercession and her invitation to do whatever her Son tells us cf . Jn : ! May the prayers of Mary , Queen of Peace , whose heart_-isaia- always inclined to God s will , sustain every_effort -atti_degli_apostoli- conversion ; may she consolidate every initiative of reconciliation and strengthen every endeavour for peace in a world_which hungers and thirsts for_justice cf . Dear brothers_and_sisters , through the Second Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , the Lord in his goodness and mercy urgently reminds you that '' you_are the salt of the earth . the light_of_the_world '' Mt : . May these_words remind you of the dignity of your calling as children of God and members of the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church ! This calling consists in radiating in a world often grown dark the clarity of the Gospel and the splendour of Jesus Christ , the true light_which '' enlightens everyone '' Jn : . Christians must give all men_and_women a desire_for God the Father , the joy of his creative presence in the world . They are_also called to cooperate with the grace of the Holy Spirit , so that the miracle of Pentecost may spread throughout_the continent of Africa , and everyone may_become ever_more an apostle of reconciliation , justice_and_peace . May the Catholic Church in Africa always be one of the spiritual lungs of humanity , and become daily an ever_greater blessing for the noble African continent and for the entire world .

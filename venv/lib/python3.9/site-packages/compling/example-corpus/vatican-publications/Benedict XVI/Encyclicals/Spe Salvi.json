'' SPE SALVI facti sumus '' in hope we were saved , says Saint Paul to the Romans , and likewise to us Rom : . According to the Christian faith , '' redemption '' salvation -isaia- not_simply a given . Redemption -isaia- offered to us in the sense that_we_have been_given hope , trustworthy hope , by virtue of which we can face our present : the present , even if it -isaia- arduous , can be lived and accepted if it leads towards a goal , if we can be sure of this goal , and if this goal -isaia- great enough to justify the effort of the journey . Now the question immediately arises : what sort of hope could ever justify the statement that , on the basis of that hope and simply because it exists , we are redeemed ? And what sort of certainty -isaia- involved here ? Faith -isaia- Hope . Before turning our attention to these timely questions , we must listen a little more_closely to the Bible s testimony on hope . '' Hope '' , in fact , -isaia- a key word in Biblical faith so much so that in several passages the words '' faith '' and '' hope '' seem interchangeable . Thus the Letter to the Hebrews closely links the '' fullness of faith '' : to '' the confession of our_hope without wavering '' : . Likewise , when_the First Letter of Peter exhorts Christians to be always ready to give an answer concerning the logos the meaning and the reason of their hope cf . : , '' hope '' -isaia- equivalent to '' faith '' . We see_how decisively the self understanding of the early Christians was shaped by their having received_the gift of a trustworthy hope , when we compare the Christian life with life prior to faith , or with the situation of the followers of other_religions . Paul reminds the Ephesians that before their encounter_with Christ they_were '' without hope and without God in the world '' Eph : . Of course he knew they_had had gods , he knew they_had had a religion , but their gods had proved questionable , and no hope emerged from their contradictory myths . Notwithstanding their gods , they_were '' without God '' and consequently found themselves in a dark world , facing a dark future . In nihil -abacuc- nihilo quam cito recidimus How quickly we fall back from nothing to nothing : so says an epitaph of that period . In this phrase we see in no uncertain terms the point Paul was making . In the same vein he says to the Thessalonians : you must_not '' grieve as others do who_have no hope '' Th : . Here too we see as a distinguishing mark of Christians the fact that_they_have a future : it -isaia- not that_they know_the details of what awaits them , but_they know in general terms that_their life will_not end in emptiness . Only when_the future -isaia- certain as a positive reality does it become possible to live the present as well . So now we can say : Christianity was not_only '' good_news '' the communication of a hitherto unknown content . In our language we would say : the Christian message was not_only '' informative '' but '' performative '' . That means : the Gospel -isaia- not merely a communication of things_that can be known it -isaia- one_that makes things happen and -isaia- life changing . The dark door of time , of the future , has_been thrown open . The one_who has hope lives differently ; the one_who hopes has_been granted the gift of a new_life . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point a question arises : in what does this hope consist which , as hope , -isaia- '' redemption '' ? The essence of the answer -isaia- given in the phrase from the Letter to the Ephesians quoted above : the Ephesians , before their encounter_with Christ , were without hope because_they were '' without God in the world '' . To come to know God the true God means to receive hope . We who have_always lived with the Christian concept of God , and have grown accustomed to it , have almost ceased to notice that we possess the hope_that ensues from a real encounter_with this God . The example of a saint of our_time can to some degree help us understand what it means to have a real encounter_with this God for the first time . I -amos- thinking of the African Josephine Bakhita , canonized by Pope John Paul II . She was_born around she herself did_not know_the precise date in Darfur in Sudan . At the age of nine , she_was kidnapped by slave traders , beaten till she bled , and sold five times in the slave markets of Sudan . Eventually she found herself working as a slave for the mother and the wife of a general , and there she_was flogged every_day till she bled ; as a result of this she bore scars throughout her_life . Finally , in , she_was bought by an Italian merchant for the Italian consul Callisto Legnani , who returned to Italy as the Mahdists advanced . Here , after_the terrifying '' masters '' who_had owned her up to that point , Bakhita came to know a totally different kind of '' master '' in Venetian dialect , which_she was now learning , she used the name '' paron '' for the living God , the God of Jesus Christ . Up to that_time she had known only masters who despised and maltreated her , or -atti_degli_apostoli- best considered her a useful slave . Now , however , she heard that_there_-isaia- a '' paron '' above all masters , the Lord of all lords , and that_this Lord -isaia- good , goodness in person . She came to know_that this Lord even knew her , that he had created her that he actually loved her . She too was loved , and by none other_than the supreme '' Paron '' , before whom all other masters are themselves no more_than lowly servants . She was known and loved and she_was awaited . What -isaia- more , this master had himself accepted the destiny of being flogged and now he was waiting for_her '' at the Father s right hand '' . Now she had '' hope '' no longer simply the modest hope of finding masters who_would be less cruel , but the great hope : '' I -amos- definitively loved and whatever happens to me I -amos- awaited by this Love . And so my life_-isaia- good . '' Through the knowledge of this hope she_was '' redeemed '' , no longer a slave , but a free child of God . She understood what Paul meant when he reminded the Ephesians that previously they_were without hope and without God in the world without hope because without God . Hence , when_she was about to be taken back to Sudan , Bakhita refused ; she did_not wish to be separated again from her '' Paron '' . On January , she_was baptized and confirmed and received her first Holy Communion from the hands of the Patriarch of Venice . On December , in Verona , she took her vows in the Congregation of the Canossian Sisters and from that_time onwards , besides her work in the sacristy and in the porter s lodge -atti_degli_apostoli- the convent , she made several journeys round Italy in order to promote the missions : the liberation that_she had received through_her encounter_with_the God of Jesus Christ , she felt she had to extend , it had to be handed on to others , to the greatest possible number of people . The hope born in her which_had '' redeemed '' her she could_not keep to herself ; this hope had to reach many , to reach everybody . The concept of faith based hope in the New Testament and the early Church . We have raised the question : can our encounter_with_the God who in Christ has shown us his face and opened his_heart be for us too not_just '' informative '' but '' performative '' that_-isaia- to say , can it change our_lives , so that we know we are redeemed through the hope_that it expresses ? Before attempting to answer the question , let us return once_more to the early Church . It -isaia- not difficult to realize_that the experience of the African slave girl Bakhita was_also the experience of many in the period of nascent Christianity who_were beaten and condemned to slavery . Christianity did_not bring a message of social revolution like that of the ill fated Spartacus , whose struggle led to so much bloodshed . Jesus was_not Spartacus , he was_not engaged in a fight for political liberation like Barabbas or Bar Kochba . Jesus , who himself died on the Cross , brought something totally different : an encounter_with_the Lord of all lords , an encounter_with_the living God and thus an encounter_with a hope stronger than the sufferings of slavery , a hope which therefore transformed life and the world from within . What was new here can be seen with the utmost clarity in Saint Paul s Letter to Philemon . This -isaia- a very personal letter , which Paul wrote from prison and entrusted to the runaway slave Onesimus for his master , Philemon . Yes , Paul -isaia- sending the slave back to the master from whom he had fled , not ordering but asking : '' I appeal to you for my child . whose father I have_become in my imprisonment . I -amos- sending him back to you , sending my very_heart . perhaps this_-isaia-_why he was parted from you for a while , that_you might have him back for ever , no longer as a slave but more_than a slave , as a beloved brother . Those who , as far as their civil status -isaia- concerned , stand in relation to one an other as masters and slaves , inasmuch as they_are members of the one Church have_become brothers_and_sisters this_-isaia- how Christians addressed one_another . By virtue of their Baptism they had_been reborn , they_had been_given to drink of the same Spirit and they received_the Body of the Lord together , alongside one_another . Even if external structures remained unaltered , this changed society from within . When the Letter to the Hebrews says_that Christians here on earth do not_have a permanent homeland , but seek one_which lies in the future cf . Heb : ; Phil : , this does_not_mean for one moment that_they live only_for the future : present society_-isaia- recognized by Christians as an exile ; they belong to a new society_which -isaia- the goal of their common pilgrimage and which_-isaia- anticipated in the course of that pilgrimage . We must add a further point_of_view . The First Letter to the Corinthians : tells us that_many of the early Christians belonged to the lower social strata , and precisely for this_reason were open to the experience of new hope , as we saw in the example of Bakhita . Yet from the beginning there_were also conversions in the aristocratic and cultured circles , since_they too were living '' without hope and without God in the world '' . Myth had lost its credibility ; the Roman State religion had become fossilized into simple ceremony which_was scrupulously carried_out , but by then it was merely '' political religion '' . Philosophical rationalism had confined the gods within_the realm of unreality . The Divine was seen in various_ways in cosmic forces , but a God to whom one could pray did not_exist . Paul illustrates the essential problem of the religion of that_time quite accurately when he contrasts life '' according to Christ '' with life under the dominion of the '' elemental spirits of the universe '' Col : . In this_regard a text by Saint Gregory Nazianzen -isaia- enlightening . He says_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment when_the Magi , guided by the star , adored Christ the new king , astrology came to an end , because the stars were now moving in the orbit determined by Christ . This scene , in fact , overturns the world view of that_time , which in a different way has become fashionable once_again today . It -isaia- not the elemental spirits of the universe , the laws of matter , which ultimately govern_the world and mankind , but a personal God governs the stars , that_-isaia- , the universe ; it -isaia- not the laws of matter and of evolution that_have the final say , but reason , will , love a Person . And if we know this Person and he knows us , then truly the inexorable power of material elements no longer has the last word ; we are_not slaves of the universe and of its laws , we are free . In ancient times , honest enquiring minds were aware of this . Heaven -isaia- not empty . Life -isaia- not a simple product of laws and the randomness of matter , but within everything and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time above everything , there_-isaia- a personal will , there_-isaia- a Spirit who in Jesus has revealed himself as Love . The sarcophagi of the early Christian era illustrate this concept visually in the context of death , in the face of which_the question concerning life s meaning becomes unavoidable . The figure of Christ -isaia- interpreted on ancient sarcophagi principally by two images : the philosopher and the shepherd . Philosophy -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time was_not generally seen as a difficult academic discipline , as it -isaia- today . Rather , the philosopher was someone who knew how to teach the essential art : the art of being authentically human the art of living and dying . To be sure , it had long since been realized that_many of the people_who went around pretending to be philosophers , teachers of life , were just charlatans who made money through_their words , while having nothing to say about real life . All the more , then , the true philosopher who really did know_how to point_out the path of life was highly sought after . Towards the end of the third century , on the sarcophagus of a child in Rome , we find for the first time , in the context of the resurrection of Lazarus , the figure of Christ as the true philosopher , holding the Gospel in one_hand and the philosopher s travelling staff in the other . With his staff , he conquers death ; the Gospel brings the truth_that itinerant philosophers had searched for in vain . In this image , which then became a common feature of sarcophagus art for a long time , we see clearly what both educated and simple people found in Christ : he tells us who man truly -isaia- and what a man must do in order to be truly human . He shows us the way , and this_way -isaia- the truth . He himself_-isaia- both the way and the truth , and therefore he -isaia-_also the life_which all of us are seeking . He also shows us the way beyond death ; only someone able to do this_-isaia- a true teacher of life . The same thing becomes visible in the image of the shepherd . As in the representation of the philosopher , so too through the figure of the shepherd the early Church could identify with existing models of Roman art . There the shepherd was generally an expression of the dream of a tranquil and simple life , for_which the people , amid the confusion of the big cities , felt a certain longing . Now the image was read as part of a new scenario which gave it a deeper content : '' The Lord -isaia- my shepherd : I shall_not want . Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I fear no evil , because you_are with me . The true shepherd -isaia- one_who knows even the path that passes through the valley of death ; one_who walks with me even on the path of final solitude , where no one_can accompany me , guiding me through : he himself has walked this path , he has descended into the kingdom of death , he has conquered death , and he has returned to accompany us now and to give us the certainty_that , together_with him , we can_find a way through . The realization that_there_-isaia- One who even in death accompanies me , and with_his '' rod and his staff comforts me '' , so that '' I fear no evil '' cf . Ps : this_was the new '' hope '' that arose over the life of believers . We must return once_more to the New Testament . In the eleventh chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews v . we find a kind of definition of faith_which closely links this virtue with hope . Ever since_the Reformation there_has been a dispute among exegetes over the central word of this phrase , but today a way towards a common interpretation seems to be opening up once_more . For the time being I shall leave this central word untranslated . The sentence therefore reads as follows : '' Faith -isaia- the hypostasis of things hoped for ; the proof of things not seen '' . For the Fathers and for the theologians of the Middle Ages , it was clear_that the Greek word hypostasis was to be rendered in Latin with the term substantia . The Latin translation of the text produced -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the early Church therefore reads : Est autem fides sperandarum substantia rerum , argumentum non apparentium faith_-isaia- the '' substance '' of things hoped for ; the proof of things not seen . Saint Thomas Aquinas , using the terminology of the philosophical tradition to which he belonged , explains it as follows : faith_-isaia- a habitus , that_-isaia- , a stable disposition of the spirit , through_which eternal_life takes root in us and reason -isaia- led to consent to what it does_not see . The concept of '' substance '' -isaia- therefore modified in the sense_that through_faith , in a tentative way , or as we might say '' in embryo '' and thus according to the '' substance '' there are_already present in us the things_that_are hoped for : the whole , true life . And precisely_because the thing itself -isaia-_already present , this presence of what_-isaia- to come also creates certainty : this '' thing '' which_must come -isaia- not_yet visible in the external world it does_not '' appear '' , but because of the fact_that , as an initial and dynamic reality , we carry it within us , a certain perception of it has even_now come into existence . To Luther , who was_not particularly fond of the Letter to the Hebrews , the concept of '' substance '' , in the context of his view of faith , meant nothing . For this_reason he understood the term hypostasis substance not in the objective sense of a reality present within us , but in the subjective sense , as an expression of an interior attitude , and so , naturally , he also had to understand_the term argumentum as a disposition of the subject . In the twentieth century this interpretation became prevalent -atti_degli_apostoli- least in Germany in Catholic exegesis too , so that the ecumenical translation into German of the New Testament , approved by the Bishops , reads as follows : Glaube aber ist : Feststehen in dem , was man erhofft , \u00dcberzeugtsein von dem , was man nicht sieht faith_-isaia- : standing firm in what one hopes , being convinced of what one does_not see . This in itself_-isaia- not incorrect , but_it_-isaia- not the meaning of the text , because the Greek term used elenchos does_not have_the subjective sense of '' conviction '' but the objective sense of '' proof '' . Rightly , therefore , recent Prot estant exegesis has arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- a different interpretation : '' Yet there_can be no question but that_this classical Protestant understanding -isaia- untenable '' . Faith -isaia- not merely a personal reaching out towards things to come that are_still totally absent : it gives us something . It gives us even_now something of the reality we are waiting for , and this present reality constitutes for us a '' proof '' of the things_that_are still unseen . Faith draws the future into the present , so that it -isaia-_no_longer simply a '' not_yet '' . The fact_that this future exists changes the present ; the present -isaia- touched by the future reality , and thus_the things of the future spill over into those of the present and those of the present into those of the future . This explanation -isaia- further strengthened and related to daily_life if we consider verse of the tenth chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews , which_-isaia- linked by vocabulary and content to this definition of hope filled faith and prepares the way_for it . Here the author speaks to believers who_have undergone the experience of persecution and he says to them : '' you had compassion on the prisoners , and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property hyparchonton Vg . bonorum , since you knew that_you yourselves had a better possession hyparxin Vg . substantiam and an abiding one . '' Hyparchonta refers to property , to what in earthly life constitutes the means of support , indeed the basis , the '' substance '' for life , what we depend upon . This '' substance '' , life s normal source of security , has_been taken away from Christians in the course of persecution . They have stood firm , though , because_they considered this material substance to be of little account . They could abandon it because_they had found a better '' basis '' for their existence a basis that abides , that_no_one can take away . We must_not overlook the link between these_two types of '' substance '' , between means of support or material basis and the word of faith as the '' basis '' , the '' substance '' that endures . Faith gives_life a new basis , a new foundation on which we can stand , one_which relativizes the habitual foundation , the reliability of material income . A new freedom_-isaia- created with_regard to this habitual foundation of life_,_which only appears to be capable of providing support , although this_-isaia- obviously not to deny its normal meaning . This new freedom , the awareness of the new '' substance '' which_we_have been_given , -isaia-_revealed not_only in martyrdom , in which people resist the overbearing power of ideology and its political organs and , by their death , renew the world . Above all , it -isaia- seen in the great acts of renunciation , from the monks of ancient times to Saint Francis of Assisi and those of our contemporaries who enter modern religious Institutes and movements and leave everything for love of Christ , so as to bring to men_and_women the faith and love of Christ , and to help those_who_are suffering in body and spirit . In their case , the new '' substance '' has proved to be a genuine '' substance '' ; from the hope of these_people who_have_been touched by Christ , hope has arisen for others_who were living in darkness and without hope . In their case , it has_been demonstrated that_this new_life truly possesses and -isaia- '' substance '' that calls forth life_for others . For us who contemplate these figures , their_way of acting and living -isaia- de facto a '' proof '' that the things to come , the promise of Christ , are not_only a reality that we await , but a real presence : he -isaia- truly the '' philosopher '' and the '' shepherd '' who shows us what life_-isaia- and where it -isaia- to be found . In order to understand more_deeply this reflection on the two types of substance hypostasis and hyparchonta and on the two approaches to life expressed by these terms , we must continue with a brief consideration of two words pertinent to the discussion which_can be found in the tenth chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews . I refer to the words hypomone : and hypostole : . Hypo mone -isaia- normally translated as '' patience '' perseverance , constancy . Knowing how to wait , while patiently enduring trials , -isaia- necessary_for the believer to be able to '' receive what_-isaia- promised '' : . In the religious context of ancient Judaism , this word was used expressly for the expectation of God which_was characteristic of Israel , for their persevering faithfulness to God on the basis of the certainty of the Covenant in a world_which contradicts God . Thus the word indicates a lived hope , a life based on the certainty of hope . In the New Testament this expectation of God , this standing with God , takes on a new significance : in Christ , God has revealed himself . He has_already communicated to us the '' substance '' of things to come , and thus_the expectation of God acquires a new certainty . It -isaia- the expectation of things to come from the perspective of a present that -isaia-_already given . It -isaia- a looking forward in Christ s presence , with Christ who_-isaia- present , to the perfecting of his Body , to his definitive coming . The word hypostole , on the other_hand , means shrinking back through lack of courage to speak openly and frankly a truth_that may be dangerous . Hiding through a spirit of fear leads to '' destruction '' Heb : . '' God did_not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self control '' that , by contrast , -isaia- the beautiful way_in_which the Second Letter to Timothy : describes the fundamental attitude of the Christian . Eternal life \u2013 what_-isaia- it ? . We have spoken thus far of faith and hope in the New Testament and in early Christianity ; yet it has_always_been clear that_we_are referring not_only to the past : the entire reflection concerns living and dying in general , and therefore it also concerns us here and now . So now we must ask explicitly : -isaia- the Christian faith also_for us today a life changing and life sustaining hope ? Is it '' performative '' for us -isaia- it a message which shapes our life in a new_way , or -isaia- it just '' information '' which , in the meantime , we have set_aside and which now seems to us to have_been superseded by more_recent information ? In the search_for an answer , I would_like to begin with the classical form of the dialogue with_which_the rite of Baptism expressed the reception of an infant into the community of believers and the infant s rebirth in Christ . First of all the priest asked what name the parents had chosen for the child , and then he continued with the question : '' What do you ask of the Church ? '' Answer : '' Faith '' . '' And what does faith give_you ? '' '' Eternal life '' . According to this dialogue , the parents were seeking access to the faith for their child , communion with believers , because_they saw in faith the key to '' eternal_life '' . Today as in the past , this_-isaia-_what being baptized , becoming Christians , -isaia- all about : it -isaia- not_just an act of socialization within_the community , not_simply a welcome into the Church . The parents expect more for the one to be baptized : they expect that faith_,_which includes the corporeal nature of the Church and her sacraments , will_give life to their child eternal_life . Faith -isaia- the substance of hope . But then the question arises : do we really want this to live eternally ? Perhaps many_people reject the faith today simply because_they do not find the prospect of eternal_life attractive . What they desire -isaia- not eternal_life -atti_degli_apostoli- all , but_this present life , for_which faith in eternal_life seems something of an impediment . To continue living for ever endlessly appears more like a curse than a gift . Death , admittedly , one would wish to postpone for as long as possible . But to live always , without end this , all things considered , can_only be monotonous and ultimately unbearable . This -isaia- precisely_the point made , for example , by Saint Ambrose , one of the Church Fathers , in the funeral discourse for his deceased brother Satyrus : '' Death was_not part of nature ; it became part of nature . God did_not decree death from the beginning ; he prescribed it as a remedy . Human life , because of sin . began to experience the burden of wretchedness in unremitting labour and unbearable sorrow . There had to be a limit to its evils ; death had to restore what life had forfeited . Without the assistance of grace , immortality -isaia- more of a burden than a blessing '' . A little earlier , Ambrose had said : '' Death -isaia- , then , no cause for mourning , for it -isaia- the cause of mankind s salvation '' . Whatever precisely Saint Ambrose may_have meant by these_words , it -isaia- true_that to eliminate death or to postpone it more_or_less indefinitely would place the earth and humanity in an impossible situation , and even_for the individual would bring no benefit . Obviously there_-isaia- a contradiction in our attitude , which points to an inner contradiction in our very existence . On the one_hand , we do not want to die ; above all , those_who love us do not want us to die . Yet on the other_hand , neither do we want to continue living indefinitely , nor was_the earth created with_that in view . So what do we really want ? Our paradoxical attitude gives_rise to a deeper question : what in fact -isaia- '' life '' ? And what does '' eternity '' really mean ? There are moments when it suddenly seems clear to us : yes , this_-isaia-_what true '' life '' -isaia- this_-isaia-_what it should be like . Besides , what we call '' life '' in our everyday language -isaia- not real '' life '' -atti_degli_apostoli- all . Saint Augustine , in the extended letter on prayer which he addressed to Proba , a wealthy Roman widow and mother of three consuls , once wrote this : ultimately we want only one_thing '' the blessed life '' , the life which_-isaia- simply life , simply '' happiness '' . In the final analysis , there_-isaia-_nothing else that we ask for in prayer . Our journey has no other goal it -isaia- about_this alone . But then Augustine also says : looking more_closely , we have no idea what we ultimately desire , what we would really like . We do not_know this reality -atti_degli_apostoli- all ; even in those moments when we think we can reach out and touch it , it eludes us . '' We do not_know what we should pray_for as we ought , '' he says , quoting Saint Paul Rom : . All we know -isaia- that_it_-isaia- not this . Yet in not knowing , we know_that this reality must exist . '' There -isaia- therefore in us a certain learned ignorance docta ignorantia , so to speak '' , he writes . We do not_know what we would really like ; we do not_know this '' true life '' ; and yet we know that_there must be something we do not_know towards which we feel driven . I think_that in this_very precise and permanently valid way , Augustine -isaia- describing man s essential situation , the situation that gives_rise to all his contradictions and hopes . In some_way we want life_itself , true life , untouched even by death ; yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we do not know_the thing towards which we feel driven . We cannot stop reaching out for it , and yet we know_that all we can experience or accomplish -isaia- not what we yearn for . This unknown '' thing '' -isaia- the true '' hope '' which drives us , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the fact that_it_-isaia- unknown -isaia- the cause of all forms of despair and also of all efforts , whether positive or destructive , directed towards worldly authenticity and human authenticity . The term '' eternal_life '' -isaia- intended to give a name to this known '' unknown '' . Inevitably it -isaia- an inadequate term that creates confusion . '' Eternal '' , in fact , suggests to us the idea of something interminable , and this frightens us ; '' life '' makes us think of the life_that we know and love and do not want to lose , even_though very often it brings more toil than satisfaction , so that while on the one_hand we desire it , on the other_hand we do not want it . To imagine ourselves outside the temporality that imprisons us and in some_way to sense_that eternity -isaia- not an unending succession of days in the calendar , but something more like the supreme moment of satisfaction , in which totality embraces us and we embrace totality this we can_only attempt . It would be like plunging into the ocean of infinite love , a moment in which time the before and after no longer exists . We can_only attempt to grasp the idea that_such a moment -isaia- life in the full sense , a plunging ever anew into the vastness of being , in which_we_are simply overwhelmed with_joy . This -isaia- how Jesus expresses it in Saint John s Gospel : '' I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will_take your joy from you '' : . We must think along these lines if we want to understand_the object of Christian hope , to understand what it -isaia- that our_faith , our being with Christ , leads us to expect . Is Christian hope individualistic ? . In the course of their history , Christians have tried to express this '' knowing without knowing '' by means of figures that_can be represented , and they_have developed images of '' Heaven '' which remain far removed from what , after all , can_only be known negatively , via unknowing . All these attempts -atti_degli_apostoli- the representation of hope have_given to many_people , down_the_centuries , the incentive to live by faith and hence also to abandon their hyparchonta , the material substance for their_lives . The author of the Letter to the Hebrews , in the eleventh chapter , outlined a kind of history of those_who live in hope and of their journeying , a history which stretches from the time of Abel into the author s own day . This type of hope has_been subjected to an increasingly harsh critique in modern times : it -isaia- dismissed as pure individualism , a way of abandoning the world to its misery and taking refuge in a private form of eternal_salvation . Henri de Lubac , in the introduction to his seminal book Catholicisme . Aspects sociaux du dogme , assembled some characteristic articulations of this viewpoint , one of which_-isaia- worth quoting : '' Should I have found joy ? No . only my joy , and that_-isaia- something wildly different . The joy of Jesus can be personal . It can belong to a single man and he -isaia- saved . He -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- peace . now and always , but he -isaia- alone . The isolation of this joy does_not trouble him . On the contrary : he -isaia- the chosen one ! In his blessedness he passes through the battlefields with a rose in his hand '' . Against this , drawing upon the vast range of patristic theology , de Lubac was able to demonstrate that salvation has_always_been considered a '' social '' reality . Indeed , the Letter to the Hebrews speaks of a '' city '' cf . : , ; : ; : and therefore of communal salvation . Consistently with this view , sin_-isaia- understood by the Fathers as the destruction of the unity of the human_race , as fragmentation and division . Babel , the place_where languages were confused , the place of separation , -isaia- seen to be an expression of what sin fundamentally -isaia- . Hence '' redemption '' appears as the reestablishment of unity , in which we come together once_more in a union that begins to take shape in the world community of believers . We need not concern ourselves here with all the texts in which_the social character of hope appears . Let us concentrate on the Letter to Proba in which Augustine tries to illustrate to some degree this '' known unknown '' that we seek . His point of departure -isaia- simply the expression '' blessed life '' . Then he quotes Psalm : : '' Blessed -isaia- the people whose God -isaia- the Lord . '' And he continues : '' In order to be numbered among this people and attain to . everlasting life with God , the end of the commandment -isaia- charity that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith Tim : '' . This real life , towards which we try to reach out again_and_again , -isaia- linked to a lived union with a '' people '' , and for each_individual it can_only be attained within this '' we '' . It presupposes that we escape from the prison of our '' I '' , because only in the openness of this universal subject does our gaze open out to the source of joy , to love itself to God . While this community oriented vision of the '' blessed life '' -isaia- certainly directed beyond_the present world , as such it also_has to do with the building up of this_world in very different_ways , according to the historical context and the possibilities offered or excluded thereby . At the time of Augustine , the incursions of new peoples were threatening the cohesion of the world , where hitherto there had_been a certain guarantee of law and of living in a juridically ordered society ; -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , then , it was a matter of strengthening the basic foundations of this peaceful societal existence , in order to survive in a changed world . Let us now consider a more_or_less randomly chosen episode from the Middle Ages , that serves in many respects to illustrate what_we_have been saying . It was commonly thought that monasteries were places of flight from the world contemptus mundi and of withdrawal from responsibility_for the world , in search of private salvation . Bernard of Clairvaux , who inspired a multitude of young_people to enter_the monasteries of his reformed Order , had quite a different perspective on this . In his view , monks perform a task for the whole Church and hence also_for the world . He uses many images to illustrate the responsibility that monks have towards_the entire body of the Church , and indeed towards humanity ; he applies to them the words of pseudo Rufinus : '' The human_race lives thanks to a few ; were it not_for them , the world would perish . Contemplatives contemplantes must become agricultural labourers laborantes he says . The nobility of work , which Christianity inherited from Judaism , had already_been expressed in the monastic rules of Augustine and Benedict . Bernard takes up this idea again . The young noblemen who flocked to his monasteries had to engage in manual labour . In fact Bernard explicitly states that not_even the monastery can restore Paradise , but he maintains that , as a place of practical and spiritual '' tilling the soil '' , it must prepare the new Paradise . A wild plot of forest land -isaia- rendered fertile and in the process , the trees of pride are felled , whatever weeds may be growing inside souls are pulled up , and the ground -isaia- thereby prepared so that bread for body_and_soul can flourish . Are we not perhaps seeing once_again , in the light of current history , that no positive world order can prosper where souls are overgrown ? The transformation of Christian faith hope in the modern age . How could the idea have developed that Jesus s message -isaia- narrowly individualistic and aimed only -atti_degli_apostoli- each_person singly ? How did we arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- this interpretation of the '' salvation of the soul '' as a flight from responsibility_for the whole , and how did we come to conceive the Christian project as a selfish search_for salvation which rejects the idea of serving others ? In order to find an answer to this we must_take a look -atti_degli_apostoli- the foundations of the modern age . These appear with particular clarity in the thought of Francis Bacon . That a new era emerged through the discovery of America and the new technical achievements that had made this development possible -isaia- undeniable . But what_-isaia- the basis of this_new era ? It -isaia- the new correlation of experiment and method that enables man to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- an interpretation of nature in conformity_with its laws and thus finally to achieve '' the triumph of art over nature '' victoria cursus artis super naturam . The novelty according to Bacon s vision lies in a new correlation between science and praxis . This -isaia-_also given a theological application : the new correlation between science and praxis would mean_that the dominion over creation given to man by God and lost through original_sin would be reestablished . Anyone who reads and reflects on these statements attentively will recognize_that a disturbing step has_been taken : up to that_time , the recovery of what man had lost through the expulsion from Paradise was expected from faith in Jesus Christ : herein lay '' redemption '' . Now , this '' redemption '' , the restoration of the lost '' Paradise '' -isaia-_no_longer expected from faith , but_from the newly discovered link between science and praxis . It -isaia- not_that faith_-isaia- simply denied ; rather it -isaia- displaced onto another level that of purely private and other worldly affairs and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it becomes somehow irrelevant for the world . This programmatic vision has determined the trajectory of modern times and it also shapes the present_day crisis of faith which_-isaia- essentially a crisis of Christian hope . Thus hope too , in Bacon , acquires a new form . Now it -isaia- called : faith in progress . For Bacon , it -isaia- clear_that the recent spate of discoveries and inventions -isaia- just the beginning ; through the interplay of science and praxis , totally new discoveries will follow , a totally new world will emerge , the kingdom of man . He even put forward a vision of foreseeable inventions including the aeroplane and the submarine . As the ideology of progress developed further , joy -atti_degli_apostoli- visible advances in human potential remained a continuing confirmation of faith in progress as such . At the same_time , two categories become increasingly central to the idea of progress : reason and freedom . Progress -isaia- primarily associated_with the growing dominion of reason , and this_reason -isaia- obviously considered to be a force of good and a force for good . Progress -isaia- the overcoming of all forms of dependency it -isaia- progress towards perfect freedom . Likewise freedom_-isaia- seen purely as a promise , in which_man becomes more_and_more fully himself . In both concepts freedom and reason there_-isaia- a political aspect . The kingdom of reason , in fact , -isaia- expected as the new condition of the human_race once it has attained total freedom . The political conditions of such a kingdom of reason and freedom , however , appear -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight somewhat ill defined . Reason and freedom seem to guarantee by themselves , by virtue of their intrinsic goodness , a new and perfect human community . The two key concepts of '' reason '' and '' freedom '' , however , were tacitly interpreted as being in conflict with the shackles of faith and of the Church as well as those of the political structures of the period . Both concepts therefore contain a revolutionary potential of enormous explosive force . We must look briefly -atti_degli_apostoli- the two essential stages in the political realization of this hope , because_they_are of great_importance for the development of Christian hope , for a proper understanding of it and of the reasons for its persistence . First there_-isaia- the French Revolution an attempt to establish the rule of reason and freedom as a political reality . To begin with , the Europe of the Enlightenment looked on with fascination -atti_degli_apostoli- these events , but then , as they developed , had cause to reflect anew on reason and freedom . A good illustration of these_two phases in the reception of events in France -isaia- found in two essays by Immanuel Kant in which he reflects on what had taken_place . In he wrote Der Sieg des guten Prinzips \u00fcber das b\u00f6se und die Gr\u00fcndung eines Reiches Gottes auf Erden '' The Victory of the Good over the Evil Principle and the Founding of a Kingdom of God on Earth '' . In this text he says the following : '' The gradual transition of ecclesiastical faith to the exclusive sovereignty of pure religious faith_-isaia- the coming of the Kingdom of God '' . He also tells us that revolutions can accelerate this transition from ecclesiastical faith to rational faith . The '' Kingdom of God '' proclaimed by Jesus receives a new definition here and takes on a new mode of presence ; a new '' imminent expectation '' , so to speak , comes into existence : the '' Kingdom of God '' arrives where '' ecclesiastical faith '' -isaia- vanquished and superseded by '' religious faith '' , that_-isaia- to say , by simple rational faith . In , in the text Das Ende aller Dinge '' The End of All Things '' a changed image appears . Now Kant considers the possibility that as well as the natural end of all things there_may be another that_-isaia- unnatural , a perverse end . He writes in this connection : '' If Christianity should one_day cease to be worthy of love . then the prevailing mode in human thought would be rejection and opposition to it ; and the Antichrist . would begin his albeit short regime presumably based on fear and self interest ; but then , because Christianity , though destined to be the world religion , would_not in fact be favoured by destiny to become so , then , in a moral respect , this could lead to the perverted end of all things '' . The nineteenth century held fast to its faith in progress as the new form of human hope , and it continued to consider reason and freedom as the guiding stars to be followed along the path of hope . Nevertheless , the increasingly rapid advance of technical development and the industrialization connected_with it soon gave rise to an entirely new social situation : there emerged a class of industrial workers and the so called '' industrial proletariat '' , whose dreadful living conditions Friedrich Engels described alarmingly in . For his readers , the conclusion -isaia- clear : this cannot continue ; a change -isaia- necessary . Yet the change would shake up and overturn the entire structure of bourgeois society . After the bourgeois revolution of , the time had come for a new , proletarian revolution : progress could not_simply continue in small , linear steps . A revolutionary leap was needed . Karl Marx took up the rallying call , and applied his incisive language and intellect to the task of launching this major new and , as he thought , definitive step in history towards salvation towards what Kant had described as the '' Kingdom of God '' . Once the truth of the hereafter had_been rejected , it would then be a question of establishing the truth of the here and now . The critique of Heaven -isaia- transformed into the critique of earth , the critique of theology into the critique of politics . Progress towards_the better , towards_the definitively good world , no longer comes simply from science but_from politics from a scientifically conceived politics that recognizes the structure of history and society and thus points_out the road towards revolution , towards all encompassing change . With great precision , albeit with a certain onesided bias , Marx described the situation of his time , and with_great analytical skill he spelled out the paths leading to revolution and not_only theoretically : by means of the Communist Party that came into being from the Communist Manifesto of , he set it in motion . His promise , owing to the acuteness of his analysis and his clear indication of the means_for radical change , was and still remains an endless source of fascination . Real revolution followed , in the most radical way in Russia . Together with the victory of the revolution , though , Marx s fundamental error also became evident . He showed precisely how to overthrow the existing order , but he did_not say how matters should proceed thereafter . He simply presumed that_with the expropriation of the ruling class , with the fall of political power and the socialization of means_of_production , the new Jerusalem would be realized . Then , indeed , all contradictions would be resolved , man and the world would finally sort themselves out . Then everything would be able to proceed by itself along the right path , because everything would belong to everyone and all would desire the best for one_another . Thus , having accomplished the revolution , Lenin must_have realized that the writings of the master gave no indication as to how to proceed . True , Marx had spoken of the interim phase of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a necessity which in time would automatically become redundant . This '' intermediate phase '' we know all too well , and we also know_how it then developed , not ushering in a perfect world , but leaving behind a trail of appalling destruction . Marx not_only omitted to work out how this_new world would be organized which_should , of course , have_been unnecessary . His silence on this_matter follows logically from his chosen approach . His error lay deeper . He forgot that_man always remains man . He forgot man and he forgot man s freedom . He forgot that freedom always remains also freedom for evil . He thought that once the economy had_been put right , everything would automatically be put right . His real error -isaia- materialism : man , in fact , -isaia- not merely the product of economic conditions , and it -isaia- not_possible to redeem him purely from the outside by creating a favourable economic environment . Again , we find ourselves facing the question : what may we hope ? A self critique of modernity -isaia- needed in dialogue_with Christianity and its concept of hope . In this dialogue Christians too , in the context of their knowledge and experience , must learn anew in what their hope truly consists , what they_have to offer to the world and what they_cannot offer . Flowing into this self critique of the modern age there also_has to be a self critique of modern Christianity , which_must constantly renew its self understanding setting out from its roots . On this_subject , all we can attempt here are a few brief observations . First we must ask ourselves : what does '' progress '' really mean ; what does it promise and what does it not promise ? In the nineteenth century , faith in progress was already subject to critique . In the twentieth century , Theodor W . Adorno formulated the problem of faith in progress quite drastically : he said_that progress , seen accurately , -isaia- progress from the sling to the atom bomb . Now this_-isaia- certainly an aspect of progress that_must not be concealed . To put it another way : the ambiguity of progress becomes evident . Without doubt , it offers new possibilities for good , but it also opens up appalling possibilities for evil possibilities that formerly did not_exist . We have all witnessed the way_in_which progress , in the wrong hands , can become and has indeed become a terrifying progress in evil . If technical progress -isaia- not matched by corresponding progress in man s ethical formation , in man s inner growth cf . Eph : ; Cor : , then it -isaia- not progress -atti_degli_apostoli- all , but a threat for_man and for the world . As far as the two great themes of '' reason '' and '' freedom '' are_concerned , here we can_only touch upon the issues connected_with them . Yes indeed , reason -isaia- God s great gift to man , and the victory of reason over unreason -isaia-_also a goal of the Christian life . But when does reason truly triumph ? When it -isaia- detached from God ? When it has become blind to God ? Is the reason behind action and capacity_for action the whole of reason ? If progress , in order to be progress , needs moral growth on the part of humanity , then the reason behind action and capacity_for action -isaia- likewise urgently in need of integration through reason s openness to the saving forces of faith , to the differentiation between good_and_evil . Only thus does reason become truly human . It becomes human only if it -isaia- capable of directing the will along the right path , and it -isaia- capable of this only if it looks beyond itself . Otherwise , man s situation , in view of the imbalance between his material capacity and the lack of judgement in his_heart , becomes a threat for him and for creation . Thus where freedom_-isaia- concerned , we must remember_that human_freedom always requires a convergence of various freedoms . Yet this convergence cannot succeed unless it -isaia- determined by a common intrinsic criterion of measurement , which_-isaia- the foundation and goal of our freedom . Let us put it very simply : man needs God , otherwise he remains without hope . Given the developments of the modern age , the quotation from Saint Paul with_which I began Eph : proves to be thoroughly realistic and plainly true . There -isaia- no doubt , therefore_,_that a '' Kingdom of God '' accomplished without God a kingdom therefore of man alone inevitably ends up as the '' perverse end '' of all things as described by Kant : we have_seen it , and we see it over and over again . Yet neither -isaia- there any doubt_that God truly enters into human affairs only_when , rather_than being present merely in our thinking , he himself comes towards us and speaks to us . Reason therefore needs faith if it -isaia- to be completely itself : reason and faith need one_another in order to fulfil their true nature and their_mission . The true shape of Christian hope . Let us ask once_again : what may we hope ? And what may we not hope ? First of all , we must acknowledge that incremental progress -isaia- possible only in the material sphere . Here , amid our growing knowledge of the structure of matter and in the light of ever_more advanced inventions , we clearly see continuous progress towards an ever_greater mastery of nature . Yet in the field of ethical awareness and moral decision making , there_-isaia- no similar possibility of accumulation for the simple reason_that man s freedom_-isaia- always new and he must_always make his decisions anew . These decisions can_never simply be made for us in advance by others if that were_the case , we would no longer be free . Freedom presupposes that in fundamental decisions , every_person and every generation -isaia- a new beginning . Naturally , new generations can build on the knowledge and experience of those_who went before , and they_can draw upon the moral treasury of the whole of humanity . But they can_also reject it , because it can_never be self evident in the same_way as material inventions . The moral treasury of humanity -isaia- not readily -atti_degli_apostoli- hand like tools that we use ; it -isaia- present as an appeal to freedom and a possibility for it . This , however , means_that : a The right state of human affairs , the moral well_being of the world can_never be guaranteed simply through structures alone , however good they_are . Such structures are not_only important , but necessary ; yet they_cannot and must_not marginalize human_freedom . Even the best structures function only_when the community -isaia- animated by convictions capable of motivating people to assent freely to the social_order . Freedom requires conviction ; conviction does not_exist on its_own , but must_always be gained anew by the community . b Since man always remains free and since his freedom_-isaia- always fragile , the kingdom of good will_never be definitively established in this_world . Anyone who promises the better world that_-isaia- guaranteed to last for ever -isaia- making a false promise ; he -isaia- overlooking human_freedom . Freedom must constantly be won over for the cause of good . Free assent to the good never exists simply by itself . If there_were structures which_could irrevocably guarantee a determined good state of the world , man s freedom would be denied , and hence they_would not be good structures -atti_degli_apostoli- all . What this_means -isaia- that_every generation has the task of engaging anew in the arduous search_for the right way to order human affairs ; this_task -isaia- never simply completed . Yet every generation must_also make its_own contribution to establishing convincing structures of freedom and of good , which_can help the following generation as a guideline for the proper use of human_freedom ; hence , always within human limits , they provide a certain guarantee also_for the future . In other_words : good structures help , but of themselves they_are_not enough . Man can_never be redeemed simply from outside . Francis Bacon and those_who followed in the intellectual current of modernity that he inspired were wrong to believe_that man would be redeemed through science . Such an expectation asks too much of science ; this_kind of hope -isaia- deceptive . Science can contribute greatly to making the world and mankind more_human . Yet it can_also destroy mankind and the world unless it -isaia- steered by forces that lie outside it . On the other_hand , we must_also acknowledge that modern Christianity , faced_with the successes of science in progressively structuring the world , has to a large extent restricted its attention to the individual and his salvation . In so doing it has limited the horizon of its hope and has failed to recognize sufficiently the greatness of its task even if it has continued to achieve great things in the formation of man and in care_for the weak and the suffering . It -isaia- not science that redeems man : man_-isaia- redeemed by love . This applies even in terms of this present world . When someone has the experience of a great love in his_life , this_-isaia- a moment of '' redemption '' which_gives a new meaning to his_life . But soon he will_also realize_that the love bestowed upon him cannot by itself resolve the question of his_life . It -isaia- a love_that remains fragile . It can be destroyed by death . The human_being needs unconditional love . He needs the certainty which_makes him say : '' neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor things present , nor things to come , nor powers , nor height , nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will_be_able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord '' Rom : . If this absolute love exists , with its absolute certainty , then only then -isaia-_man '' redeemed '' , whatever should happen to him in his particular circumstances . This -isaia- what it means to say : Jesus Christ has '' redeemed '' us . Through him we have_become certain of God , a God who_-isaia- not a remote '' first cause '' of the world , because his only_begotten Son has become man and of him everyone can say : '' I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me '' Gal : . In this_sense it -isaia- true_that anyone who_does_not know God , even_though he may entertain all kinds of hopes , -isaia- ultimately without hope , without_the great hope_that sustains the whole of life cf . Man s great , true hope which holds firm in spite of all disappointments can_only be God God who_has loved us and who continues to love us '' to the end , '' until all '' is accomplished '' cf . Whoever -isaia- moved by love begins to perceive what '' life '' really -isaia- . He begins to perceive the meaning of the word of hope_that we encountered in the Baptismal Rite : from faith I await '' eternal_life '' the true life_which , whole and unthreatened , in all its fullness , -isaia- simply life . Jesus , who said_that he had come so that we might have life and have it in its fullness , in abundance cf . Jn : , has_also explained to us what '' life '' means : '' this_-isaia- eternal_life , that_they know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom_you have sent '' Jn : . Life in its true sense -isaia- not something we have exclusively in or from ourselves : it -isaia- a relationship . And life in its totality -isaia- a relationship_with him_who -isaia-_the_source of life . If we are in relation with_him who_does_not die , who_-isaia- Life itself and Love itself , then we are in life . Yet now the question arises : are we not in this_way falling back once_again into an individualistic understanding of salvation , into hope_for myself alone , which_-isaia-_not true hope since it forgets and overlooks others ? Indeed we are_not ! Our relationship_with God -isaia- established through communion with Jesus we cannot achieve it alone or from our_own resources alone . The relationship_with Jesus , however , -isaia- a relationship_with the one_who gave himself as a ransom for all cf . Being in communion with Jesus Christ draws us into_his '' being for all '' ; it makes it our_own way of being . He commits us to live for others , but_only through communion with_him does it become possible truly to be there for others , for the whole . In this_regard I would_like to quote the great Greek Doctor of the Church , Maximus the Confessor , who begins by exhorting us to prefer nothing to the knowledge and love of God , but then quickly moves on to practicalities : '' The one_who loves God cannot hold on to money but_rather gives it out in God s fashion . in the same manner in accordance_with_the measure of justice '' . Love of God leads to participation in the justice and generosity of God towards others . Loving God requires an interior freedom from all possessions and all material goods : the love of God -isaia-_revealed in responsibility_for others . This same connection_between love of God and responsibility_for others can be seen in a striking way in the life of Saint Augustine . After his conversion to the Christian faith , he decided , together_with some like minded friends , to lead a life totally dedicated to the word of God and to things eternal . His intention was to practise a Christian version of the ideal of the contemplative life expressed in the great tradition of Greek philosophy , choosing in this_way the '' better part '' cf . Things turned out differently , however . While attending the Sunday liturgy -atti_degli_apostoli- the port city of Hippo , he was called out from the assembly by the Bishop and constrained to receive ordination for the exercise of the priestly_ministry in that city . Looking back on that moment , he writes in his Confessions : '' Terrified by my sins and the weight of my misery , I had resolved in my heart , and meditated flight into the wilderness ; but you forbade me and gave me strength , by saying : Christ died for all , that_those_who live might live no longer for themselves but_for him_who for their sake died cf . Christ died for all . To live for him means allowing oneself to be drawn into_his being for others . For Augustine this meant a totally new_life . He once described his daily_life in the following terms : '' The turbulent have to be corrected , the faint hearted cheered up , the weak supported ; the Gospel s opponents need to be refuted , its insidious enemies guarded against ; the unlearned need to be taught , the indolent stirred up , the argumentative checked ; the proud must be put in their place , the desperate set on their feet , those engaged in quarrels reconciled ; the needy have to be helped , the oppressed to be liberated , the good to be encouraged , the bad to be tolerated ; all must be loved '' . '' The Gospel terrifies me '' producing that healthy fear which prevents us from living for ourselves alone and compels us to pass on the hope we hold in common . Amid the serious difficulties facing the Roman Empire and also posing a serious threat to Roman Africa , which_was actually destroyed -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of Augustine s life this_was what he set_out to do : to transmit hope , the hope which came to him from faith and which , in complete contrast with_his introverted temperament , enabled him to take_part decisively and with all his strength in the task of building up the city . In the same chapter of the Confessions in which_we_have just noted the decisive reason_for his commitment '' for all '' , he says_that Christ '' intercedes for us , otherwise I should despair . My weaknesses are_many and grave , many and grave indeed , but more abundant still -isaia- your medicine . We might have thought that_your word was far distant from union with_man , and so we might have despaired of ourselves , if this Word had not become flesh and dwelt among us '' . On the strength of his hope , Augustine dedicated himself completely to the ordinary people and to his city renouncing his spiritual nobility , he preached and acted in a simple way_for simple people . Let us summarize what_has emerged so far in the course of our reflections . Day by day , man experiences many greater or lesser hopes , different in kind according to the different periods of his_life . Sometimes one of these hopes may appear to be totally satisfying without_any need_for other hopes . Young people can have_the hope of a great and fully satisfying love ; the hope of a certain position in their profession , or of some success that_will prove decisive for the rest of their_lives . When these hopes are fulfilled , however , it becomes clear_that they_were not , in reality , the whole . It becomes evident_that man_has need of a hope_that goes further . It becomes clear_that only something infinite will suffice for him , something_that will_always be more_than he can ever attain . In this_regard our contemporary age has developed the hope of creating a perfect world_that , thanks to scientific knowledge and to scientifically based politics , seemed to be achievable . Thus Biblical hope in the Kingdom of God has_been displaced by hope in the kingdom of man , the hope of a better world which_would be the real '' Kingdom of God '' . This seemed -atti_degli_apostoli- last to be the great and realistic hope_that man needs . It was capable of galvanizing for a time all man s energies . The great objective seemed worthy of full commitment . In the course of time , however , it has become clear_that this hope -isaia- constantly receding . Above all it has become apparent that_this may be a hope_for a future generation , but_not for me . And however much '' for all '' may be part of the great hope since I cannot be happy without others or in opposition to them it remains true_that a hope_that does_not concern me personally -isaia- not a real hope . It has_also become clear_that this hope -isaia- opposed to freedom , since human affairs depend in each generation on the free decisions of those concerned . If this freedom were to be taken away , as a result of certain conditions or structures , then ultimately this_world would_not be good , since a world without freedom can by no means be a good world . Hence , while we must_always be committed to the improvement of the world , tomorrow s better world cannot be the proper and sufficient content of our_hope . And in this_regard the question always arises : when -isaia- the world '' better '' ? What makes it good ? By what standard are we to judge its goodness ? What are the paths that lead to this '' goodness '' ? . Let us say once_again : we need the greater and lesser hopes that keep us going day_by_day . But these_are not_enough without_the great hope , which_must surpass everything else . This great hope can_only be God , who encompasses the whole of reality and who_can bestow upon us what we , by ourselves , cannot attain . The fact_that it comes to us as a gift -isaia- actually part of hope . God -isaia- the foundation of hope : not any god , but the God who_has a human face and who_has loved us to the end , each_one of us and humanity in its entirety . His Kingdom -isaia- not an imaginary hereafter , situated in a future that will_never arrive ; his Kingdom -isaia- present wherever he -isaia- loved and wherever his_love reaches us . His love alone gives us the possibility of soberly persevering day_by_day , without ceasing to be spurred on by hope , in a world_which by its_very nature_-isaia- imperfect . His love_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time our guarantee of the existence of what we only vaguely sense and which nevertheless , in our deepest self , we await : a life that_-isaia- '' truly '' life . Let us now , in the final section , develop this idea in more detail as we focus our attention on some of the '' settings '' in which we can learn in practice about hope and its exercise . '' Settings '' for learning and practising hope I . Prayer as a school of hope . A first essential setting for learning hope -isaia- prayer . When no one listens to me any more , God still listens to me . When I can no longer talk to anyone or call_upon anyone , I can always talk to God . When there -isaia-_no_longer anyone to help me deal_with a need or expectation that goes beyond_the human capacity_for hope , he can_help me . When I have_been plunged into complete solitude . ; if I pray I -amos- never totally alone . The late Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan , a prisoner for thirteen years , nine of them spent in solitary confinement , has left us a precious little book : Prayers of Hope . During thirteen years in jail , in a situation of seemingly utter hopelessness , the fact_that he could listen and speak to God became for him an increasing power of hope , which enabled him , after_his release , to become for people all over the world a witness to hope to that great hope which_does_not wane even in the nights of solitude . Saint Augustine , in a homily on the First Letter of John , describes very beautifully the intimate relationship_between prayer and hope . He defines prayer as an exercise of desire . Man was created for greatness for God himself ; he was created to be filled by God . But his heart_-isaia- too small for the greatness to which_it_-isaia- destined . '' By delaying his gift , God strengthens our desire ; through desire he enlarges our soul and by expanding it he increases its capacity_for receiving him '' . Augustine refers to Saint Paul , who speaks of himself as straining forward to the things_that_are to come cf . He then uses a very beautiful image to describe this_process of enlargement and preparation of the human_heart . '' Suppose that God wishes to fill you with honey a symbol of God s tenderness and goodness ; but if you_are full of vinegar , where will you put the honey ? '' The vessel , that_-isaia- your heart , must first be enlarged and then cleansed , freed from the vinegar and its taste . This requires hard work and -isaia- painful , but in this_way alone do we become suited to that_for which_we_are destined . Even if Augustine speaks directly only of our capacity_for God , it -isaia- nevertheless clear that_through this effort by which_we_are freed from vinegar and the taste of vinegar , not_only are we made free for God , but we also become open to others . It -isaia- only by becoming children of God , that_we_can be with our_common Father . To pray -isaia- not to step outside history and withdraw to our_own private corner of happiness . When we pray properly we undergo a process of inner purification which opens us up to God and thus to our fellow human_beings as well . In prayer we must learn what we can truly ask of God what_-isaia- worthy of God . We must learn that we cannot pray against others . We must learn that we cannot ask for the superficial and comfortable things_that we desire -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment that meagre , misplaced hope_that leads us away from God . We must learn to purify our desires and our hopes . We must free ourselves from the hidden lies with_which we deceive ourselves . God sees through them , and when we come before God , we too are forced to recognize them . '' But who_can discern his errors ? Clear me from hidden faults '' prays the Psalmist Ps : : . Failure to recognize my guilt , the illusion of my innocence , does_not justify me and does_not save me , because I -amos- culpable for the numbness of my conscience and my incapacity to recognize_the evil in me for_what it -isaia- . If God does not_exist , perhaps I have to seek refuge in these lies , because there_-isaia- no one_who can forgive me ; no one_who_-isaia- the true criterion . Yet my encounter_with God awakens my conscience in such_a_way_that it no longer aims -atti_degli_apostoli- self justification , and -isaia-_no_longer a mere reflection of me and those of my contemporaries who shape my thinking , but it becomes a capacity_for listening to the Good itself . For prayer to develop this_power of purification , it must on the one_hand be something very personal , an encounter between my intimate self and God , the living God . On the other_hand it must be constantly guided and enlightened by the great prayers of the Church and of the saints , by liturgical prayer , in which_the Lord teaches us again_and_again how to pray properly . Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan , in his book of spiritual_exercises , tells us that during his_life there_were long periods when he was unable to pray and that he would hold fast to the texts of the Church s prayer : the Our Father , the Hail Mary and the prayers of the liturgy . Praying must_always involve this intermingling of public and personal prayer . This -isaia- how we can speak to God and how God speaks to us . In this_way we undergo those purifications by which we become open to God and are prepared_for the service of our fellow human_beings . We become capable of the great hope , and thus we become ministers of hope_for others . Hope in a Christian sense -isaia- always hope_for others as well . It -isaia- an active hope , in which we struggle to prevent things moving towards_the '' perverse end '' . It -isaia- an active hope also in the sense_that we keep the world open to God . Only in this_way does it continue to be a truly human hope . Action and suffering as settings for learning hope . All serious and upright human conduct -isaia- hope in action . This -isaia- so first of all in the sense_that we thereby strive to realize our lesser and greater hopes , to complete this or that task which_-isaia- important_for our onward journey , or we work towards a brighter and more humane world so as to open doors into the future . Yet our daily efforts in pursuing our_own lives and in working for the world s future either tire us or turn into fanaticism , unless we are enlightened by the radiance of the great hope_that cannot be destroyed even by small scale failures or by a breakdown in matters of historic importance . If we cannot hope_for more_than -isaia- effectively attainable -atti_degli_apostoli- any given time , or more_than -isaia- promised by political or economic authorities , our_lives will soon be without hope . It -isaia- important to know_that I can always continue to hope , even if in my own_life , or the historical period in which I -amos- living , there seems to be nothing left to hope_for . Only the great certitude of hope_that my own_life and history in general , despite all failures , are held firm by the indestructible power of Love , and that_this gives them their meaning and importance , only this_kind of hope can then give the courage to act and to persevere . Certainly we cannot '' build '' the Kingdom of God by our_own efforts what we build will_always be the kingdom of man with all the limitations proper to our human_nature . The Kingdom of God -isaia-_a_gift , and precisely_because of this , it -isaia- great and beautiful , and constitutes the response to our_hope . And we cannot to use the classical expression '' merit '' Heaven through our works . Heaven -isaia- always more_than we could merit , just as being loved -isaia- never something '' merited '' , but always a gift . However , even_when we are fully aware_that Heaven far exceeds what we can merit , it will_always be true_that our behaviour -isaia- not indifferent before God and therefore -isaia- not indifferent for the unfolding of history . We can open ourselves and the world and allow God to enter : we can open ourselves to truth , to love , to what_-isaia-_good . This -isaia- what_the saints did , those_who , as '' God s fellow workers '' , contributed to the world s salvation cf . We can free our life and the world from the poisons and contaminations that could destroy the present and the future . We can uncover the sources of creation and keep them unsullied , and in this_way we can_make a right use of creation , which_comes to us as a gift , according to its intrinsic requirements and ultimate purpose . This makes sense even if outwardly we achieve nothing or seem powerless in the face of overwhelming hostile forces . So on the one_hand , our actions engender hope_for us and for others ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , it -isaia- the great hope based upon God s promises that gives us courage and directs our action in good times and bad . Like action , suffering -isaia- a part of our human_existence . Suffering stems partly from our finitude , and partly from the mass of sin which_has accumulated over the course of history , and continues to grow unabated today . Certainly we must do whatever we can to reduce suffering : to avoid as far_as_possible the suffering of the innocent ; to soothe pain ; to give assistance in overcoming mental suffering . These are obligations both in justice and in love , and they_are included among the fundamental requirements of the Christian life and every truly human_life . Great progress has been_made in the battle against physical pain ; yet the sufferings of the innocent and mental suffering have , if anything , increased in recent decades . Indeed , we must do all we can to overcome suffering , but to banish it from the world altogether -isaia- not in our power . This -isaia- simply because we are unable to shake off our finitude and because none of us -isaia- capable of eliminating the power of evil , of sin which , as we plainly see , -isaia- a constant source of suffering . Only God -isaia- able to do this : only a God who personally enters history by making himself man and suffering within history . We know_that this God exists , and hence that this_power to '' take away the sin of the world '' Jn : -isaia- present in the world . Through faith in the existence of this_power , hope_for the world s healing has emerged in history . It -isaia- , however , hope not_yet fulfilment ; hope_that gives us the courage to place ourselves on the side of good even in seemingly hopeless situations , aware_that , as far as the external course of history -isaia- concerned , the power of sin will_continue to be a terrible presence . Let us return to our topic . We can try to limit suffering , to fight against it , but we cannot eliminate it . It -isaia- when we attempt to avoid suffering by withdrawing from anything that might involve hurt , when we try to spare ourselves the effort and pain of pursuing truth , love , and goodness , that we drift into a life of emptiness , in which_there may be almost no pain , but the dark sensation of meaninglessness and abandonment -isaia- all the greater . It -isaia- not by sidestepping or fleeing from suffering that_we_are healed , but_rather by our capacity_for accepting it , maturing through it and finding meaning through union with Christ , who suffered with infinite love . In this_context , I would_like to quote a passage from a letter written by the Vietnamese martyr Paul Le Bao Tinh which illustrates this transformation of suffering through the power of hope springing from faith . '' I , Paul , in chains for the name of Christ , wish to relate to you the trials besetting me daily , in order that_you_may be inflamed with love for God and join with me in his praises , for his_mercy -isaia- for ever Ps . The prison here -isaia- a true image of everlasting Hell : to cruel tortures of every_kind shackles , iron chains , manacles are added hatred , vengeance , calumnies , obscene speech , quarrels , evil acts , swearing , curses , as well as anguish and grief . But the God who once freed the three children from the fiery furnace -isaia- with me always ; he has delivered me from_these tribulations and made them sweet , for his_mercy -isaia- for ever . In the midst of these torments , which usually terrify others , I -amos- , by the grace of God , full of joy and gladness , because I -amos- not alone Christ -isaia- with me . How -amos- I to bear with the spectacle , as each_day I see emperors , mandarins , and their retinue blaspheming your holy name , O Lord , who_are enthroned above the Cherubim and Seraphim ? cf . Behold , the pagans have trodden your Cross underfoot ! Where -isaia- your glory ? As I see all this , I would , in the ardent love I have for you , prefer to be torn limb from limb and to die as a witness to your love . O Lord , show your power , save me , sustain me , that in my infirmity your power may be shown and may be glorified before the nations . Beloved brothers , as you hear all these_things may you give endless thanks in joy to God , from whom every good proceeds ; bless the Lord with me , for his_mercy -isaia- for ever . I write these_things to you in order_that your faith and mine may be united . In the midst of this storm I cast my anchor towards_the throne of God , the anchor that_-isaia- the lively hope in my heart '' . This -isaia- a letter from '' Hell '' . It lays bare all the horror of a concentration camp , where to the torments inflicted by tyrants upon their victims -isaia- added the outbreak of evil in the victims themselves , such that_they in turn become further instruments of their persecutors cruelty . This -isaia- indeed a letter from Hell , but it also reveals the truth of the Psalm text : '' If I go up to the heavens , you_are there ; if I sink to the nether world , you_are present there . If I say , Surely the darkness shall hide me , and night shall be my light for you darkness itself_-isaia- not dark , and night shines as the day ; darkness and light are the same '' Ps : ; cf . Christ descended into '' Hell '' and -isaia- therefore close to those cast into it , transforming their darkness into light . Suffering and torment -isaia- still terrible and well nigh unbearable . Yet the star of hope has risen the anchor of the heart reaches the very throne of God . Instead of evil being unleashed within man , the light shines victorious : suffering without ceasing to be suffering becomes , despite everything , a hymn of praise . The true measure of humanity -isaia- essentially determined in relationship to suffering and to the sufferer . This holds true both_for the individual and for society . A society unable to accept its suffering members and incapable of helping to share their suffering and to bear it inwardly through '' com passion '' -isaia- a cruel and inhuman society . Yet society cannot accept its suffering members and support them in their trials unless individuals are capable of doing so themselves ; moreover , the individual cannot accept another s suffering unless he personally -isaia- able to find meaning in suffering , a path of purification and growth in maturity , a journey of hope . Indeed , to accept the '' other '' who suffers , means_that I take up his suffering in such_a_way_that it becomes mine also . Because it has now become a shared suffering , though , in which another person_-isaia- present , this suffering -isaia- penetrated by the light of love . The Latin word con solatio , '' consolation '' , expresses this beautifully . It suggests being with the other in his solitude , so that it ceases to be solitude . Furthermore , the capacity to accept suffering for the sake of goodness , truth and justice -isaia- an essential criterion of humanity , because if my own well_being and safety are ultimately more_important than truth and justice , then the power of the stronger prevails , then violence and untruth reign supreme . Truth and justice must stand above my comfort and physical well_being , or else my life_itself becomes a lie . In the end , even the '' yes '' to love_-isaia- a source of suffering , because love always requires expropriations of my '' I '' , in which I allow myself to be pruned and wounded . Love simply cannot exist without this painful renunciation of myself , for otherwise it becomes pure selfishness and thereby ceases to be love . To suffer with the other and for others ; to suffer for the sake of truth and justice ; to suffer out of love and in order to become a person_who truly loves these_are fundamental elements of humanity , and to abandon them would destroy man_himself . Yet once_again the question arises : are we capable of this ? Is the other important enough to warrant my becoming , on his account , a person_who suffers ? Does truth matter to me enough to make suffering worthwhile ? Is the promise of love so great that it justifies the gift of myself ? In the history of humanity , it was_the Christian faith_that had the particular merit of bringing forth within man a new and deeper capacity_for these kinds of suffering that_are decisive for his humanity . The Christian faith_has shown us that_truth , justice and love are not_simply ideals , but enormously weighty realities . It has shown us that God Truth and Love in person desired to suffer for us and with us . Bernard of Clairvaux coined the marvellous expression : Impassibilis -ester- Deus , sed non incompassibilis God cannot suffer , but he can suffer with . Man -isaia- worth so much to God that he himself became man in order to suffer with_man in an utterly real way in flesh and blood as -isaia-_revealed to us in the account of Jesus s Passion . Hence in all human suffering we are joined by one_who experiences and carries that suffering with us ; hence con solatio -isaia- present in all suffering , the consolation of God s compassionate love and so the star of hope rises . Certainly , in our many_different sufferings and trials we always need the lesser and greater hopes too a kind visit , the healing of internal and external wounds , a favourable resolution of a crisis , and so on . In our lesser trials these kinds of hope may even be sufficient . But in truly great trials , where I must make a definitive decision to place the truth before my own welfare , career and possessions , I need the certitude of that true , great hope of which_we_have spoken here . For this too we need witnesses martyrs who have_given themselves totally , so as to show us the way day after day . We need them if we are to prefer goodness to comfort , even in the little choices we face each_day knowing that_this_-isaia- how we live life to the full . Let us say it once_again : the capacity to suffer for the sake of the truth_-isaia- the measure of humanity . Yet this capacity to suffer depends on the type and extent of the hope_that we bear within us and build upon . The saints were able to make_the great journey of human_existence in the way_that Christ had done before them , because_they were brimming with_great hope . I would_like to add here another brief comment with some relevance for everyday living . There used to be a form of devotion perhaps less practised today but quite widespread not long ago that included the idea of '' offering up '' the minor daily hardships that continually strike -atti_degli_apostoli- us like irritating '' jabs '' , thereby giving them a meaning . Of course , there_were some exaggerations and perhaps unhealthy applications of this_devotion , but we need to ask ourselves whether there_may not after all have_been something essential and helpful contained within it . What does it mean to offer something up ? Those who did so were convinced_that they could insert these little annoyances into Christ s great '' com passion '' so that_they somehow became part of the treasury of compassion so greatly needed by the human_race . In this_way , even the small inconveniences of daily_life could acquire meaning and contribute to the economy of good and of human love . Maybe we should consider whether it might be judicious to revive this practice ourselves . Judgement as a setting for learning and practising hope . At the conclusion of the central section of the Church s great Credo the part that recounts the mystery of Christ , from his eternal birth of the Father and his temporal birth of the Virgin Mary , through_his Cross and Resurrection to the second coming we find the phrase : '' he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead '' . From the earliest times , the prospect of the Judgement has influenced Christians in their_daily living as a criterion by which to order their present life , as a summons to their conscience , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as hope in God s justice . Faith in Christ has_never looked merely backwards or merely upwards , but always also forwards to the hour of justice that the Lord repeatedly proclaimed . This looking ahead has_given Christianity its importance for the present moment . In the arrangement of Christian sacred buildings , which_were intended to make visible the historic and cosmic breadth of faith in Christ , it became customary to depict the Lord returning as a king the symbol of hope -atti_degli_apostoli- the east end ; while the west wall normally portrayed the Last Judgement as a symbol of our responsibility_for our_lives a scene which followed and accompanied the faithful as they went out to resume their_daily routine . As the iconography of the Last Judgement developed , however , more_and_more prominence was_given to its ominous and frightening aspects , which obviously held more fascination for artists than the splendour of hope , often all too well concealed beneath the horrors . In the modern era , the idea of the Last Judgement has faded into the background : Christian faith_has been individualized and primarily oriented towards_the salvation of the believer s own soul , while reflection on world history -isaia- largely dominated by the idea of progress . The fundamental content of awaiting a final Judgement , however , has not disappeared : it has simply taken on a totally different form . The atheism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries -isaia- in its origins and aims a type of moralism : a protest against the injustices of the world and of world history . A world marked by so much injustice , innocent suffering , and cynicism of power cannot be the work of a good God . A God with responsibility_for such a world would_not be a just God , much less a good God . It -isaia- for the sake of morality that_this God has to be contested . Since there_-isaia- no God to create justice , it seems man himself_-isaia- now called to establish justice . If in the face of this_world s suffering , protest against God -isaia- understandable , the claim that humanity can and must do what no God actually does or -isaia- able to do -isaia- both presumptuous and intrinsically false . It -isaia- no accident that_this idea has led to the greatest forms of cruelty and violations of justice ; rather , it -isaia- grounded in the intrinsic falsity of the claim . A world_which has to create its_own justice -isaia- a world without hope . No one and nothing can answer for centuries of suffering . No one and nothing can guarantee that the cynicism of power whatever beguiling ideological mask it adopts will cease to dominate the world . This -isaia- why_the great thinkers of the Frankfurt School , Max Horkheimer and Theodor W . Adorno , were equally critical of atheism and theism . Horkheimer radically excluded the possibility of ever finding a this worldly substitute for God , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time he rejected the image of a good and just God . In an extreme radicalization of the Old Testament prohibition of images , he speaks of a '' longing for the totally Other '' that remains inaccessible a cry of yearning directed -atti_degli_apostoli- world history . Adorno also firmly upheld this total rejection of images , which naturally meant the exclusion of any '' image '' of a loving God . On the other_hand , he also constantly emphasized this '' negative '' dialectic and asserted that justice true justice would require a world '' where not_only present suffering would be wiped out , but_also that_which_-isaia- irrevocably past would be undone '' . This , would mean , however to express it with positive and hence , for him , inadequate symbols that_there can be no justice without a resurrection of the dead . Yet this_would have to involve '' the resurrection of the flesh , something_that -isaia- totally foreign to idealism and the realm of Absolute spirit '' . Christians likewise can and must constantly learn from the strict rejection of images that_-isaia- contained in God s first commandment cf . The truth of negative theology was highlighted by the Fourth Lateran Council , which explicitly stated_that however great the similarity that may be established between Creator and creature , the dissimilarity between_them -isaia- always greater . In any case , for the believer the rejection of images cannot be carried so far that_one ends up , as Horkheimer and Adorno would_like , by saying '' no '' to both theses theism and atheism . God has_given himself an '' image '' : in Christ who was_made man . In him_who was crucified , the denial of false images of God -isaia- taken to an extreme . God now reveals his true face in the figure of the sufferer who shares man s God forsaken condition by taking it upon himself . This innocent sufferer has attained the certitude of hope : there_-isaia- a God , and God can create justice in a way_that we cannot conceive , yet we can begin to grasp it through_faith . Yes , there_-isaia- a resurrection of the flesh . There -isaia- justice . There -isaia- an '' undoing '' of past suffering , a reparation that sets things aright . For this_reason , faith in the Last Judgement -isaia- first_and_foremost hope the need for_which was_made abundantly clear in the upheavals of recent centuries . I -amos- convinced_that the question of justice constitutes the essential argument , or in any case the strongest argument , in favour of faith in eternal_life . The purely individual need_for a fulfilment that_-isaia- denied to us in this_life , for an everlasting love_that we await , -isaia- certainly an important motive for believing that_man was_made for eternity ; but_only in connection_with the impossibility that the injustice of history should be the final word does the necessity for Christ s return and for new_life become fully convincing . To protest against God in the name of justice -isaia- not helpful . A world without God -isaia- a world without hope cf . Only God can create justice . And faith gives us the certainty_that he does so . The image of the Last Judgement -isaia- not primarily an image of terror , but an image of hope ; for us it may even be the decisive image of hope . Is it not also a frightening image ? I would say : it -isaia- an image that evokes responsibility , an image , therefore , of that fear of which Saint Hilary spoke when he said_that all our fear has its place in love . God -isaia- justice and creates justice . This -isaia-_our consolation and our_hope . And in his justice there_-isaia-_also grace . This we know by turning our gaze to the crucified and risen Christ . Both these_things justice and grace must be seen in their correct inner relationship . Grace does_not cancel out justice . It does_not make wrong into right . It -isaia- not a sponge which wipes everything away , so that whatever someone has done on earth ends up being of equal value . Dostoevsky , for example , was right to protest against this_kind of Heaven and this_kind of grace in his novel The Brothers Karamazov . Evildoers , in the end , do not sit -atti_degli_apostoli- table -atti_degli_apostoli- the eternal banquet beside their victims without distinction , as though nothing had happened . Here I would_like to quote a passage from Plato which expresses a premonition of just judgement that in many respects remains true and salutary for Christians too . Albeit using mythological images , he expresses the truth with an unambiguous clarity , saying that in the end souls will stand naked before the judge . It no longer matters what_they once were in history , but_only what_they are in truth : '' Often , when_it_-isaia- the king or some other monarch or potentate that he the judge has to deal_with , he finds that_there_-isaia- no soundness in the soul whatever ; he finds it scourged and scarred by the various acts of perjury and wrong doing . ; it -isaia- twisted and warped by lies and vanity , and nothing_-isaia- straight because truth has had no part in its development . Power , luxury , pride , and debauchery have left it so full of disproportion and ugliness that_when he has inspected it he sends it straight to prison , where on its arrival it will undergo the appropriate punishment . Sometimes , though , the eye of the judge lights on a different soul which_has lived in purity and truth . then he -isaia- struck with admiration and sends him to the isles of the blessed '' . In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus cf . Lk : , Jesus admonishes us through the image of a soul destroyed by arrogance and opulence , who_has created an impassable chasm between himself and the poor man ; the chasm of being trapped within material pleasures ; the chasm of forgetting the other , of incapacity to love_,_which then becomes a burning and unquenchable thirst . We must note that in this parable Jesus -isaia- not referring to the final destiny after_the Last Judgement , but_-isaia- taking up a notion found , inter alia , in early Judaism , namely that of an intermediate state between death_and_resurrection , a state in which_the final sentence -isaia- yet to be pronounced . This early Jewish idea of an intermediate state includes the view that_these souls are not_simply in a sort of temporary custody but , as the parable of the rich man illustrates , are_already being punished or are experiencing a provisional form of bliss . There -isaia-_also the idea that_this state can involve purification and healing which mature the soul for communion with God . The early Church took up these concepts , and in the Western Church they gradually developed into the doctrine of Purgatory . We do not need to examine here_the complex historical paths of this development ; it -isaia- enough to ask what it actually means . With death , our life choice becomes definitive our life stands before the judge . Our choice , which in the course of an entire life takes on a certain shape , can have a variety of forms . There can be people_who have totally destroyed their desire_for truth and readiness to love , people for_whom everything has become a lie , people_who have lived for hatred and have suppressed all love within themselves . This -isaia- a terrifying thought , but alarming profiles of this type can be seen in certain figures of our_own history . In such people all would be beyond remedy and the destruction of good would be irrevocable : this_-isaia-_what we mean by the word Hell . On the other_hand there_can be people_who_are utterly pure , completely permeated by God , and thus fully open to their neighbours people for_whom communion with God even_now gives direction to their entire being and whose journey towards God only brings to fulfilment what_they already are . Yet we know from experience that neither case -isaia- normal in human_life . For the great majority of people we may suppose there remains in the depths of their being an ultimate interior openness to truth , to love , to God . In the concrete choices of life , however , it -isaia- covered over by ever_new compromises with evil much filth covers purity , but the thirst_for purity remains and it still constantly re emerges from all that_-isaia- base and remains present in the soul . What happens to such individuals when_they appear before the Judge ? Will all the impurity they_have amassed through life suddenly cease to matter ? What else might occur ? Saint Paul , in his First Letter to the Corinthians , gives us an idea of the differing impact of God s judgement according to each_person s particular circumstances . He does this using images which in some_way try to express the invisible , without it being possible_for us to conceptualize these images simply because we can neither see into_the_world beyond death nor do we have any experience of it . Paul begins by saying that Christian life_-isaia- built upon a common foundation : Jesus Christ . This foundation endures . If we have stood firm on this foundation and built our life upon it , we know_that it cannot be taken away from us even in death . Then Paul continues : '' Now if any_one builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw each man s work will_become manifest ; for the Day will disclose it , because it will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test what sort of work each_one has done . If the work_which any man_has built on the foundation survives , he will receive a reward . If any man s work_-isaia- burned up , he will suffer loss , though he himself will be saved , but_only as through fire '' Cor : . In this text , it -isaia- in any case evident_that our_salvation can take different_forms , that_some of what_-isaia- built may be burned down , that in order to be saved we personally have to pass through '' fire '' so as to become fully open to receiving God and able to take our place -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the eternal marriage feast . Some recent theologians are of the opinion that the fire which both burns and saves -isaia- Christ himself , the Judge and Saviour . The encounter_with him -isaia- the decisive act of judgement . Before his gaze all falsehood melts away . This encounter_with him , as it burns us , transforms and frees us , allowing us to become truly ourselves . All that we build during our_lives can prove to be mere straw , pure bluster , and it collapses . Yet in the pain of this encounter , when_the impurity and sickness of our_lives become evident to us , there lies salvation . His gaze , the touch of his_heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation '' as through fire '' . But it -isaia- a blessed pain , in which_the holy power of his_love sears through us like a flame , enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God . In this_way the inter relation between justice and grace also becomes clear : the way we live our_lives -isaia- not immaterial , but our defilement does_not stain us for ever if we have -atti_degli_apostoli- least continued to reach out towards Christ , towards truth and towards love . Indeed , it has_already_been burned away through Christ s Passion . At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his_love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves . The pain of love becomes our_salvation and our joy . It -isaia- clear_that we cannot calculate the '' duration '' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this_world . The transforming '' moment '' of this encounter eludes earthly time reckoning it -isaia- the heart s time , it -isaia- the time of '' passage '' to communion with God in the Body of Christ . The judgement of God -isaia- hope , both because_it_-isaia- justice and because_it_-isaia- grace . If it were merely grace , making all earthly things cease to matter , God would still owe us an answer to the question about justice the crucial question that we ask of history and of God . If it were merely justice , in the end it could bring only fear to us all . The incarnation of God in Christ has so closely linked the two together judgement and grace that justice -isaia- firmly established : we all work out our_salvation '' with fear and trembling '' Phil : . Nevertheless grace allows us all to hope , and to go trustfully to meet_the Judge whom we know as our '' advocate '' , or parakletos cf . A further point must be mentioned here , because_it_-isaia- important_for the practice of Christian hope . Early Jewish thought includes the idea that_one can_help the deceased in their intermediate state through prayer see for example Macc : ; first century BC . The equivalent practice was readily adopted by Christians and -isaia- common to the Eastern and Western Church . The East does_not recognize_the purifying and expiatory suffering of souls in the afterlife , but it does acknowledge various levels of beatitude and of suffering in the intermediate state . The souls of the departed can , however , receive '' solace and refreshment '' through the Eucharist , prayer and almsgiving . The belief that_love can reach into the afterlife , that reciprocal giving and receiving -isaia- possible , in which_our affection for one_another continues beyond_the limits of death this has_been a fundamental conviction of Christianity throughout_the ages and it remains a source of comfort today . Who would_not feel the need to convey to their departed loved ones a sign of kindness , a gesture of gratitude or even a request for pardon ? Now a further question arises : if '' Purgatory '' -isaia- simply purification through fire in the encounter_with_the Lord , Judge and Saviour , how_can a third person intervene , even if he or she_-isaia- particularly close to the other ? When we ask such a question , we should recall that no man_-isaia- an island , entire of itself . Our lives are involved with one_another , through innumerable interactions they_are linked together . No one lives alone . No one sins alone . No one_-isaia- saved alone . The lives of others continually spill over into mine : in what I think , say , do and achieve . And conversely , my life spills over into that of others : for better and for worse . So my prayer_for another -isaia- not something extraneous to that person , something external , not_even after death . In the interconnectedness of Being , my gratitude to the other my prayer_for him can play a small part in his purification . And for that_there_-isaia- no need to convert earthly time into God s time : in the communion of souls simple terrestrial time -isaia- superseded . It -isaia- never too late to touch the heart of another , nor_-isaia- it ever in vain . In this_way we further clarify an important element of the Christian concept of hope . Our hope -isaia- always essentially also hope_for others ; only thus -isaia- it truly hope_for me too . As Christians we should never limit ourselves to asking : how_can I save myself ? We should_also ask : what can I do in order_that others may be saved and that_for them too the star of hope may rise ? Then I will have_done my utmost for my own personal salvation as well . Mary , Star of Hope . With a hymn composed in the eighth or ninth century , thus for over a thousand years , the Church has greeted Mary , the Mother of God , as '' Star of the Sea '' : Ave maris stella . Human life_-isaia- a journey . Towards what destination ? How do we find the way ? Life -isaia- like a voyage on the sea of history , often dark and stormy , a voyage in which we watch for the stars that indicate the route . The true stars of our life are the people_who have lived good lives . They are lights of hope . Certainly , Jesus Christ -isaia- the true light , the sun that_has risen above all the shadows of history . But to reach him we also need lights close by people_who shine with_his light and so guide us along our way . Who more_than Mary could be a star of hope_for us ? With her '' yes '' she opened the door of our_world to God himself ; she became the living Ark of the Covenant , in whom God took flesh , became one of us , and pitched his tent among us cf . So we cry to her : Holy Mary , you belonged to the humble and great souls of Israel who , like Simeon , were '' looking for the consolation of Israel '' Lk : and hoping , like Anna , '' for the redemption of Jerusalem '' Lk : . Your life was thoroughly imbued_with the sacred_scriptures of Israel which spoke of hope , of the promise made to Abraham and his descendants cf . In this_way we can appreciate the holy fear that overcame you when_the angel of the Lord appeared to you and told you that_you would give birth to the One who was_the hope of Israel , the One awaited by the world . Through you , through your '' yes '' , the hope of the ages became reality , entering this_world and its history . You bowed low before the greatness of this_task and gave your consent : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk : . When you hastened with holy joy across the mountains of Judea to see your cousin Elizabeth , you became the image of the Church to come , which carries the hope of the world in her womb across the mountains of history . But alongside the joy which , with your Magnificat , you proclaimed in word and song for all the centuries to hear , you also knew the dark sayings of the prophets about the suffering of the servant of God in this_world . Shining over his birth in the stable -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem , there_were angels in splendour who brought the good_news to the shepherds , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time the lowliness of God in this_world was all too palpable . The old man Simeon spoke to you of the sword which_would pierce your soul cf . Lk : , of the sign of contradiction that_your Son would be in this_world . Then , when Jesus began his public ministry , you had to step aside , so that a new family could grow , the family which it was his_mission to establish and which_would be made up of those_who heard his_word and kept it cf . Notwithstanding the great joy that marked the beginning of Jesus s ministry , in the synagogue of Nazareth you_must already have experienced the truth of the saying about the '' sign of contradiction '' cf . In this_way you saw the growing power of hostility and rejection which built up around Jesus until the hour of the Cross , when_you had to look upon the Saviour of the world , the heir of David , the Son of God dying like a failure , exposed to mockery , between criminals . Then you received_the word of Jesus : '' Woman , behold , your Son ! '' Jn : . From the Cross you received a new mission . From the Cross you became a mother in a new_way : the mother of all those who_believe in your Son Jesus and wish to follow_him . The sword of sorrow pierced your heart . Did hope die ? Did the world remain definitively without light , and life without purpose ? At that moment , deep down , you probably listened again to the word spoken by the angel in answer to your fear -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Annunciation : '' Do not be afraid , Mary ! '' Lk : . How many times had the Lord , your Son , said the same thing to his_disciples : do not be afraid ! In your heart , you heard this word again during the night of Golgotha . Before the hour of his betrayal he had said to his_disciples : '' Be of good cheer , I have overcome the world '' Jn : . '' Let not your hearts be troubled , neither let_them be afraid '' Jn : . '' Do not be afraid , Mary ! '' In that hour -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth the angel had also said to you : '' Of his_kingdom there_will be no end '' Lk : . Could it have ended before it began ? No , -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , on the strength of Jesus s own word , you became the mother of believers . In this faith_,_which even in the darkness of Holy Saturday bore the certitude of hope , you made your way towards Easter morning . The joy of the Resurrection touched your heart and united you in a new_way to the disciples , destined to become the family of Jesus through_faith . In this_way you were in the midst of the community of believers , who in the days following the Ascension prayed with one voice for the gift of the Holy Spirit cf . Acts : and then received that gift on the day of Pentecost . The '' Kingdom '' of Jesus was_not as might have_been imagined . It began in that hour , and of this '' Kingdom '' there_will be no end . Thus you remain in the midst of the disciples as their Mother , as the Mother of hope . Holy Mary , Mother of God , our Mother , teach us to believe , to hope , to love with you . Show us the way to his Kingdom ! Star of the Sea , shine upon us and guide us on our way !

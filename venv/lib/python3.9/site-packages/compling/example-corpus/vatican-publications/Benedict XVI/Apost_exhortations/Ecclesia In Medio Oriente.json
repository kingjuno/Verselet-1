The Church in the Middle East , which from the dawn of Christian faith_has made her pilgrim way in those holy lands , today courageously continues her witness , the fruit of a life of communion with God and neighbour . Communion and Witness ! This was_the conviction which occasioned the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the Middle East , which gathered around_the Successor of Peter from to October to discuss the theme , '' The Catholic Church in the Middle East : Communion and Witness . Now the company of those_who believed were of one heart and one soul '' Acts : . At the beginning of this third_millennium , I wish to entrust this conviction , which draws its strength from Jesus Christ , to the pastoral concern of all the Pastors of the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church , and in a more particular_way to my esteemed brothers the Patriarchs , Archbishops and Bishops who together , in union with the Bishop of Rome , oversee the Catholic Church in the Middle East . The natives of these lands include faithful of the venerable Eastern Catholic Churches sui iuris : the patriarchal Church of Alexandria of the Copts ; the three patriarchal Churches of Antioch : Greek Melkite , Syrian and Maronite ; the patriarchal Church of Babylon of the Chaldeans and that of Cilicia of the Armenians . Also living in the area are Bishops , priests and lay_faithful belonging to the Latin Church . Likewise present are Indian priests and faithful from the Major Archbishoprics of Ernakulam Angamaly of the Syro Malabars , and from Trivandrum of the Syro Malankaras , as well as priests and faithful of the Eastern Churches and the Latin Church in Asia and Eastern Europe , and many members of the faithful from Ethiopia and Eritrea . Together they bear_witness to the unity of the faith amid the diversity of their traditions . I wish also to entrust this conviction to all the priests , the men_and_women_religious , and the lay_faithful of the Middle East , confident that it will confirm the ministry or apostolate which_each carries out in his or her respective Church , in accordance_with_the charism bestowed by the Spirit for the upbuilding of all . In the context of the Christian faith , '' communion_-isaia- the very life of God which_-isaia- communicated in the Holy Spirit , through Jesus Christ '' . It -isaia-_a_gift of God which brings our freedom into play and calls for our response . It -isaia- precisely because_it_-isaia- divine in origin that communion has a universal extension . While it clearly engages Christians by virtue of their shared apostolic faith , it remains no less open to our Jewish and Muslim brothers_and_sisters , and to all those ordered in various_ways to the People of God . The Catholic Church in the Middle East -isaia- aware_that she_will not be able fully to manifest this communion -atti_degli_apostoli- the ecumenical and interreligious level unless she_has first revived it in herself , within each of her Churches and among all her members : Patriarchs , Bishops , priests , religious , consecrated_persons and lay persons . Growth by individuals in the life of faith and spiritual renewal within_the Catholic Church will_lead to the fullness of the life of grace and theosis divinization . In this_way , the Church s witness will_become all the more convincing . The example of the first community in Jerusalem can serve as a model for renewing the present Christian community and making it a place of communion for witness . The Acts of the Apostles give us a simple yet touching early description of this community born on the day of Pentecost : a company of believers who_were of one heart and soul . From the beginning there_was a fundamental connection_between faith in Jesus and ecclesial_communion , as becomes clear from the two interchangeable expressions : one heart and soul . Communion -isaia- not the result of our_own human efforts . It comes about , above all else , by the power of the Holy Spirit , who creates in us the faith_which works through love cf . According to Acts , the unity of believers was seen in the fact_that '' they devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of the bread and the prayers '' : . The unity of believers was thus nourished by the teaching of the Apostles the proclamation of God s word , to which_they responded with unanimous faith , by fraternal communion the service of charity , by the breaking of the bread the Eucharist and the sacraments , and by prayer , both personal and communal . It was on these four pillars that communion and witness were based within_the first community of believers . May the Church which_has lived uninterruptedly in the Middle East from apostolic times to our_own day find in the example of that community the resources needed to keep fresh the memory and the apostolic vitality of her origins ! . All who took part in the Synod assembly had an experience of the unity_which exists within_the Catholic Church in a broad spectrum of geographical , religious , cultural and sociopolitical contexts . The common faith_-isaia- practised and made admirably evident in the diversity of its theological , spiritual , liturgical and canonical expressions . Like my Predecessors in the See of Peter , I wish here to state once_more my desire to ensure_that '' the rites of the Eastern Churches , as the patrimony of the whole Church of Christ in which shines_forth the tradition coming down from the Apostles through the Fathers , and which , in its variety , affirms the divine unity of the Catholic faith , are observed and promoted conscientiously . '' I likewise assure my Latin brothers_and_sisters of my affection and my concern_for their needs and necessities , in accordance_with_the commandment of charity_which presides over all , and the norms of law . PART ONE '' We give thanks to God always for you all , constantly mentioning you in our prayers '' Th : . With these_words of thanksgiving from Saint Paul , I greet the Christians living in the Middle East and assure them of my fervent and continued prayers . The Catholic Church , and with_her the entire Christian community , keeps them in mind and acknowledges with gratitude their noble and ancient contribution to the building up of the Body of Christ . She thanks them_for their fidelity and assures them of her affection . It -isaia- moving for me to recall my journeys to the Middle East . As a land especially chosen by God , it was_the home of Patriarchs and Prophets . It was_the glorious setting for the Incarnation of the Messiah ; it saw the raising of the Saviour s cross and witnessed the resurrection of the Redeemer and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . Traversed by the Apostles , saints and a number of the Fathers of the Church , it was_the crucible of the earliest dogmatic formulations . Yet this blessed land and its peoples have tragically experienced human upheavals . How many deaths have there been , how_many lives ravaged by human blindness , how_many occasions of fear and humiliation ! It would seem that_there_-isaia- no end to the crime of Cain cf . Gen : and Jn : among the sons of Adam and Eve created in God s image cf . Adam s transgression , reinforced by the sin of Cain , continues to produce thorns and thistles cf . Gen : even today . How sad it -isaia- to see this blessed land suffer in its children who relentlessly tear one_another to pieces and die ! Christians know_that only Jesus , who passed through sufferings and death in order to rise again , -isaia- capable of bringing salvation and peace to all who dwell in your part_of_the_world cf . Him alone , Christ , the Son of God , do we proclaim ! Let us repent , then , and be converted , '' that sins may be blotted out , that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord '' Acts : a . For the sacred Scriptures , peace_-isaia- not_simply a pact or a treaty which ensures a tranquil life , nor_can its definition be reduced to the mere absence of war . According to its Hebrew etymology , peace means being complete and intact , restored to wholeness . It -isaia- the state of those_who live in harmony_with God and with themselves , with_others and with nature . Before appearing outwardly , peace_-isaia- interior . It -isaia- the yearning for a reality . Peace -isaia- something so desirable that it has become a greeting in the Middle East cf . Peace -isaia- justice cf . Is : ; Saint James in his Letter adds that '' the harvest of righteousness -isaia- sown in peace by those_who make peace '' : . The struggle of the Prophets and the reflections of the Wisdom authors were inspired by the hope of eschatological peace . It -isaia- towards this authentic peace in God that Christ leads us . He alone_-isaia- its gate Jn : . This -isaia- the sole gate that Christians wish to enter . Only by beginning with conversion to God , and by showing forgiveness to those close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand and in the wider community , will the just respond to Christ s invitation to become '' children of God '' cf . Only the meek will delight in boundless peace cf . In offering us a life of communion with God , Jesus creates true fraternity , not the fraternity marred by sin . '' For he -isaia-_our peace , who_has made us both one , and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility '' Eph : . Christians know_that the earthly politics of peace will only be effective if justice in God and justice among men_and_women are its authentic basis , and if this_same justice battles against the sin which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of division . For this_reason , the Church wishes to overcome every difference of race , sex and social condition cf . Gal : and Col : in the knowledge that all are_one in Christ , who_-isaia- all in all . This too -isaia- why_the Church supports and encourages every peace initiative throughout_the_world and particularly in the Middle East . She works unstintingly and in a variety of ways to help people to live in peace , while also supporting the international juridical framework which consolidates peace . The Holy See s positions on the different conflicts which tragically afflict the region and on the status of Jerusalem and the holy places are well_known . Yet the Church does_not lose sight of the fact_that , before all else , peace remains a fruit of the Spirit cf . Gal : , one which_must constantly be implored from God cf . The Christian and ecumenical life . It -isaia- in this restrictive , unstable and lately violence prone context that God has permitted his Church to grow . She lives there in a remarkable variety of forms . Along with the Catholic Church , a great number of venerable Churches and Ecclesial Communities of more_recent date are present in the Middle East . This mosaic demands a significant and continued effort to build unity in respect_for the riches of each , and thus to reaffirm the credibility of the proclamation of the Gospel and Christian witness . Unity -isaia-_a_gift of God which_-isaia- born of the Spirit and which_must be cultivated with patient perseverance cf . We know that_it_-isaia- tempting , whenever our divisions make themselves felt , to appeal to purely human criteria , forgetting the sage counsel of Saint Paul cf . He entreats us : '' Be eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace '' Eph : . Faith -isaia- the centre and the fruit of true ecumenism . Faith itself must first be deepened . Unity -isaia- born of constant prayer and the conversion which enables each of us to live in accordance_with_the truth and in charity cf . The Second Vatican Council encouraged this '' spiritual ecumenism '' which_-isaia- the soul of true ecumenism . The situation in the Middle East -isaia- itself a pressing summons to holiness of life . The various martyrologies are proof that saints and martyrs of every ecclesial_community have_been \u2013 and certainly remain today \u2013 living witnesses of this untrammelled unity in the glorified Christ , a foretaste of our '' being gathered together '' as a people finally reconciled in him . For this_reason , within_the Catholic Church herself we need to consolidate the communion_which bears_witness to the love of Christ . On the basis of the indications set_forth in the Ecumenical Directory , the Catholic faithful can promote spiritual ecumenism in parishes , monasteries and convents , in schools and universities , and in seminaries . Pastors should ensure that_the_faithful come to see themselves as witnesses of communion in all areas of their_lives . Communion in this_sense -isaia- certainly not confusion . Authentic witness calls for acknowledgment and respect_for others , a willingness to dialogue in truth , patience as an expression of love , the simplicity and humility proper to those_who realize that_they_are sinners in the sight of God and their neighbour , a capacity_for forgiveness , reconciliation and purification of memory , -atti_degli_apostoli- both the personal and communal levels . I encourage the efforts of theologians who work tirelessly for_unity , and I express my appreciation for the activities of local ecumenical commissions -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels and of the various communities which pray and work_for the goal of unity by promoting friendship and fraternity . In fidelity to the Church s origins and her living traditions , it -isaia-_also important_that all speak with one voice in addressing the great moral questions dealing_with the truth_about man , the family , sexuality , bioethics , freedom , justice_and_peace . An '' ecumenism of service '' , moreover , already exists in the fields of charity and education between Christians of the different Churches and Ecclesial Communities . The Middle East Council of Churches , to which_the Churches of the various Christian traditions in the region belong , offers a promising setting for a dialogue which_can develop in love and reciprocal respect . The Second Vatican Council points_out that , to be effective , the path of ecumenism should be marked '' by prayer above all , by example , by scrupulous fidelity to the ancient traditions of the East , by better knowledge of one_another , by working together and by an understanding attitude towards persons and things '' . It would be most fitting for all to draw closer to Christ himself . Jesus draws into unity those who_believe in and love him ; he gives them the Spirit of his Father as well as Mary , his Mother Jn : ; : and : . These two gifts , different in level , can be a powerful source of help , one_that merits greater attention on the part of all . Our common love for Christ , '' who committed no sin ; no guile was found on his lips '' Pet : and the '' close bonds '' which exist between_the Catholic Church and the Churches of the East not in full_communion with_her , are an urgent summons to dialogue and unity . In a number of cases , Catholics are linked to the Churches of the East not in full_communion by reason of common religious origins . For a renewed ecumenical pastoral outreach in view of common witness , it -isaia- helpful to have a clear understanding of the Council s openness to a certain communicatio in sacris for the sacraments of Penance , the Eucharist and the Anointing of the Sick ; this -isaia-_not_only possible but_even to be commended in some situations , in accordance_with specific norms and with the approval of the ecclesiastical authorities . Marriages between Catholics and Orthodox are numerous and call_for particular ecumenical attention . I encourage Bishops and Eparchs to apply , to the extent possible and wherever they exist , pastoral agreements on the gradual implementation of a joint ecumenical pastoral effort . Ecumenical unity does_not_mean uniformity of traditions and celebrations . To begin with , I -amos- sure_that with God s help agreement can be found for a common translation of the Lord s Prayer , the Our Father , in the local languages of the region , wherever necessary . By praying together in the same words , Christians will acknowledge their common roots in the one apostolic faith which_-isaia- the basis of our pursuit of full_communion . Engaging together in a deeper study of the Eastern and Latin Fathers , and of our respective spiritual traditions , could prove greatly helpful to this_end , in the correct application of the canonical norms regulating this material . I invite the Catholics of the Middle East to cultivate relationships with the faithful of the different Ecclesial Communities present in the region . Various joint initiatives are possible . Common Bible study and a wider diffusion of the Bible could , for example , initiate this_process . Particularly fruitful forms of cooperation in the area of charitable activities and the promotion of the values of human_life , justice_and_peace could also be developed or expanded . All this_will contribute to greater mutual knowledge and the creation of a climate of esteem ; these_are indispensable conditions for promoting fraternity . The Church s universal nature and vocation require that_she engage in dialogue_with_the members of other_religions . In the Middle East this dialogue -isaia- based on the spiritual and historical bonds uniting Christians to Jews and Muslims . It -isaia- a dialogue which_-isaia-_not primarily dictated by pragmatic political or social considerations , but by underlying theological concerns which_have to do with_faith . They are grounded in the sacred Scriptures and are clearly defined in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium and in the Declaration on the Church s Relation to Non Christian Religions Nostra Aetate . Jews , Christians and Muslims alike believe in one God , the Creator of all men_and_women . May Jews , Christians and Muslims rediscover one of God s desires , that of the unity and harmony of the human_family . May Jews , Christians and Muslims find in other believers brothers_and_sisters to be respected and loved , and in this_way , beginning in their_own lands , give the beautiful witness of serenity and concord between_the children of Abraham . Rather than being exploited in endless conflicts which_are unjustifiable for authentic believers , the acknowledgment of one God \u2013 if lived with a pure heart \u2013 can_make a powerful contribution to peace in the region and to respectful coexistence on the part of its peoples . The bonds uniting Christians and Jews are_many and they run deep . They are anchored in a precious common spiritual heritage . There -isaia- of course our_faith in one God , the Creator , who reveals himself , offers his unending friendship to mankind and out of love desires to redeem us . There -isaia-_also the Bible , much of which_-isaia- common to both Jews and Christians . For both , it -isaia- the word of God . Our common recourse to sacred Scripture draws us closer to one_another . Moreover , Jesus , a son of the Chosen People , was_born , lived and died a Jew cf . Mary , his Mother , likewise invites us to rediscover the Jewish roots of Christianity . These close bonds are a unique treasure of which Christians are proud and for which_they_are indebted to the Chosen People . The Jewishness of the Nazarene allows Christians to taste joyfully the world of the Promise and resolutely introduces them_into the faith of the Chosen People , making them a part of that People . Yet the person and the deepest identity of Jesus also divide them , for in him Christians recognize_the Messiah , the Son of God . Christians ought to become more conscious of the depth of the mystery of the Incarnation in order to love God with all their heart , with all their soul and with all their might cf . Christ , the Son of God , became flesh in a people , a faith tradition and a culture which , if better known , can_only enrich the understanding of the Christian faith . Christians have come to this deeper_understanding thanks to the death_and_resurrection of Christ cf . But they must_always be aware of and grateful for their roots . For the shoot grafted onto the ancient tree to take cf . Rom : , it needs the -sapienza- rising from the roots . Relationships between_the two communities of believers bear the marks of history and human passion . Misunderstandings and reciprocal distrust have abounded . Past persecutions , whether surreptitious or violent , are inexcusable and greatly to be deplored . And yet , despite these tragic situations , the interplay between both communities over the centuries proved so fruitful that it contributed to the birth and expansion of the civilization and culture commonly known as Judeo Christian . It -isaia- as if these_two worlds , claiming to be different or opposed for various reasons , had decided to unite in offering humanity a noble alloy . This relationship , which both unites and separates Jews and Christians , ought to open both groups to a new sense_of_responsibility for and with one_another . For both peoples have_received the same blessing and the eternal promises which enable them to advance trustingly towards fraternity . The Catholic Church , in fidelity to the teachings of the Second Vatican Council , looks with esteem to Muslims , who worship God above all by prayer , almsgiving and fasting , revere Jesus as a prophet while not acknowledging his divinity , and honour Mary , his Virgin Mother . We know_that the encounter of Islam and Christianity has often taken the form of doctrinal controversy . Sadly , both sides have used doctrinal differences as a pretext for justifying , in the name of religion , acts of intolerance , discrimination , marginalization and even of persecution . Despite this_fact , Christians live daily alongside Muslims in the Middle East , where their presence -isaia- neither recent nor accidental , but has a long history . As an integral part of the Middle East , Christians have developed over the centuries a type of relationship_with their surroundings which_can prove instructive . They have let themselves be challenged by Muslim devotion and piety , and have continued , in accordance_with their means and to the extent possible , to live by and to promote the values of the Gospel in the surrounding culture . The result has_been a particular form of symbiosis . It -isaia- proper , then , to acknowledge_the contribution made by Jews , Christians and Muslims in the formation of a rich culture proper to the Middle East . The Catholics of the Middle East , the majority of whom are native citizens of their countries , have_the duty and right to participate fully in national life , working to build up their_country . They should enjoy full citizenship and not be treated as second class citizens or believers . As in the past when , as pioneers of the Arab Renaissance , they took full part in the cultural , economic and scientific life of the different_cultures of the region , so too in our_own day they wish to share_with Muslims their experiences and to make their_specific contribution . It -isaia- because of Jesus that Christians are sensitive to the dignity_of_the_human_person and to freedom of religion which_-isaia- its corollary . For love of God and humanity , thus honouring Christ s two natures , and with eternal_life in view , Christians have built schools , hospitals and institutions of every_kind where all people_are welcomed without discrimination cf . For these reasons , Christians are particularly concerned for the fundamental rights of the human_person . It -isaia- wrong to claim that_these rights are only '' Christian '' human_rights . They are nothing less_than the rights demanded by the dignity of each human_person and each citizen , whatever his or her origins , religious convictions and political preferences . Religious freedom_-isaia- the pinnacle of all other freedoms . It -isaia- a sacred and inalienable right . It includes on the individual and collective levels the freedom to follow one s conscience in religious matters and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , freedom of worship . It includes the freedom to choose the religion which one judges to be true and to manifest one s beliefs in public . It must be possible to profess and freely manifest one s religion and its symbols without endangering one s life and personal freedom . Religious freedom_-isaia- rooted in the dignity of the person ; it safeguards moral freedom and fosters mutual respect . Jews , with_their long experience of often deadly assaults , know full well the benefits of religious_freedom . For their_part , Muslims share_with Christians the conviction_that no constraint in religious matters , much less the use of force , -isaia- permitted . Such constraint , which_can take multiple and insidious forms on the personal and social , cultural , administrative and political levels , -isaia- contrary to God s will . It gives_rise to political and religious exploitation , discrimination and violence leading to death . God wants life , not death . He forbids all killing , even of those_who kill cf . Religious tolerance exists in a number of countries , but it does_not have much effect since it remains limited in its field of action . There -isaia-_a_need to move beyond tolerance to religious_freedom . Taking this step does_not open the door to relativism , as some would maintain . It does_not compromise belief , but_rather calls for a reconsideration of the relationship_between man , religion and God . It -isaia- not an attack on the '' foundational truths '' of belief , since , despite human and religious divergences , a ray of truth shines on all men_and_women . We know very well that_truth , apart_from God , does not_exist as an autonomous reality . If it did , it would be an idol . The truth cannot unfold except in an otherness open to God , who wishes to reveal his_own otherness in and through my human brothers_and_sisters . Hence it -isaia- not fitting to state in an exclusive way : '' I possess the truth '' . The truth_-isaia- not possessed by anyone ; it -isaia- always a gift_which calls us to undertake a journey of ever closer assimilation to truth . Truth can_only be known and experienced in freedom ; for this_reason we cannot impose truth on others ; truth_-isaia- disclosed only in an encounter of love . The attention of the whole world_-isaia- fixed on the Middle East as it seeks its path . May this region demonstrate that coexistence -isaia- not a utopia , and that distrust and prejudice are_not a foregone conclusion . Religions can join one_another in service to the common_good and contribute to the development of each_person and the building of society . The Christians of the Middle East have experienced for centuries the dialogue_between Islam and Christianity . For them it means the dialogue of and in daily_life . They know its rich possibilities and its limitations . They have_also experienced the more_recent dialogue_between Judaism and Christianity . For some time now , bilateral and trilateral dialogues have taken_place between Jewish , Muslim and Christian intellectuals or theologians . These offer fruitful opportunities_for encounter and the study of various issues , and they ought to be supported . An effective contribution in this_regard -isaia- made by all those Catholic institutions or centres for the study of philosophy , theology and other disciplines which_have long been present in the Middle East , and carry on their activity there in sometimes difficult conditions . I express my appreciation to them and I encourage them to continue their_work as peacemakers , in the knowledge that every_effort made to overcome ignorance and to promote knowledge deserves to be supported . God willing , the happy union of the dialogue of everyday life and the dialogue of intellectuals or theologians will slowly but surely contribute to improving relations_between Jews and Christians , Jews and Muslims and Muslims and Christians . This -isaia- my hope and the intention for_which I pray . Two new realities . Like the rest of the world , the Middle East -isaia- experiencing two opposing trends : secularization , with its occasionally extreme consequences , and a violent fundamentalism claiming to be based on religion . Some Middle Eastern political and religious leaders , whatever their community , tend to look with suspicion upon secularity la\u00efcit\u00e9 as something intrinsically atheistic or immoral . It -isaia- true_that secularity sometimes reduces religion to a purely private concern , seeing personal or family worship as unrelated to daily_life , ethics or one s relationships with_others . In its extreme and ideological form , secularity becomes a secularism which denies citizens the right openly to express their religion and claims that_only the State can legislate on the public form which religion may take . These theories are_not new . Nor are they confined to the West or to be confused with Christianity . A healthy secularity , on the other_hand , frees religion from the encumbrance of politics , and allows politics to be enriched by the contribution of religion , while maintaining the necessary distance , clear distinction and indispensable collaboration between_the two spheres . No society can develop in a healthy way without embodying a spirit of mutual respect between politics and religion , avoiding the constant temptation either to merge the two or to set them -atti_degli_apostoli- odds . The basis of a constructive relationship_between politics and religion_-isaia- , first_and_foremost , human_nature \u2013 a sound understanding of man \u2013 and full respect_for inalienable human_rights . A sense of this correct relationship should lead to the realization that relations_between the spiritual religious and the temporal political spheres should be marked by a kind of unity in distinction , inasmuch as both are_called , while remaining distinct , to cooperate harmoniously in the service of the common_good . This kind of healthy secularity ensures that political activity does_not manipulate religion , while the practice of religion remains free_from a politics of self interest which -atti_degli_apostoli- times -isaia- barely compatible with , if not downright contrary to , religious belief . For this_reason , a healthy secularity , embodying unity in distinction , -isaia- necessary and even vital for both spheres . The challenges raised by the relationship of politics and religion can be met patiently and courageously through a sound human and religious formation . Constant emphasis needs to be put on the place of God in personal , family and civic life , and on the proper place of men_and_women in God s plan . Above all , greater prayer_-isaia- required_for this intention . Economic and political instability , a readiness on the part of some to manipulate others , and a defective understanding of religion help open the door to religious fundamentalism . This phenomenon afflicts all religious communities , and denies their long standing tradition of coexistence . It wants to gain power , -atti_degli_apostoli- times violently , over individual consciences , and over religion itself , for political reasons . I appeal urgently to all Jewish , Christian and Muslim religious leaders in the region to seek , by their example and by their teaching , to do everything in their_power to eliminate this menace which indiscriminately and fatally affects believers of all religions . '' To use the revealed word , the Sacred Scriptures or the name of God to justify our interests , our easy and convenient policies or our violence , -isaia- a very grave fault '' . Life in the Middle East -isaia- rich in diversity , but all too frequently restrictive and even violent . This affects all the inhabitants of the region and every aspect of their_lives . Christians , who frequently find_themselves in a delicate position , feel keenly , -atti_degli_apostoli- times with weariness and little hope , the negative consequences of these conflicts and uncertainties . They experience frequent humiliation . They know from experience that_they_are often the victims when trouble breaks out . After taking an active part for centuries in the growth of their_respective nations and helping to forge their identity and prosperity , many Christians are_now seeking more favourable horizons and places of peace where their_families will_be_able to live a dignified and secure life , and spaces of freedom where_they can express their_faith openly without fear of various constraints . This -isaia- a heart rending decision . It has a profound impact on individuals , families and Churches . It dismembers nations and contributes to the human , cultural and religious impoverishment of the Middle East . A Middle East without Christians , or with only a few Christians , would no longer be the Middle East , since Christians , together_with other believers , are part of the distinctive identity of the region . All are responsible before God for one_another . Thus it -isaia- important_that politicians and religious leaders appreciate this and avoid those policies or partisan strategies which_would result in a monochromatic Middle East that_would be completely unreflective of its rich human and historic reality . The Pastors of the Eastern Catholic Churches sui iuris realize with regret and concern that the numbers of their faithful_are dwindling in the traditional Patriarchal territories , and for some time now they_have had to develop a plan of pastoral_care for emigrants . I -amos- certain that_they_are doing all in their_power to exhort the faithful to continue to hope , not to leave their homelands and not to sell their possessions . I ask them to continue to show affection for their priests and faithful in the diaspora , and I encourage them to stay in close contact_with their_families and Churches and above all to remain steadfast in their_faith in God through_their religious identity , built as it -isaia- upon venerable spiritual traditions . By preserving this closeness to God and to their_respective Churches , and by cultivating a deep love of their Latin brothers_and_sisters , they_will greatly benefit the entire Catholic Church . I also exhort the Church s Pastors in those places_where Eastern Catholics have settled to welcome them_with charity and fraternal esteem , to facilitate the bonds of communion_between emigrants and their Churches of origin , and to enable them to celebrate in accordance_with their_own traditions and , wherever possible , to develop pastoral and parish activities . The Latin Church in the Middle East , which_has also seen a dramatic decline in the number of its faithful , operates in different circumstances and has to deal_with a variety of new pastoral challenges . In countries with strong economies , her Pastors have to respond to a massive influx of workers coming from Africa , the Far East and the Indian sub continent . These groups , comprising many single men_and_women or entire families , face insecurity on two fronts . They are aliens in the country where_they work , and they frequently experience discrimination and injustice . God has a special concern_for the foreigner , who thus deserves respect . The way we treat strangers will be taken into_account -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Judgement cf . These persons , downtrodden , -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of others and unable to defend themselves , bound by contracts which_are more_or_less limited , or even legal , are_often the victims of violations of local laws and international conventions . They also face powerful pressure and grave religious restrictions . The task of their Pastors -isaia- both necessary and delicate . I encourage all the Catholic faithful and all priests , to whatever Church they belong , to manifest sincere communion and pastoral cooperation_with the local Bishop , and I ask the Bishops to show paternal understanding towards all the Eastern faithful . It -isaia- by working together and above all by speaking with one voice that , in situations like these , all will_be_able to live and celebrate their_faith , enriched by the diversity of spiritual traditions and remaining in contact_with their Christian communities of origin . I also invite the leaders of those countries which receive these new groups to respect and defend their_rights , and to allow them freely to express their_faith by promoting religious_freedom and the construction of places of worship . Religious freedom '' could become the subject of dialogue_between Christians and Muslims , a dialogue whose urgency and usefulness was reiterated by the Synod Fathers '' . Some Catholics born in the Middle East , whether out of necessity , weariness or despair , make_the dramatic decision to abandon the land of their ancestors , their family and their believing community . Others , full of hope , choose to remain in their_country and community . I encourage the latter to reaffirm their praiseworthy commitment and to remain firm in the faith . Other Catholics decide on a course -atti_degli_apostoli- least as heartrending as that of their brothers_and_sisters in the Middle East who emigrate ; fleeing from unsure prospects in the hope of building a better future , they choose to come to the countries of the region in order to live and work . Native and immigrant Catholics together constitute the current reality of Catholicism in the region . As Pastor of the universal Church , I wish to say a word to all the Catholics of the region , whether native or recently arrived , realizing that in recent_years their proportionate numbers have come closer together : for God there_-isaia- only_one people and for believers only_one faith ! Strive to live in unity and respect , and in fraternal communion with one_another in mutual love and esteem , so as to be credible witnesses to your faith in the death_and_resurrection of Christ ! God will hear your prayer , he will bless your way_of_life and give_you his Spirit to enable you to bear the burden of the day . For '' where_the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- , there_-isaia- freedom '' Cor : . To Christians who_were experiencing similar situations Saint Peter wrote the following words of exhortation which I willingly address to you : '' Now who_-isaia- there to harm you , if you_are zealous for what_-isaia- right ? . Have no fear of them , nor be troubled , but in your hearts reverence Christ the Lord . Always be prepared to make a defence to anyone_who calls you to account for the hope that_-isaia- in you '' Pet : . PART TWO '' The company of those_who believed were of one heart and one soul '' Acts : . The outward aspect of the nascent Christian community was described in terms of spiritual qualities which express the Church s koinonia : those_who believed were of one heart and one soul . This phrase conveys the profound meaning of giving witness , which_-isaia- the reflection of an interior life both personal and communitarian . By letting itself be inwardly knit together by divine_grace , each particular Church can experience anew the beauty of the first community of believers which_was united in that_faith moved by charity that visibly characterizes the disciples of Christ cf . Koinonia brings consistency and coherence to witness , and demands constant conversion . Conversion for its part brings communion to perfection and in turn consolidates witness . '' Without communion there_can be no witness : the life of communion_-isaia- truly the great witness . '' Communion -isaia-_a_gift to be fully accepted by all and a reality to be constantly built up anew . I invite all the members of the Churches present in the Middle East , each in accordance_with his or her vocation , to consolidate communion , humbly and prayerfully , so that the unity for_which Christ prayed may be realized cf . The Catholic notion of the Church looks to the communion_which exists between_the universal and the particular . There -isaia- a relationship of mutual interiority between_the universal Church and the particular Churches , and this identifies and makes concrete the Church s catholicity . The presence of the whole in each of the parts gives each part an inner impulse towards universality , an impulse that in one sense -isaia- manifested in the missionary impulse of each of the Churches and , in another sense , in the sincere recognition of the goodness of the other parts , which includes acting in harmonious cooperation_with them . The universal Church -isaia- a reality which precedes the particular Churches , which_are born in and through the universal Church . This truth_-isaia- faithfully reflected in Catholic teaching , especially that of the Second Vatican Council . It leads to an understanding of the hierarchical dimension of ecclesial_communion and allows the rich and legitimate diversity of the particular Churches constantly to develop within that_unity in which particular gifts can become an authentic source of enrichment for the universality of the Church . A renewed and lived awareness of these basic principles of ecclesiology will allow for a rediscovery of the distinctiveness and richness of Catholic identity in the lands of the East . As Fathers and Heads of Churches sui iuris , the Patriarchs are visible points of reference and watchful guardians of communion . By nature and mission , they_are men of communion , charged with tending the flock of God cf . Pet : , and servants of ecclesial unity . They exercise a ministry which works through charity lived authentically -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels : between_the Patriarchs themselves and between each Patriarch and the Bishops , priests , consecrated_persons and lay_faithful under his jurisdiction . Patriarchs , whose indefectible union with the Bishop of Rome -isaia- rooted in the ecclesiastica communio which_they request from the Pope following their canonical election , show by this special bond the Church s universality and unity . Their care extends to all the disciples of Jesus Christ living in the patriarchal territory . As a sign of communion in the service of witness , they_should strive to strengthen union and solidarity within_the Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the Middle East and the various patriarchal Synods , and recognize_the need to consult one_another in matters of great_importance for the Church prior to taking a unified collegial action . For the credibility of their witness , Patriarchs should seek righteousness , godliness , faith , love , steadfastness and gentleness cf . Tim : , and adopt a sober manner of life in imitation of Christ , who became poor so that by his poverty we might become rich cf . They should_also take_care to promote concrete solidarity among the ecclesiastical jurisdictions through careful management of personnel and the Church s resources . This -isaia-_part of their_duties . Following the example of Jesus , who passed through towns and villages in the fulfilment of his_mission cf . Mk : , Patriarchs are to be zealous in making the required pastoral visitations . They ought to do so not_only as a means of exercising their right and duty of vigilance , but_also as a practical sign of fraternal and paternal charity towards_the Bishops , priests and lay_faithful , and especially towards_the poor , the sick and the outcast , and those who_suffer spiritually . By virtue of his ordination , a Bishop becomes both a member of the College of Bishops and the pastor of a local community through his_ministry of teaching , preaching and governance . With the Patriarchs , Bishops are visible signs of the unity in diversity which_-isaia- proper to the Church as the Body whose Head -isaia- Christ cf . They were_the first to be freely chosen and sent forth to make disciples of all nations , teaching them to observe all that the risen Lord commanded cf . Hence it -isaia- of vital importance that they_themselves hear God s word and treasure it in their_hearts . They must proclaim it with courage , defending firmly the integrity and unity of the faith amid the difficult situations which , sadly , are all too common in the Middle East . To promote the life of communion and diakonia , it -isaia- important_for Bishops to strive constantly for their_own personal renewal . This interior vigilance demands '' above all a life of prayer , self denial , sacrifice and listening to others ; it also demands an exemplary life as apostles and pastors based on simplicity , poverty and humility ; finally it includes a constant concern to defend truth , justice , sound morals and to protect the weak '' . The greatly desired renewal of communities demands_that Bishops show pastoral concern_for all the baptized , and in a particular_way for their closest co workers , the priests . Communion within each local Church -isaia- the primary basis of communion_between the Churches , which_-isaia- constantly nourished by the word of God and the sacraments , and by other_forms of prayer . I encourage Bishops to show concern_for all the faithful present in their jurisdiction , regardless of their social condition , nationality or Church of origin . They should shepherd the flock entrusted to them and watch over them , '' not domineering over those in their charge , but being examples to the flock '' Pet : . They should show particular concern_for those who_do_not regularly practise their_faith and those_who for various reasons no longer practise the faith -atti_degli_apostoli- all . They should_also strive to be Christ s loving presence among_those who_do_not profess the Christian faith . By so doing , they_will promote unity among Christians themselves and solidarity between all men_and_women created in the image of God cf . Gen : , the Father from whom all things come and for_whom we exist cf . It -isaia-_the_duty of the Bishops to ensure_that the temporal goods of the Church are managed wisely , honestly and transparently in accordance_with_the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches or the Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church . The Synod Fathers called_for a serious audit of finances and holdings in order to avoid any possible confusion between personal and Church property . The Apostle Paul calls the servant of God a steward of the mysteries of God : '' and it -isaia- required of stewards that_they be found trustworthy '' Cor : . A steward administers property that_-isaia-_not his and which , according to the Apostle , -isaia- destined to a higher use , that of the mysteries of God cf . Such scrupulous and impartial management , called_for by the monastic founders \u2013 the true pillars of many of the Eastern Churches \u2013 should be directed primarily to evangelization and charity . Bishops should see_to_it_that priests , who_are their first co workers , receive a just remuneration so that_they_will not be distracted by temporal concerns but may devote_themselves with dignity to the things of God and to their pastoral mission . Those who help the poor obtain heaven ! Saint James insists on the respect due to the poor , their importance and their true place in the community cf . The administration of the Church s goods must_therefore become a clear way of proclaiming Jesus message of liberation : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor . He has_sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the acceptable year of the Lord '' Lk : . The faithful steward -isaia-_the_one who_has understood that the Lord alone_-isaia- the pearl of great price cf . Mt : ; he alone_-isaia- our true treasure Mt : ; : . May every Bishop be a clear example of this to his priests , seminarians and faithful ! Moreover , the alienation of Church goods should adhere strictly to the relevant canonical norms and current papal legislation . Priests , deacons and seminarians . By his ordination the priest_-isaia- configured to Christ and becomes a close collaborator of the Patriarch and Bishop in whose threefold munus he shares . This itself makes him a servant of communion ; the fulfilment of this role demands_that he remain closely united to Christ and be zealous in charity and works of mercy towards all . Thus he will_be_able to radiate that holiness to which all the baptized are_called . He will teach and encourage the People of God to build up the civilization of evangelical love and unity . To this_end he should renew and confirm his flock in the life of faith by wisely passing on God s word and the Church s Tradition and teaching , and by celebrating the sacraments . The Eastern traditions are marked by great insight into the practice of spiritual direction . May priests , deacons and consecrated_persons avail themselves of this practice and thereby open to the faithful pathways to eternity . Bearing witness to communion also requires a solid theological and spiritual formation which in turn calls for ongoing intellectual and spiritual renewal . Bishops should provide priests and deacons with the means necessary to enable them to deepen their_life of faith and thus benefit the faithful , giving them '' food in due season '' Ps : . The faithful also rightly expect of them an example of unblemished conduct cf . Dear priests , I invite you to rediscover each_day the ontological dimension of Holy Orders , which inspires you to live the priesthood as a source of sanctification for the baptized and for the betterment of every man_and_woman . '' Tend the flock of God that_-isaia- your charge . not_for shameful gain , but eagerly '' Pet : . Hold in high esteem the practice of living and working together , when possible , as a ministerial team , whatever difficulties this may entail Pet : ; this_will help you to esteem and experience more_fully priestly and pastoral communion -atti_degli_apostoli- the local and universal levels . Dear deacons , in communion with your Bishop and the priests , serve the people of God in exercising your ministry in the specific responsibilities entrusted to you . Priestly celibacy -isaia- a priceless gift of God to his Church , one_which ought to be received with appreciation in East and West alike , for it represents an ever timely prophetic sign . Mention must_also be made of the ministry of married priests , who_are an ancient part of the Eastern tradition . I would_like to encourage those priests_who , along_with their_families , are_called to holiness in the faithful exercise of their_ministry and in sometimes difficult living conditions . To all I repeat that the excellence of your priestly life will doubtless raise up new vocations which_you are_called to cultivate . The calling of the young Samuel cf . Sam : teaches us that we need competent guides to assist us in discerning the will of the Lord and in responding generously to his call . Hence the flowering of vocations must be supported by a specific pastoral plan . It has to be sustained by prayer in families , parishes , ecclesial movements and educational institutions . Those who answer the Lord s call need to experience growth in specific centres of formation and be guided by suitable and exemplary formators , who_will train them in prayer , communion , witness and missionary awareness . There should be appropriate programmes to deal_with the spiritual , intellectual and pastoral aspects of human_life , while taking prudent account of differing social contexts , origins and cultural and ecclesial backgrounds . Dear seminarians , a reed cannot grow where there_-isaia- no water cf . Job : ; nor_can you be true builders of communion and authentic witnesses of faith without being deeply rooted in Christ , without constant conversion to his_word , without love of his Church and selfless love of neighbour . Even today you are_being called to live and build communion for the sake of a courageous and blameless witness . The strengthening of God s People in faith will depend on the quality of your_own witness . I ask you to grow in openness to the cultural diversity of your Churches by coming to know other languages and cultures with_a_view to your future mission . Be open likewise to diversity in the Church and among all Christians , and to interreligious dialogue . A careful reading of my Letter to Seminarians should be of help in this_regard . The consecrated_life . Monasticism in its different_forms was_born in the Middle East and gave rise to several of the Churches in the region . Monks and nuns have devoted their_lives to prayer , sanctifying the day and night hours and bringing to their prayers the concerns and needs of the Church and all mankind . May they be a constant reminder to everyone of how important prayer_-isaia- for the life of the Church and of each member of the faithful . May monasteries also be places_where the faithful can_find guidance in learning to pray ! . The consecrated_life , whether contemplative or apostolic , -isaia- a deepening of the consecration received in Baptism . Men and women_religious seek to follow Christ more radically through the profession of the evangelical_counsels of obedience , chastity and poverty . Their unreserved gift_of_self to the Lord and their disinterested love for every_individual are a form of witness to God and a real sign of his_love for the world . Lived as a precious gift of the Holy Spirit , the consecrated_life -isaia- an indispensable support for the Church s life and pastoral_activity . Religious communities will be prophetic signs of communion in their Churches and throughout_the_world if they_are truly grounded in the word of God , fraternal communion and the witness of service cf . In the coenobitic life , each community or monastery -isaia- meant to be a privileged setting for union with God and communion with one s neighbour . It -isaia- a place_where consecrated_persons learn each_day to start afresh from Christ in order to be faithful to their_mission in prayer and recollection , and to be for all the faithful a sign of the eternal_life which has_already begun here below cf . I invite all of you_who are_called in the Middle East to follow Christ in the religious_life : let yourselves be seduced by the word of God , as was_the prophet Jeremiah , and hold that word in your heart like a consuming fire cf . It -isaia- the reason_for existing , the foundation and the ultimate and objective reference point of your consecration . The word of God -isaia- truth . By obeying this word , you purify your souls so as to love one_another sincerely as brothers_and_sisters cf . Whatever the canonical status of your religious institute , always be open to cooperate , in a spirit of communion with the Bishop , in pastoral and missionary activities . The religious_life -isaia- one of personal devotion to Christ , the Head of the Body cf . Col : ; Eph : and it reflects the indissoluble bond_between Christ and his Church . Since this_-isaia- so , support families in their Christian vocation and encourage parishes to be open to the various priestly and religious callings . This will serve to consolidate the life of communion for the sake of witness within_the local Church . Never grow tired of responding to the appeals of the men_and_women of our_time , pointing out the right path and the profound meaning of human_life . I would_like to add a further consideration directed not_only to consecrated_persons alone , but to all the members of Eastern Catholic Churches . It concerns the evangelical_counsels , which_are particularly characteristic of the monastic life , a form of religious_life which played a decisive role in the origins of numerous Churches sui iuris and continues to do so in their_life today . It seems to me that we ought to meditate long and hard on the evangelical_counsels : obedience , chastity and poverty , in order to discover anew their beauty , the power of their witness and their pastoral dimension . There can_only be inner rebirth of the faithful , the believing community and the whole Church , if each_person , according_to_his or her vocation , makes a determined and unequivocal return to the search_for God quaerere Deum which helps us to define and live authentically our relationship to God , neighbour and self . This certainly concerns the Churches sui iuris , and the Latin Church as well . Through Baptism , the lay faithful_are fully incorporated into the Body of Christ and associated_with the mission of the universal Church . Their participation in the life and internal activities of the Church -isaia- the perennial spiritual source enabling them to reach beyond_the confines of ecclesial structures . As apostles in the world , they translate the Gospel , the doctrine and social_teaching of the Church into concrete actions . Indeed , '' Christians as fully fledged citizens can and must do their_part with the spirit of the Beatitudes , becoming builders of peace and apostles of reconciliation to the benefit of all society . Dear lay_faithful , since temporal affairs are your proper domain , I encourage you to strengthen the bonds of fraternity and cooperation that unite you with all people_of_good_will in pursuing the common_good , sound administration of public funds , freedom of religion and respect_for the dignity of each_person . Even when_the Church s mission encounters obstacles in environments where_the explicit proclamation of the Gospel -isaia- hindered or not_possible , '' maintain good conduct among the Gentiles , so that . they_may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation '' Pet : . Be concerned to give an account of your faith cf . Pet : by the consistency of your daily_life and your activity . To make your witness truly bear_fruit cf . Mt : , , I urge you to overcome divisions and all subjective interpretations of the Christian life . Take care not to separate that life \u2013 with its values and its demands \u2013 from the life of your family or from life in society , the workplace , the political and cultural spheres , since all the many areas of the lay person s life fall under God s plan . I invite you to be bold for the sake of Christ , in the confidence that neither tribulation , nor anguish , nor persecution can separate you from him cf . In the Middle East , lay people_have long had fraternal and lasting relationships with the Catholic faithful of the various patriarchal or Latin Churches , and are used to attending one_another s places of worship , especially_when there_-isaia- need . To this impressive reality , which demonstrates an authentic experience of communion , one_must add the fact_that within a single territory various ecclesial jurisdictions overlap in a beneficial way . In this particular area , the Church in the Middle East sets an example for other_local Churches in the rest of the world . The Middle East -isaia- thus , in a certain_sense , a laboratory where_the future of the Church -isaia-_already being developed . Exemplary as it -isaia- , this experience also needs to be constantly improved and purified , as does the experience acquired locally in the field of ecumenism . The family , a divine institution founded on marriage as willed by the Creator himself cf . Gen : ; Mt : , -isaia- nowadays exposed to a number of threats . The Christian family in particular -isaia- faced more_than_ever before with the issue of its deepest identity . The essential properties of sacramental marriage \u2013 unity and indissolubility cf . Mt : \u2013 and the Christian model of family , sexuality and love , are in our_day , if not called into question , -atti_degli_apostoli- least misunderstood by some of the faithful . There -isaia- a temptation to adopt models contrary to the Gospel , under the influence of a certain contemporary culture that_has spread throughout_the_world . Conjugal love -isaia-_part of the definitive covenant between God and his_people , fully sealed in the sacrifice of the cross . Its character as mutual self_giving , even to the point of martyrdom , -isaia- clearly expressed in some of the Eastern Churches , where each spouse receives the other as a '' crown '' during the marriage ceremony , which_-isaia- rightly called a '' liturgy of coronation '' . Conjugal love_-isaia- not a fleeting event , but the patient project of a lifetime . Called to live a Christ like love each_day , the Christian family_-isaia- a privileged expression of the Church s presence and mission in the world . As such , it needs to be accompanied pastorally and supported in its problems and difficulties , especially in places_where social , familial and religious bearings tend to grow weak or to be lost . Christian families of the Middle East , I invite each of you to be constantly reborn through the power of God s word and the sacraments , so as to become more_fully a domestic Church which_-isaia- a place of formation in faith and prayer , a seedbed of vocations , the natural school of virtues and ethical values , and the primary living cell of society . Always look to the Holy Family of Nazareth , which_had the joy of receiving life and demonstrating its piety by the observance of the Law and the religious practices of the time cf . Look to this family which knew anxiety when_the child Jesus was lost , as well as the pain of persecution , emigration and hard daily labour cf . Help your children to grow in wisdom , in stature and in grace under the watchful eye of God and of men cf . Lk : ; teach them to trust the Father , to imitate Christ , and to let themselves be guided by the Holy Spirit . After these brief reflections on the shared dignity and vocation of man_and_woman in marriage , my thoughts turn in a particular_way towards women in the Middle East . The first creation account shows the essential equality of men_and_women cf . This equality was damaged by the effects of sin cf . Overcoming this legacy , the fruit of sin , -isaia-_the_duty of every human_person , whether man or woman . I want to assure all women that the Catholic Church , in fidelity to God s plan , works to advance women s personal_dignity and equality with men in response to the wide variety of forms of discrimination which_they experience simply because_they_are women . Such practices seriously harm the life of communion and witness . They gravely offend not_only women but , above all , God the Creator . In recognition of their innate inclination to love and protect human_life , and paying tribute to their_specific contribution to education , healthcare , humanitarian work and the apostolic_life , I believe_that women should play , and be allowed to play , a greater part in public and ecclesial life . In this_way they will_be_able to make their_specific contribution to building a more fraternal society and a Church whose beauty -isaia- ever_more evident in the genuine communion existing among the baptized . In those unfortunate instances where litigation takes_place between men_and_women , especially regarding marital questions , the woman s voice must_also be heard and taken into_account with a respect equal to that shown towards_the man , in order to put an end to certain injustices . Here there needs to be a more sound and fair implementation of Church law . The Church s justice must be exemplary -atti_degli_apostoli- every level and in every field in which_it_-isaia- exercised . It -isaia- absolutely vital to ensure_that litigation on marital questions does_not lead to apostasy . Christians in the region must_also have_the opportunity to apply their_proper law in the area of marriage and in other areas without restriction . Young people and children . I greet with paternal solicitude all the children and young_people of the Church in the Middle East . My thoughts turn to the young who_are searching for long term human and Christian direction for their_lives . At the same_time I think of all those_whose youth has_been marked by a gradual move away from the Church , leading them to abandon the practice of religion . Dear young_people , I encourage you to cultivate a true and lasting friendship with Jesus cf . Jn : through the power of prayer . The firmer that friendship becomes , the better it will serve as a beacon to protect you from youthful failings cf . Personal prayer_-isaia- strengthened by frequent recourse to the sacraments , which_make possible an authentic encounter_with God and with one s brothers_and_sisters in the Church . Do not be afraid or ashamed to bear_witness to your friendship with Jesus among your family and in public . In doing so , always be respectful towards other believers , Jews and Muslims , with whom_you share belief in God , the Creator of heaven and earth , as well as lofty humane and spiritual ideals . Do not be afraid or ashamed to be a Christian . Your relationship_with Jesus will_help you to cooperate generously with your fellow citizens , whatever their religious affiliation , so as to build the future of your countries on human_dignity , which -isaia-_the_source and foundation of freedom , and on equality and on peace in justice . By loving Christ and his Church , you will come to discern wisely those values in modern culture that will_bring you fulfilment and those evils that gradually poison your life . Try not to be seduced by materialism and by some social networks whose indiscriminate use can lead to a distortion of genuine human relations . The Church in the Middle East counts greatly on your prayer , enthusiasm , creativity , know_how and deep commitment to serving Christ , the Church , society and especially_the other young_people of your age . Do not_hesitate to take_part in every initiative that_will help you to strengthen your faith and to respond to the particular call that the Lord addresses to you . Do not_hesitate to follow Christ s call by choosing priestly , religious or missionary life . Dear children , need I remind you that , in your journey with the Lord , particular honour -isaia- due to your parents cf . Ex : ; Dt : ? They are your educators in faith . God has_entrusted you to them as a marvellous gift , for them to care_for your health , your human and Christian education , and your intellectual formation . For their_part , parents , teachers and guides , and the public institutions have a duty to respect the rights of children from the moment of their conception . As for you , dear children , learn how to obey God here and now by obeying your parents , as the child Jesus did cf . Learn also to live the Christian life in your families , -atti_degli_apostoli- school and elsewhere . The Lord does_not forget you cf . He -isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- your side and he wants you to walk with_him by being responsible , courageous and kind cf . Bless the Lord God in everything , ask him to guide your steps and to make your paths and plans prosper ; always remember his commandments and do not let_them fade from your heart cf . Once again I would_like to stress the education of children and young_people , which -isaia-_a_matter of the utmost importance . The Christian family_-isaia- the natural setting for children and young_people to grow in faith , their first school of catechesis . In these troubled times , educating a child or a young person_-isaia- not easy . This indispensable task -isaia- made all the more complex by the particular socio political and religious situation of the region . That -isaia- why I want to assure parents of my support and my prayers . It -isaia- important_that children grow up in a united family that lives its faith simply and with conviction . It -isaia- important_for children and young_people to see their_parents pray . It -isaia- important_that they go with_them to church , and that_they see and understand_that their_parents love God and wish to know him better . And it -isaia-_especially important_that children and young_people see their_parents charity towards those in need . In this_way they_will understand that_it_-isaia- good and beautiful to love God ; they_will enjoy going to church and be proud to do so , for they_will have experienced personally that_he_-isaia- the solid rock on which_they can build their_lives cf . For those children and young_people who_do_not have this good fortune , my hope -isaia- that_they_will find authentic witnesses on their journey through life , friends who_will help_them to meet Christ and to discover the joy of following him . PART THREE '' We proclaim . the power and the wisdom of God '' Cor : . Christian witness , the primary form of mission , -isaia-_part of the Church s deepest vocation , in fidelity to the mandate received_from_the Lord Jesus : '' You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth '' Acts : . When she proclaims Christ crucified and risen cf . Acts : , the Church becomes ever more_fully what she -isaia-_already by nature and vocation : the sacrament of communion and reconciliation with God and between men . Communion and witness to Christ are thus two aspects of a single reality : both draw from the same source , the Holy Trinity , and rest on the same foundations : the word of God and the sacraments . The word of God and the sacraments nourish and give authenticity to other acts of divine_worship and the devotional practices of popular_piety . Progress in the spiritual_life entails an increase in charity and leads naturally to witness . Before all else , the Christian -isaia- a witness . To be a witness , however , calls not_only_for a Christian formation which imparts an understanding of the truths of faith , but_also_for a life in harmony_with that_faith , a life capable of responding to the expectations and needs of our contemporaries . The word of God , soul and source of communion and witness . '' They devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching '' Acts : . With these_words Saint Luke makes_the first community the prototype of the apostolic Church , that_-isaia- to say , one that_-isaia- founded on the Apostles chosen by Christ and on their teaching . The Church s principal mission , which_she has received_from Christ himself , -isaia- to preserve intact the deposit of the apostolic faith cf . Tim : , the foundation of her unity , while proclaiming this faith to the whole_world . The Apostles teaching brought out the relationship of the Church to the Scriptures of the first Covenant , which find_their fulfilment in the person of Jesus Christ cf . Meditation on the mystery of the Church as communion and witness , in the light of the Scriptures , that great book of the Covenant between God and his_people cf . Ex : , guides us to the knowledge of God ; it -isaia- a '' light for our path '' Ps : , '' lest we stumble '' Ps : . May the Christian faithful , as heirs of this covenant , always seek truth in the whole of the divinely inspired Scriptures cf . The Bible -isaia- not a historical curio , but '' the work of the Holy Spirit , through_which we can hear_the very voice of the Lord and know his presence in history '' \u2013 our human_history . The exegetical schools of Alexandria , Antioch , Edessa and Nisibe contributed significantly to the Church s understanding and dogmatic formulation of the Christian mystery in the fourth and fifth centuries . For this , the whole Church remains indebted to them . The representatives of the various schools of textual interpretation were agreed on the traditional principles of exegesis accepted by the Churches of both East and West . The most important of these_principles -isaia- the conviction_that Jesus Christ incarnates the intrinsic unity of the two Testaments and consequently the unity of God s saving plan in history cf . The disciples would only come to understand this_unity after_the resurrection , once Jesus had_been glorified cf . A second principle -isaia- fidelity to a typological reading of the Bible , whereby certain Old Testament events are seen as a prefiguration a type and figure of realities in the new Covenant in Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- thus_the hermeneutical key to the entire Bible cf . The Church s liturgical and spiritual writings bear_witness to the continued validity of these_two principles of interpretation , which shape the ecclesial celebration of the word of God and inspire Christian witness . The Second Vatican Council went on to explain that the correct meaning of the sacred texts -isaia- found by considering the content and unity of the whole of Scripture , in the light of the living Tradition of the whole Church and the analogy of faith . For a truly ecclesial approach to the Bible , it would be most helpful to read , both individually and in groups , the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Verbum Domini . The Christian presence in the biblical countries of the Middle East -isaia- much more_than a sociological factor or a mere cultural and economic success story . By rediscovering its original inspiration and following in the footsteps of those first disciples whom Jesus chose to be his companions and whom he sent out to preach cf . Mk : , the Christian presence will_take on new vitality . If the word of God -isaia- to be the soul and foundation of the Christian life , the Bible should be readily available within families ; this_will favour daily reading and meditation on God s word lectio divina . Suitable means must be found to establish a genuine biblical apostolate . Modern communications media can prove an excellent means_for proclaiming the word of God and promoting reading and meditation on that word . Simple and accessible ways of explaining the Bible will_help to dispel prejudices and mistaken ideas about the Bible which become the source of needless and demeaning controversies . Here it would be wise to explain the necessary distinction between inspiration and revelation , inasmuch as a lack of clarity about these_two concepts in the minds of many_people leads to a false understanding of the sacred texts , with consequences for the future of interreligious dialogue . The media can_also help to disseminate the teachings of the Church s magisterium . To achieve these goals , it -isaia- important to support the means of communication which presently exist and to work_for the development of suitable new structures . The training of specialized personnel in this sector , so critical not_only in the light of rapid technical advances but also_because of its pedagogical and ethical implications , -isaia- an increasingly urgent task , especially in view of evangelization . Nonetheless , for all the importance of a wise use of the communications media , the latter can_never take the place of meditating on the word of God , personally appropriating its message , and drawing upon it in order to respond to the questions of the faithful . This will_lead in turn to a greater familiarity with the Scriptures , a yearning for a deeper spirituality and a greater involvement in the apostolate and in mission . Depending on the particular pastoral conditions of each country in the region , a Year of the Bible could be celebrated and then followed , if appropriate , by an Annual Bible Week . The liturgy and sacramental life . Throughout history the liturgy has_been an essential element in the spiritual unity and communion of the faithful in the Middle East . Indeed , the liturgy -isaia- an outstanding witness to the apostolic Tradition as preserved and developed in the particular traditions of the Churches of East and West . A renewal of liturgical texts and celebrations , where necessary , could enable the faithful to draw more_deeply from the liturgical tradition and its biblical , patristic , theological and spiritual riches through_their experience of the Mystery to which these give access . Such a renewal must of course be undertaken , to the extent possible , in cooperation_with those Churches which_are not in full_communion , yet are_also heirs to the same liturgical traditions . The desired liturgical renewal must be based on the word of God , on the proper tradition of each Church , and upon the new insights of Christian theology and anthropology . It will bear_fruit if Christians become convinced_that the sacramental life introduces them deeply into the new_life in Christ cf . Rom : ; Cor : which -isaia-_the_source of communion and witness . There -isaia- a vital link between liturgy \u2013 the source and summit of the Church s life_,_which grounds the unity of the episcopate and of the universal Church \u2013 and the ministry of Peter which preserves this_unity . The liturgy expresses this reality primarily in the Eucharist , which_-isaia- celebrated in union not only_with the Bishop , but primarily with the Pope , the order of Bishops , all the clergy and the entire people of God . Through the sacrament of Baptism , administered in the name of the Holy Trinity , we enter_into the communion of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and are configured to Christ in order that_we_may live a new_life cf . Rom : ; Col : , a life of faith and conversion cf . Baptism also incorporates us into Christ s Body , the Church , the foretaste and first fruits of a humanity reconciled in Christ cf . In communion with God , the baptized are_called to live here and now in fraternal communion among_themselves , while also growing in genuine solidarity with_other members of the human_family , whatever their race or religion . In this_context , efforts should be made to ensure_that the sacramental preparation of young_people and adults -isaia- of sufficient depth and duration . The Catholic Church regards validly conferred Baptism as '' a sacramental bond of unity among all who through it have_been reborn . '' May the day soon come when_the Catholic Church and those Churches which_are her partners in theological dialogue can reach an ecumenical agreement on the mutual recognition of Baptism , in view of the eventual restoration of full_communion in the apostolic faith ! To some extent the credibility of the Christian message and witness in the Middle East depends on this . The Eucharist , in which_the Church celebrates the great mystery of the death_and_resurrection of Jesus Christ for the salvation of many , -isaia- the basis of ecclesial_communion and brings it to its fullness . Saint Paul strikingly made the Eucharist a principle of ecclesiology : '' Because there_-isaia-_one bread , we who are_many are one_body , for we all partake of the one bread '' Cor : . Since Christ s Church , in carrying_out her_mission , suffers from the tragedy of divisions and separations , and -isaia- concerned lest her members assemble for their_own perdition cf . Cor : , she fervently hopes that the day will soon come when all Christians will -atti_degli_apostoli- last be able to receive communion together from one bread , in the unity of one_body . In celebrating the Eucharist , the Church also constantly experiences the communion of her members in their_daily witness in society , which_-isaia- an essential dimension of Christian hope . As she calls to mind the entire economy of salvation , from the incarnation to the parousia , the Church becomes ever_more conscious of the intrinsic unity between eschatological hope and commitment in the world . This notion could be given greater consideration in an age like our_own , when_the eschatological dimension of the faith_has been attenuated and the Christian sense of history moving towards fulfilment in God has yielded to earthbound perspectives and projects . As pilgrims journeying towards God , following in the footsteps of countless monks , nuns and hermits who devoted their_lives to seeking the Absolute , the Christians of the Middle East will_find in the Eucharist the strength and the light needed to bear_witness to the Gospel , even_when , as often happens , this involves going against the grain and encountering countless obstacles . They will draw strength from the intercession of the righteous , the saints , the martyrs and confessors , and all those_who were pleasing to the Lord , as our liturgies in both East and West proclaim . The sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation -isaia- an invitation to conversion of heart ; together_with_the Synod Fathers , I express my hope_for a renewed appreciation and practice of this_sacrament among the faithful . Christ clearly tells us : '' Before offering your gift -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar . go first to be reconciled with your brother '' Mt : . Sacramental conversion -isaia-_a_gift which demands to be more widely accepted and used . The sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation certainly remits sins , but it also grants healing . More frequent confession will surely help to form consciences and foster reconciliation , thus dispelling various_forms of fear and combating violence . God alone -isaia-_the_source of authentic peace cf . With this in mind , I urge Pastors and the faithful entrusted to their care to work constantly to purify individual and collective memories , dispelling prejudices through mutual acceptance and through cooperation_with people_of_good_will . I also urge them to promote every initiative of peace and reconciliation , even amid situations of persecution , and in this_way to become true disciples of Christ in the spirit of the Beatitudes cf . It -isaia- only fitting_that the '' good conduct '' of Christians cf . Pet : , by serving as an example , should become a leaven in society cf . Lk : , for it has its source in Christ , who calls all to perfection cf . Prayer and pilgrimages . The Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the Middle East forcefully emphasized the need_for prayer in the life of the Church ; through prayer the Church allows herself to be transformed by her Lord , and each member of the faithful allows Christ to live within him or her cf . As Jesus himself showed when he withdrew to pray -atti_degli_apostoli- decisive moments in his_life , the effectiveness of the mission of preaching the Gospel , and thus of Christian witness , has its source in prayer . Through openness to the working of God s Spirit , believers , by their_personal and communal prayer , enable the riches of love and the light of hope within them to break through to the world cf . May the desire_for prayer grow among the Pastors of the People of God and among the faithful , so that_their contemplation of the face of Christ may increasingly inspire their witness and their actions ! Jesus taught his_disciples to pray unceasingly and not to be discouraged cf . Situations of human suffering caused by selfishness , injustice or the thirst_for power can lead to weariness and discouragement . That -isaia- why Jesus tells us to pray constantly . Prayer -isaia- the true '' tent of meeting '' cf . Ex : , the privileged place of communion_between God and man . Let us not forget the meaning of the name of the Child whose birth was proclaimed by Isaiah and who brings salvation : Emmanuel , '' God with us '' cf . Jesus -isaia-_our Emmanuel , the true God in our midst . Let us fervently call_upon him ! . As the land of biblical revelation , the Middle East soon became a major goal of pilgrimage for_many Christians throughout world , who came to be strengthened in faith and to have a profoundly spiritual experience . Theirs was a penitential journey which expressed an authentic thirst_for God . Today s pilgrimages to the lands of the Bible need to recover this primordial insight . Marked by a spirit of penitence aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- conversion and by the desire to seek God , and walking in the earthly footsteps of Christ and the apostles , pilgrimages to the holy and apostolic places , if undertaken with intense faith , can become an authentic path of discipleship sequela Christi . They also provide the faithful with a powerful visual experience of the richness of biblical history , which evokes before their_eyes the great moments of God s saving plan . It -isaia- fitting_that pilgrimages to the biblical sites should be complemented by pilgrimages to the shrines of the martyrs and saints in whom_the Church venerates Christ , the wellspring of their martyrdom and their holiness . Certainly the Church lives in vigilant and confident expectation of the final coming of her Spouse cf . With her Lord , she knows that true worship -isaia- offered in spirit and in truth , and not restricted to a sacred place , whatever its religious and symbolic importance in the minds and hearts of believers cf . Nonetheless , the Church as a whole , and each of the baptized , legitimately feels the need of a return to the sources . In those places_where the events of our_salvation unfolded , each pilgrim can undertake a path of conversion to the Lord and find renewed enthusiasm . It -isaia- my hope that_the_faithful of the Middle East can themselves become pilgrims to these sites made holy by the Lord , and enjoy free and unrestricted access to the holy places . Pilgrimages to these sites can_also be an opportunity_for other Christians to discover the liturgical and spiritual treasures of the Eastern Churches . In this_way they can_help support and encourage the Christian communities in their steadfast and valiant efforts to remain in these blessed lands . Evangelization and charity : the Church s mission . Passing down the Christian faith_-isaia- an essential mission for the Church . To respond more_effectively to the challenges of today_s_world , I have called the entire Church to a new_evangelization . If this_-isaia- to bear_fruit , it must be completely centred on faith in Jesus Christ . Saint Paul exclaimed : '' Woe to me if I do not preach_the_gospel ! '' cf . In troubled and uncertain times , this new_evangelization seeks to make all the members of the faithful conscious that the witness of their_lives makes their words all the more compelling when_they speak of God openly and courageously in proclaiming the Good News of salvation . The Catholic Church in the Middle East -isaia- summoned , along_with the universal Church , to take an active part in this evangelization , carefully discerning today s cultural and social context and acknowledging both its possibilities and its limits . Above all else , this_-isaia- a summons to a new self evangelization through an encounter_with Christ , a summons directed to every ecclesial_community and each of her members . As Pope Paul VI put it : '' The person_who has_been evangelized goes on to evangelize others . Here lies the test of truth , the touchstone of evangelization : it -isaia- unthinkable that a person should accept the word and give himself to the Kingdom without becoming a person_who bears_witness to it and proclaims it in his turn '' . It -isaia- important to come to a deeper appreciation of the theological and pastoral significance of this evangelization , for this_will help us to '' share the inestimable gift_which God has wished to give us , making us sharers in his own_life '' . This reflection should be open to the ecumenical and interreligious dimensions inherent in the specific vocation and mission of the Catholic Church in the Middle East . For a number of years now , ecclesial movements and new communities have_been present in the Middle East . They are a gift of the Spirit for our_times . While the Spirit -isaia- not to be quenched cf . Th : , each_individual and every community -isaia- called to put their charisms -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the common_good cf . The Catholic Church in the Middle East rejoices in the witness of faith and fraternal communion given by these communities , which embrace Christians from a number of Churches without confusion or proselytism . I encourage the members of these movements and communities to be builders of communion and witnesses of the peace which_comes_from God , in union with the Bishop of the place and following his_pastoral directives , and with due regard_for the history , liturgy , spirituality and culture of the local Church . In this_way they_will show their generous and heartfelt desire to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the local Church and the universal Church . Lastly , their successful integration will serve as a sign of communion in diversity and contribute to the new_evangelization . As heir to the apostolic outreach which brought the Good News to distant lands , each of the Catholic Churches present in the Middle East -isaia-_also called to renew its missionary spirit by training and sending forth men_and_women proud of their_faith in Christ crucified and risen , and able to proclaim_the Gospel courageously both in the region and throughout_the diaspora , and even in other countries around_the world . The Year of Faith , which_-isaia- linked to the new_evangelization , if lived with intense conviction , will provide an excellent incentive for Churches of the region to evangelize themselves and to consolidate their witness to Christ . To make known the Son of God who died and rose again , the sole Saviour of mankind , -isaia- an essential duty of the Church and a grave responsibility_for all the baptized . '' God desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth '' cf . As she takes up this urgent and demanding task in a culturally and religiously pluralistic context , the Church -isaia- aided by the Holy Spirit , the gift of the risen Lord who continues to sustain his_disciples , and the treasury of great spiritual traditions which_are a sure guide to all who seek God . I encourage each ecclesiastical jurisdiction and all religious institutes and ecclesial movements to develop an authentic missionary spirit_which will serve as a sure pledge of spiritual renewal . In carrying_out this_work , the Catholic Church in the Middle East can count on the support of the universal Church . For many years , the Catholic Church in the Middle East has carried_out her_mission through a network of educational , social and charitable institutions . She has_taken to heart_the words of Jesus : '' As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : . The proclamation of the Gospel has_been accompanied by works of charity , since_it_-isaia- of the very nature of Christian charity to respond to the immediate needs of all , whatever their religion and regardless of factions or ideologies , for the sole purpose of making present on earth God s love for_humanity . Through her witness of charity , the Church makes her specific contribution to the life of society and desires to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of that peace which_the region needs . Jesus Christ always drew close to those most in need . Inspired by his example , the Church makes every_effort to serve children in her maternity clinics and orphanages , as well as the poor , the handicapped , the sick and all those in need , helping them to become part of the community . The Church believes in the inalienable dignity of each human_person ; she worships God , Creator and Father , by serving his creatures in spiritual or material need . It -isaia- because of Jesus , true God and true man , that the Church fulfils a mission of solace which seeks only to reflect God s love for_humanity . Here I wish to express my admiration and gratitude to all those men_and_women_who have consecrated their_lives to this noble ideal , and to assure them of God s blessing . The Middle East -isaia- home to many Catholic educational centres , schools , institutes of higher learning and universities . The men_and_women_religious and the lay_people who work in them carry_out impressive work_which I cannot_fail to praise and encourage . Alien to every_form of proselytism , these Catholic educational institutions open their doors to students of other Churches and other_religions . As an invaluable means_for ensuring the cultural and intellectual formation of young_people , they show in an inspiring way_that living together in respect and cooperation -isaia- possible in the Middle East , if young_people are trained in tolerance and the constant pursuit of human betterment . These institutions are_also attentive to the local cultures , which_they support by emphasizing the positive elements that_they contain . Greater solidarity between parents , students , the universities and the Eparchies and Dioceses , together_with_the help of credit unions , will ensure access to education for everyone , especially_those lacking the necessary resources . The Church asks the various political authorities to support these institutions , whose activities contribute in a real and effective manner to the common_good , to the building up and the future of different nations . Catechesis and Christian formation . In his First Letter Saint Peter writes : '' Always be prepared to make a defence to anyone_who calls you to account for the hope that_-isaia- in you , yet do it with gentleness and reverence '' : . The baptized have_received the gift of faith . This inspires the whole of their_lives and leads them to defend it with sensitivity and respect_for persons , but also_with frankness and courage cf . The faithful also need to receive an adequate formation in the celebration of the sacred mysteries , a basic knowledge of revealed doctrine and encouragement in their_efforts to put their_faith into_practice in daily_life and activity . This formation_-isaia- ensured above all by a catechesis which , to the extent possible , should be carried_out in a spirit of fraternal cooperation between_the different Churches . The liturgy , and above all the celebration of the Eucharist , -isaia- a school of faith_which leads to witness . The word of God , proclaimed in a way suited to its hearers , should lead the faithful to discover its presence and power for their_lives and for the lives of men_and_women today . The Catechism of the Catholic Church -isaia- a necessary and fundamental resource . As I have_already mentioned , the study and teaching of the Catechism -isaia- to be encouraged , together_with a practical introduction to the Church s social_teaching as expressed particularly in the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church and in the great documents of the papal magisterium . The reality of ecclesial life in the Middle East and mutual assistance in carrying_out the diakonia of charity will_enable this formation to take on an ecumenical dimension , depending on the nature of each place and in agreement with the respective ecclesiastical authorities . Finally , the involvement of Christians in the life of the Church and in civic institutions must be reinforced by a solid spiritual formation . There appears to be a need to assist the faithful , especially_those of the Eastern traditions and in the light of the history of their_respective Churches , to have access to the treasures of the Fathers of the Church and the great masters of the spiritual_life . I invite the various Synods and other episcopal bodies to reflect on how this goal can gradually be attained and how a contemporary presentation of patristic theology can complement and enrich the teaching of Scripture . This would enable priests , men_and_women_religious , and seminarians or novices to draw from the treasures found in the writings of the Fathers and the spiritual masters to deepen their_own life of faith , and then faithfully hand those treasures down to others . The teachings of the great spiritual masters of East and West , and of the saints \u2013 men_and_women alike \u2013 will assist all those_who truly seek God . '' Fear not , little flock ! '' Lk : . With these_words of Christ , I wish to exhort all the Pastors and Christian faithful in the Middle East courageously to keep alive the flame of divine_love both in the Church and in all those places_where they live and work . In this_way , they_will preserve in their integrity the essence and mission of the Church as willed by Christ . Legitimate historical differences will enrich the communion existing among the baptized with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ , whose blood cleanses us from all sin cf . At the dawn of Christianity , Saint Peter , Apostle of Jesus Christ , wrote his First Letter to the communities of believers in Asia Minor who_were experiencing difficulties . At the beginning of this_new millennium , it was beneficial for the Pastors and faithful of the Middle East , and elsewhere , to gather around_the Successor of Peter for common prayer and reflection . The demands of the apostolic mission and the complexity of the moment call_for prayer and for renewed pastoral enthusiasm . The urgency of the present hour and the injustice of so many tragic situations invite us to reread the First Letter of Peter and to join in bearing_witness to Christ who died and rose again . This '' togetherness '' , this communion willed by our Lord and God , -isaia- needed now more_than_ever . Let us put aside all that could be cause for discontent , however justifiable , in order to concentrate unanimously on the one_thing necessary : the goal of uniting the whole of humanity and the entire universe in God s only Son cf . Christ entrusted to Peter the specific mission of feeding his lambs cf . Jn : and it -isaia- upon him_that he built his Church cf . As the Successor of Peter , I cannot overlook the trials and sufferings of Christ s faithful and especially_those who_live in the Middle East . In a particular_way , the Pope continues to be spiritually close to them . That -isaia- why , in the name of God , I ask the political and religious authorities of the Middle East not_just to relieve these sufferings , but to eliminate the causes which produce them . I ask them to do all in their_power to ensure_that peace -atti_degli_apostoli- last prevails . Nor -isaia- the Pope unmindful that the Church \u2013 the holy city , the heavenly Jerusalem \u2013 whose corner stone -isaia- Christ Pet : and which he has_received the mission to care_for on earth , -isaia- built on foundations adorned with precious stones of various colours cf . The venerable Eastern Churches and the Latin Church are these brilliant jewels , worn down and made smooth by constant worship before '' the river of the water of life , bright as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb '' Rev : . So that men_and_women may see the face of God and his_name marked on their foreheads cf . Rev : , I invite all the Catholic faithful to let_the Spirit of God increasingly strengthen their communion , and to live it out in a simple and joyful fraternity . I know_that circumstances -atti_degli_apostoli- times can lead to compromises which threaten to disrupt this human and Christian communion . Unfortunately , these occur all too_often and this '' lukewarm '' spirit_-isaia- displeasing to God cf . The light of Christ cf . Jn : -isaia- meant to spread to the farthest ends of the earth and to the hearts of all men_and_women , even where_the darkness -isaia- deepest cf . If we are to be lamps bearing the one Light cf . Lk : and witnesses in every circumstance cf . Mk : , it -isaia- important to choose the path which_leads to life cf . Mt : and to leave behind the barren works of darkness cf . Eph : , resolutely casting them off cf . By its witness , may the '' brotherhood '' of Christians become a leaven in the whole human_family cf . Mt : ! May Christ s followers in the Middle East , Catholics and other Christians as well , be one in courageously bearing this difficult yet exhilarating witness to Christ , and thus receive the crown of life Rev : b ! May they know_the encouragement and support of the Christian world as a whole . May the trials experienced by some of our_brothers_and_sisters cf . Ps : ; Is : ; Pet : strengthen the fidelity and faith of all ! '' May grace and peace be multiplied to you . Peace to all of you that_are in Christ '' Pet : b ; : b ! . The heart of Mary , Theot\u00f3kos and Mother of the Church , was pierced cf . Lk : on account of the '' contradiction '' brought by her_divine Son , that_-isaia- to say , because of the opposition and hostility to his_mission of light_which Christ himself had to face , and which_the Church , his mystical Body , continues to experience . May Mary , whom_the whole Church , in East and West alike , venerates with affection , grant us her_maternal assistance . Mary All Holy , who walked in our midst , will once_again present our needs to her_divine Son . She offers us her Son . Let us listen to her , for she opens our_hearts to hope : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : .

Charity in truth , to which Jesus Christ bore witness by his earthly life and especially by his death_and_resurrection , -isaia- the principal driving force behind the authentic development of every_person and of all humanity . Love caritas -isaia- an extraordinary force which_leads people to opt for courageous and generous engagement in the field of justice_and_peace . It -isaia- a force that_has its origin in God , Eternal Love and Absolute Truth . Each person finds his good by adherence to God s plan_for him , in order to realize it fully : in this plan , he finds his truth , and through adherence to this_truth he becomes free cf . To defend the truth , to articulate it with humility and conviction , and to bear_witness to it in life are therefore exacting and indispensable forms of charity . Charity , in fact , '' rejoices in the truth '' Cor : . All people feel the interior impulse to love authentically : love and truth never abandon them completely , because these_are the vocation planted by God in the heart and mind of every human_person . The search_for love and truth_-isaia- purified and liberated by Jesus Christ from the impoverishment that_our humanity brings to it , and he reveals to us in all its fullness the initiative of love and the plan_for true life_that God has prepared_for us . In Christ , charity in truth becomes_the Face of his Person , a vocation for us to love our_brothers_and_sisters in the truth of his plan . Indeed , he himself_-isaia- the Truth cf . Charity -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Church s social_doctrine . Every responsibility and every commitment spelt out by that doctrine -isaia- derived_from charity_which , according to the teaching of Jesus , -isaia- the synthesis of the entire Law cf . It gives real substance to the personal relationship_with God and with neighbour ; it -isaia- the principle not_only of micro relationships with friends , with family members or within small groups but_also of macro relationships social , economic and political ones . For the Church , instructed by the Gospel , charity_-isaia- everything because , as Saint John teaches cf . Jn : , and as I recalled in my first Encyclical Letter , '' God -isaia- love '' Deus Caritas Est : everything has its origin in God s love , everything -isaia- shaped by it , everything -isaia-_directed towards it . Love -isaia- God s greatest gift to humanity , it -isaia-_his promise and our_hope . I -amos- aware of the ways in which charity has_been and continues to be misconstrued and emptied of meaning , with the consequent risk of being misinterpreted , detached from ethical living and , in any event , undervalued . In the social , juridical , cultural , political and economic fields the contexts , in other_words , that are_most exposed to this danger it -isaia- easily dismissed as irrelevant for interpreting and giving direction to moral responsibility . Hence the need to link charity with truth not_only in the sequence , pointed_out by Saint Paul , of veritas in caritate Eph : , but_also in the inverse and complementary sequence of caritas in veritate . Truth needs to be sought , found and expressed within_the '' economy '' of charity , but charity in its turn needs to be understood , confirmed and practised in the light of truth . In this_way , not_only do we do a service to charity enlightened by truth , but we also help give credibility to truth , demonstrating its persuasive and authenticating power in the practical setting of social living . This -isaia-_a_matter of no small account today , in a social_and_cultural context which relativizes truth , often paying little heed to it and showing increasing reluctance to acknowledge its existence . Through this close link with truth , charity can be recognized as an authentic expression of humanity and as an element of fundamental importance in human relations , including those of a public nature . Only in truth does charity shine_forth , only in truth can charity be authentically lived . Truth -isaia- the light that gives meaning and value to charity . That light -isaia- both the light of reason and the light_of_faith , through_which the intellect attains to the natural and supernatural truth of charity : it grasps its meaning as gift , acceptance , and communion . Without truth , charity degenerates into sentimentality . Love becomes an empty shell , to be filled in an arbitrary way . In a culture without truth , this_-isaia- the fatal risk facing love . It falls prey to contingent subjective emotions and opinions , the word '' love '' -isaia- abused and distorted , to the point where it comes to mean the opposite . Truth frees charity from the constraints of an emotionalism that deprives it of relational and social content , and of a fideism that deprives it of human and universal breathing space . In the truth , charity reflects the personal yet public dimension of faith in the God of the Bible , who_-isaia- both Ag\u00e1pe and L\u00f3gos : Charity and Truth , Love and Word . Because it -isaia- filled_with truth , charity can be understood in the abundance of its values , it can be shared and communicated . Truth , in fact , -isaia- l\u00f3gos which creates di\u00e1 logos , and hence communication and communion . Truth , by enabling men_and_women to let go of their subjective opinions and impressions , allows them to move beyond cultural and historical limitations and to come together in the assessment of the value and substance of things . Truth opens and unites our minds in the l\u00f3gos of love : this_-isaia- the Christian proclamation and testimony of charity . In the present social_and_cultural context , where there_-isaia- a widespread tendency to relativize truth , practising charity in truth helps people to understand_that adhering to the values of Christianity -isaia- not merely useful but essential for building a good society and for true integral human_development . A Christianity of charity without truth would be more_or_less interchangeable with a pool of good sentiments , helpful for social cohesion , but of little relevance . In other_words , there_would no longer be any real place_for God in the world . Without truth , charity_-isaia- confined to a narrow field devoid of relations . It -isaia- excluded from the plans and processes of promoting human_development of universal range , in dialogue_between knowledge and praxis . Charity -isaia- love received and given . It -isaia- '' grace '' ch\u00e1ris . Its source -isaia- the wellspring of the Father s love for the Son , in the Holy Spirit . Love comes down to us from the Son . It -isaia- creative love , through_which we have our being ; it -isaia- redemptive love , through_which we are recreated . Love -isaia-_revealed and made present by Christ cf . Jn : and '' poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit '' Rom : . As the objects of God s love , men_and_women become subjects of charity , they_are_called to make themselves instruments of grace , so as to pour forth God s charity and to weave networks of charity . This dynamic of charity received and given -isaia- what gives_rise to the Church s social_teaching , which_-isaia- caritas in veritate in re sociali : the proclamation of the truth of Christ s love in society . This doctrine -isaia- a service to charity , but its locus -isaia- truth . Truth preserves and expresses charity s power to liberate in the ever changing events of history . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the truth of faith and of reason , both in the distinction and also in the convergence of those two cognitive fields . Development , social well_being , the search_for a satisfactory solution to the grave socio economic problems besetting humanity , all need this_truth . What they_need even_more -isaia- that this_truth should be loved and demonstrated . Without truth , without trust and love for what_-isaia- true , there_-isaia- no social conscience and responsibility , and social action ends up serving private interests and the logic of power , resulting in social fragmentation , especially in a globalized society -atti_degli_apostoli- difficult times like the present . '' Caritas in veritate '' -isaia- the principle around which_the Church s social_doctrine turns , a principle that takes on practical form in the criteria that govern moral action . I would_like to consider two of these in particular , of special relevance to the commitment to development in an increasingly globalized society : justice and the common_good . First of all , justice . Ubi societas , ibi ius : every society draws up its_own system of justice . Charity goes beyond justice , because to love_-isaia- to give , to offer what_-isaia- '' mine '' to the other ; but it never lacks justice , which prompts us to give the other what_-isaia- '' his '' , what_-isaia- due to him by reason of his being or his acting . I cannot '' give '' what_-isaia- mine to the other , without first giving him what pertains to him in justice . If we love others with charity , then first of all we are just towards them . Not only -isaia- justice not extraneous to charity , not_only -isaia- it not an alternative or parallel path to charity : justice -isaia- inseparable from charity , and intrinsic to it . Justice -isaia- the primary way of charity or , in Paul VI s words , '' the minimum measure '' of it , an integral part of the love '' in deed and in truth '' Jn : , to which Saint John exhorts us . On the one_hand , charity demands justice : recognition and respect_for the legitimate rights of individuals and peoples . It strives to build the earthly city according to law and justice . On the other_hand , charity transcends justice and completes it in the logic of giving and forgiving . The earthly city -isaia- promoted not merely by relationships of rights_and_duties , but to an even greater and more fundamental extent by relationships of gratuitousness , mercy and communion . Charity always manifests God s love in human relationships as well , it gives theological and salvific value to all commitment for_justice in the world . Another important consideration -isaia- the common_good . To love someone -isaia- to desire_that person s good and to take effective steps to secure it . Besides the good of the individual , there_-isaia- a good that_-isaia- linked to living in society : the common_good . It -isaia- the good of '' all of us '' , made up of individuals , families and intermediate groups who together constitute society . It -isaia- a good that_-isaia- sought not_for its_own sake , but_for the people_who belong to the social community and who can_only really and effectively pursue their good within it . To desire the common_good and strive towards it -isaia- a requirement of justice and charity . To take a stand for the common_good -isaia- on the one_hand to be solicitous for , and on the other_hand to avail oneself of , that complex of institutions that give structure to the life of society , juridically , civilly , politically and culturally , making it the p\u00f3lis , or '' city '' . The more we strive to secure a common_good corresponding to the real needs of our neighbours , the more_effectively we love them . Every Christian -isaia- called to practise this charity , in a manner corresponding to his vocation and according to the degree of influence he wields in the p\u00f3lis . This -isaia- the institutional path we might also call it the political path of charity , no less excellent and effective than the kind of charity_which encounters the neighbour directly , outside the institutional mediation of the p\u00f3lis . When animated by charity , commitment to the common_good has greater worth than a merely secular and political stand would_have . Like all commitment to justice , it has a place within_the testimony of divine charity that paves the way_for eternity through temporal action . Man s earthly activity , when inspired and sustained by charity , contributes to the building of the universal city of God , which_-isaia- the goal of the history of the human_family . In an increasingly globalized society , the common_good and the effort to obtain it cannot_fail to assume the dimensions of the whole human_family , that_-isaia- to say , the community of peoples and nations , in such_a_way as to shape the earthly city in unity and peace , rendering it to some degree an anticipation and a prefiguration of the undivided city of God . In , when he issued the Encyclical Populorum Progressio , my venerable predecessor Pope Paul VI illuminated the great theme of the development of peoples with the splendour of truth and the gentle light of Christ s charity . He taught that life in Christ -isaia-_the_first and principal factor of development and he entrusted us with the task of travelling the path of development with_all_our heart and all our intelligence , that_-isaia- to say with the ardour of charity and the wisdom of truth . It -isaia- the primordial truth of God s love , grace bestowed upon us , that opens our_lives to gift and makes it possible to hope_for a '' development of the whole man and of all men '' , to hope_for progress '' from less human conditions to those_which are more_human '' , obtained by overcoming the difficulties that_are inevitably encountered along the way . At a distance of over forty years from the Encyclical s publication , I intend to pay tribute and to honour the memory of the great Pope Paul VI , revisiting his teachings on integral human_development and taking my place within_the path that_they marked out , so as to apply them to the present moment . This continual application to contemporary circumstances began with the Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , with_which_the Servant of God Pope John Paul II chose to mark the twentieth anniversary of the publication of Populorum Progressio . Until that_time , only Rerum Novarum had_been commemorated in this_way . Now that a further twenty years have passed , I express my conviction_that Populorum Progressio deserves to be considered '' the Rerum Novarum of the present age '' , shedding light upon humanity s journey towards unity . Love in truth caritas in veritate -isaia- a great challenge for the Church in a world that_-isaia- becoming progressively and pervasively globalized . The risk for our_time -isaia- that the de facto interdependence of people and nations -isaia- not matched by ethical interaction of consciences and minds that_would give rise to truly human_development . Only in charity , illumined by the light of reason and faith , -isaia- it possible to pursue development goals that possess a more humane and humanizing value . The sharing of goods and resources , from which authentic development proceeds , -isaia- not guaranteed by merely technical progress and relationships of utility , but by the potential of love_that overcomes evil with_good cf . Rom : , opening up the path towards reciprocity of consciences and liberties . The Church does_not have technical solutions to offer and does_not claim '' to interfere in any_way in the politics of States . '' She does , however , have a mission of truth to accomplish , in every time and circumstance , for a society that_-isaia- attuned to man , to his dignity , to his vocation . Without truth , it -isaia- easy to fall_into an empiricist and sceptical view of life , incapable of rising to the level of praxis because of a lack of interest in grasping the values sometimes even the meanings with_which to judge and direct it . Fidelity to man requires fidelity to the truth , which alone_-isaia- the guarantee of freedom cf . Jn : and of the possibility of integral human_development . For this_reason_the Church searches for truth , proclaims it tirelessly and recognizes it wherever it -isaia- manifested . This mission of truth_-isaia- something_that the Church can_never renounce . Her social_doctrine -isaia- a particular dimension of this proclamation : it -isaia- a service to the truth_which sets us free . Open to the truth , from whichever branch of knowledge it comes , the Church s social_doctrine receives it , assembles into a unity the fragments in which_it_-isaia- often found , and mediates it within_the constantly changing life patterns of the society of peoples and nations . CHAPTER ONE THE MESSAGEOF POPULORUM PROGRESSIO . A fresh reading of Populorum Progressio , more_than forty years after its publication , invites us to remain faithful to its message of charity and truth , viewed within_the overall context of Paul VI s specific magisterium and , more generally , within_the tradition of the Church s social_doctrine . Moreover , an evaluation -isaia- needed of the different terms in which_the problem of development -isaia- presented today , as compared with forty years_ago . The correct viewpoint , then , -isaia- that of the Tradition of the apostolic faith , a patrimony both ancient and new , outside of which Populorum Progressio would be a document without roots and issues concerning development would be reduced to merely sociological data . The publication of Populorum Progressio occurred immediately after_the conclusion of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , and in its opening paragraphs it clearly indicates its close connection_with the Council . Twenty years later , in Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , John Paul II , in his turn , emphasized the earlier Encyclical s fruitful relationship_with the Council , and especially with the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes . I too wish to recall here_the importance of the Second Vatican Council for Paul VI s Encyclical and for the whole of the subsequent social Magisterium of the Popes . The Council probed more_deeply what had always belonged to the truth of the faith , namely that the Church , being -atti_degli_apostoli- God s service , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the world in terms of love and truth . Paul VI set_out from this vision in order to convey two important truths . The first -isaia- that_the_whole Church , in all her being and acting when_she proclaims , when_she celebrates , when_she performs works of charity_-isaia- engaged in promoting integral human_development . She has a public role over and above her charitable and educational activities : all the energy she brings to the advancement of humanity and of universal fraternity -isaia- manifested when she_-isaia- able to operate in a climate of freedom . In not_a_few cases , that freedom_-isaia- impeded by prohibitions and persecutions , or it -isaia- limited when_the Church s public presence -isaia- reduced to her charitable activities alone . The second truth_-isaia- that authentic human_development concerns the whole of the person in every single dimension . Without the perspective of eternal_life , human progress in this world_-isaia- denied breathing space . Enclosed within history , it runs the risk of being reduced to the mere accumulation of wealth ; humanity thus loses the courage to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of higher goods , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the great and disinterested initiatives called forth by universal charity . Man does_not develop through_his own powers , nor_can development simply be handed to him . In the course of history , it was often maintained that the creation of institutions was sufficient to guarantee the fulfilment of humanity s right to development . Unfortunately , too much confidence was placed in those institutions , as if they_were able to deliver the desired objective automatically . In reality , institutions by themselves are not_enough , because integral human_development -isaia- primarily a vocation , and therefore it involves a free assumption of responsibility in solidarity on the part of everyone . Moreover , such development requires a transcendent vision of the person , it needs God : without him , development -isaia- either denied , or entrusted exclusively to man_,_who falls into the trap of thinking he can bring_about his_own salvation , and ends up promoting a dehumanized form of development . Only through an encounter_with God are we able to see in the other something more_than just another creature , to recognize_the divine image in the other , thus truly coming to discover him or her and to mature in a love_that '' becomes concern and care_for the other . The link between Populorum Progressio and the Second Vatican Council does_not_mean that Paul VI s social magisterium marked a break with_that of previous Popes , because the Council constitutes a deeper exploration of this magisterium within_the continuity of the Church s life . In this_sense , clarity -isaia- not served by certain abstract subdivisions of the Church s social_doctrine , which apply categories to Papal social_teaching that_are extraneous to it . It -isaia- not a case of two typologies of social_doctrine , one pre conciliar and one post conciliar , differing from one_another : on the contrary , there_-isaia- a single teaching , consistent and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time ever_new . It -isaia- one_thing to draw attention to the particular characteristics of one Encyclical or another , of the teaching of one Pope or another , but quite another to lose sight of the coherence of the overall doctrinal corpus . Coherence does_not_mean a closed system : on the contrary , it means dynamic faithfulness to a light received . The Church s social_doctrine illuminates with an unchanging light the new problems that_are constantly emerging . This safeguards the permanent and historical character of the doctrinal '' patrimony '' which , with its specific characteristics , -isaia-_part and parcel of the Church s ever living Tradition . Social doctrine -isaia- built on the foundation handed on by the Apostles to the Fathers of the Church , and then received and further explored by the great Christian doctors . This doctrine points definitively to the New Man , to the '' last Adam who became a life_giving spirit '' Cor : , the principle of the charity that '' never ends '' Cor : . It -isaia- attested by the saints and by those_who gave their_lives for Christ our Saviour in the field of justice_and_peace . It -isaia- an expression of the prophetic task of the Supreme Pontiffs to give apostolic guidance to the Church of Christ and to discern the new demands of evangelization . For these reasons , Populorum Progressio , situated within_the great current of Tradition , can still speak to us today . In addition to its important link with the entirety of the Church s social_doctrine , Populorum Progressio -isaia- closely connected to the overall magisterium of Paul VI , especially his social magisterium . His was certainly a social_teaching of great_importance : he underlined the indispensable importance of the Gospel for building a society according to freedom and justice , in the ideal and historical perspective of a civilization animated by love . Paul VI clearly understood that the social_question had become worldwide and he grasped the interconnection between_the impetus towards_the unification of humanity and the Christian ideal of a single family of peoples in solidarity and fraternity . In the notion of development , understood in human and Christian terms , he identified the heart of the Christian social message , and he proposed Christian charity as the principal force -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of development . Motivated by the wish to make Christ s love fully visible to contemporary men_and_women , Paul VI addressed important ethical questions robustly , without yielding to the cultural weaknesses of his time . In his Apostolic Letter Octogesima Adveniens of , Paul VI reflected on the meaning of politics , and the danger constituted by utopian and ideological visions that place its ethical and human dimensions in jeopardy . These are matters closely connected_with development . Unfortunately the negative ideologies continue to flourish . Paul VI had_already warned against the technocratic ideology so prevalent today , fully aware of the great danger of entrusting the entire process of development to technology alone , because in that way it would lack direction . Technology , viewed in itself , -isaia- ambivalent . If on the one_hand , some today would be inclined to entrust the entire process of development to technology , on the other_hand we are witnessing an upsurge of ideologies that deny in toto the very value of development , viewing it as radically anti human and merely a source of degradation . This leads to a rejection , not_only of the distorted and unjust way_in_which progress -isaia- sometimes directed , but_also of scientific discoveries themselves , which , if well used , could serve as an opportunity of growth for all . The idea of a world without development indicates a lack of trust in man and in God . It -isaia- therefore a serious mistake to undervalue human capacity to exercise control over the deviations of development or to overlook the fact_that man_-isaia- constitutionally oriented towards '' being more '' . Idealizing technical progress , or contemplating the utopia of a return to humanity s original natural state , are two contrasting ways of detaching progress from its moral evaluation and hence from our responsibility . Two further documents by Paul VI without_any direct link to social_doctrine the Encyclical Humanae Vitae July and the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi December are highly important_for delineating the fully human meaning of the development that the Church proposes . It -isaia- therefore helpful to consider these texts too in relation to Populorum Progressio . The Encyclical Humanae Vitae emphasizes both the unitive and the procreative meaning of sexuality , thereby locating -atti_degli_apostoli- the foundation of society the married couple , man_and_woman , who accept one_another mutually , in distinction and in complementarity : a couple , therefore_,_that -isaia- open to life . This -isaia- not a question of purely individual morality : Humanae Vitae indicates the strong links between life ethics and social ethics , ushering in a new area of magisterial teaching that_has gradually been articulated in a series of documents , most recently John Paul II s Encyclical Evangelium Vitae . The Church forcefully maintains this link between life ethics and social ethics , fully aware_that '' a society lacks solid foundations when , on the one_hand , it asserts values such as the dignity of the person , justice_and_peace , but then , on the other_hand , radically acts to the contrary by allowing or tolerating a variety of ways in which human life_-isaia- devalued and violated , especially where it -isaia- weak or marginalized . '' The Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , for its part , -isaia-_very closely linked_with development , given that , in Paul VI s words , '' evangelization would_not be complete if it did_not take account of the unceasing interplay of the Gospel and of man s concrete life , both personal and social . '' '' Between evangelization and human advancement development and liberation there_are in fact profound links '' : on the basis of this insight , Paul VI clearly presented the relationship_between_the proclamation of Christ and the advancement of the individual in society . Testimony to Christ s charity , through works of justice , peace and development , -isaia-_part and parcel of evangelization , because Jesus Christ , who loves us , -isaia- concerned_with the whole person . These important teachings form the basis for the missionary aspect of the Church s social_doctrine , which_-isaia- an essential element of evangelization . The Church s social_doctrine proclaims and bears_witness to faith . It -isaia- an instrument and an indispensable setting for formation in faith . In Populorum Progressio , Paul VI taught that progress , in its origin and essence , -isaia- first_and_foremost a vocation : '' in the design of God , every man_-isaia- called_upon to develop and fulfil himself , for_every life_-isaia- a vocation . '' This -isaia- what gives legitimacy to the Church s involvement in the whole question of development . If development were concerned_with merely technical aspects of human_life , and not_with the meaning of man s pilgrimage through history in company with_his fellow human_beings , nor with identifying the goal of that journey , then the Church would_not be entitled to speak on it . Paul VI , like Leo XIII before him in Rerum Novarum , knew that he was carrying_out a duty proper to his office by shedding the light of the Gospel on the social questions of his time . To regard development as a vocation -isaia- to recognize , on the one_hand , that it derives from a transcendent call , and on the other_hand that_it_-isaia- incapable , on its_own , of supplying its ultimate meaning . Not without reason_the word '' vocation '' -isaia-_also found in another passage of the Encyclical , where we read : '' There -isaia- no true humanism but that_which_-isaia- open to the Absolute , and -isaia- conscious of a vocation which_gives human_life its true meaning . '' This vision of development -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of Populorum Progressio , and it lies behind all Paul VI s reflections on freedom , on truth and on charity in development . It -isaia-_also the principal reason_why that Encyclical -isaia- still timely in our_day . A vocation -isaia- a call that requires a free and responsible answer . Integral human_development presupposes the responsible freedom of the individual and of peoples : no structure can guarantee this development over and above human responsibility . The '' types of messianism which give promises but create illusions '' always build their case on a denial of the transcendent dimension of development , in the conviction_that it lies entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal . This false security becomes a weakness , because it involves reducing man to subservience , to a mere means_for development , while the humility of those_who accept a vocation -isaia- transformed into true autonomy , because it sets them free . Paul VI was in no doubt_that obstacles and forms of conditioning hold up development , but he was_also certain_that '' each_one remains , whatever be these influences affecting him , the principal agent of his_own success or failure . '' This freedom concerns the type of development we are considering , but it also affects situations of underdevelopment which_are not due to chance or historical necessity , but are attributable to human responsibility . This -isaia- why '' the peoples in hunger are making a dramatic appeal to the peoples blessed with abundance '' . This too -isaia- a vocation , a call addressed by free subjects to other free subjects in favour of an assumption of shared responsibility . Paul VI had a keen sense of the importance of economic structures and institutions , but he had an equally clear sense of their nature as instruments of human_freedom . Only when_it_-isaia- free can development be integrally human ; only in a climate of responsible freedom can it grow in a satisfactory manner . Besides requiring freedom , integral human_development as a vocation also demands respect_for its truth . The vocation to progress drives us to '' do more , know more and have more in order to be more '' . But herein lies the problem : what does it mean '' to be more '' ? Paul VI answers the question by indicating the essential quality of '' authentic '' development : it must be '' integral , that_-isaia- , it has to promote the good of every man and of the whole man '' . Amid the various competing anthropological visions put forward in today s society , even_more so than in Paul VI s time , the Christian vision has the particular characteristic of asserting and justifying the unconditional value of the human_person and the meaning of his growth . The Christian vocation to development helps to promote the advancement of all men and of the whole man . As Paul VI wrote : '' What we hold important -isaia-_man , each man and each group of men , and we even include the whole of humanity '' . In promoting development , the Christian faith does_not rely on privilege or positions of power , nor even on the merits of Christians even_though these existed and continue to exist alongside their natural limitations , but_only on Christ , to whom every authentic vocation to integral human_development must be directed . The Gospel -isaia- fundamental for development , because in the Gospel , Christ , '' in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father and of his_love , fully reveals humanity to itself '' . Taught by her Lord , the Church examines the signs of the times and interprets them , offering the world '' what she possesses as her characteristic attribute : a global vision of man and of the human_race '' . Precisely because God gives a resounding '' yes '' to man , man cannot_fail to open himself to the divine vocation to pursue his_own development . The truth of development consists in its completeness : if it does_not involve the whole man and every man , it -isaia- not true development . This -isaia- the central message of Populorum Progressio , valid for today and for all time . Integral human_development on the natural plane , as a response to a vocation from God the Creator , demands self fulfilment in a '' transcendent humanism which_gives to man his greatest possible perfection : this_-isaia- the highest goal of personal development '' . The Christian vocation to this development therefore applies to both the natural plane and the supernatural plane ; which_-isaia- why , '' when God -isaia- eclipsed , our ability to recognize_the natural order , purpose and the good begins to wane '' . Finally , the vision of development as a vocation brings with it the central place of charity within that development . Paul VI , in his Encyclical Letter Populorum Progressio , pointed_out that the causes of underdevelopment are_not primarily of the material order . He invited us to search_for them in other dimensions of the human_person : first of all , in the will , which often neglects the duties of solidarity ; secondly in thinking , which_does_not always give proper direction to the will . Hence , in the pursuit of development , there_-isaia-_a_need for '' the deep thought and reflection of wise men in search of a new humanism which will_enable modern man to find himself anew '' . But that_-isaia-_not all . Underdevelopment has an even more_important cause than lack of deep thought : it -isaia- '' the lack of brotherhood among individuals and peoples '' . Will it ever be possible to obtain this brotherhood by human effort alone ? As society becomes ever_more globalized , it makes us neighbours but does_not make us brothers . Reason , by itself , -isaia- capable of grasping the equality between men and of giving stability to their civic coexistence , but it cannot establish fraternity . This originates in a transcendent vocation from God the Father , who loved us first , teaching us through the Son what fraternal charity_-isaia- . Paul VI , presenting the various levels in the process of human_development , placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the summit , after mentioning faith , '' unity in the charity of Christ who calls us all to share as sons in the life of the living God , the Father of all '' . These perspectives , which Populorum Progressio opens up , remain fundamental for giving breathing space and direction to our commitment for the development of peoples . Moreover , Populorum Progressio repeatedly underlines the urgent_need for reform , and in the face of great problems of injustice in the development of peoples , it calls for courageous action to be taken without delay . This urgency -isaia-_also a consequence of charity in truth . It -isaia- Christ s charity that drives us on : '' caritas Christi urget nos '' Cor : . The urgency -isaia- inscribed not_only in things , it -isaia- not derived solely from the rapid succession of events and problems , but_also from the very matter that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake : the establishment of authentic fraternity . The importance of this goal -isaia- such as to demand our openness to understand it in depth and to mobilize ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the '' heart '' , so as to ensure_that current economic_and_social processes evolve towards fully human outcomes . CHAPTER TWO HUMAN DEVELOPMENTIN OUR TIME . Paul VI had an articulated vision of development . He understood the term to indicate the goal of rescuing peoples , first_and_foremost , from hunger , deprivation , endemic diseases and illiteracy . From the economic point_of_view , this meant their active participation , on equal terms , in the international economic process ; from the social point_of_view , it meant their evolution into educated societies marked by solidarity ; from the political point_of_view , it meant the consolidation of democratic regimes capable of ensuring freedom and peace . After so many years , as we observe with concern the developments and perspectives of the succession of crises that afflict the world today , we ask to what extent Paul VI s expectations have_been fulfilled by the model of development adopted in recent decades . We recognize , therefore_,_that the Church had good_reason to be concerned about the capacity of a purely technological society to set realistic goals and to make good use of the instruments -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal . Profit -isaia- useful if it serves as a means towards an end that provides a sense both of how to produce it and how to make good use of it . Once profit becomes_the exclusive goal , if it -isaia- produced by improper means and without_the common_good as its ultimate end , it risks destroying wealth and creating poverty . The economic development that Paul VI hoped to see was meant to produce real growth , of benefit to everyone and genuinely sustainable . It -isaia- true_that growth has taken_place , and it continues to be a positive factor that_has lifted billions of people out of misery recently it has_given many countries the possibility of becoming effective players in international politics . Yet it must be acknowledged that_this same economic growth has_been and continues to be weighed down by malfunctions and dramatic problems , highlighted even further by the current crisis . This presents us with choices that cannot be postponed concerning nothing less_than the destiny of man_,_who , moreover , cannot prescind from his nature . The technical forces in play , the global interrelations , the damaging effects on the real economy of badly managed and largely speculative financial dealing , large scale migration of peoples , often provoked by some particular circumstance and then given insufficient attention , the unregulated exploitation of the earth s resources : all this leads us today to reflect on the measures that_would be necessary to provide a solution to problems that_are not_only new in comparison to those addressed by Pope Paul VI , but_also , and above all , of decisive impact upon the present and future good of humanity . The different aspects of the crisis , its solutions , and any new development that the future may bring , are increasingly interconnected , they imply one_another , they require new efforts of holistic understanding and a new humanistic synthesis . The complexity and gravity of the present economic situation rightly cause us concern , but we must adopt a realistic attitude as we take up with confidence and hope the new responsibilities to which_we_are called by the prospect of a world in need of profound cultural renewal , a world_that needs to rediscover fundamental values on which to build a better future . The current crisis obliges us to re plan our journey , to set ourselves new rules and to discover new_forms of commitment , to build on positive experiences and to reject negative ones . The crisis thus becomes an opportunity_for discernment , in which to shape a new vision for the future . In this_spirit , with confidence rather_than resignation , it -isaia- appropriate to address the difficulties of the present_time . Today the picture of development has many overlapping layers . The actors and the causes in both underdevelopment and development are manifold , the faults and the merits are differentiated . This fact should prompt us to liberate ourselves from ideologies , which often oversimplify reality in artificial ways , and it should lead us to examine objectively the full human dimension of the problems . As John Paul II has_already observed , the demarcation line between rich and poor countries -isaia-_no_longer as clear as it was -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Populorum Progressio . The world s wealth -isaia- growing in absolute terms , but inequalities are on the increase . In rich countries , new sectors of society are succumbing to poverty and new_forms of poverty are emerging . In poorer areas some groups enjoy a sort of '' superdevelopment '' of a wasteful and consumerist kind which forms an unacceptable contrast with the ongoing situations of dehumanizing deprivation . '' The scandal of glaring inequalities '' continues . Corruption and illegality are unfortunately evident in the conduct of the economic and political class in rich countries , both old_and_new , as well as in poor ones . Among those_who sometimes fail to respect the human_rights of workers are large multinational companies as well as local producers . International aid has often been diverted from its_proper ends , through irresponsible actions both within_the chain of donors and within that of the beneficiaries . Similarly , in the context of immaterial or cultural causes of development and underdevelopment , we find these same patterns of responsibility reproduced . On the part of rich countries there_-isaia- excessive zeal for protecting knowledge through an unduly rigid assertion of the right to intellectual property , especially in the field of health_care . At the same_time , in some poor countries , cultural models and social norms of behaviour persist which hinder the process of development . Many areas of the globe today have evolved considerably , albeit in problematical and disparate ways , thereby taking their place among the great powers destined to play important roles in the future . Yet it should be stressed that progress of a merely economic and technological kind -isaia- insufficient . Development needs above all to be true and integral . The mere fact of emerging from economic backwardness , though positive in itself , does_not resolve the complex issues of human advancement , neither for the countries that_are spearheading such progress , nor for those_that are_already economically developed , nor even_for those_that are_still poor , which_can suffer not_just through old forms of exploitation , but_also from the negative consequences of a growth that_-isaia- marked by irregularities and imbalances . After the collapse of the economic and political systems of the Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the end of the so called opposing blocs , a complete re examination of development was needed . Pope John Paul II called_for it , when in he pointed to the existence of these blocs as one of the principal causes of underdevelopment , inasmuch as politics withdrew resources from the economy and from the culture , and ideology inhibited freedom . Moreover , in , after_the events of , he asked that , in view of the ending of the blocs , there_should be a comprehensive new plan_for development , not_only in those countries , but_also in the West and in those parts_of_the_world that were in the process of evolving . This has_been achieved only in part , and it -isaia- still a real duty that needs to be discharged , perhaps by means of the choices that_are necessary to overcome current economic problems . The world_that Paul VI had before him even_though society had_already evolved to such an extent_that he could speak of social issues in global terms was still far less integrated than today_s_world . Economic activity and the political process were both largely conducted within_the same geographical area , and could therefore feed off one_another . Production took_place predominantly within national boundaries , and financial investments had somewhat limited circulation outside the country , so that the politics of many States could still determine the priorities of the economy and to some degree govern its performance using the instruments -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal . Hence Populorum Progressio assigned a central , albeit not exclusive , role to '' public_authorities '' . In our_own day , the State finds itself having to address the limitations to its sovereignty imposed by the new context of international trade and finance , which_-isaia- characterized by increasing mobility both of financial capital and means_of_production , material and immaterial . This new context has altered the political power of States . Today , as we take to heart_the lessons of the current economic crisis , which sees the State s public_authorities directly involved in correcting errors and malfunctions , it seems more realistic to re evaluate their role and their powers , which need to be prudently reviewed and remodelled so as to enable them , perhaps through new_forms of engagement , to address the challenges of today_s_world . Once the role of public_authorities has_been more_clearly defined , one could foresee an increase in the new_forms of political participation , nationally and internationally , that_have come about through the activity of organizations operating in civil_society ; in this_way it -isaia- to be hoped that the citizens interest and participation in the res publica will_become more_deeply rooted . From the social point_of_view , systems of protection and welfare , already present in many countries in Paul VI s day , are finding it hard and could find it even harder in the future to pursue their goals of true social_justice in today s profoundly changed environment . The global market has stimulated first_and_foremost , on the part of rich countries , a search_for areas in which to outsource production -atti_degli_apostoli- low cost with_a_view to reducing the prices of many goods , increasing purchasing power and thus accelerating the rate of development in terms of greater availability of consumer goods for the domestic market . Consequently , the market has prompted new_forms of competition between States as they seek to attract foreign businesses to set up production centres , by means of a variety of instruments , including favourable fiscal regimes and deregulation of the labour market . These processes have led to a downsizing of social security systems as the price to be paid for seeking greater competitive advantage in the global market , with consequent grave danger for the rights of workers , for fundamental human_rights and for the solidarity associated_with the traditional forms of the social State . Systems of social security can lose the capacity to carry_out_their task , both in emerging countries and in those_that were among the earliest to develop , as well as in poor countries . Here budgetary policies , with cuts in social spending often made under pressure from international financial institutions , can leave citizens powerless in the face of old_and_new risks ; such powerlessness -isaia- increased by the lack of effective protection on the part of workers associations . Through the combination of social_and_economic change , trade union organizations experience greater difficulty in carrying_out their task of representing the interests of workers , partly because Governments , for reasons of economic utility , often limit the freedom or the negotiating capacity of labour unions . Hence traditional networks of solidarity have more_and_more obstacles to overcome . The repeated calls issued within_the Church s social_doctrine , beginning with Rerum Novarum , for the promotion of workers associations that_can defend their_rights must_therefore be honoured today even_more than in the past , as a prompt and far sighted response to the urgent_need for new_forms of cooperation -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level , as well as the local level . The mobility of labour , associated_with a climate of deregulation , -isaia- an important phenomenon with certain positive aspects , because it can stimulate wealth production and cultural exchange . Nevertheless , uncertainty over working conditions caused by mobility and deregulation , when it becomes endemic , tends to create new_forms of psychological instability , giving rise to difficulty in forging coherent life plans , including that of marriage . This leads to situations of human decline , to say nothing of the waste of social resources . In comparison with the casualties of industrial society in the past , unemployment today provokes new_forms of economic marginalization , and the current crisis can_only make_this situation worse . Being out of work or dependent on public or private assistance for a prolonged period undermines the freedom and creativity of the person and his family and social relationships , causing great psychological and spiritual suffering . I would_like to remind everyone , especially governments engaged in boosting the world s economic_and_social assets , that the primary capital to be safeguarded and valued -isaia-_man , the human_person in his or her integrity : '' Man -isaia-_the_source , the focus and the aim of all economic_and_social life '' . On the cultural plane , compared with Paul VI s day , the difference -isaia- even_more marked . At that_time cultures were relatively well defined and had greater opportunity to defend themselves against attempts to merge them_into one . Today the possibilities of interaction between cultures have increased significantly , giving rise to new openings for intercultural dialogue : a dialogue that , if it -isaia- to be effective , has to set_out from a deep seated knowledge of the specific identity of the various dialogue partners . Let it not be forgotten that the increased commercialization of cultural exchange today leads to a twofold danger . First , one may observe a cultural eclecticism that -isaia-_often assumed uncritically : cultures are simply placed alongside one_another and viewed as substantially equivalent and interchangeable . This easily yields to a relativism that does_not serve true intercultural dialogue ; on the social plane , cultural relativism has the effect that cultural groups coexist side by side , but remain separate , with no authentic dialogue and therefore with no true integration . Secondly , the opposite danger exists , that of cultural levelling and indiscriminate acceptance of types of conduct and life styles . In this_way one loses sight of the profound significance of the culture of different nations , of the traditions of the various peoples , by which_the individual defines himself in relation to life s fundamental questions . What eclecticism and cultural levelling have in common -isaia- the separation of culture from human_nature . Thus , cultures can no longer define themselves within a nature that transcends them , and man ends up being reduced to a mere cultural statistic . When this happens , humanity runs new risks of enslavement and manipulation . Life in many poor countries -isaia- still extremely insecure as a consequence of food shortages , and the situation could become worse : hunger still reaps enormous numbers of victims among_those who , like Lazarus , are_not permitted to take their place -atti_degli_apostoli- the rich man s table , contrary to the hopes expressed by Paul VI . Feed the hungry cf . Mt : , , -isaia- an ethical imperative for the universal Church , as she responds to the teachings of her Founder , the Lord Jesus , concerning solidarity and the sharing of goods . Moreover , the elimination of world hunger has_also , in the global era , become a requirement for safeguarding the peace and stability of the planet . Hunger -isaia- not_so_much dependent on lack of material things as on shortage of social resources , the most important of which_are institutional . What -isaia- missing , in other_words , -isaia- a network of economic institutions capable of guaranteeing regular access to sufficient food and water for nutritional needs , and also capable of addressing the primary needs and necessities ensuing from genuine food crises , whether due to natural causes or political irresponsibility , nationally and internationally . The problem of food insecurity needs to be addressed within a long term perspective , eliminating the structural causes that give rise to it and promoting the agricultural development of poorer countries . This can be done by investing in rural infrastructures , irrigation systems , transport , organization of markets , and in the development and dissemination of agricultural technology that can_make the best use of the human , natural and socio economic resources that are_more readily available -atti_degli_apostoli- the local level , while guaranteeing their sustainability over the long term as well . All this needs to be accomplished with the involvement of local communities in choices and decisions that affect the use of agricultural land . In this perspective , it could be useful to consider_the new possibilities that_are opening up through proper use of traditional as well as innovative farming techniques , always assuming that_these have_been judged , after sufficient testing , to be appropriate , respectful of the environment and attentive to the needs of the most deprived peoples . At the same_time , the question of equitable agrarian reform in developing countries should_not be ignored . The right to food , like the right to water , has an important place within_the pursuit of other rights , beginning with the fundamental right to life . It -isaia- therefore necessary to cultivate a public conscience that considers food and access to water as universal rights of all human_beings , without distinction or discrimination . It -isaia- important , moreover , to emphasize that solidarity with poor countries in the process of development can point towards a solution of the current global crisis , as politicians and directors of international institutions have begun to sense in recent_times . Through support for economically poor countries by means of financial plans inspired by solidarity so that_these countries can take steps to satisfy their_own citizens demand for consumer goods and for development not_only can true economic growth be generated , but a contribution can be made towards sustaining the productive capacities of rich countries that risk being compromised by the crisis . One of the most striking aspects of development in the present_day -isaia- the important question of respect_for life_,_which cannot in any_way be detached from questions concerning the development of peoples . It -isaia- an aspect which_has acquired increasing prominence in recent_times , obliging us to broaden our concept of poverty and underdevelopment to include questions connected_with_the acceptance of life , especially in cases where it -isaia- impeded in a variety of ways . Not only does the situation of poverty still provoke high rates of infant mortality in many regions , but some parts_of_the_world still experience practices of demographic control , on the part of governments that often promote contraception and even go so far as to impose abortion . In economically developed countries , legislation contrary to life -isaia-_very widespread , and it has_already shaped moral attitudes and praxis , contributing to the spread of an anti birth mentality ; frequent attempts are made to export this mentality to other States as if it were a form of cultural progress . Some non governmental Organizations work actively to spread abortion , -atti_degli_apostoli- times promoting the practice of sterilization in poor countries , in some cases not_even informing the women concerned . Moreover , there_-isaia- reason to suspect that development aid -isaia- sometimes linked to specific health_care policies which de facto involve the imposition of strong birth control measures . Further grounds for concern are laws permitting euthanasia as well as pressure from lobby groups , nationally and internationally , in favour of its juridical recognition . Openness to life_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of true development . When a society moves towards_the denial or suppression of life , it ends up no longer finding the necessary motivation and energy to strive for_man s true good . If personal and social sensitivity towards_the acceptance of a new life_-isaia- lost , then other_forms of acceptance that_are valuable for society also wither away . The acceptance of life strengthens moral fibre and makes people capable of mutual help . By cultivating openness to life , wealthy peoples can better understand_the needs of poor ones , they_can avoid employing huge economic and intellectual resources to satisfy the selfish desires of their_own citizens , and instead , they_can promote virtuous action within_the perspective of production that_-isaia- morally sound and marked by solidarity , respecting the fundamental right to life of every people and every_individual . There -isaia- another aspect of modern life_that -isaia-_very closely connected to development : the denial of the right to religious_freedom . I -amos- not referring simply to the struggles and conflicts that continue to be fought in the world for religious motives , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- times the religious motive -isaia- merely a cover for other reasons , such as the desire_for domination and wealth . Today , in fact , people frequently kill in the holy name of God , as both my predecessor John Paul II and I myself have often publicly acknowledged and lamented . Violence puts the brakes on authentic development and impedes the evolution of peoples towards greater socio economic and spiritual well_being . This applies especially to terrorism motivated by fundamentalism , which generates grief , destruction and death , obstructs dialogue_between nations and diverts extensive resources from their peaceful and civil uses . Yet it should be added that , as well as religious fanaticism that in some contexts impedes the exercise of the right to religious_freedom , so too the deliberate promotion of religious indifference or practical atheism on the part of many countries obstructs the requirements for the development of peoples , depriving them of spiritual and human resources . God -isaia- the guarantor of man s true development , inasmuch as , having created him in his image , he also establishes the transcendent dignity of men_and_women and feeds their innate yearning to '' be more '' . Man -isaia- not a lost atom in a random universe : he -isaia- God s creature , whom God chose to endow with an immortal soul and whom he has_always loved . If man were merely the fruit of either chance or necessity , or if he had to lower his aspirations to the limited horizon of the world in which he lives , if all reality were merely history and culture , and man did_not possess a nature destined to transcend itself in a supernatural life , then one could speak of growth , or evolution , but_not development . When the State promotes , teaches , or actually imposes forms of practical atheism , it deprives its citizens of the moral and spiritual strength that_-isaia- indispensable for attaining integral human_development and it impedes them_from moving forward with renewed dynamism as they strive to offer a more generous human response to divine_love . In the context of cultural , commercial or political relations , it also sometimes happens_that economically developed or emerging countries export this reductive vision of the person and his destiny to poor countries . This -isaia- the damage that '' superdevelopment '' causes to authentic development when_it_-isaia- accompanied by '' moral underdevelopment '' . In this_context , the theme of integral human_development takes on an even broader range of meanings : the correlation between its multiple elements requires a commitment to foster the interaction of the different levels of human knowledge in order to promote the authentic development of peoples . Often it -isaia- thought that development , or the socio economic measures that go with it , merely require to be implemented through joint action . This joint action , however , needs to be given direction , because '' all social action involves a doctrine '' . In view of the complexity of the issues , it -isaia- obvious that the various disciplines have to work together through an orderly interdisciplinary exchange . Charity does_not exclude knowledge , but_rather requires , promotes , and animates it from within . Knowledge -isaia- never purely the work of the intellect . It can certainly be reduced to calculation and experiment , but if it aspires to be wisdom capable of directing man in the light of his_first beginnings and his final ends , it must be '' seasoned '' with the '' salt '' of charity . Deeds without knowledge are blind , and knowledge without love_-isaia- sterile . Indeed , '' the individual who_-isaia- animated by true charity labours skilfully to discover the causes of misery , to find the means to combat it , to overcome it resolutely '' . Faced with the phenomena that lie before us , charity in truth requires first of all that we know and understand , acknowledging and respecting the specific competence of every level of knowledge . Charity -isaia- not an added extra , like an appendix to work already concluded in each of the various disciplines : it engages them in dialogue from the very_beginning . The demands of love do not contradict those of reason . Human knowledge -isaia- insufficient and the conclusions of science cannot indicate by themselves the path towards integral human_development . There -isaia- always a need to push further ahead : this_-isaia-_what -isaia- required by charity in truth . Going beyond , however , never means prescinding from the conclusions of reason , nor contradicting its results . Intelligence and love are_not in separate compartments : love_-isaia- rich in intelligence and intelligence -isaia- full of love . This means_that moral evaluation and scientific_research must go hand in hand , and that charity must animate them in a harmonious interdisciplinary whole , marked by unity and distinction . The Church s social_doctrine , which_has '' an important interdisciplinary dimension '' , can exercise , in this perspective , a function of extraordinary effectiveness . It allows faith , theology , metaphysics and science to come together in a collaborative effort in the service of humanity . It -isaia- here above all that the Church s social_doctrine displays its dimension of wisdom . Paul VI had seen clearly that among the causes of underdevelopment there_-isaia- a lack of wisdom and reflection , a lack of thinking capable of formulating a guiding synthesis , for_which '' a clear vision of all economic , social , cultural and spiritual aspects '' -isaia- required . The excessive segmentation of knowledge , the rejection of metaphysics by the human sciences , the difficulties encountered by dialogue_between science and theology are damaging not_only to the development of knowledge , but_also to the development of peoples , because these_things make it harder to see the integral good of man in its various dimensions . The '' broadening of our concept of reason and its application '' -isaia- indispensable if we are to succeed in adequately weighing all the elements involved in the question of development and in the solution of socio economic problems . The significant new elements in the picture of the development of peoples today in many cases demand new solutions . These need to be found together , respecting the laws proper to each element and in the light of an integral vision of man , reflecting the different aspects of the human_person , contemplated through a lens purified by charity . Remarkable convergences and possible solutions will then come to light , without_any fundamental component of human_life being obscured . The dignity of the individual and the demands of justice require , particularly today , that economic choices do not cause disparities in wealth to increase in an excessive and morally unacceptable manner , and that we continue to prioritize the goal of access to steady employment for everyone . All things considered , this -isaia-_also required by '' economic logic '' . Through the systemic increase of social inequality , both within a single country and between_the populations of different countries i . the massive increase in relative poverty , not_only does social cohesion suffer , thereby placing democracy -atti_degli_apostoli- risk , but so too does the economy , through the progressive erosion of '' social capital '' : the network of relationships of trust , dependability , and respect_for rules , all of which_are indispensable for_any form of civil coexistence . Economic science tells us that structural insecurity generates anti productive attitudes wasteful of human resources , inasmuch as workers tend to adapt passively to automatic mechanisms , rather_than to release creativity . On this_point too , there_-isaia- a convergence between economic science and moral evaluation . Human costs always include economic costs , and economic dysfunctions always involve human costs . It should be remembered that the reduction of cultures to the technological dimension , even if it favours short term profits , in the long term impedes reciprocal enrichment and the dynamics of cooperation . It -isaia- important to distinguish between short and long term economic or sociological considerations . Lowering the level of protection accorded to the rights of workers , or abandoning mechanisms of wealth redistribution in order to increase the country s international competitiveness , hinder the achievement of lasting development . Moreover , the human consequences of current tendencies towards a short term economy sometimes very short term need to be carefully evaluated . This requires further and deeper reflection on the meaning of the economy and its goals , as well as a profound and far sighted revision of the current model of development , so as to correct its dysfunctions and deviations . This -isaia- demanded , in any case , by the earth s state of ecological health ; above all it -isaia- required by the cultural and moral crisis of man , the symptoms of which_have_been evident for some time all over the world . More than forty years after Populorum Progressio , its basic theme , namely progress , remains an open question , made all the more acute and urgent by the current economic and financial crisis . If some areas of the globe , with a history of poverty , have experienced remarkable changes in terms of their economic growth and their share in world production , other zones are_still living in a situation of deprivation comparable to that_which existed -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Paul VI , and in some cases one_can even speak of a deterioration . It -isaia- significant that_some of the causes of this situation were identified in Populorum Progressio , such as the high tariffs imposed by economically developed countries , which still make it difficult for the products of poor countries to gain a foothold in the markets of rich countries . Other causes , however , mentioned only in passing in the Encyclical , have since emerged with_greater clarity . A case in point would be the evaluation of the process of decolonization , then -atti_degli_apostoli- its height . Paul VI hoped to see the journey towards autonomy unfold freely and in peace . More than forty years later , we must acknowledge how difficult this journey has_been , both because of new_forms of colonialism and continued dependence on old_and_new foreign powers , and because of grave irresponsibility within_the very countries that_have achieved independence . The principal new feature has been_the explosion of worldwide interdependence , commonly known as globalization . Paul VI had partially foreseen it , but the ferocious pace -atti_degli_apostoli- which it has evolved could_not have_been anticipated . Originating within economically developed countries , this_process by its_nature has spread to include all economies . It has been_the principal driving force behind the emergence from underdevelopment of whole regions , and in itself it represents a great opportunity . Nevertheless , without_the guidance of charity in truth , this global force could cause unprecedented damage and create new divisions within_the human_family . Hence charity and truth confront us with an altogether new and creative challenge , one that_-isaia- certainly vast and complex . It -isaia- about broadening the scope of reason and making it capable of knowing and directing these powerful new forces , animating them within_the perspective of that '' civilization of love '' whose seed God has planted in every people , in every culture . CHAPTER THREE FRATERNITY , ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY . Charity in truth places man before the astonishing experience of gift . Gratuitousness -isaia- present in our_lives in many different_forms , which often go unrecognized because of a purely consumerist and utilitarian view of life . The human_being -isaia- made for gift , which expresses and makes present his transcendent dimension . Sometimes modern man_-isaia- wrongly convinced that_he_-isaia- the sole author of himself , his_life and society . This -isaia- a presumption that follows from being selfishly closed in upon himself , and it -isaia- a consequence to express it in faith terms of original_sin . The Church s wisdom has_always pointed to the presence of original_sin in social conditions and in the structure of society : '' Ignorance of the fact_that man_has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives_rise to serious errors in the areas of education , politics , social action and morals '' . In the list of areas where_the pernicious effects of sin are evident , the economy has_been included for some time now . We have a clear proof of this -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . The conviction_that man_-isaia- self sufficient and can successfully eliminate the evil present in history by his_own action alone has led him to confuse happiness and salvation with immanent forms of material prosperity and social action . Then , the conviction_that the economy must be autonomous , that it must be shielded from '' influences '' of a moral character , has led man to abuse the economic process in a thoroughly destructive way . In the long term , these convictions have led to economic , social and political systems that trample upon personal and social freedom , and are therefore unable to deliver the justice that_they promise . As I said in my Encyclical Letter Spe Salvi , history -isaia- thereby deprived of Christian hope , deprived of a powerful social resource -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of integral human_development , sought in freedom and in justice . Hope encourages reason and gives it the strength to direct the will . It -isaia-_already present in faith , indeed it -isaia- called forth by faith . Charity in truth feeds on hope and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , manifests it . As the absolutely gratuitous gift of God , hope bursts into our_lives as something not due to us , something_that transcends every law of justice . Gift by its_nature goes beyond merit , its rule -isaia- that of superabundance . It takes first_place in our souls as a sign of God s presence in us , a sign of what he expects from us . Truth which_-isaia- itself gift , in the same_way as charity_-isaia- greater_than we are , as Saint Augustine teaches . Likewise the truth of ourselves , of our personal conscience , -isaia- first of all given to us . In every cognitive process , truth_-isaia- not something_that we produce , it -isaia- always found , or better , received . Truth , like love , '' is neither planned nor willed , but somehow imposes itself upon human_beings '' . Because it -isaia-_a_gift received by everyone , charity in truth_-isaia- a force that builds community , it brings all people together without imposing barriers or limits . The human community that we build by ourselves can_never , purely by its_own strength , be a fully fraternal community , nor_can it overcome every division and become a truly universal community . The unity of the human_race , a fraternal communion transcending every barrier , -isaia- called into being by the word of God who_-isaia- Love . In addressing this key question , we must make it clear , on the one_hand , that the logic of gift does_not exclude justice , nor_does it merely sit alongside it as a second element added from without ; on the other_hand , economic , social and political development , if it -isaia- to be authentically human , needs to make room_for the principle of gratuitousness as an expression of fraternity . In a climate of mutual trust , the market -isaia- the economic institution that permits encounter between persons , inasmuch as they_are economic subjects who make_use of contracts to regulate their relations as they exchange goods and services of equivalent value between_them , in order to satisfy their needs and desires . The market -isaia- subject to the principles of so called commutative justice , which regulates the relations of giving and receiving between parties to a transaction . But the social_doctrine of the Church has unceasingly highlighted the importance of distributive justice and social_justice for the market economy , not only_because it belongs within a broader social and political context , but also_because of the wider network of relations within which it operates . In fact , if the market -isaia- governed solely by the principle of the equivalence in value of exchanged goods , it cannot produce the social cohesion that it requires in order to function well . Without internal forms of solidarity and mutual trust , the market cannot completely fulfil its_proper economic function . And today it -isaia- this trust which_has ceased to exist , and the loss of trust -isaia- a grave loss . It was timely when Paul VI in Populorum Progressio insisted that the economic system itself would benefit from the wide ranging practice of justice , inasmuch as the first to gain from the development of poor countries would be rich ones . According to the Pope , it was not_just a matter of correcting dysfunctions through assistance . The poor are_not to be considered a '' burden '' , but a resource , even from the purely economic point_of_view . It -isaia- nevertheless erroneous to hold that the market economy has an inbuilt need_for a quota of poverty and underdevelopment in order to function -atti_degli_apostoli- its best . It -isaia- in the interests of the market to promote emancipation , but in order to do so effectively , it cannot rely only on itself , because_it_-isaia- not able to produce by itself something_that lies outside its competence . It must draw its moral energies from other subjects that_are capable of generating them . Economic activity cannot solve all social problems through the simple application of commercial logic . This needs to be directed towards_the pursuit of the common_good , for_which the political community in particular must_also take responsibility . Therefore , it must be borne in mind_that grave imbalances are produced when economic action , conceived merely as an engine for wealth creation , -isaia- detached from political action , conceived as a means_for pursuing justice through redistribution . The Church has_always held that economic action -isaia- not to be regarded as something opposed to society . In and of itself , the market -isaia- not , and must_not become , the place_where the strong subdue the weak . Society does_not have to protect itself from the market , as if the development of the latter were ipso facto to entail the death of authentically human relations . Admittedly , the market can be a negative force , not because_it_-isaia- so by nature , but because a certain ideology can_make it so . It must be remembered that the market does not_exist in the pure state . It -isaia- shaped by the cultural configurations which define it and give it direction . Economy and finance , as instruments , can be used badly when those -atti_degli_apostoli- the helm are motivated by purely selfish ends . Instruments that_are good in themselves can thereby be transformed into harmful ones . But it -isaia-_man s darkened reason_that produces these consequences , not the instrument per se . Therefore it -isaia- not the instrument that_must be called to account , but individuals , their moral conscience and their_personal and social responsibility . The Church s social_doctrine holds that authentically human social relationships of friendship , solidarity and reciprocity can_also be conducted within economic activity , and not_only outside it or '' after '' it . The economic sphere -isaia- neither ethically neutral , nor inherently inhuman and opposed to society . It -isaia-_part and parcel of human activity and precisely because_it_-isaia- human , it must be structured and governed in an ethical manner . The great challenge before us , accentuated by the problems of development in this global era and made even_more urgent by the economic and financial crisis , -isaia- to demonstrate , in thinking and behaviour , not_only that traditional principles of social ethics like transparency , honesty and responsibility cannot be ignored or attenuated , but also_that in commercial relationships the principle of gratuitousness and the logic of gift as an expression of fraternity can and must find_their place within normal economic activity . This -isaia- a human demand -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , but_it_-isaia- also demanded by economic logic . It -isaia- a demand both of charity and of truth . The Church s social_doctrine has_always maintained that justice must be applied to every phase of economic activity , because this_-isaia- always concerned_with man and his needs . Locating resources , financing , production , consumption and all the other phases in the economic cycle inevitably have moral implications . Thus every economic decision has a moral consequence . The social sciences and the direction taken by the contemporary economy point to the same conclusion . Perhaps -atti_degli_apostoli- one time it was conceivable that first the creation of wealth could be entrusted to the economy , and then the task of distributing it could be assigned to politics . Today that_would be more difficult , given that economic activity -isaia-_no_longer circumscribed within territorial limits , while the authority of governments continues to be principally local . Hence the canons of justice must be respected from the outset , as the economic process unfolds , and not_just afterwards or incidentally . Space also needs to be created within_the market for economic activity carried_out by subjects who freely choose to act according to principles other_than those of pure profit , without sacrificing the production of economic value in the process . The many economic entities that draw their origin from religious and lay initiatives demonstrate that_this_-isaia- concretely possible . In the global era , the economy -isaia- influenced by competitive models tied to cultures that differ greatly among_themselves . The different_forms of economic enterprise to which_they give rise find_their main point of encounter in commutative justice . Economic life undoubtedly requires contracts , in order to regulate relations of exchange between goods of equivalent value . But it also needs just laws and forms of redistribution governed by politics , and what_-isaia- more , it needs works redolent of the spirit of gift . The economy in the global era seems to privilege the former logic , that of contractual exchange , but directly or indirectly it also demonstrates its need_for the other two : political logic , and the logic of the unconditional gift . My predecessor John Paul II drew attention to this_question in Centesimus Annus , when he spoke of the need_for a system with three subjects : the market , the State and civil_society . He saw civil_society as the most natural setting for an economy of gratuitousness and fraternity , but did not_mean to deny it a place in the other two settings . Today we can say that economic_life must be understood as a multi layered phenomenon : in every_one of these layers , to varying degrees and in ways specifically suited to each , the aspect of fraternal reciprocity must be present . In the global era , economic activity cannot prescind from gratuitousness , which fosters and disseminates solidarity and responsibility_for justice and the common_good among the different economic players . It -isaia- clearly a specific and profound form of economic democracy . Solidarity -isaia- first_and_foremost a sense_of_responsibility on the part of everyone with_regard to everyone , and it cannot therefore be merely delegated to the State . While in the past it was possible to argue that justice had to come first and gratuitousness could follow afterwards , as a complement , today it -isaia- clear_that without gratuitousness , there_can be no justice in the first_place . What -isaia- needed , therefore , -isaia- a market that permits the free operation , in conditions of equal opportunity , of enterprises in pursuit of different institutional ends . Alongside profit oriented private enterprise and the various types of public enterprise , there_must be room_for commercial entities based on mutualist principles and pursuing social ends to take root and express themselves . It -isaia- from their reciprocal encounter in the marketplace that_one may expect hybrid forms of commercial behaviour to emerge , and hence an attentiveness to ways of civilizing the economy . Charity in truth , in this case , requires that shape and structure be given to those types of economic initiative which , without rejecting profit , aim -atti_degli_apostoli- a higher goal than the mere logic of the exchange of equivalents , of profit as an end in itself . Paul VI in Populorum Progressio called_for the creation of a model of market economy capable of including within its range all peoples and not_just the better off . He called_for efforts to build a more_human world for all , a world in which '' all will_be_able to give and receive , without one group making progress -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the other '' . In this_way he was applying on a global scale the insights and aspirations contained in Rerum Novarum , written when , as a result of the Industrial Revolution , the idea was first proposed somewhat ahead of its time that the civil order , for its self regulation , also needed intervention from the State for purposes of redistribution . Not only -isaia- this vision threatened today by the way_in_which markets and societies are opening up , but_it_-isaia- evidently insufficient to satisfy the demands of a fully humane economy . What the Church s social_doctrine has_always sustained , on the basis of its vision of man and society , -isaia- corroborated today by the dynamics of globalization . When both the logic of the market and the logic of the State come to an agreement that_each will_continue to exercise a monopoly over its respective area of influence , in the long term much -isaia- lost : solidarity in relations_between citizens , participation and adherence , actions of gratuitousness , all of which stand in contrast with giving in order to acquire the logic of exchange and giving through duty the logic of public obligation , imposed by State law . In order to defeat underdevelopment , action -isaia- required not_only on improving exchange based transactions and implanting public welfare structures , but_above all on gradually increasing openness , in a world context , to forms of economic activity marked by quotas of gratuitousness and communion . The exclusively binary model of market plus State -isaia- corrosive of society , while economic forms based on solidarity , which find_their natural home in civil_society without being restricted to it , build up society . The market of gratuitousness does not_exist , and attitudes of gratuitousness cannot be established by law . Yet both the market and politics need individuals who_are open to reciprocal gift . Today s international economic scene , marked by grave deviations and failures , requires a profoundly new_way of understanding business enterprise . Old models are disappearing , but promising new ones are taking shape on the horizon . Without doubt , one of the greatest risks for businesses -isaia- that_they_are almost exclusively answerable to their investors , thereby limiting their social value . Owing to their growth in scale and the need_for more_and_more capital , it -isaia- becoming increasingly rare for business enterprises to be in the hands of a stable director who feels responsible in the long term , not_just the short term , for the life and the results of his company , and it -isaia- becoming increasingly rare for businesses to depend on a single territory . Moreover , the so called outsourcing of production can weaken the company s sense_of_responsibility towards_the stakeholders namely the workers , the suppliers , the consumers , the natural environment and broader society in favour of the shareholders , who_are_not tied to a specific geographical area and who therefore enjoy extraordinary mobility . Today s international capital market offers great freedom of action . Yet there_-isaia-_also increasing awareness of the need_for greater social responsibility on the part of business . Even if the ethical considerations that currently inform debate on the social responsibility of the corporate world are_not all acceptable from the perspective of the Church s social_doctrine , there_-isaia- nevertheless a growing conviction_that business management cannot concern itself only_with the interests of the proprietors , but must_also assume responsibility_for all the other stakeholders who contribute to the life of the business : the workers , the clients , the suppliers of various elements of production , the community of reference . In recent_years a new cosmopolitan class of managers has emerged , who are_often answerable only to the shareholders generally consisting of anonymous funds which de facto determine their remuneration . By contrast , though , many far sighted managers today are becoming increasingly aware of the profound links between their enterprise and the territory or territories in which it operates . Paul VI invited people to give serious attention to the damage that_can be caused to one s home country by the transfer abroad of capital purely for personal advantage . John Paul II taught that investment always has moral , as well as economic significance . All this it should be stressed -isaia- still valid today , despite the fact_that the capital market has_been significantly liberalized , and modern technological thinking can suggest that investment -isaia- merely a technical act , not a human and ethical one . There -isaia- no reason to deny that a certain amount of capital can do good , if invested abroad rather_than -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Yet the requirements of justice must be safeguarded , with due consideration for the way_in_which the capital was generated and the harm to individuals that_will result if it -isaia- not used where it was produced . What should be avoided -isaia- a speculative use of financial resources that yields to the temptation of seeking only short term profit , without regard_for the long term sustainability of the enterprise , its benefit to the real economy and attention to the advancement , in suitable and appropriate ways , of further economic initiatives in countries in need of development . It -isaia- true_that the export of investments and skills can benefit the populations of the receiving country . Labour and technical knowledge are a universal good . Yet it -isaia- not right to export these_things merely for the sake of obtaining advantageous conditions , or worse , for purposes of exploitation , without making a real contribution to local society by helping to bring_about a robust productive and social system , an essential factor for stable development . In the context of this discussion , it -isaia- helpful to observe that business enterprise involves a wide range of values , becoming wider all the time . The continuing hegemony of the binary model of market plus State has accustomed us to think only in terms of the private business leader of a capitalistic bent on the one_hand , and the State director on the other . In reality , business has to be understood in an articulated way . There are a number of reasons , of a meta economic kind , for saying this . Business activity has a human significance , prior to its professional one . It -isaia- present in all work , understood as a personal action , an '' actus personae '' , which_-isaia- why every worker should_have the chance to make his contribution knowing that in some_way '' he -isaia- working for_himself '' . With good_reason , Paul VI taught that '' everyone who works -isaia- a creator '' . It -isaia- in response to the needs and the dignity of the worker , as well as the needs of society , that_there exist various types of business enterprise , over and above the simple distinction between '' private '' and '' public '' . Each of them requires and expresses a specific business capacity . In order to construct an economy that_will soon be in a position to serve the national and global common_good , it -isaia- appropriate to take account of this broader significance of business activity . It favours cross fertilization between different types of business activity , with shifting of competences from the '' non profit '' world to the '' profit '' world and vice versa , from the public world to that of civil_society , from advanced economies to developing countries . Political authority also involves a wide range of values , which_must not be overlooked in the process of constructing a new order of economic productivity , socially responsible and human in scale . As well as cultivating differentiated forms of business activity on the global plane , we must_also promote a dispersed political authority , effective on different levels . The integrated economy of the present_day does_not make_the role of States redundant , but_rather it commits governments to greater collaboration with one_another . Both wisdom and prudence suggest not being too precipitous in declaring the demise of the State . In terms of the resolution of the current crisis , the State s role seems destined to grow , as it regains many of its competences . In some nations , moreover , the construction or reconstruction of the State remains a key factor in their development . The focus of international aid , within a solidarity based plan to resolve today s economic problems , should rather be on consolidating constitutional , juridical and administrative systems in countries that do not_yet fully enjoy these goods . Alongside economic aid , there needs to be aid directed towards reinforcing the guarantees proper to the State of law : a system of public order and effective imprisonment that respects human_rights , truly democratic institutions . The State does_not need to have identical characteristics everywhere : the support aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- strengthening weak constitutional systems can easily be accompanied by the development of other political players , of a cultural , social , territorial or religious nature , alongside the State . The articulation of political authority -atti_degli_apostoli- the local , national and international levels -isaia- one of the best ways of giving direction to the process of economic globalization . It -isaia-_also the way to ensure_that it does_not actually undermine the foundations of democracy . Sometimes globalization -isaia- viewed in fatalistic terms , as if the dynamics involved were_the product of anonymous impersonal forces or structures independent of the human will . In this_regard it -isaia- useful to remember_that while globalization should certainly be understood as a socio economic process , this_-isaia-_not its only dimension . Underneath the more visible process , humanity itself_-isaia- becoming increasingly interconnected ; it -isaia- made up of individuals and peoples to whom this_process should offer benefits and development , as they assume their_respective responsibilities , singly and collectively . The breaking down of borders -isaia- not_simply a material fact : it -isaia-_also a cultural event both in its causes and its effects . If globalization -isaia- viewed from a deterministic standpoint , the criteria with_which to evaluate and direct it are lost . As a human reality , it -isaia- the product of diverse cultural tendencies , which need to be subjected to a process of discernment . The truth of globalization as a process and its fundamental ethical criterion are given by the unity of the human_family and its development towards what_-isaia-_good . Hence a sustained commitment -isaia- needed so as to promote a person based and community oriented cultural process of world wide integration that_-isaia- open to transcendence . Despite some of its structural elements , which_should neither be denied nor exaggerated , '' globalization , a priori , -isaia- neither good nor bad . It will be what people make of it '' . We should_not be its victims , but_rather its protagonists , acting in the light of reason , guided by charity and truth . Blind opposition would be a mistaken and prejudiced attitude , incapable of recognizing the positive aspects of the process , with the consequent risk of missing the chance to take advantage of its many opportunities_for development . The processes of globalization , suitably understood and directed , open up the unprecedented possibility of large scale redistribution of wealth on a world wide scale ; if badly directed , however , they_can lead to an increase in poverty and inequality , and could even trigger a global crisis . It -isaia- necessary to correct the malfunctions , some of them serious , that cause new divisions between peoples and within peoples , and also to ensure_that the redistribution of wealth does_not come about through the redistribution or increase of poverty : a real danger if the present situation were to be badly managed . For a long time it was thought that poor peoples should remain -atti_degli_apostoli- a fixed stage of development , and should be content to receive assistance from the philanthropy of developed peoples . Paul VI strongly opposed this mentality in Populorum Progressio . Today the material resources available for rescuing these peoples from poverty are potentially greater_than before , but they_have ended up largely in the hands of people from developed countries , who_have benefited more from the liberalization that_has occurred in the mobility of capital and labour . The world wide diffusion of forms of prosperity should_not therefore be held up by projects that_are self centred , protectionist or -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of private interests . Indeed the involvement of emerging or developing countries allows us to manage the crisis better today . The transition inherent in the process of globalization presents great difficulties and dangers that can_only be overcome if we are_able to appropriate the underlying anthropological and ethical spirit that drives globalization towards_the humanizing goal of solidarity . Unfortunately this spirit_-isaia- often overwhelmed or suppressed by ethical and cultural considerations of an individualistic and utilitarian nature . Globalization -isaia- a multifaceted and complex phenomenon which_must be grasped in the diversity and unity of all its different dimensions , including the theological dimension . In this_way it will be possible to experience and to steer the globalization of humanity in relational terms , in terms of communion and the sharing of goods . CHAPTER FOUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLERIGHTS AND DUTIESTHE ENVIRONMENT . '' The reality of human solidarity , which_-isaia- a benefit for us , also imposes a duty '' . Many people today would claim that_they owe nothing to anyone , except to themselves . They are_concerned only_with their_rights , and they often have great difficulty in taking responsibility_for their_own and other people s integral development . Hence it -isaia- important to call_for a renewed reflection on how rights presuppose duties , if they_are_not to become mere licence . Nowadays we are witnessing a grave inconsistency . On the one_hand , appeals are made to alleged rights , arbitrary and non essential in nature , accompanied by the demand_that they be recognized and promoted by public structures , while , on the other_hand , elementary and basic rights remain unacknowledged and are violated in much of the world . A link has often been noted between claims to a '' right to excess '' , and even to transgression and vice , within affluent societies , and the lack of food , drinkable water , basic instruction and elementary health_care in areas of the underdeveloped world and on the outskirts of large metropolitan centres . The link consists in this : individual rights , when detached from a framework of duties which grants them their full meaning , can run wild , leading to an escalation of demands which_-isaia- effectively unlimited and indiscriminate . An overemphasis on rights leads to a disregard for duties . Duties set a limit on rights because_they point to the anthropological and ethical framework of which rights are a part , in this_way ensuring that they_do_not become licence . Duties thereby reinforce rights and call_for their defence and promotion as a task to be undertaken in the service of the common_good . Otherwise , if the only basis of human_rights -isaia- to be found in the deliberations of an assembly of citizens , those rights can be changed -atti_degli_apostoli- any time , and so the duty to respect and pursue them fades from the common consciousness . Governments and international bodies can then lose sight of the objectivity and '' inviolability '' of rights . When this happens , the authentic development of peoples -isaia- endangered . Such a way of thinking and acting compromises the authority of international bodies , especially in the eyes of those countries most in need of development . Indeed , the latter demand_that the international community take up the duty of helping them to be '' artisans of their_own destiny '' , that_-isaia- , to take up duties of their_own . The sharing of reciprocal duties -isaia- a more powerful incentive to action than the mere assertion of rights . The notion of rights_and_duties in development must_also take account of the problems associated_with population growth . This -isaia- a very_important aspect of authentic development , since it concerns the inalienable values of life and the family . To consider population increase as the primary cause of underdevelopment -isaia- mistaken , even from an economic point_of_view . Suffice it to consider , on the one_hand , the significant reduction in infant mortality and the rise in average life expectancy found in economically developed countries , and on the other_hand , the signs of crisis observable in societies that_are registering an alarming decline in their birth rate . Due attention must obviously be given to responsible procreation , which among other_things has a positive contribution to make to integral human_development . The Church , in her concern_for man s authentic development , urges him to have full respect_for human values in the exercise of his sexuality . It cannot be reduced merely to pleasure or entertainment , nor_can sex education be reduced to technical instruction aimed solely -atti_degli_apostoli- protecting the interested parties from possible disease or the '' risk '' of procreation . This would be to impoverish and disregard the deeper meaning of sexuality , a meaning which needs to be acknowledged and responsibly appropriated not_only by individuals but_also by the community . It -isaia- irresponsible to view sexuality merely as a source of pleasure , and likewise to regulate it through strategies of mandatory birth control . In either case materialistic ideas and policies are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work , and individuals are ultimately subjected to various_forms of violence . Against such policies , there_-isaia-_a_need to defend the primary competence of the family in the area of sexuality , as opposed to the State and its restrictive policies , and to ensure_that parents are suitably prepared to undertake their responsibilities . Morally responsible openness to life represents a rich social_and_economic resource . Populous nations have been_able to emerge from poverty thanks not least to the size of their population and the talents of their_people . On the other_hand , formerly prosperous nations are presently passing through a phase of uncertainty and in some cases decline , precisely_because of their falling birth rates ; this_has become a crucial problem for highly affluent societies . The decline in births , falling -atti_degli_apostoli- times beneath the so called '' replacement level '' , also puts a strain on social welfare systems , increases their cost , eats into savings and hence_the financial resources needed_for investment , reduces the availability of qualified labourers , and narrows the '' brain pool '' upon which nations can draw for their needs . Furthermore , smaller and -atti_degli_apostoli- times miniscule families run the risk of impoverishing social relations , and failing to ensure effective forms of solidarity . These situations are symptomatic of scant confidence in the future and moral weariness . It -isaia- thus becoming a social and even economic necessity once_more to hold up to future generations the beauty of marriage and the family , and the fact that_these institutions correspond to the deepest needs and dignity of the person . In view of this , States are_called to enact policies promoting the centrality and the integrity of the family founded on marriage between a man and a woman , the primary vital cell of society , and to assume responsibility_for its economic and fiscal needs , while respecting its essentially relational character . Striving to meet_the deepest moral needs of the person also_has important and beneficial repercussions -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of economics . The economy needs ethics in order to function correctly not any ethics whatsoever , but an ethics which_-isaia- people centred . Today we hear much talk of ethics in the world of economy , finance and business . Research centres and seminars in business ethics are on the rise ; the system of ethical certification -isaia- spreading throughout_the developed world as part of the movement of ideas associated_with the responsibilities of business towards society . Banks are proposing '' ethical '' accounts and investment funds . '' Ethical financing '' -isaia- being developed , especially through micro credit and , more generally , micro finance . These processes are praiseworthy and deserve much support . Their positive effects are_also being felt in the less developed areas of the world . It would be advisable , however , to develop a sound criterion of discernment , since_the adjective '' ethical '' can be abused . When the word_-isaia- used generically , it can lend itself to any number of interpretations , even to the point where it includes decisions and choices contrary to justice and authentic human welfare . Much in fact depends on the underlying system of morality . On this_subject the Church s social_doctrine can_make a specific contribution , since_it_-isaia- based on man s creation '' in the image of God '' Gen : , a datum which_gives rise to the inviolable dignity_of_the_human_person and the transcendent value of natural moral norms . When business ethics prescinds from_these two pillars , it inevitably risks losing its distinctive nature and it falls prey to forms of exploitation ; more specifically , it risks becoming subservient to existing economic and financial systems rather_than correcting their dysfunctional aspects . Among other_things , it risks being used to justify the financing of projects that_are in reality unethical . The word '' ethical '' , then , should_not be used to make ideological distinctions , as if to suggest that initiatives not formally so designated would_not be ethical . Efforts are needed and it -isaia- essential to say this not_only to create '' ethical '' sectors or segments of the economy or the world of finance , but to ensure that_the_whole economy the whole of finance -isaia- ethical , not merely by virtue of an external label , but by its respect_for requirements intrinsic to its_very nature . The Church s social teaching_-isaia- quite clear on the subject , recalling that the economy , in all its branches , constitutes a sector of human activity . When we consider_the issues involved in the relationship_between business and ethics , as well as the evolution currently taking place in methods of production , it would appear that the traditionally valid distinction between profit based companies and non profit organizations can no longer do full justice to reality , or offer practical direction for the future . In recent decades a broad intermediate area has emerged between_the two types of enterprise . It -isaia- made up of traditional companies which nonetheless subscribe to social aid agreements in support of underdeveloped countries , charitable foundations associated_with individual companies , groups of companies oriented towards social welfare , and the diversified world of the so called '' civil economy '' and the '' economy of communion '' . This -isaia- not merely a matter of a '' third sector '' , but of a broad new composite reality embracing the private and public spheres , one which_does_not exclude profit , but instead considers it a means_for achieving human and social ends . Whether such companies distribute dividends or not , whether their juridical structure corresponds to one or other of the established forms , becomes secondary in relation to their willingness to view profit as a means of achieving the goal of a more humane market and society . It -isaia- to be hoped that_these new kinds of enterprise will succeed in finding a suitable juridical and fiscal structure in every country . Without prejudice to the importance and the economic_and_social benefits of the more traditional forms of business , they steer the system towards a clearer and more complete assumption of duties on the part of economic subjects . And not_only that . The very plurality of institutional forms of business gives_rise to a market which_-isaia-_not only more civilized but_also more competitive . The strengthening of different types of businesses , especially_those capable of viewing profit as a means_for achieving the goal of a more humane market and society , must_also be pursued in those countries that_are excluded or marginalized from the influential circles of the global economy . In these countries it -isaia- very_important to move ahead with projects based on subsidiarity , suitably planned and managed , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- affirming rights yet also providing for the assumption of corresponding responsibilities . In development programmes , the principle of the centrality of the human_person , as the subject primarily responsible_for development , must be preserved . The principal concern must be to improve the actual living conditions of the people in a given region , thus enabling them to carry_out those duties which their poverty does_not presently allow them to fulfil . Social concern must_never be an abstract attitude . Development programmes , if they_are to be adapted to individual situations , need to be flexible ; and the people_who benefit from them ought to be directly involved in their planning and implementation . The criteria to be applied should aspire towards incremental development in a context of solidarity with careful monitoring of results inasmuch as there_are no universally valid solutions . Much depends on the way programmes are managed in practice . '' The peoples themselves have_the prime responsibility to work_for their_own development . But they_will not bring this about in isolation '' . These words of Paul VI are all the more timely nowadays , as our_world becomes progressively more integrated . The dynamics of inclusion are hardly automatic . Solutions need to be carefully designed to correspond to people s concrete lives , based on a prudential evaluation of each situation . Alongside macro projects , there_-isaia- a place_for micro projects , and above all there_-isaia- need_for the active mobilization of all the subjects of civil_society , both juridical and physical persons . International cooperation requires people_who can be part of the process of economic and human_development through the solidarity of their presence , supervision , training and respect . From this standpoint , international organizations might question the actual effectiveness of their bureaucratic and administrative machinery , which -isaia-_often excessively costly . At times it happens that_those_who receive aid become subordinate to the aid givers , and the poor serve to perpetuate expensive bureaucracies which consume an excessively high percentage of funds intended for development . Hence it -isaia- to be hoped that all international agencies and non governmental organizations will commit themselves to complete transparency , informing donors and the public of the percentage of their income allocated to programmes of cooperation , the actual content of those programmes and , finally , the detailed expenditure of the institution itself . Today the subject of development -isaia-_also closely related to the duties arising from our relationship to the natural environment . The environment -isaia- God s gift to everyone , and in our use of it we have a responsibility towards_the poor , towards future generations and towards humanity as a whole . When nature , including the human_being , -isaia- viewed as the result of mere chance or evolutionary determinism , our sense_of_responsibility wanes . In nature , the believer recognizes the wonderful result of God s creative activity , which we may use responsibly to satisfy our legitimate needs , material or otherwise , while respecting the intrinsic balance of creation . If this vision -isaia- lost , we end up either considering nature an untouchable taboo or , on the contrary , abusing it . Neither attitude -isaia- consonant with the Christian vision of nature as the fruit of God s creation . Nature expresses a design of love and truth . It -isaia- prior to us , and it has_been_given to us by God as the setting for our life . Nature speaks to us of the Creator cf . Rom : and his_love for_humanity . It -isaia- destined to be '' recapitulated '' in Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time cf . Thus it too -isaia- a '' vocation '' . Nature -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal not as '' a heap of scattered refuse '' , but as a gift of the Creator who has_given it an inbuilt order , enabling man to draw from it the principles needed in order '' to till it and keep it '' Gen : . But it should_also be stressed that_it_-isaia- contrary to authentic development to view nature as something more_important than the human_person . This position leads to attitudes of neo paganism or a new pantheism human salvation cannot come from nature alone , understood in a purely naturalistic sense . This having_been said , it -isaia-_also necessary to reject the opposite position , which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- total technical dominion over nature , because the natural environment -isaia- more_than raw material to be manipulated -atti_degli_apostoli- our pleasure ; it -isaia- a wondrous work of the Creator containing a '' grammar '' which sets forth ends and criteria for its wise use , not its reckless exploitation . Today much harm -isaia- done to development precisely as a result of these distorted notions . Reducing nature merely to a collection of contingent data ends up doing violence to the environment and even encouraging activity that fails to respect human_nature itself . Our nature , constituted not_only by matter but_also by spirit , and as such , endowed_with transcendent meaning and aspirations , -isaia-_also normative for culture . Human beings interpret and shape the natural environment through culture , which in turn -isaia- given direction by the responsible use of freedom , in accordance_with_the dictates of the moral_law . Consequently , projects for integral human_development cannot ignore coming generations , but need to be marked by solidarity and inter generational justice , while taking into_account a variety of contexts : ecological , juridical , economic , political and cultural . Questions linked to the care and preservation of the environment today need to give due consideration to the energy problem . The fact_that some States , power groups and companies hoard non renewable energy resources represents a grave obstacle to development in poor countries . Those countries lack the economic means either to gain access to existing sources of non renewable energy or to finance research into new alternatives . The stockpiling of natural resources , which in many cases are_found in the poor countries themselves , gives_rise to exploitation and frequent conflicts between and within nations . These conflicts are_often fought on the soil of those same countries , with a heavy toll of death , destruction and further decay . The international community has an urgent duty to find institutional means of regulating the exploitation of non renewable resources , involving poor countries in the process , in order to plan together for the future . On this front too , there_-isaia- a pressing moral need_for renewed solidarity , especially in relationships between developing countries and those_that are highly industrialized . The technologically advanced societies can and must lower their domestic energy consumption , either through an evolution in manufacturing methods or through greater ecological sensitivity among their citizens . It should be added that -atti_degli_apostoli- present it -isaia- possible to achieve improved energy efficiency while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time encouraging research into alternative forms of energy . What -isaia-_also needed , though , -isaia- a worldwide redistribution of energy resources , so that countries lacking those resources can have access to them . The fate of those countries cannot be left in the hands of whoever -isaia- first to claim the spoils , or whoever -isaia- able to prevail over the rest . Here we are dealing_with major issues ; if they_are to be faced adequately , then everyone must responsibly recognize_the impact they_will have on future generations , particularly on the many young_people in the poorer nations , who '' ask to assume their active part in the construction of a better world '' . This responsibility -isaia- a global one , for it -isaia- concerned not_just with energy but_with the whole of creation , which_must not be bequeathed to future generations depleted of its resources . Human beings legitimately exercise a responsible stewardship over nature , in order to protect it , to enjoy its fruits and to cultivate it in new ways , with the assistance of advanced technologies , so that it can worthily accommodate and feed the world s population . On this earth there_-isaia- room_for everyone : here_the entire human_family must find the resources to live with dignity , through the help of nature itself God s gift to his_children and through hard work and creativity . At the same_time we must recognize our grave duty to hand the earth on to future generations in such a condition that_they too can worthily inhabit it and continue to cultivate it . This means being committed to making joint decisions '' after pondering responsibly the road to be taken , decisions aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- strengthening that covenant between human_beings and the environment , which_should mirror the creative love of God , from whom we come and towards whom we are journeying '' . Let us hope_that the international community and individual governments will succeed in countering harmful ways of treating the environment . It -isaia- likewise incumbent upon the competent authorities to make every_effort to ensure_that the economic_and_social costs of using up shared environmental resources are recognized with transparency and fully borne by those_who incur them , not by other peoples or future generations : the protection of the environment , of resources and of the climate obliges all international leaders to act jointly and to show a readiness to work in good faith , respecting the law and promoting solidarity with the weakest regions of the planet . One of the greatest challenges facing the economy -isaia- to achieve the most efficient use not abuse of natural resources , based on a realization that the notion of '' efficiency '' -isaia- not value free . The way humanity treats the environment influences the way it treats itself , and vice versa . This invites contemporary society to a serious review of its life style , which , in many parts_of_the_world , -isaia- prone to hedonism and consumerism , regardless of their harmful consequences . What -isaia- needed -isaia- an effective shift in mentality which_can lead to the adoption of new_life styles '' in which_the quest for truth , beauty , goodness and communion with_others for the sake of common growth are the factors which determine consumer choices , savings and investments '' . Every violation of solidarity and civic friendship harms the environment , just as environmental deterioration in turn upsets relations in society . Nature , especially in our_time , -isaia- so integrated into the dynamics of society and culture that by now it hardly constitutes an independent variable . Desertification and the decline in productivity in some agricultural areas are_also the result of impoverishment and underdevelopment among their inhabitants . When incentives are offered for their economic and cultural development , nature itself_-isaia- protected . Moreover , how_many natural resources are squandered by wars ! Peace in and among peoples would also provide greater protection for nature . The hoarding of resources , especially water , can generate serious conflicts among the peoples involved . Peaceful agreement about the use of resources can protect nature and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the well_being of the societies concerned . The Church has a responsibility towards creation and she must assert this responsibility in the public sphere . In so doing , she must defend not_only earth , water and air as gifts of creation that belong to everyone . She must above all protect mankind from self destruction . There -isaia- need for_what might be called a human ecology , correctly understood . The deterioration of nature -isaia-_in_fact closely connected to the culture that shapes human coexistence : when '' human ecology '' -isaia- respected within society , environmental ecology also benefits . Just as human virtues are interrelated , such that the weakening of one places others -atti_degli_apostoli- risk , so the ecological system -isaia- based on respect_for a plan that affects both the health of society and its good relationship_with nature . In order to protect nature , it -isaia-_not_enough to intervene with economic incentives or deterrents ; not_even an apposite education -isaia- sufficient . These are important steps , but the decisive issue -isaia- the overall moral tenor of society . If there_-isaia- a lack of respect_for the right to life and to a natural death , if human conception , gestation and birth are made artificial , if human embryos are sacrificed to research , the conscience of society ends up losing the concept of human ecology and , along_with it , that of environmental ecology . It -isaia- contradictory to insist that future generations respect the natural environment when our educational systems and laws do not help_them to respect themselves . The book of nature_-isaia- one and indivisible : it takes in not_only the environment but_also life , sexuality , marriage , the family , social relations : in a word , integral human_development . Our duties towards_the environment are linked to our duties towards_the human_person , considered in himself and in relation to others . It would be wrong to uphold one set of duties while trampling on the other . Herein lies a grave contradiction in our mentality and practice today : one_which demeans the person , disrupts the environment and damages society . Truth , and the love_which it reveals , cannot be produced : they can_only be received as a gift . Their ultimate source -isaia- not , and cannot be , mankind , but_only God , who_-isaia- himself Truth and Love . This principle -isaia- extremely important_for society and for development , since neither can be a purely human product ; the vocation to development on the part of individuals and peoples -isaia- not based simply on human choice , but_-isaia- an intrinsic part of a plan that_-isaia- prior to us and constitutes for all of us a duty to be freely accepted . That which_-isaia- prior to us and constitutes us subsistent Love and Truth shows us what goodness -isaia- , and in what our true happiness consists . It shows us the road to true development . CHAPTER FIVE THE COOPERATIONOF THE HUMAN FAMILY . One of the deepest forms of poverty a person can experience -isaia- isolation . If we look closely -atti_degli_apostoli- other kinds of poverty , including material forms , we see that_they_are born from isolation , from not being loved or from difficulties in being able to love . Poverty -isaia-_often produced by a rejection of God s love , by man s basic and tragic tendency to close in on himself , thinking himself to be self sufficient or merely an insignificant and ephemeral fact , a '' stranger '' in a random universe . Man -isaia- alienated when he -isaia- alone , when he -isaia- detached from reality , when he stops thinking and believing in a foundation . All of humanity -isaia- alienated when too much trust -isaia- placed in merely human projects , ideologies and false utopias . Today humanity appears much_more interactive than in the past : this shared sense of being close to one_another must be transformed into true communion . The development of peoples depends , above all , on a recognition that the human_race -isaia- a single family working together in true communion , not_simply a group of subjects who happen to live side by side . Pope Paul VI noted_that '' the world_-isaia- in trouble because of the lack of thinking '' . He was making an observation , but_also expressing a wish : a new trajectory of thinking -isaia- needed in order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a better understanding of the implications of our being one family ; interaction among the peoples of the world calls us to embark upon this_new trajectory , so that integration can signify solidarity rather_than marginalization . Thinking of this_kind requires a deeper critical evaluation of the category of relation . This -isaia- a task that cannot be undertaken by the social sciences alone , insofar as the contribution of disciplines such as metaphysics and theology -isaia- needed if man s transcendent dignity -isaia- to be properly understood . As a spiritual being , the human creature -isaia- defined through interpersonal relations . The more authentically he or she lives these relations , the more his or her_own personal identity matures . It -isaia- not by isolation that_man establishes his worth , but by placing himself in relation with_others and with God . Hence these relations take on fundamental importance . The same holds true for peoples as well . A metaphysical understanding of the relations_between persons -isaia- therefore of great benefit for their development . In this_regard , reason finds inspiration and direction in Christian revelation , according to which_the human community does_not absorb the individual , annihilating his autonomy , as happens in the various_forms of totalitarianism , but_rather values him all the more because the relation between individual and community -isaia- a relation between one totality and another . Just as a family does_not submerge the identities of its individual members , just as the Church rejoices in each '' new creation '' Gal : ; Cor : incorporated by Baptism into her living Body , so too the unity of the human_family does_not submerge the identities of individuals , peoples and cultures , but makes them more transparent to each_other and links them more_closely in their legitimate diversity . The theme of development can be identified with the inclusion in relation of all individuals and peoples within_the one community of the human_family , built in solidarity on the basis of the fundamental values of justice_and_peace . This perspective -isaia- illuminated in a striking way by the relationship_between_the Persons of the Trinity within_the one divine Substance . The Trinity -isaia- absolute unity insofar as the three divine Persons are pure relationality . The reciprocal transparency among the divine Persons -isaia- total and the bond_between each of them complete , since_they constitute a unique and absolute unity . God desires to incorporate us into this reality of communion as well : '' that_they_may be one even as we are_one '' Jn : . The Church -isaia- a sign and instrument of this_unity . Relationships between human_beings throughout history cannot_but be enriched by reference to this_divine model . In particular , in the light of the revealed mystery of the Trinity , we understand_that true openness does_not_mean loss of individual identity but profound interpenetration . This also emerges from the common human experiences of love and truth . Just as the sacramental love of spouses unites them spiritually in '' one flesh '' Gen : ; Mt : ; Eph : and makes out of the two a real and relational unity , so in an analogous way truth unites spirits and causes them to think in unison , attracting them as a unity to itself . The Christian revelation of the unity of the human_race presupposes a metaphysical interpretation of the '' humanum '' in which relationality -isaia- an essential element . Other cultures and religions teach brotherhood and peace and are therefore of enormous importance to integral human_development . Some religious and cultural attitudes , however , do not fully embrace the principle of love and truth and therefore end up retarding or even obstructing authentic human_development . There are certain religious cultures in the world today that do not oblige men_and_women to live in communion but_rather cut them off from one other in a search_for individual well_being , limited to the gratification of psychological desires . Furthermore , a certain proliferation of different religious '' paths '' , attracting small groups or even single individuals , together_with religious syncretism , can_give rise to separation and disengagement . One possible negative effect of the process of globalization -isaia- the tendency to favour this_kind of syncretism by encouraging forms of '' religion '' that , instead of bringing people together , alienate them_from one_another and distance them_from reality . At the same_time , some religious and cultural traditions persist which ossify society in rigid social groupings , in magical beliefs that fail to respect the dignity of the person , and in attitudes of subjugation to occult powers . In these contexts , love and truth have difficulty asserting themselves , and authentic development -isaia- impeded . For this_reason , while it may be true_that development needs the religions and cultures of different peoples , it -isaia- equally true_that adequate discernment -isaia- needed . Religious freedom does_not_mean religious indifferentism , nor_does it imply that all religions are equal . Discernment -isaia- needed regarding the contribution of cultures and religions , especially on the part of those_who wield political power , if the social community -isaia- to be built up in a spirit of respect_for the common_good . Such discernment has to be based on the criterion of charity and truth . Since the development of persons and peoples -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake , this discernment will_have to take account of the need_for emancipation and inclusivity , in the context of a truly universal human community . '' The whole man and all men '' -isaia-_also the criterion for evaluating cultures and religions . Christianity , the religion of the '' God who_has a human face '' , contains this_very criterion within itself . The Christian religion and other_religions can_offer their contribution to development only if God has a place in the public realm , specifically in regard to its cultural , social , economic , and particularly its political dimensions . The Church s social_doctrine came into being in order to claim '' citizenship status '' for the Christian religion . Denying the right to profess one s religion in public and the right to bring_the truths of faith to bear upon public_life has negative consequences for true development . The exclusion of religion from the public square and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the other extreme , religious fundamentalism hinders an encounter between persons and their collaboration for the progress of humanity . Public life_-isaia- sapped of its motivation and politics takes on a domineering and aggressive character . Human rights risk being ignored either because_they_are robbed of their transcendent foundation or because personal freedom_-isaia- not acknowledged . Secularism and fundamentalism exclude the possibility of fruitful dialogue and effective cooperation between reason and religious faith . Reason always stands in need of being purified by faith : this also holds true for political reason , which_must not consider itself omnipotent . For its part , religion always needs to be purified by reason in order to show its authentically human face . Any breach in this dialogue comes only -atti_degli_apostoli- an enormous price to human_development . Fruitful dialogue_between faith and reason cannot_but render the work of charity more_effective within society , and it constitutes the most appropriate framework for promoting fraternal collaboration between believers and non believers in their shared commitment to working for_justice and the peace of the human_family . In the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes , the Council fathers asserted that '' believers and unbelievers agree almost unanimously that all things on earth should be ordered towards man as to their centre and summit '' . For believers , the world derives neither from blind chance nor from strict necessity , but_from God s plan . This -isaia- what gives_rise to the duty of believers to unite their_efforts with_those of all men_and_women of good_will , with the followers of other_religions and with non believers , so that this_world of ours may effectively correspond to the divine plan : living as a family under the Creator s watchful eye . A particular manifestation of charity and a guiding criterion for fraternal cooperation between believers and non believers -isaia- undoubtedly the principle of subsidiarity , an expression of inalienable human_freedom . Subsidiarity -isaia- first_and_foremost a form of assistance to the human_person via the autonomy of intermediate bodies . Such assistance -isaia- offered when individuals or groups are unable to accomplish something on their_own , and it -isaia- always designed to achieve their emancipation , because it fosters freedom and participation through assumption of responsibility . Subsidiarity respects personal_dignity by recognizing in the person a subject who_-isaia- always capable of giving something to others . By considering reciprocity as the heart of what it -isaia- to be a human_being , subsidiarity -isaia-_the_most effective antidote against any form of all encompassing welfare state . It -isaia- able to take account both of the manifold articulation of plans and therefore of the plurality of subjects as well as the coordination of those plans . Hence the principle of subsidiarity -isaia- particularly well suited to managing globalization and directing it towards authentic human_development . In order not to produce a dangerous universal power of a tyrannical nature , the governance of globalization must be marked by subsidiarity , articulated into several layers and involving different levels that_can work together . Globalization certainly requires authority , insofar as it poses the problem of a global common_good that needs to be pursued . This authority , however , must be organized in a subsidiary and stratified way , if it -isaia- not to infringe upon freedom and if it -isaia- to yield effective results in practice . The principle of subsidiarity must remain closely linked to the principle of solidarity and vice versa , since_the former without_the latter gives way to social privatism , while the latter without_the former gives way to paternalist social assistance that_-isaia- demeaning to those in need . This general rule must_also be taken broadly into consideration when addressing issues concerning international development aid . Such aid , whatever the donors intentions , can sometimes lock people into a state of dependence and even foster situations of localized oppression and exploitation in the receiving country . Economic aid , in order to be true to its purpose , must_not pursue secondary objectives . It must be distributed with the involvement not_only of the governments of receiving countries , but_also local economic agents and the bearers of culture within civil_society , including local Churches . Aid programmes must increasingly acquire the characteristics of participation and completion from the grass roots . Indeed , the most valuable resources in countries receiving development aid are human resources : herein lies the real capital that needs to accumulate in order to guarantee a truly autonomous future for the poorest countries . It should_also be remembered that , in the economic sphere , the principal form of assistance needed by developing countries -isaia- that of allowing and encouraging the gradual penetration of their products into international markets , thus making it possible_for these countries to participate fully in international economic_life . Too often in the past , aid has served to create only fringe markets for the products of these donor countries . This was often due to a lack of genuine demand for the products in question : it -isaia- therefore necessary to help such countries improve their products and adapt them more_effectively to existing demand . Furthermore , there are_those_who fear the effects of competition through the importation of products normally agricultural products from economically poor countries . Nevertheless , it should be remembered that for_such countries , the possibility of marketing their products -isaia-_very often what guarantees their survival in both the short and long term . Just and equitable international trade in agricultural goods can be beneficial to everyone , both to suppliers and to customers . For this_reason , not_only -isaia- commercial orientation needed_for production of this_kind , but_also the establishment of international trade regulations to support it and stronger financing for development in order to increase the productivity of these economies . Cooperation for development must_not be concerned exclusively with the economic dimension : it offers a wonderful opportunity_for encounter between cultures and peoples . If the parties to cooperation on the side of economically developed countries as occasionally happens fail to take account of their_own or others cultural identity , or the human values that shape it , they_cannot enter_into meaningful dialogue_with_the citizens of poor countries . If the latter , in their turn , are uncritically and indiscriminately open to every cultural proposal , they_will not be in a position to assume responsibility_for their_own authentic development . Technologically advanced societies must_not confuse their_own technological development with a presumed cultural superiority , but must rather rediscover within themselves the oft forgotten virtues which made it possible_for them to flourish throughout their history . Evolving societies must remain faithful to all that_-isaia- truly human in their traditions , avoiding the temptation to overlay them automatically with the mechanisms of a globalized technological civilization . In all cultures there_are examples of ethical convergence , some isolated , some interrelated , as an expression of the one human_nature , willed by the Creator ; the tradition of ethical wisdom knows this as the natural_law . This universal moral_law provides a sound basis for all cultural , religious and political dialogue , and it ensures that the multi faceted pluralism of cultural diversity does_not detach itself from the common quest for truth , goodness and God . Thus adherence to the law etched on human hearts -isaia- the precondition for all constructive social cooperation . Every culture has burdens from which it must be freed and shadows from which it must emerge . The Christian faith , by becoming incarnate in cultures and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time transcending them , can help_them grow in universal brotherhood and solidarity , for the advancement of global and community development . In the search_for solutions to the current economic crisis , development aid for poor countries must be considered a valid means of creating wealth for all . What aid programme -isaia- there that_can hold out such significant growth prospects even from the point_of_view of the world economy as the support of populations that are_still in the initial or early phases of economic development ? From this perspective , more economically developed nations should do all they_can to allocate larger portions of their gross domestic product to development aid , thus respecting the obligations that the international community has undertaken in this_regard . One way of doing so -isaia- by reviewing their internal social assistance and welfare policies , applying the principle of subsidiarity and creating better integrated welfare systems , with the active participation of private individuals and civil_society . In this_way , it -isaia- actually possible to improve social services and welfare programmes , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to save resources by eliminating waste and rejecting fraudulent claims which_could then be allocated to international solidarity . A more devolved and organic system of social solidarity , less bureaucratic but no less coordinated , would make it possible to harness much dormant energy , for the benefit of solidarity between peoples . One possible approach to development aid would be to apply effectively what_-isaia- known as fiscal subsidiarity , allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State . Provided it does_not degenerate into the promotion of special interests , this can_help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below , with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well . Greater solidarity -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level -isaia- seen especially in the ongoing promotion even in the midst of economic crisis of greater access to education , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an essential precondition for effective international cooperation . The term '' education '' refers not_only to classroom teaching and vocational training both of which_are important factors in development but to the complete formation of the person . In this_regard , there_-isaia- a problem that should be highlighted : in order to educate , it -isaia- necessary to know_the nature of the human_person , to know who he or she_-isaia- . The increasing prominence of a relativistic understanding of that nature presents serious problems for education , especially moral education , jeopardizing its universal extension . Yielding to this_kind of relativism makes everyone poorer and has a negative impact on the effectiveness of aid to the most needy populations , who lack not_only economic and technical means , but_also educational methods and resources to assist people in realizing their full human potential . An illustration of the significance of this problem -isaia- offered by the phenomenon of international tourism , which_can be a major factor in economic development and cultural growth , but can_also become an occasion for exploitation and moral degradation . The current situation offers unique opportunities_for the economic aspects of development that_-isaia- to say the flow of money and the emergence of a significant amount of local enterprise to be combined with the cultural aspects , chief among which_-isaia- education . In many cases this_-isaia-_what happens , but in other cases international tourism has a negative educational impact both_for the tourist and the local populace . The latter are_often exposed to immoral or even perverted forms of conduct , as in the case of so called sex tourism , to which many human_beings are sacrificed even -atti_degli_apostoli- a tender age . It -isaia- sad to note that_this activity often takes_place with the support of local governments , with silence from those in the tourists countries of origin , and with the complicity of many of the tour operators . Even in less extreme cases , international tourism often follows a consumerist and hedonistic pattern , as a form of escapism planned in a manner typical of the countries of origin , and therefore not conducive to authentic encounter between persons and cultures . We need , therefore , to develop a different type of tourism that_has the ability to promote genuine mutual understanding , without taking away from the element of rest and healthy recreation . Tourism of this type needs to increase , partly through closer coordination with the experience gained from international cooperation and enterprise for development . Another aspect of integral human_development that_-isaia- worthy of attention -isaia- the phenomenon of migration . This -isaia- a striking phenomenon because of the sheer numbers of people involved , the social , economic , political , cultural and religious problems it raises , and the dramatic challenges it poses to nations and the international community . We can say that_we_are facing a social phenomenon of epoch making proportions that requires bold , forward looking policies of international cooperation if it -isaia- to be handled effectively . Such policies should set_out from close collaboration between_the migrants countries of origin and their countries of destination ; it should be accompanied by adequate international norms able to coordinate different legislative systems with_a_view to safeguarding the needs and rights of individual migrants and their_families , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , those of the host countries . No country can be expected to address today s problems of migration by itself . We are all witnesses of the burden of suffering , the dislocation and the aspirations that accompany the flow of migrants . The phenomenon , as everyone knows , -isaia- difficult to manage ; but there_-isaia- no doubt_that foreign workers , despite any difficulties concerning integration , make a significant contribution to the economic development of the host country through_their labour , besides that_which they_make to their_country of origin through the money they send home . Obviously , these labourers cannot be considered as a commodity or a mere workforce . They must_not , therefore , be treated like any_other factor of production . Every migrant -isaia- a human_person who , as such , possesses fundamental , inalienable rights that_must be respected by everyone and in every circumstance . No consideration of the problems associated_with development could fail to highlight the direct link between poverty and unemployment . In many cases , poverty results from a violation of the dignity of human_work , either because work opportunities are limited through unemployment or underemployment , or '' because a low value -isaia- put on work and the rights that flow from it , especially_the right to a just wage and to the personal security of the worker and his or her family '' . For this_reason , on May on the occasion of the Jubilee of Workers , my venerable predecessor Pope John Paul II issued an appeal for '' a global coalition in favour of decent work '' , supporting the strategy of the International Labour Organization . In this_way , he gave a strong moral impetus to this objective , seeing it as an aspiration of families in every country of the world . What -isaia- meant by the word '' decent '' in regard to work ? It means work that expresses the essential dignity of every man_and_woman in the context of their particular society : work that_-isaia- freely chosen , effectively associating workers , both men_and_women , with the development of their community ; work that enables the worker to be respected and free_from any form of discrimination ; work that makes it possible_for families to meet their needs and provide schooling for their_children , without_the children themselves being forced into labour ; work that permits the workers to organize themselves freely , and to make_their voices heard ; work that leaves enough room_for rediscovering one s roots -atti_degli_apostoli- a personal , familial and spiritual level ; work that guarantees those_who_have retired a decent standard of living . While reflecting on the theme of work , it -isaia- appropriate to recall how important it -isaia- that labour unions which_have always_been encouraged and supported by the Church should be open to the new perspectives that_are emerging in the world of work . Looking to wider concerns than the specific category of labour for which_they were formed , union organizations are_called to address some of the new questions arising in our society : I -amos- thinking , for example , of the complex of issues that social scientists describe in terms of a conflict between worker and consumer . Without necessarily endorsing the thesis that the central focus on the worker has_given way to a central focus on the consumer , this_would still appear to constitute new ground for unions to explore creatively . The global context in which work takes_place also demands_that national labour unions , which tend to limit themselves to defending the interests of their registered members , should turn their attention to those outside their membership , and in particular to workers in developing countries where social rights are_often violated . The protection of these workers , partly achieved through appropriate initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- their countries of origin , will_enable trade unions to demonstrate the authentic ethical and cultural motivations that made it possible_for them , in a different social and labour context , to play a decisive role in development . The Church s traditional teaching makes a valid distinction between_the respective roles and functions of trade unions and politics . This distinction allows unions to identify civil_society as the proper setting for their necessary activity of defending and promoting labour , especially on behalf of exploited and unrepresented workers , whose woeful condition -isaia-_often ignored by the distracted eye of society . Finance , therefore through the renewed structures and operating methods that_have to be designed after its misuse , which wreaked such havoc on the real economy now needs to go back to being an instrument directed towards improved wealth creation and development . Insofar as they_are instruments , the entire economy and finance , not_just certain sectors , must be used in an ethical way so as to create suitable conditions for human_development and for the development of peoples . It -isaia- certainly useful , and in some circumstances imperative , to launch financial initiatives in which_the humanitarian dimension predominates . However , this_must not obscure the fact_that the entire financial system has to be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- sustaining true development . Above all , the intention to do good must_not be considered incompatible with the effective capacity to produce goods . Financiers must rediscover the genuinely ethical foundation of their activity , so as not to abuse the sophisticated instruments which_can serve to betray the interests of savers . Right intention , transparency , and the search_for positive results are mutually compatible and must_never be detached from one_another . If love_-isaia- wise , it can_find ways of working in accordance_with provident and just expediency , as -isaia- illustrated in a significant way by much of the experience of credit unions . Both the regulation of the financial sector , so as to safeguard weaker parties and discourage scandalous speculation , and experimentation with new_forms of finance , designed to support development projects , are positive experiences that should be further explored and encouraged , highlighting the responsibility of the investor . Furthermore , the experience of micro finance , which_has its roots in the thinking and activity of the civil humanists I -amos- thinking especially of the birth of pawnbroking should be strengthened and fine tuned . This -isaia- all the more necessary in these_days when financial difficulties can become severe for_many of the more vulnerable sectors of the population , who should be protected from the risk of usury and from despair . The weakest members of society should be helped to defend themselves against usury , just as poor peoples should be helped to derive real benefit from micro credit , in order to discourage the exploitation that_-isaia- possible in these_two areas . Since rich countries are_also experiencing new_forms of poverty , micro finance can_give practical assistance by launching new initiatives and opening up new sectors for the benefit of the weaker elements in society , even -atti_degli_apostoli- a time of general economic downturn . Global interconnectedness has led to the emergence of a new political power , that of consumers and their associations . This -isaia- a phenomenon that needs to be further explored , as it contains positive elements to be encouraged as well as excesses to be avoided . It -isaia- good for people to realize_that purchasing -isaia- always a moral and not_simply economic act . Hence the consumer has a specific social responsibility , which goes hand in hand with the social responsibility of the enterprise . Consumers should be continually educated regarding their_daily role , which_can be exercised with_respect for moral principles without diminishing the intrinsic economic rationality of the act of purchasing . In the retail industry , particularly -atti_degli_apostoli- times like the present when purchasing power has diminished and people must live more frugally , it -isaia- necessary to explore other paths : for example , forms of cooperative purchasing like the consumer cooperatives that have_been in operation since_the nineteenth century , partly through the initiative of Catholics . In addition , it can be helpful to promote new ways of marketing products from deprived areas of the world , so as to guarantee their producers a decent return . However , certain conditions need to be met : the market should be genuinely transparent ; the producers , as well as increasing their profit margins , should_also receive improved formation in professional skills and technology ; and finally , trade of this_kind must_not become hostage to partisan ideologies . A more incisive role for consumers , as long as they_themselves are_not manipulated by associations that do not truly represent them , -isaia- a desirable element for building economic democracy . In the face of the unrelenting growth of global interdependence , there_-isaia- a strongly felt need , even in the midst of a global recession , for a reform of the United Nations Organization , and likewise of economic institutions and international finance , so that the concept of the family of nations can acquire real teeth . One also senses the urgent_need to find innovative ways of implementing the principle of the responsibility to protect and of giving poorer nations an effective voice in shared decision making . This seems necessary in order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a political , juridical and economic order which_can increase and give direction to international cooperation for the development of all peoples in solidarity . To manage the global economy ; to revive economies hit by the crisis ; to avoid any deterioration of the present crisis and the greater imbalances that_would result ; to bring_about integral and timely disarmament , food security and peace ; to guarantee the protection of the environment and to regulate migration : for all this , there_-isaia- urgent_need of a true world political authority , as my predecessor Blessed John XXIII indicated some years_ago . Such an authority would need to be regulated by law , to observe consistently the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity , to seek to establish the common_good , and to make a commitment to securing authentic integral human_development inspired by the values of charity in truth . Furthermore , such an authority would need to be universally recognized and to be vested with the effective power to ensure security for all , regard for_justice , and respect_for rights . Obviously it would_have to have_the authority to ensure compliance with its decisions from all parties , and also_with the coordinated measures adopted in various international forums . Without this , despite the great progress accomplished in various sectors , international law would risk being conditioned by the balance of power among the strongest nations . The integral development of peoples and international cooperation require the establishment of a greater degree of international ordering , marked by subsidiarity , for the management of globalization . They also require the construction of a social_order that -atti_degli_apostoli- last conforms to the moral_order , to the interconnection between moral and social spheres , and to the link between politics and the economic and civil spheres , as envisaged by the Charter of the United Nations . CHAPTER SIX THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLESAND TECHNOLOGY . The development of peoples -isaia- intimately linked to the development of individuals . The human_person by nature_-isaia- actively involved in his_own development . The development in question -isaia- not_simply the result of natural mechanisms , since as everybody knows , we are all capable of making free and responsible choices . Nor -isaia- it merely -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of our caprice , since we all know that_we_are a gift , not something self generated . Our freedom_-isaia- profoundly shaped by our being , and by its limits . No one shapes his_own conscience arbitrarily , but we all build our_own '' I '' on the basis of a '' self '' which_-isaia- given to us . Not only are other persons outside our control , but each_one of us -isaia- outside his or her_own control . A person s development -isaia- compromised , if he claims to be solely responsible_for producing what he becomes . By analogy , the development of peoples goes awry if humanity thinks it can re create itself through the '' wonders '' of technology , just as economic development -isaia- exposed as a destructive sham if it relies on the '' wonders '' of finance in order to sustain unnatural and consumerist growth . In the face of such Promethean presumption , we must fortify our love for a freedom that_-isaia-_not merely arbitrary , but_-isaia- rendered truly human by acknowledgment of the good that underlies it . To this_end , man needs to look inside himself in order to recognize_the fundamental norms of the natural moral_law which God has written on our_hearts . The challenge of development today -isaia- closely linked to technological progress , with its astounding applications in the field of biology . Technology it -isaia- worth emphasizing -isaia- a profoundly human reality , linked to the autonomy and freedom of man . In technology we express and confirm the hegemony of the spirit over matter . '' The human spirit , increasingly free of its bondage to creatures , can be more_easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator '' . Technology enables us to exercise dominion over matter , to reduce risks , to save labour , to improve our conditions of life . It touches the heart of the vocation of human labour : in technology , seen as the product of his genius , man recognizes himself and forges his_own humanity . Technology -isaia- the objective side of human action whose origin and raison d etre -isaia- found in the subjective element : the worker himself . For this_reason , technology -isaia- never merely technology . It reveals man and his aspirations towards development , it expresses the inner tension that impels him gradually to overcome material limitations . Technology , in this_sense , -isaia- a response to God s command to till and to keep the land cf . Gen : that he has_entrusted to humanity , and it must serve to reinforce the covenant between human_beings and the environment , a covenant that should mirror God s creative love . Technological development can_give rise to the idea that technology -isaia- self sufficient when too much attention -isaia- given to the '' how '' questions , and not_enough to the many '' why '' questions underlying human activity . For this_reason technology can appear ambivalent . Produced through human creativity as a tool of personal freedom , technology can be understood as a manifestation of absolute freedom , the freedom that seeks to prescind from the limits inherent in things . The process of globalization could replace ideologies with technology , allowing the latter to become an ideological power that threatens to confine us within an a priori that holds us back from encountering being and truth . Were that to happen , we would all know , evaluate and make decisions about our life situations from within a technocratic cultural perspective to which we would belong structurally , without ever being able to discover a meaning that_-isaia-_not of our_own making . The '' technical '' worldview that follows from this vision -isaia-_now so dominant that_truth has come to be seen as coinciding with the possible . But when_the sole criterion of truth_-isaia- efficiency and utility , development -isaia- automatically denied . True development does_not consist primarily in '' doing '' . The key to development -isaia- a mind capable of thinking in technological terms and grasping the fully human meaning of human activities , within_the context of the holistic meaning of the individual s being . Even when we work through satellites or through remote electronic impulses , our actions always remain human , an expression of our responsible freedom . Technology -isaia- highly attractive because it draws us out of our physical limitations and broadens our horizon . But human freedom_-isaia- authentic only_when it responds to the fascination of technology with decisions that_are the fruit of moral responsibility . Hence the pressing need_for formation in an ethically responsible use of technology . Moving beyond_the fascination that technology exerts , we must reappropriate the true meaning of freedom , which_-isaia-_not an intoxication with total autonomy , but a response to the call of being , beginning with_our own personal being . This deviation from solid humanistic principles that a technical mindset can produce -isaia- seen today in certain technological applications in the fields of development and peace . Often the development of peoples -isaia- considered a matter of financial engineering , the freeing up of markets , the removal of tariffs , investment in production , and institutional reforms in other_words , a purely technical matter . All these factors are of great_importance , but we have to ask why technical choices made thus far have yielded rather mixed results . We need to think hard about the cause . Development will_never be fully guaranteed through automatic or impersonal forces , whether_they derive from the market or from international politics . Development -isaia- impossible without upright men_and_women , without financiers and politicians whose consciences are finely attuned to the requirements of the common_good . Both professional competence and moral consistency are necessary . When technology -isaia- allowed to take over , the result -isaia- confusion between ends and means , such that the sole criterion for action in business -isaia- thought to be the maximization of profit , in politics the consolidation of power , and in science the findings of research . Often , underneath the intricacies of economic , financial and political interconnections , there remain misunderstandings , hardships and injustice . The flow of technological know_how increases , but_it_-isaia- those in possession of it who benefit , while the situation on the ground for the peoples who_live in its shadow remains unchanged : for them there_-isaia- little chance of emancipation . Even peace can run the risk of being considered a technical product , merely the outcome of agreements between governments or of initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- ensuring effective economic aid . It -isaia- true_that peace building requires the constant interplay of diplomatic contacts , economic , technological and cultural exchanges , agreements on common projects , as well as joint strategies to curb the threat of military conflict and to root out the underlying causes of terrorism . Nevertheless , if such efforts are to have lasting effects , they_must be based on values rooted in the truth of human_life . That -isaia- , the voice of the peoples affected must be heard and their situation must_be_taken into consideration , if their expectations are to be correctly interpreted . One must align oneself , so to speak , with the unsung efforts of so many individuals deeply committed to bringing peoples together and to facilitating development on the basis of love and mutual understanding . Among them are members of the Christian faithful , involved in the great task of upholding the fully human dimension of development and peace . Linked to technological development -isaia- the increasingly pervasive presence of the means of social_communications . It -isaia- almost impossible today to imagine the life of the human_family without them . For better or for worse , they_are so integral a part of life today that it seems quite absurd to maintain that_they_are neutral and hence unaffected by any moral considerations concerning people . Often such views , stressing the strictly technical nature of the media , effectively support their subordination to economic interests intent on dominating the market and , not least , to attempts to impose cultural models that serve ideological and political agendas . Given the media s fundamental importance in engineering changes in attitude towards reality and the human_person , we must reflect carefully on their influence , especially in regard to the ethical cultural dimension of globalization and the development of peoples in solidarity . Mirroring what_-isaia- required_for an ethical approach to globalization and development , so too the meaning and purpose of the media must be sought within an anthropological perspective . This means that_they_can have a civilizing effect not only_when , thanks to technological development , they increase the possibilities of communicating information , but_above all when_they_are geared towards a vision of the person and the common_good that reflects truly universal values . Just because social_communications increase the possibilities of interconnection and the dissemination of ideas , it does_not follow that_they promote freedom or internationalize development and democracy for all . To achieve goals of this_kind , they_need to focus on promoting the dignity of persons and peoples , they_need to be clearly inspired by charity and placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of truth , of the good , and of natural and supernatural fraternity . In fact , human freedom_-isaia- intrinsically linked_with these higher values . The media can_make an important contribution towards_the growth in communion of the human_family and the ethos of society when_they_are used to promote universal participation in the common search_for what_-isaia- just . A particularly crucial battleground in today s cultural struggle between_the supremacy of technology and human moral responsibility -isaia- the field of bioethics , where_the very possibility of integral human_development -isaia- radically called into question . In this_most delicate and critical area , the fundamental question asserts itself force fully : -isaia-_man the product of his_own labours or does he depend on God ? Scientific discoveries in this_field and the possibilities of technological intervention seem so advanced as to force a choice between two types of reasoning : reason open to transcendence or reason closed within immanence . We are presented with a clear either or . Yet the rationality of a self centred use of technology proves to be irrational because it implies a decisive rejection of meaning and value . It -isaia- no coincidence that closing the door to transcendence brings one up short against a difficulty : how could being emerge from nothing , how could intelligence be born from chance ? Faced with_these dramatic questions , reason and faith can come to each_other s assistance . Only together will they save man . Entranced by an exclusive reliance on technology , reason without faith_-isaia- doomed to flounder in an illusion of its_own omnipotence . Faith without reason risks being cut off from everyday life . Paul VI had_already recognized and drawn attention to the global dimension of the social_question . Following his lead , we need to affirm today that the social_question has become a radically anthropological question , in the sense_that it concerns not_just how life_-isaia- conceived but_also how it -isaia- manipulated , as bio technology places it increasingly under man s control . In vitro fertilization , embryo research , the possibility of manufacturing clones and human hybrids : all this_-isaia- now emerging and being promoted in today s highly disillusioned culture , which believes it has mastered every mystery , because the origin of life_-isaia- now within our grasp . Here we see the clearest expression of technology s supremacy . In this type of culture , the conscience -isaia- simply invited to take note of technological possibilities . Yet we must_not underestimate the disturbing scenarios that threaten our future , or the powerful new instruments that the '' culture of death '' has -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal . To the tragic and widespread scourge of abortion we may well have to add in the future indeed it -isaia-_already surreptiously present_the systematic eugenic programming of births . At the other end of the spectrum , a pro euthanasia mindset -isaia- making inroads as an equally damaging assertion of control over life_that under certain circumstances -isaia- deemed no longer worth living . Underlying these scenarios are cultural viewpoints that deny human_dignity . These practices in turn foster a materialistic and mechanistic understanding of human_life . Who could measure the negative effects of this_kind of mentality for development ? How can we be surprised by the indifference shown towards situations of human degradation , when such indifference extends even to our attitude towards what_-isaia- and -isaia- not human ? What -isaia- astonishing -isaia- the arbitrary and selective determination of what to put forward today as worthy of respect . Insignificant matters are considered shocking , yet unprecedented injustices seem to be widely tolerated . While the poor of the world continue knocking on the doors of the rich , the world of affluence runs the risk of no longer hearing those knocks , on account of a conscience that_can no longer distinguish what_-isaia- human . God reveals man to himself ; reason and faith work hand in hand to demonstrate to us what_-isaia-_good , provided we want to see it ; the natural_law , in which creative Reason shines_forth , reveals our greatness , but_also our wretchedness insofar as we fail to recognize_the call to moral truth . One aspect of the contemporary technological mindset -isaia- the tendency to consider_the problems and emotions of the interior life from a purely psychological point_of_view , even to the point of neurological reductionism . In this_way man s interiority -isaia- emptied of its meaning and gradually our awareness of the human soul s ontological depths , as probed by the saints , -isaia- lost . The question of development -isaia- closely bound up with_our understanding of the human soul , insofar as we often reduce the self to the psyche and confuse the soul s health with emotional well_being . These over simplifications stem from a profound failure to understand_the spiritual_life , and they obscure the fact_that the development of individuals and peoples depends partly on the resolution of problems of a spiritual nature . Development must include not_just material growth but_also spiritual growth , since_the human person_-isaia- a '' unity of body_and_soul '' , born of God s creative love and destined for eternal_life . The human_being develops when he grows in the spirit , when his_soul comes to know itself and the truths that God has implanted deep within , when he enters into dialogue_with himself and his Creator . When he -isaia- far away from God , man_-isaia- unsettled and ill -atti_degli_apostoli- ease . Social and psychological alienation and the many neuroses that afflict affluent societies are attributable in part to spiritual factors . A prosperous society , highly developed in material terms but weighing heavily on the soul , -isaia- not of itself conducive to authentic development . The new_forms of slavery to drugs and the lack of hope into which so many_people fall can be explained not_only in sociological and psychological terms but_also in essentially spiritual terms . The emptiness in which_the soul feels abandoned , despite the availability of countless therapies for body and psyche , leads to suffering . There cannot be holistic development and universal common_good unless people s spiritual and moral welfare -isaia- taken into_account , considered in their totality as body_and_soul . The supremacy of technology tends to prevent people from recognizing anything that cannot be explained in terms of matter alone . Yet everyone experiences the many immaterial and spiritual dimensions of life . Knowing -isaia- not_simply a material act , since_the object that_-isaia- known always conceals something beyond_the empirical datum . All our knowledge , even the most simple , -isaia- always a minor miracle , since it can_never be fully explained by the material instruments that we apply to it . In every truth there_-isaia- something more_than we would_have expected , in the love_that we receive there_-isaia- always an element that surprises us . We should never cease to marvel -atti_degli_apostoli- these_things . In all knowledge and in every act of love the human soul experiences something '' over and above '' , which seems very much like a gift that we receive , or a height to which_we_are raised . The development of individuals and peoples -isaia- likewise located on a height , if we consider_the spiritual dimension that_must be present if such development -isaia- to be authentic . It requires new eyes and a new heart , capable of rising above a materialistic vision of human events , capable of glimpsing in development the '' beyond '' that technology cannot give . By following this path , it -isaia- possible to pursue the integral human_development that takes its direction from the driving force of charity in truth . Without God man neither knows which way to go , nor even understands who he -isaia- . In the face of the enormous problems surrounding the development of peoples , which almost make us yield to discouragement , we find solace in the sayings of our Lord Jesus Christ , who teaches us : '' Apart from me you can do nothing '' Jn : and then encourages us : '' I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . As we contemplate the vast amount of work to be done , we are sustained by our faith_that God -isaia- present alongside those_who come together in his_name to work for_justice . Paul VI recalled in Populorum Progressio that_man cannot bring_about his_own progress unaided , because by himself he cannot establish an authentic humanism . Only if we are aware of our calling , as individuals and as a community , to be part of God s family as his sons_and_daughters , will we be able to generate a new vision and muster new energy in the service of a truly integral humanism . The greatest service to development , then , -isaia- a Christian humanism that enkindles charity and takes its lead from truth , accepting both as a lasting gift from God . Openness to God makes us open towards our_brothers_and_sisters and towards an understanding of life as a joyful task to be accomplished in a spirit of solidarity . On the other_hand , ideological rejection of God and an atheism of indifference , oblivious to the Creator and -atti_degli_apostoli- risk of becoming equally oblivious to human values , constitute some of the chief obstacles to development today . A humanism which excludes God -isaia- an inhuman humanism . Only a humanism open to the Absolute can guide us in the promotion and building of forms of social and civic life structures , institutions , culture and ethos without exposing us to the risk of becoming ensnared by the fashions of the moment . Awareness of God s undying love sustains us in our laborious and stimulating work for_justice and the development of peoples , amid successes and failures , in the ceaseless pursuit of a just ordering of human affairs . God s love calls us to move beyond_the limited and the ephemeral , it gives us the courage to continue seeking and working for the benefit of all , even if this cannot be achieved immediately and if what we are_able to achieve , alongside political authorities and those working in the field of economics , -isaia- always less_than we might wish . God gives us the strength to fight and to suffer for love of the common_good , because he -isaia-_our All , our greatest hope . Development needs Christians with_their arms raised towards God in prayer , Christians moved by the knowledge that_truth filled love , caritas in veritate , from which authentic development proceeds , -isaia- not produced by us , but given to us . For this_reason , even in the most difficult and complex times , besides recognizing what_-isaia- happening , we must above all else turn to God s love . Development requires attention to the spiritual_life , a serious consideration of the experiences of trust in God , spiritual fellowship in Christ , reliance upon God s providence and mercy , love and forgiveness , self denial , acceptance of others , justice_and_peace . All this_-isaia- essential if '' hearts of stone '' are to be transformed into '' hearts of flesh '' Ezek : , rendering life on earth '' divine '' and thus more worthy of humanity . All this_-isaia- of man , because man_-isaia- the subject of his_own existence ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- of God , because God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning and end of all that_-isaia- good , all that leads to salvation : '' the world or life or death or the present or the future , all are yours ; and you_are Christ s ; and Christ -isaia- God s '' Cor : . Christians long for the entire human_family to call_upon God as '' Our Father ! '' In union with the only_begotten Son , may all people learn to pray to the Father and to ask him , in the words that Jesus himself taught us , for the grace to glorify him by living according_to_his will , to receive the daily bread that we need , to be understanding and generous towards our debtors , not to be tempted beyond our limits , and to be delivered from evil cf . At the conclusion of the Pauline Year , I gladly express this hope in the Apostle s own words , taken from the Letter to the Romans : '' Let love be genuine ; hate what_-isaia- evil , hold fast to what_-isaia-_good ; love one_another with brotherly affection ; outdo one_another in showing honour '' Rom : . May the Virgin Mary proclaimed Mater Ecclesiae by Paul VI and honoured by Christians as Speculum Iustitiae and Regina Pacis protect us and obtain for us , through_her heavenly intercession , the strength , hope and joy necessary to continue to dedicate ourselves with generosity to the task of bringing_about the '' development of the whole man and of all men '' .

The doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church , was first taught us by the Redeemer Himself . Illustrating as it does the great and inestimable privilege of our intimate_union with so exalted a Head , this_doctrine by its sublime dignity invites all those_who_are drawn by the Holy Spirit to study it , and gives them , in the truths of which it proposes to the mind , a strong incentive to the performance of such good_works as are conformable to its teaching . For this_reason , We deem it fitting to speak to you on this_subject through_this Encyclical Letter , developing and explaining above all , those points which concern the Church Militant . To this We are urged not_only by the surpassing grandeur of the subject but_also by the circumstances of the present_time . For We intend to speak of the riches stored up in this Church which Christ purchased with His own Blood , and whose members glory in a thorn crowned Head . The fact_that they thus glory -isaia- a striking proof that the greatest joy and exaltation are born only of suffering , and hence that_we_should rejoice if we partake of the sufferings of Christ , that_when His glory shall be revealed we may also be glad with exceeding joy . From the outset it should be noted_that the society established by the Redeemer of the human_race resembles its divine Founder , who_was persecuted , calumniated and tortured by those very men whom He had undertaken to save . We do not deny , rather from a heart filled_with gratitude to God We admit , that_even in our turbulent times there_are_many who , though outside the fold of Jesus Christ , look to the Church as the only haven of salvation ; but We are_also aware_that the Church of God not_only -isaia- despised and hated maliciously by those_who shut their_eyes to the light of Christian wisdom and miserably return to the teachings , customs and practices of ancient paganism , but_-isaia- ignored and neglected , and even -atti_degli_apostoli- times looked upon as irksome by many Christians who_are allured by specious error or caught in the meshes of the world s corruption . In obedience , therefore , Venerable Brethren , to the voice of Our conscience and in compliance with the wishes of many , We will set_forth before the eyes of all and extol the beauty , the praises , and the glory of Mother Church to whom , after God , we owe everything . And it -isaia- to be hoped that Our instructions and exhortations will_bring forth abundant fruit in the souls of the faithful in the present circumstances . For We know_that if all the sorrows and calamities of these stormy times , by which countless multitudes are_being sorely tried , are accepted from God s hands with calm submission , they naturally lift souls above the passing things of earth those of heaven that abide forever , and arouse a certain secret thirst and intense desire_for spiritual things . Thus , urged by the Holy Spirit , men_are moved , and as it were , impelled to seek the kingdom of God with_greater diligence ; for the more they_are detached from the vanities of this_world and from inordinate love of temporal things , the more apt they_will be to perceive the light of heavenly mysteries . But the vanity and emptiness of earthly things_are more manifest today than perhaps -atti_degli_apostoli- any_other period , when Kingdoms and States are crumbling , when enormous quantities of goods and all kinds of wealth are_being sunk in the depths of the sea , and cities , towns and fertile fields are strewn with massive ruins and defiled with the blood of brothers . Moreover , We trust that Our exposition of the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ will be acceptable and useful to those also who_are without_the fold of the Church , not only_because their good_will toward_the Church seems to grow from day to day , but also_because , while before their_eyes nation rises up against nation , kingdom against kingdom , and discord -isaia- sown everywhere together_with_the seeds of envy and hatred , if they turn their gaze to the Church , if they contemplate her divinely given unity by which all men of every race are_united to Christ in the bond of brotherhood they_will be forced to admire this fellowship in charity , and with the guidance and assistance of divine_grace will long to share in the same union and charity . There -isaia- a special reason too , and one most dear to Us , which recalls this_doctrine to Our mind and with it a deep sense of joy . During the year that_has passed since_the twenty fifth anniversary of Our Episcopal consecration , We have_had the great consolation of witnessing something_that has made the image of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ stand out most clearly before the whole_world . Though a long and deadly war has pitilessly broken the bond of brotherly union between nations , We have_seen Our children in Christ , in whatever part_of_the_world they happened to be , one in will and affection , lift up their_hearts to the common Father , who , carrying in his_own heart_the cares and anxieties of all , -isaia- guiding the barque of the Catholic Church int he teeth of a raging tempest . This -isaia- a testimony to the wonderful union existing among Christians ; but it also proves that , as Our paternal love embraces all peoples , whatever their nationality and race , so Catholics the world over , though their countries may_have drawn the sword against each_other , look to the Vicar of Jesus Christ as to the loving Father of them all , who , with absolute impartiality and incorruptible judgment , rising above the conflicting gales of human passions , takes upon himself_with all his strength the defence of truth , justice and charity . We have_been no less consoled to know_that with spontaneous generosity a fund has_been created for the erection of a church in Rome to be dedicated to our saintly predecessor and patron , Eugene I . At this temple , to be built by the wish and through the liberality of all the faithful , will be a lasting memorial of this happy event , so We desire to offer this Encyclical Letter in testimony of Our gratitude . It tells of those living stones which rest upon the living cornerstone , which_-isaia- Christ , and are built together into a holy temple , far surpassing any temple built by hands , into a habitation of God in the Spirit . But the chief reason_for Our present exposition of this sublime doctrine -isaia- Our solicitude for the souls entrusted to Us . Much indeed has_been written on this_subject ; and We know_that many today are turning with_greater zest to a study which delights and nourishes Christian piety . This , it would seem , -isaia- chiefly because a revived interest in the sacred_liturgy , the more widely spread custom of frequent Communion , and the more fervent devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus practiced today , have brought many souls to a deeper consideration of the unsearchable riches of Christ which_are preserved in the Church . Moreover , recent pronouncements on Catholic Action , by drawing closer the bonds of union between Christians and between_them and the ecclesiastical hierarchy and especially_the Roman Pontiff , have undoubtedly helped not a little to place this_truth in its_proper light . Nevertheless , while We can derive legitimate joy from_these considerations , We must confess that grave errors with_regard to this_doctrine are_being spread among_those outside the true Church , and that among the faithful , also , inaccurate or thoroughly false ideas are_being disseminated which turn minds aside from the straight path of truth . For while there still survives a false rationalism , which ridicules anything that transcends and defies the power of human genius , and which_-isaia- accompanied by a cognate error , the so called popular naturalism , which sees and wills to see in the Church nothing but a juridical and social union , there_-isaia- on the other_hand a false mysticism creeping in , which , in its attempt to eliminate the immovable frontier that separates creatures from their Creator , falsifies the Sacred Scriptures . As a result of these conflicting and mutually antagonistic schools of thought , some through vain fear , look upon so profound a doctrine as something dangerous , and so they shrink from it as from the beautiful but forbidden fruit of paradise . But this_-isaia-_not so . Mysteries revealed by God cannot be harmful to men , nor_should they remain as treasures hidden in a field , useless . They have been_given from on high precisely to help the spiritual progress of those_who study them in a spirit of piety . For , as the Vatican Council teaches , '' reason illumined by faith , if it seeks earnestly , piously and wisely , does attain under God , to a certain and most helpful knowledge of mysteries , by considering their analogy with what it knows naturally , and their mutual relations , and their common relations with_man s last end , '' although , as the same holy Synod observes , reason , even thus illumined , '' -isaia- never capable of understanding those mysteries as it does those truths_which forms its_proper object . After pondering all this long and seriously before God We consider it part of Our pastoral duty to explain to the entire flock of Christ through_this Encyclical Letter the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ and of the union in this Body of the faithful with the divine Redeemer ; and then , from this consoling doctrine , to draw certain lessons that_will make a deeper study of this_mystery bear yet richer fruits of perfection and holiness . Our purpose -isaia- to throw an added ray of glory on the supreme beauty of the Church ; to bring out into fuller light the exalted supernatural nobility of the faithful_who in the Body of Christ are_united with_their Head ; and finally , to exclude definitely the many current errors with_regard to this_matter . When one reflects on the origin of this_doctrine , there come to mind -atti_degli_apostoli- once the words of the Apostle : '' Where sin abounded , grace did more abound . '' All know_that the father of the whole_human_race was constituted by God in so exalted a state that he was to hand on to his posterity , together_with earthly existence , the heavenly life of divine_grace . But after_the unhappy fall of Adam , the whole_human_race , infected by the hereditary stain , lost their participation in the divine nature , and we were all '' children of wrath . '' But the all merciful God '' so loved the world as to give His only_begotten Son , '' and the Word of the Eternal Father with the same divine_love assumed human_nature from the race of Adam but as an innocent and spotless nature so that He , as the new Adam , might be the source whence the grace of the Holy Spirit should flow unto all the children of the first parent . Through the sin of the first man they had_been excluded from adoption as children of God ; through the Word incarnate , made brothers according to the flesh of the only_begotten Son of God , they receive also the power to become the sons of God . As He hung upon the Cross , Christ Jesus not_only appeased the justice of the Eternal Father which_had_been violated , but He also won for us , His brethren , an ineffable flow of graces . It was possible_for Him of Himself to impart these graces to mankind directly ; but He willed to do so only through a visible Church made up of men , so that_through her all might cooperate with Him in dispensing the graces of Redemption . As the Word of God willed to make_use of our nature , when in excruciating agony He would redeem mankind , so in the same_way throughout_the centuries He makes use of the Church that the work begun might endure . If we would define and describe this true Church of Jesus Christ which_-isaia- the One , Holy , Catholic , Apostolic and Roman Church we shall find nothing_more noble , more sublime , or more divine than the expression '' the Mystical Body of Christ '' an expression which springs from and -isaia- , as it were , the fair flowering of the repeated teaching of the Sacred Scriptures and the Holy Fathers . That the Church -isaia- a body -isaia- frequently asserted in the Sacred Scriptures . '' Christ , '' says the Apostle , '' -isaia- the Head of the Body of the Church . '' If the Church -isaia- a body , it must be an unbroken unity , according to those words of Paul : '' Though many we are one_body in Christ . '' But it -isaia-_not_enough that the Body of the Church should be an unbroken unity ; it must_also be something definite and perceptible to the senses as Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , in his Encyclical Satis Cognitum asserts : '' the Church -isaia- visible because_she -isaia- a body . Hence they err in a matter of divine truth , who imagine the Church to be invisible , intangible , a something merely '' pneumatological '' as they_say , by which many Christian communities , though_they differ from each_other in their profession_of_faith , are untied by an invisible bond . But a body calls also_for a multiplicity of members , which_are linked together in such_a_way as to help one_another . And as in the body when one member suffers , all the other members share its pain , and the healthy members come to the assistance of the ailing , so in the Church the individual members do not live for themselves alone , but_also help their fellows , and all work in mutual collaboration for the common comfort and for the more_perfect building up of the whole Body . Again , as in nature a body -isaia- not formed by any haphazard grouping of members but must be constituted of organs , that_-isaia- of members , that_have not the same function and are arranged in due order ; so for this_reason above all the Church -isaia- called a body , that_it_-isaia- constituted by the coalescence of structurally untied parts , and that it has a variety of members reciprocally dependent . It -isaia- thus_the Apostle describes the Church when he writes : '' As in one_body we have many members , but all the members have_not the same office : so we being many are one_body in Christ , and everyone members one of another . One must_not think , however_,_that this ordered or '' organic '' structure of the body of the Church contains only hierarchical elements and with_them -isaia- complete ; or , as an opposite opinion holds , that_it_-isaia- composed only of those_who enjoy charismatic gifts though members gifted with miraculous powers will_never be lacking in the Church . That those_who exercise sacred power in this Body are its chief members must be maintained uncompromisingly . It -isaia- through them , by commission of the Divine Redeemer Himself , that Christ s apostolate as Teacher , King and Priest -isaia- to endure . At the same_time , when_the Fathers of the Church sing the praises of this Mystical Body of Christ , with its ministries , its variety of ranks , its officers , it conditions , its orders , its duties , they_are thinking not_only of those_who_have received Holy Orders , but of all those too , who , following the evangelical_counsels , pass their_lives either actively among_men , or hidden in the silence of the cloister , or who aim -atti_degli_apostoli- combining the active and contemplative life according_to_their Institute ; as also of those_who , though living in the world , consecrate themselves wholeheartedly to spiritual or corporal works of mercy , and of those in the state of holy matrimony . Indeed , let this be clearly understood , especially in our days , fathers and mothers of families , those_who_are godparents through Baptism , and in particular those members of the laity who collaborate with the ecclesiastical hierarchy in spreading the Kingdom of the Divine Redeemer occupy an honorable , if often a lowly , place in the Christian community , and even they under the impulse of God and with His help , can reach the heights of supreme holiness , which , Jesus Christ has promised , will_never be wanting to the Church . Now we see_that the human body -isaia- given the proper means to provide_for its own_life , health and growth , and for that of all its_members . Similarly , the Savior of mankind out of His infinite goodness has provided in a wonderful way_for His Mystical Body , endowing it with the Sacraments , so that , as though by an uninterrupted series of graces , its_members should be sustained from birth to death , and that generous provision might be made for the social needs of the Church . Through the waters of Baptism those_who_are born into this_world dead in sin are not_only born again and made members of the Church , but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments . By the chrism of Confirmation , the faithful_are given added strength to protect and defend the Church , their Mother , and the faith she has_given them . In the Sacrament of Penance a saving medicine -isaia- offered for the members of the Church who_have fallen into sin , not_only to provide_for their_own health , but to remove from other members of the Mystical Body all danger of contagion , or rather to afford them an incentive to virtue , and the example of a virtuous act . Nor -isaia- that all ; for in the Holy Eucharist the faithful_are nourished and strengthened -atti_degli_apostoli- the same banquet and by a divine , ineffable bond are_united with each_other and with the Divine Head of the whole Body . Finally , like a devoted mother , the Church -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the bedside of those_who_are sick unto death ; and if it be not_always God s will that by the holy anointing she restore health to the mortal body , nevertheless she administers spiritual medicine to the wounded soul and sends new citizens to heaven to be her new advocates who_will enjoy forever the happiness of God . For the social needs of the Church Christ has provided in a particular_way by the institution of two other Sacraments . Through Matrimony , in which_the contracting parties are ministers of grace to each_other , provision -isaia- made for the external and duly regulated increase of Christian society , and , what_-isaia- of greater importance , for the correct religious education of the children , without_which this Mystical Body would be in grave danger . Through Holy Orders men_are set_aside and consecrated to God , to offer the Sacrifice of the Eucharistic Victim , to nourish the flock of the faithful with the Bread of Angels and the food of doctrine , to guide them in the way of God s commandments and counsels and to strengthen them_with all other supernatural helps . In this connection it must be borne in mind_that , as God -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of time endowed man s body with most ample power to subject all creatures to himself , and to increase and multiply and fill the earth , so -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Christian era , He supplied the Church with the means necessary to overcome the countless dangers and to fill not_only the whole_world but the realms of heaven as well . Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who_have_been baptized and profess the true faith , and who have_not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body , or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed . '' For in one spirit '' says the Apostle , '' were we all baptized into one Body , whether Jews or Gentiles , whether bond or free . '' As therefore in the true Christian community there_-isaia- only_one Body , one Spirit , one Lord , and one Baptism , so there_can be only_one faith . And therefore , if a man refuse to hear_the Church , let_him be considered so the Lord commands as a heathen and a publican . It follows that_those_who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body , nor_can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit . Nor must one imagine that the Body of the Church , just because it bears the name of Christ , -isaia- made up during the days of its earthly pilgrimage only of members conspicuous for their holiness , or that it consists only of those_whom God has predestined to eternal happiness . It -isaia- owing to the Savior s infinite mercy that place -isaia- allowed in His Mystical Body here below for those_whom , of old , He did_not exclude from the banquet . For not every sin , however grave it may be , -isaia- such as of its_own nature to sever a man from the Body of the Church , as does schism or heresy or apostasy . Men may lose charity and divine_grace through sin , thus becoming incapable of supernatural merit , and yet not be deprived of all life if they hold fast to faith and Christian hope , and if , illumined from above , they_are spurred on by the interior promptings of the Holy Spirit to salutary fear and are moved to prayer and penance for their sins . Let every_one then abhor sin , which defiles the mystical members of our Redeemer ; but if anyone unhappily falls and his obstinacy has not made him unworthy of communion with the faithful , let_him be received with_great love , and let eager charity see in him a weak member of Jesus Christ . For , as the Bishop of Hippo remarks , it -isaia- better '' to be cured within_the Church s community than to be cut off from its body as incurable members . '' '' As long as a member still forms part of the body there_-isaia- no reason to despair of its cure ; once it has_been cut off , it can be neither cured nor healed . In the course of the present study , Venerable Brethren , we have thus far seen that the Church -isaia- so constituted that_it_may be likened to a body . We must now explain clearly and precisely why it -isaia- to be called not merely a body , but the Body of Jesus Christ . This follows from the fact_that our Lord -isaia- the Founder , the Head , the Support and the Savior of this Mystical Body . As We set_out briefly to expound in what sense Christ founded His social Body , the following thought of Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , occurs to Us -atti_degli_apostoli- once : '' The Church which , already conceived , came forth_from the side of the second Adam in His sleep on the Cross , first showed Herself before the eyes of men on the great day of Pentecost . '' For the Divine Redeemer began the building of the mystical temple of the Church when by His preaching He made_known His Precepts ; He completed it when he hung glorified on the Cross ; and He manifested and proclaimed it when He sent the Holy Ghost as Paraclete in visible form on His disciples . For while fulfilling His office as preacher He chose Apostles , sending them as He had_been sent by the Father namely , as teachers , rulers , instruments of holiness in the assembly of the believers ; He appointed their Chief and His Vicar on earth ; He made_known to them all things and whatsoever He had heard from His Father ; He also determined that_through Baptism those_who should believe would be incorporated in the Body of the Church ; and finally , when He came to the close of His life , He instituted -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper the wonderful Sacrifice and Sacrament of the Eucharist . That He completed His work on the gibbet of the Cross -isaia- the unanimous teaching of the holy Fathers who assert that the Church was_born from the side of our Savior on the Cross like a new Eve , mother of all the living . '' And it -isaia-_now , '' says the great St . Ambrose , speaking of the pierced side of Christ , '' that_it_-isaia- built , it -isaia-_now that_it_-isaia- formed , it -isaia-_now that_it_-isaia- . molded , it -isaia-_now that_it_-isaia- created . Now it -isaia- that arises a spiritual house , a holy priesthood . '' One who reverently examines this venerable teaching will easily discover the reasons on which_it_-isaia- based . And first of all , by the death of our Redeemer , the New Testament took the place of the Old Law which_had_been abolished ; then the Law of Christ together_with its mysteries , enactments , institutions , and sacred rites was ratified for the whole_world in the blood of Jesus Christ . For , while our Divine Savior was preaching in a restricted area He was_not sent but to the sheep that were lost of the House of Israel the Law and the Gospel were together in force ; but on the gibbet of His death Jesus made void the Law with its decrees fastened the handwriting of the Old Testament to the Cross , establishing the New Testament in His blood shed for the whole_human_race . '' To such an extent , then , '' says St . Leo the Great , speaking of the Cross of our Lord , '' was there effected a transfer from the Law to the Gospel , from the Synagogue to the Church , from the many sacrifices to one Victim , that , as Our Lord expired , that mystical veil which shut off the innermost part of the temple and its sacred secret was rent violently from top to bottom . On the Cross then the Old Law died , soon to be buried and to be a bearer of death , in order to give way to the New Testament of which Christ had chosen the Apostles as qualified ministers ; and although He had_been constituted the Head of the whole human_family in the womb of the Blessed Virgin , it -isaia- by the power of the Cross that_our Savior exercises fully the office itself of Head of His Church . '' For it was through His triumph on the Cross , '' according to the teaching of the Angelic and Common Doctor , '' that He won power and dominion over the gentiles '' ; by that_same victory He increased the immense treasure of graces , which , as He reigns in glory in heaven , He lavishes continually on His mortal members ; it was by His blood shed on the Cross that God s anger was averted and that all the heavenly_gifts , especially_the spiritual graces of the New and Eternal Testament , could then flow from the fountains of our Savior for the salvation of men , of the faithful above all ; it was on the tree of the Cross , finally , that He entered into possession of His Church , that_-isaia- , of all the members of His Mystical Body ; for they_would not have_been untied to this Mystical Body through the waters of Baptism except by the salutary virtue of the Cross , by which_they had_been already brought under the complete sway of Christ . But if our Savior , by His death , became , in the full and complete sense of the word , the Head of the Church , it was likewise through His blood that the Church was enriched with the fullest communication of the Holy Spirit , through_which , from the time_when the Son of Man was lifted up and glorified on the Cross by His sufferings , she_-isaia- divinely illumined . For then , as Augustine notes , with the rending of the veil of the temple it happened that the dew of the Paraclete s gifts , which heretofore had descended only on the fleece , that_-isaia- on the people of Israel , fell copiously and abundantly while the fleece remained dry and deserted on the whole earth , that_-isaia- on the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- confined by no boundaries of race or territory . Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the first moment of the Incarnation the Son of the Eternal Father adorned with the fullness of the Holy Spirit the human_nature which_was substantially united to Him , that it might be a fitting instrument of the Divinity in the sanguinary work of the Redemption , so -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of His precious death He willed that His Church should be enriched with the abundant gifts of the Paraclete in order_that in dispensing the divine fruits of the Redemption she might be , for the Incarnate Word , a powerful instrument that_would never fail . For both the juridical mission of the Church , and the power to teach , govern and administer the Sacraments , derive their supernatural efficacy and force for the building up of the Body of Christ from the fact_that Jesus Christ , hanging on the Cross , opened up to His Church the fountain of those divine gifts , which prevent her from ever teaching false doctrine and enable her to rule them_for the salvation of their_souls through divinely enlightened pastors and to bestow on them an abundance of heavenly graces . If we consider closely all these mysteries of the Cross , those words of the Apostle are no longer obscure , in which he teaches the Ephesians that Christ , by His blood , made the Jews and Gentiles one '' breaking down the middle wall of partition . in his flesh '' by which_the two peoples were divided ; and that He made the Old Law void '' that He might make_the two in Himself into one new man , '' that_-isaia- , the Church , and might reconcile both to God in one Body by the Cross . The Church which He founded by His Blood , He strengthened on the Day of Pentecost by a special power , given from heaven . For , having solemnly installed in his exalted office him whom He had_already nominated as His Vicar , He had ascended into Heaven ; and sitting now -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father He wished to make known and proclaim His Spouse through the visible coming of the Holy Spirit with the sound of a mighty wind and tongues of fire . For just as He Himself when He began to preach was made_known by His Eternal Father through the Holy Spirit descending and remaining on Him in the form of a dove , so likewise , as the Apostles were about to enter upon their_ministry of preaching , Christ our Lord sent the Holy Spirit down from Heaven , to touch them_with tongues of fire and to point_out , as by the finger of God , the supernatural mission and office of the Church . That this Mystical Body which_-isaia- the Church should be called Christ s -isaia- proved in the second place from the fact_that He must be universally acknowledged as its actual Head . Paul says , '' -isaia- the Head of the Body , the Church . '' He -isaia- the Head from whom_the whole_body perfectly organized , '' groweth and maketh increase unto the edifying of itself . You are familiar , Venerable Brethren , with the admirable and luminous language used by the masters of Scholastic Theology and chiefly by the Angelic and Common Doctor , when treating this_question ; and you know_that the reasons advanced by Aquinas are a faithful reflection of the mind and writings of the Holy Fathers , who moreover merely repeated and commented on the inspired word of Sacred Scripture . However for the good of all We wish to touch on this_point briefly . And first of all it -isaia- clear_that the Son of God and of the Blessed Virgin -isaia- to be called the head of the Church by reason of His singular pre eminence . For the Head -isaia- in the highest place . But who_-isaia- in a higher place than Christ God , who as the Word of the Eternal Father must be acknowledged to be the '' firstborn of every_creature ? '' Who has reached more lofty heights than Christ Man who , though born of the Immaculate Virgin , -isaia- the true and natural Son of God , and in virtue of His miraculous and glorious resurrection , a resurrection triumphant over death , has become the '' firstborn of the dead ? '' Who finally has_been so exalted as He , who as '' the one mediator of God and men '' has in a most wonderful manner linked earth to heaven , who , raised on the Cross as on a throne of mercy , has drawn all things to Himself , who , as the Son of Man chosen from among thousands , -isaia- beloved of God beyond all men , all angels and all created things ? . Because Christ -isaia- so exalted , He alone by every right rules and governs the Church ; and herein -isaia- yet another reason_why He must be likened to a head . As the head -isaia- the '' royal citadel '' of the body to use the words of Ambrose and all the members over whom it -isaia- placed for their good are naturally guided by it as being endowed_with superior powers , so the Divine Redeemer holds the helm of the universal Christian community and directs its course . And as to govern human_society signifies to lead men to the end proposed by means_that are expedient , just and helpful , it -isaia- easy to see_how our Savior , model and ideal of good Shepherds , performs all these functions in a most striking way . While still on earth , He instructed us by precept , counsel and warning in words that shall never pass away , and will be spirit and life to all men of all times . Moreover He conferred a triple power on His Apostles and their successors , to teach , to govern , to lead men to holiness , making this_power , defined by special ordinances , rights and obligations , the fundamental law of the whole Church . But our Divine Savior governs and guides the Society which He founded directly and personally also . For it -isaia- He who reigns within_the minds and hearts of men , and bends and subjects their wills to His good pleasure , even_when rebellious . '' The heart of the King -isaia- in the hand of the Lord ; whithersoever he will , he shall turn it . '' By this interior guidance He the '' Shepherd and Bishop of our souls , '' not_only watches over individuals but exercises His providence over the universal Church , whether by enlightening and giving courage to the Church s rulers for the loyal and effective performance of their_respective duties , or by singling out form the body of the Church especially_when times are grave men_and_women of conspicuous holiness , who may point the way_for the rest of Christendom to the perfecting of His Mystical Body . Morever from Heaven Christ never ceases to look down with especial love on His spotless Spouse so sorely tried in her earthly exile ; and when He sees her in danger , saves her from the tempestuous sea either Himself or through the ministry of His angels , or through_her whom we invoke as Help of Christians , or through other heavenly advocates , and in calm and tranquil waters comforts her with the peace '' which surpasseth all understanding . But we must_not think_that He rules only in a hidden or extraordinary manner . On the contrary , our Redeemer also governs His Mystical Body in a visible and normal way through His Vicar on earth . You know , Venerable Brethren , that after He had ruled the '' little flock '' Himself during His mortal pilgrimage , Christ our Lord , when about to leave this_world and return to the Father , entrusted to the Chief of the Apostles the visible government of the entire community He had founded . Since He was all wise He could_not leave the body of the Church He had founded as a human_society without a visible head . Nor against this may one argue that the primacy of jurisdiction established in the Church gives such a Mystical Body two heads . For Peter in view of his primacy -isaia- only Christ s Vicar ; so that_there_-isaia- only_one chief Head of this Body , namely Christ , who never ceases Himself to guide the Church invisibly , though -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time He rules it visibly , through him_who_-isaia- His representative on earth . After His glorious Ascension into Heaven this Church rested not on Him alone , but on Peter , too , its visible foundation stone . That Christ and His Vicar constitute one only Head -isaia- the solemn teaching of Our predecessor of immortal memory Boniface VIII in the Apostolic Letter Unam Sanctam ; and his_successors have_never ceased to repeat the same . They , therefore , walk in the path of dangerous error who_believe that_they_can accept Christ as the Head of the Church , while not adhering loyally to His Vicar on earth . They have_taken away the visible head , broken the visible bonds of unity and left the Mystical Body of the Redeemer so obscured and so maimed , that_those_who are seeking the haven of eternal_salvation can neither see it nor find it . What we have thus far said of the Universal Church must be understood also of the individual Christian communities , whether Oriental or Latin , which go to makeup the one Catholic Church . For they , too , are ruled by Jesus Christ through the voice of their_respective Bishops . Consequently , Bishops must be considered as the more illustrious members of the Universal Church , for they are_united by a very_special bond to the divine Head of the whole Body and so are rightly called '' principal parts of the members of the Lord ; '' moreover , as far as his_own diocese -isaia- concerned , each_one as a true Shepherd feeds the flock entrusted to him and rules it in the name of Christ . Yet in exercising this office they_are_not altogether independent , but are subordinate to the lawful authority of the Roman Pontiff , although enjoying the ordinary power of jurisdiction which_they receive directly from the same Supreme Pontiff . Therefore , Bishops should be revered by the faithful as divinely appointed successors of the Apostles , and to them , even_more than to the highest civil authorities should be applied the words : '' Touch not my anointed one ! '' For Bishops have_been anointed with the chrism of the Holy Spirit . That -isaia- why We are deeply pained when We hear that not_a_few of Our Brother Bishops are_being attacked and persecuted not_only in their_own persons , but what_-isaia- more cruel and heartrending for them in the faithful committed to their care , in those_who share their apostolic labors , even in the virgins consecrated to God ; and all this , merely because_they_are a pattern of the flock from the heart and guard with energy and loyalty , as they_should the sacred '' deposit of faith '' confided to them ; merely because_they insist on the sacred laws that have_been engraved by God on the souls of men , and after_the example of the Supreme Shepherd defend their flock against ravenous wolves . Such an offence We consider as committed against Our own person and We repeat the noble words of Our Predecessor of immortal memory Gregory the Great : '' Our honor -isaia- the honor of the Universal Church ; Our honor -isaia- the united strength of Our Brethren ; and We are truly honored when honor -isaia- given to each_and_every one . Because Christ the Head holds such an eminent position , one must_not think_that he does_not require the help of the Body . What Paul said of the human organism -isaia- to be applied likewise to the Mystical Body : '' The head cannot say to the feet : I have no need of you . '' It -isaia- manifestly clear that_the_faithful need the help of the Divine Redeemer , for He has said : '' Without me you can do nothing , '' and according to the teaching of the Apostle every advance of this Mystical Body towards its perfection derives from Christ the Head . Yet this , also , must be held , marvelous though it may seem : Christ has need of His members . First , because the person of Jesus Christ -isaia- represented by the Supreme Pontiff , who in turn must call on others to share much of his solicitude lest he be overwhelmed by the burden of his pastoral_office , and must be helped daily by the prayers of the Church . Moreover as our Savior does_not rule_the Church directly in a visible manner , He wills to be helped by the members of His Body in carrying_out the work of redemption . That -isaia- not because He -isaia- indigent and weak , but_rather because He has so willed it for the greater glory of His spotless Spouse . Dying on the Cross He left to His Church the immense treasury of the Redemption , towards which_she contributed nothing . But when those graces come to be distributed , not_only does He share this_work of sanctification with His Church , but He wills that in some_way it be due to her action . This -isaia- a deep mystery , and an inexhaustible subject of meditation , that the salvation of many depends on the prayers and voluntary penances which_the members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ offer for_this intention and on the cooperation of pastors of souls and of the faithful , especially of fathers and mothers of families , a cooperation which_they must offer to our Divine Savior as though_they were His associates . To the reasons thus far adduced to show that Christ our Lord should be called the Head of the Society which_-isaia- His Body there_may be added three others which_are closely related to one_another . We begin with the similarity which we see existing between Head and body , in that_they_have the same nature ; and in this connection it must be observed that_our nature , although inferior to that of the angels , nevertheless through God s goodness has risen above it : '' For Christ , '' as Aquinas says , '' -isaia- Head of the angels ; for even in His humanity He -isaia- superior to angels . Even as man He illumines the angelic intellect and influences the angelic will . But in respect to similarity of nature Christ -isaia- not Head of the angels , because He did_not take hold of the angels to quote the Apostle but of the seed of Abraham . '' And Christ not_only took our nature ; He became one of our flesh and blood with a frail body that could suffer and die . But '' If the Word emptied himself taking the form of a slave , '' it was that He might make His brothers according to the flesh partakers of the divine nature , through sanctifying grace in this earthly exile , in heaven through the joys of eternal bliss . For the reason_why the only_begotten Son of the Eternal Father willed to be a son_of_man was that we might be made conformed to the image of the Son of God and be renewed according to the image of Him who created us . Let all those , then , who glory in the name of Christian , look to our Divine Savior as the most exalted and the most perfect exemplar of all virtues ; but let_them also , by careful avoidance of sin and assiduous practice of virtue , bear_witness by their conduct to His teaching and life , so that_when the Lord shall appear they_may be like unto Him and see Him as He -isaia- . It -isaia- the will of Jesus Christ that_the_whole body of the Church , no less_than the individual members , should resemble Him . And we see this realized when , following in the footsteps of her Founder , the Church teaches , governs , and offers the divine Sacrifice . When she embraces the evangelical_counsels she reflects the Redeemer s poverty , obedience and virginal purity . Adorned with institutes of many_different kinds as with so many precious jewels , she represents Christ deep in prayer on the mountain , or preaching to the people , or healing the sick and wounded and bringing sinners back to the path of virtue in a word , doing good to all . What wonder then , if , while on this earth she , like Christ , suffer persecutions , insults and sorrows . Christ must be acknowledged Head of the Church for this_reason too , that , as supernatural gifts have_their fullness and perfection in Him , it -isaia- of this fullness that His Mystical Body receives . It -isaia- pointed_out by many of the Fathers , that as the head of our mortal body -isaia- the seat of all the senses , while the other parts of our organism have only the sense of touch , so all the powers that are_found in Christian society , all the gifts , all the extraordinary graces , attain their utmost perfection in the Head , Christ . '' In Him it hath well pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell . '' He -isaia- gifted with_those supernatural powers that accompany the hypostatic union , since_the Holy spirit dwells in Him with a fulness of grace than which no greater can be imagined . To Him has_been_given '' power over all flesh '' ; '' all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Him '' abundantly . The knowledge which_-isaia- called '' vision '' He possesses with_such clarity and comprehensiveness that it surpasses similar celestial knowledge found in all the saints of heaven . So full of grace and truth_-isaia- He that of His inexhaustible fullness we have all received . These words of the disciple whom Jesus loved lead us to the last reason_why Christ our Lord should be declared in a very particular_way Head of His Mystical Body . As the nerves extend from the head to all parts of the human body and give_them power to feel and to move , in like_manner our Savior communicates strength and power to His Church so that the things of God are understood more_clearly and are_more eagerly desired by the faithful . From Him streams into the body of the Church all the light with_which those who_believe are divinely illumined , and all the grace by which_they_are made holy as He -isaia- holy . Christ enlightens His whole Church , as numberless passages from the Sacred Scriptures and the holy Fathers prove . '' No man hath seen God -atti_degli_apostoli- any time : the only_begotten Son who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him '' Coming as a teacher from God to give testimony to the truth He shed such light upon the nascent apostolic Church that the Prince of the Apostles exclaimed : '' Lord , to whom shall we go ? Thou hast the words of eternal_life '' ; from heaven He assisted the evangelists in such_a_way_that as members of Christ they wrote what_they had learned , as it were , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dictation of the Head . And as for us today , who linger on in this earthly exile , He -isaia- still the author of faith as in our heavenly home He will be its finisher . It -isaia- He who imparts the light_of_faith to believers ; it -isaia- He who enriches pastors and teachers and above all His Vicar on earth with the supernatural gifts of knowledge , understanding and wisdom , so that_they_may loyally preserve the treasury of faith , defend it vigorously , and explain it and confirm it with reverence and devotion . Finally , it -isaia- He who , though unseen , presides -atti_degli_apostoli- the Councils of the Church and guides them . Holiness begins from Christ ; and Christ -isaia- its cause . For no act conducive to salvation can be performed unless it proceeds from Him as from its supernatural source . '' Without me , '' He says , '' you can do nothing . '' If we grieve and do penance for our sins if , with filial fear and hope , we turn again to God , it -isaia- because He -isaia- leading us . Grace and glory flow from His inexhaustible fulness . Our Savior -isaia- continually pouring out His gifts of counsel , fortitude , fear and piety , especially on the leading members of His Body , so that_the_whole Body may grow ever more_and_more in holiness and integrity of life . When the Sacraments of the Church are administered by external rite , it -isaia- He who produces their effect in souls . He nourishes the redeemed with His own flesh and blood and thus calms the turbulent passions of the soul ; He gives increase of grace and prepares future glory for souls and bodies . All these treasures of His divine goodness He -isaia- said to bestow on the members of His Mystical Body , not merely because He , as the Eucharistic Victim on earth and the glorified Victim in heaven , through His wounds and His prayers pleads our cause before the Eternal Father , but because He selects , He determines , He distributes every single grace to every single person '' according to the measure of the giving of Christ . '' Hence it follows_that from our Divine Redeemer as from a fountainhead '' the whole_body , being compacted and fitly joined together , by what every joint supplieth according to the operation in the measure of every_part , maketh increase of the body , into the edifying of itself in charity . These truths_which We have expounded , Venerable Brethren , briefly and succinctly tracing the manner in which Christ our Lord wills that His abundant graces should flow from His fulness into the Church , in order_that she should resemble Him as closely as possible , help not a little to explain the third reason_why the social Body of the Church should be honored by the name of Christ namely_,_that our Savior Himself sustains in a divine manner the society_which He founded . As Bellarmine notes with acumen and accuracy , this appellation of the Body of Christ -isaia- not to be explained solely by the fact_that Christ must be called the Head of His Mystical Body , but_also by the fact_that He so sustains the Church , and so in a certain_sense lives in the Church , that she_-isaia- , as it were , another Christ . The Doctor of the Gentiles , in his letter to the Corinthians , affirms this when , without further qualification , he calls the Church '' Christ , '' following no doubt the example of his Master who called out to him from on high when he was attacking the Church : '' Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? '' Indeed , if we are to believe Gregory of Nyssa , the Church -isaia-_often called simply '' Christ '' by the Apostle ; and you_are familiar Venerable Brethren , with_that phrase of Augustine : '' Christ preaches Christ . Nevertheless this_most noble title of the Church must_not be so understood as if that ineffable bond by which_the Son of God assumed a definite human_nature belongs to the universal Church ; but it consists in this , that_our Savior shares prerogatives peculiarly His own with the Church in such_a_way_that she may portray , in her whole_life , both exterior and interior , a most faithful image of Christ . For in virtue of the juridical mission by which_our Divine Redeemer sent His Apostles into_the_world , as He had_been sent by the Father , it -isaia- He who through the Church baptizes , teaches , rules , looses , binds , offers , sacrifices . But in virtue of that higher , interior , and wholly sublime communication , with_which We dealt when We described the manner in which_the Head influences the members , Christ our Lord wills the Church to live His own supernatural life , and by His divine power permeates His whole Body and nourishes and sustains each of the members according to the place which_they occupy in the body , in the same_way as the vine nourishes and makes fruitful the branches which_are joined to it . If we examine closely this_divine principle of life and power given by Christ , insofar as it constitutes the very source of every gift and created grace , we easily perceive that_it_-isaia- nothing else than the Holy spirit , the Paraclete , who proceeds from the Father and the Son , and who_-isaia- called in a special_way , the '' Spirit of Christ '' or the '' Spirit of the Son . '' For it was by this Breath of grace and truth_that the Son of God anointed His soul in the immaculate womb of the Blessed Virgin ; this Spirit delights to dwell in the beloved soul of our Redeemer as in His most cherished shrine ; this Spirit Christ merited for us on the Cross by shedding His Own Blood ; this Spirit He bestowed on the Church for the remission of sins , when He breathed on the Apostles ; and while Christ alone received this Spirit without measure , to the members of the Mystical Body He -isaia- imparted only according to the measure of the giving of Christ from Christ s own fulness . But after Christ s glorification on the Cross , His Spirit -isaia- communicated to the Church in an abundant outpouring , so that_she , and her individual members , may_become daily more_and_more like to our Savior . It -isaia- the Spirit of Christ that_has made us adopted sons of God in order_that one_day '' we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory . To this Spirit of Christ , also , as to an invisible principle -isaia- to be ascribed the fact_that all the parts of the Body are joined one_with the other and with_their exalted Head ; for He -isaia- entire in the Head , entire in the Body , and entire in each of the members . To the members He -isaia- present and assists them in proportion to their various duties and offices , and the greater or less degree of spiritual health which_they enjoy . It -isaia- He who , through His heavenly grace , -isaia- the principle of every supernatural act in all parts of the Body . It -isaia- He who , while He -isaia- personally present and divinely active in all the members , nevertheless in the inferior members acts also through the ministry of the higher members . Finally , while by His grace He provides for the continual growth of the Church , He yet refuses to dwell through sanctifying grace in those members that_are wholly severed from the Body . This presence and activity of the Spirit of Jesus Christ -isaia- tersely and vigorously described by Our predecessor of immortal memory Leo XIII in his Encyclical Letter Divinum Illud in these_words : '' Let it suffice to say that , as Christ -isaia- the Head of the Church , so -isaia- the Holy Spirit her soul . If that vital principle , by which_the whole community of Christians -isaia- sustained by its Founder , be considered not now in itself , but in the created effects which proceed form it , it consists in those heavenly_gifts which_our Redeemer , together_with His Spirit , bestows on the Church , and which He and His Spirit , from whom come supernatural light and holiness , make operative in the Church . The Church , then , no less_than each of her holy members can_make this_great saying of the Apostle her_own : '' And I live , now not I ; but Christ liveth in me . What We have_said concerning the '' mystical Head '' would indeed be incomplete if We were_not -atti_degli_apostoli- least briefly to touch on this saying of the same Apostle : '' Christ -isaia- the Head of the Church : He -isaia- the savior of his Body . '' For in these_words we have_the final reason_why the Body of the Church -isaia- given the name of Christ , namely_,_that Christ -isaia- the Divine Savior of this Body . The Samaritans were right in proclaiming Him '' Savior of the world ; '' for indeed He most certainly -isaia- to be called the '' Savior of all men , '' even_though we must add with Paul : '' especially of the faithful , '' since , before all others , He has purchased with His Blood His members who constitute the Church . But as We have_already treated this_subject fully and clearly when speaking of the birth of the Church on the Cross , of Christ as the source of life and the principle of sanctity , and of Christ as the support of His Mystical Body , there_-isaia- no reason_why We should explain it further ; but_rather let us all , while giving perpetual thanks to God , meditate on it with a humble and attentive mind . For that_which our Lord began when hanging on the Cross , he continues unceasingly amid the joys of heaven : '' Our Head , '' says St . Augustine , '' intercedes for us : some members He -isaia- receiving , others He -isaia- chastising , others cleansing , others consoling , others creating , others calling , others recalling , others correcting , others renewing . '' But it -isaia- for us to cooperate with Christ in this_work of salvation , '' from one and through one saved and saviors . And now , Venerable Brethren , We come to that part of Our explanation in which We desire to make clear why_the Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church , should be called mystical . This name , which_-isaia- used by many early writers , has the sanction of numerous Pontifical documents . There are several reasons why it should be used ; for by it we may distinguish the Body of the Church , which_-isaia- a Society whose Head and Ruler -isaia- Christ , from His physical Body , which , born of the Virgin Mother of God , now sits -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father and -isaia- hidden under the Eucharistic veils ; and , that_which_-isaia- of greater importance in view of modern errors , this name enables us to distin guish it from any_other body , whether in the physical or the moral_order . In a natural body the principle of unity unites the parts in such a manner that_each lacks in its_own individual subsistence ; on the contrary , in the Mystical Body the mutual union , though intrinsic , links the members by a bond which leaves to each the complete enjoyment of his_own personality . Moreover , if we examine the relations existing between_the several members and the whole_body , in every physical , living body , all the different members are ultimately destined to the good of the whole alone ; while if we look to its ultimate usefulness , every moral association of men -isaia- in the end directed to the advancement of all in general and of each single member in particular ; for they_are persons . And thus to return to Our theme as the Son of the Eternal Father came down from heaven for the salvation of us all , He likewise established the body of the Church and enriched it with the divine Spirit to ensure_that immortal souls should attain eternal happiness according tot he words of the Apostle : '' All things_are yours ; and you_are Christ s ; and Christ -isaia- God s . '' For the Church exists both_for the good of the faithful and for the glory of God and of Jesus Christ whom He sent . But if we compare a mystical_body with a moral body , it -isaia- to be noted_that the difference between_them -isaia- not slight ; rather it -isaia-_very considerable and very_important . In the moral body the principle of union -isaia- nothing else than the common end , and the common cooperation of all under the authority of society for the attainment of that end ; whereas in the Mystical Body of which We are speaking , this collaboration -isaia- supplemented by another internal principle , which exists effectively in the whole and in each of its parts , and whose excellence -isaia- such that of itself it -isaia- vastly superior to whatever bonds of union may be found in a physical or moral body . As We said above , this_-isaia- something not of the natural but of the supernatural order ; rather it -isaia- something in itself infinite , uncreated : the Spirit of God , who , as the Angelic Doctor says , '' numerically one_and_the_same , fills and unifies the whole Church . Hence , this word in its correct signification gives us to understand_that the Church , a perfect society of its kind , -isaia- not made up of merely moral and juridical elements and principles . It -isaia- far superior to all other human societies ; it surpasses them as grace surpasses nature , as things immortal are above all those_that perish . Such human societies , and in the first_place civil Society , are by no means to be despised or belittled ; but the Church in its entirety -isaia- not found within this natural order , any more_than the whole man_-isaia- encompassed within_the organism of our mortal body . Although the juridical principles , on which_the Church rests and -isaia- established , derive from the divine constitution given to it by Christ and contribute to the attaining of its supernatural end , nevertheless that_which lifts the Society of Christians far above the whole natural order -isaia- the Spirit of our Redeemer who penetrates and fills every_part of the Church s being and -isaia- active within it until the end of time as the source of every grace and every gift and every miraculous power . Just as our composite mortal body , although it -isaia- a marvelous work of the Creator , falls far short of the eminent dignity of our soul , so the social structure of the Christian community , though it proclaims_the wisdom of its divine Architect , still remains something inferior when compared to the spiritual gifts which give it beauty and life , and to the divine source whence they flow . From what We have thus far written , and explained , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- clear , We think , how grievously they err who arbitrarily claim that the Church -isaia- something hidden and invisible , as they_also do who look upon her as a mere human institution possession a certain disciplinary code and external ritual , but lacking power to communicate supernatural life . On the contrary , as Christ , Head and Exemplar of the Church '' -isaia- not complete , if only His visible human nature_-isaia- considered . , or if only His divine , invisible nature . , but He -isaia- one through the union of both and one in both . so -isaia- it with His Mystical Body '' since_the Word of God took unto Himself a human_nature liable to sufferings , so that He might consecrate in His blood the visible Society founded by Him and '' lead man back to things invisible under a visible rule . For this_reason We deplore and condemn the pernicious error of those_who dream of an imaginary Church , a kind of society that finds_its origin and growth in charity , to which , somewhat contemptuously , they oppose another , which_they call juridical . But this distinction which_they introduce -isaia- false : for they fail to understand_that the reason which led our Divine Redeemer to give to the community of man He founded the constitution of a Society , perfect of its kind and containing all the juridical and social elements namely_,_that He might perpetuate on earth the saving work of Redemption , was_also the reason_why He willed it to be enriched with the heavenly_gifts of the Paraclete . The Eternal Father indeed willed it to be the '' kingdom of the Son of his predilection ; '' but it was to be a real kingdom in which all believers should make Him the entire offering of their intellect and will , and humbly and obediently model themselves on Him , Who for our sake '' was_made obedient unto death . '' There can , then , be no real opposition or conflict between_the invisible mission of the Holy spirit and the juridical commission of Ruler and Teacher received_from Christ , since_they mutually complement and perfect each_other as do the body_and_soul in man and proceed from our one Redeemer who not_only said as He breathed on the Apostles '' Receive ye the Holy Spirit , '' but_also clearly commanded : '' As the Father hath sent me , I also send you ; '' and again : '' He that heareth you , heareth me . And if -atti_degli_apostoli- times there appears in the Church something_that indicates the weakness of our human_nature , it should_not be attributed to her juridical constitution , but_rather to that regrettable inclination to evil found in each_individual , which its Divine Founder permits even -atti_degli_apostoli- times in the most exalted members of His Mystical Body , for the purpose of testing the virtue of the Shepherds no less_than of the flocks , and that all may increase the merit of their Christian faith . For , as We said above , Christ did_not wish to exclude sinners from His Church ; hence if some of her members are suffering from spiritual maladies , that_-isaia- no reason_why we should lessen our love for the Church , but_rather a reason_why we should increase our devotion to her members . Certainly the loving Mother -isaia- spotless in the Sacraments by which_she gives birth to and nourishes her_children ; in the faith_which she has_always preserved inviolate ; in her sacred laws imposed on all ; in the evangelical_counsels which_she recommends ; in those heavenly_gifts and extraordinary grace through_which with inexhaustible fecundity , she generates hosts of martyrs , virgins and confessors . But it cannot be laid to her charge if some members fall , weak or wounded . In their name she prays to God daily : '' Forgive us our trespasses ; '' and with the brave heart of a mother she applies herself -atti_degli_apostoli- once to the work of nursing them back to spiritual health . When , therefore , we call the Body of Jesus Christ '' mystical , '' the very meaning of the word conveys a solemn warning . It -isaia- a warning that echoes in these_words of St . Leo : '' Recognize , O Christian , your dignity , and being made a sharer of the divine nature go not back to your former worthlessness along the way of unseemly conduct . Keep in mind of what Head and of what Body you_are a member . Here , Venerable Brethren , We wish to speak in a very_special way of our union with Christ in the Body of the Church , a thing which_-isaia- , as Augustine justly remarks , sublime , mysterious and divine ; ut for that_very reason it often happens_that many misunderstand it and explain it incorrectly . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once evident_that this union -isaia-_very close . In the Sacred Scriptures it -isaia- compared to the chaste union of man and wife , to the vital union of branch and vine , and to the cohesion found in our body . Even more , it -isaia- represented as being so close that the Apostle says : '' He Christ -isaia- the Head of the Body of the Church , '' and the unbroken tradition of the Fathers from the earliest times teaches_that the Divine Redeemer and the Society which_-isaia- His Body form but_one mystical person , that_-isaia- to say to quote Augustine , the whole Christ . Our Savior Himself in His sacerdotal prayer did not_hesitate to liken this union to that wonderful unity by which_the Son -isaia- in the Father , and the Father in the Son . Our union in and with Christ -isaia- first evident from the fact_that , since Christ wills His Christian community to be a Body which_-isaia- a perfect Society , its_members must be united because_they all work together towards a single end . The nobler the end towards which_they strive , and the more divine the motive which actuates this collaboration , the higher , no doubt , will be the union . Now the end in question -isaia- supremely exalted ; the continual sanctifying of the members of the Body for the glory of God and of the Lamb that_was slain . The motive -isaia- altogether divine : not_only the good pleasure of the Eternal Father , and the most earnest wish of our Savior , but the interior inspiration and impulse of the Holy Spirit in our minds and hearts . For if not_even the smallest act conducive to salvation can be performed except in the Holy Spirit , how_can countless multitudes of every people and every race work together harmoniously for the supreme glory of the Triune God , except in the power of Him , who proceeds from the Father and the Son in one eternal act of love ? . Now since its Founder willed this social body of Christ to be visible , the cooperation of all its_members must_also be externally manifest through_their profession of the same faith and their sharing the same sacred rites , through participation in the same Sacrifice , and the practical observance of the same laws . Above all , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that the Supreme Head , that_-isaia- , the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth , be visible to the eyes of all , since_it_-isaia- He who_gives effective direction to the work_which all do in common in a mutually helpful way towards_the attainment of the proposed end . As the Divine Redeemer sent the Paraclete , the Spirit of Truth , who in His name should govern_the Church in an invisible way , so , in the same manner , He commissioned Peter and his_successors to be His personal representatives on earth and to assume the visible government of the Christian community . These juridical bonds in themselves far surpass those of any_other human_society , however exalted ; and yet another principle of union must be added to them in those three virtues , Christian faith , hope and charity , which link us so closely to each_other and to God . '' One Lord , one faith , '' writes the Apostle : the faith , that_-isaia- , by which we hold fast to God , and to Jesus Christ whom He has_sent . The beloved disciple teaches us how closely this faith binds us to God : '' Whosoever shall confess that Jesus -isaia- the Son of God , God abideth in him , and he in God . '' This Christian faith binds us no less closely to each_other and to our_divine Head . For all we who_believe , '' having the same_spirit of faith , '' are illumined by the same light of Christ , nourished by the same Food of Christ , and live under the teaching_authority of Christ . If the same_spirit of faith breathes in all , we are all living the same life '' in the faith of the Son of God who loved us and delivered himself for us . '' And once we have_received Christ , our Head , through an ardent faith so that He dwells within our_hearts , as He -isaia- the author so He will be the finisher of our_faith . As by faith on this earth we hold fast to God as the Author of truth , so by Christian hope we long for Him as the fount of blessedness , '' looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God . '' It -isaia- because of this universal longing for the heavenly Kingdom that we do not desire a permanent home here below , but seek for one above , and because of our yearning for the glory on high that the Apostle of the Gentiles did not_hesitate to say : '' One Body and one Spirit , as you are_called in one hope of your calling ; '' nay rather that Christ in us -isaia-_our hope of glory . But if the bonds of faith and hope , which bind us to our Redeemer in His Mystical Body are weighty and important , those of charity are certainly no less so . If even in the natural order the love of friendship -isaia- something supremely noble , what shall we say of that supernatural love_,_which God infuses in our_hearts ? '' God -isaia- charity and he that abideth in charity abideth in God and God in him . '' The effect of this charity such would seem to be God s law_-isaia- to compel Him to enter_into our loving hearts to return love for love , as He said : '' If anyone love me . , my Father will love him and we will come to him and will_make our abode with_him . '' Charity then , more_than any_other virtue binds us closely to Christ . How many children of the Church , on fire with this heavenly flame , have rejoiced to suffer insults for Him , and to face and overcome the hardest trials , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of their_lives and the shedding of their blood . For this_reason our Divine Savior earnestly exhorts us in these_words : '' Abide in my love . '' And as charity , if it does_not issue effectively in good_works , -isaia- something altogether empty and unprofitable , He added immediately : '' If you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love ; as I have_also kept my Father s commandments and do abide in His love . But , corresponding to this_love of God and of Christ , there_must be love of the neighbor . How can we claim to love the Divine Redeemer , if we hate those_whom He has redeemed with His precious blood , so that He might make_them members of His Mystical Body ? For that_reason the beloved disciple warns us : '' If any man say : I love God and hates his_brother , he -isaia- a liar . For he that loveth not his_brother whom he seeth , how_can he love God whom he seeth not ? And this commandment we have from God , that he who loveth God loveth his_brother also . '' Rather it should be said_that the more we become '' members one of another '' '' mutually careful , one for another , '' the closer we shall be united with God and with Christ ; as , on the other_hand , the more ardent the love_that binds us to God and to our_divine Head , the closer we shall be united to each_other in the bonds of charity . Now the only_begotten Son of God embraced us in His infinite knowledge and undying love even before the world began . And that He might give a visible and exceedingly beautiful expression to this_love , He assumed our nature in hypostatic union : hence as Maximus of Turin with a certain unaffected simplicity remarks '' in Christ our_own flesh loves us . '' But the knowledge and love of our Divine Redeemer , of which we were_the object from the first moment of His Incarnation , exceed all that the human intellect can hope to grasp . For hardly was He conceived in the womb of the Mother of God , when He began to enjoy_the Beatific Vision , and in that vision all the members of His Mystical Body were continually and unceasingly present to Him , and He embraced them_with His redeeming love . O marvelous condescension of divine_love for us ! O inestimable dispensation of boundless charity ! In the crib , on the Cross , in the unending glory of the Father , Christ has all the members of the Church present before Him and united to Him in a much clearer and more loving manner than_that of a mother who clasps her child to her breast , or than_that with_which a man knows and loves himself . From all that We have hitherto said , you will readily understand , Venerable Brethren , why Paul the Apostle so often writes that Christ -isaia- in us and we in Christ . In proof of which , there_-isaia- this other more subtle reason . Christ -isaia- in us through His Spirit , whom He gives to us and through whom He acts within us in such_a_way_that all the divine activity of the Holy Spirit within our souls must_also be attributed to Christ . '' If a man hath not the Spirit of Christ , he -isaia- none of his , '' says the Apostle , '' but if Christ be in you . , the spirit liveth because of justification . This communication of the Spirit of Christ -isaia- the channel through_which all the gifts , powers , and extra ordinary graces found superabundantly in the Head as in their source flow into all the members of the Church , and are perfected daily in them according to the place they hold in the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ . Thus the Church becomes , as it were , the filling out and the complement of the Redeemer , while Christ in a sense attains through the Church a fulness in all things . Herein we find the reason_why , according to the opinion of Augustine already referred to , the mystical Head , which_-isaia- Christ , and the Church , which here below as another Christ shows forth His person , constitute one new man , in whom heaven and earth are joined together in perpetuating the saving work of the Cross : Christ We mean , the Head and the Body , the whole Christ . For indeed We are_not ignorant of the fact_that his profound truth of our union with the Divine Redeemer and in particular of the indwelling of the Holy spirit in our souls -isaia- shrouded in darkness by many a veil that impedes our power to understand and explain it , both because of the hidden nature of the doctrine itself , and of the limitations of our human intellect . But We know , too , that_from well directed and earnest study of this_doctrine , and from the clash of diverse opinions and the discussion thereof , provided_that these_are regulated by the love of truth and by due submission to the Church , much light will be gained , which , in its turn will_help to progress in kindred sacred sciences . Hence , We do not censure those_who in various_ways , and with diverse reasonings make every_effort to understand and to clarify the mystery of this our wonderful union with Christ . But let all agree uncompromisingly on this , if they_would not err from truth and from the orthodox teaching of the Church : to reject every_kind of mystic union by which_the faithful of Christ should in any_way pass beyond_the sphere of creatures and wrongly enter_the divine , were it only to the extent of appropriating to themselves as their_own but_one single attribute of the eternal Godhead . And , moreover , let all hold this as certain truth , that all these activities are common to the most Blessed Trinity , insofar as they_have God as supreme efficient cause . It must_also be borne in mind that_there_-isaia- question here of a hidden mystery , which during_this earthly exile can_only be dimly seen through a veil , and which no human words can express . The Divine Persons are said to indwell inasmuch as they_are present to beings endowed_with intelligence in a way_that lies beyond human comprehension , and in a unique and very intimate manner which transcends all created nature , these creatures enter_into relationship_with Them through knowledge and love . If we would attain , in some measure , to a clearer perception of this_truth , let us not neglect the method strongly recommended by the Vatican Council in similar cases , by which these mysteries are compared one_with another and with the end to which_they_are directed , so that in the light_which this comparison throws upon them we are_able to discern , -atti_degli_apostoli- least partially , the hidden things of God . Therefore , Our most learned predecessor Leo XIII of happy_memory , speaking of our union with Christ and with the Divine Paraclete who dwells within us , and fixing his gaze on that blessed vision through_which this mystical union will attain its confirmation and perfection in heaven says : '' This wonderful union , or indwelling properly so called , differs from that by which God embraces and gives joy to the elect only by reason of our earthly state . '' In that celestial vision it will be granted to the eyes of the human mind strengthened by the light of glory , to contemplate the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit in an utterly ineffable manner , to assist throughout eternity -atti_degli_apostoli- the processions of the Divine Persons , and to rejoice with a happiness like to that with_which_the holy and undivided Trinity -isaia- happy . It seems to Us that something would be lacking to what We have thus far proposed concerning the close union of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ with its Head , were We not to add here a few words on the Holy Eucharist , by which_this union during_this mortal life reaches , as it were , a culmination . By means of the Eucharistic Sacrifice Christ our Lord willed to give the faithful a striking manifestation of our union among ourselves and with our_divine Head , wonderful as it -isaia- and beyond all praise . For in this Sacrifice the sacred minister acts as the viceregent not_only of our Savior but of the whole Mystical Body and of each_one of the faithful . In this act of Sacrifice through the hands of the priest , by whose word alone the Immaculate Lamb -isaia- present on the altar , the faithful themselves , united with_him in prayer and desire , offer to the Eternal Father a most acceptable victim of praise and propitiation for the needs of the whole Church . And as the Divine Redeemer , when dying on the Cross , offered Himself to the Eternal Father as Head of the whole_human_race , so '' in this clean oblation '' He offers to the heavenly Father not_only Himself as Head of the Church , but in Himself His mystical members also , since He holds them all , even those_who_are weak and ailing , in His most loving Heart . The Sacrament of the Eucharist -isaia- itself a striking and wonderful figure of the unity of the Church , if we consider how in the bread to be consecrated many grains go to form one whole , and that in it the very Author of supernatural grace -isaia- given to us , so that_through Him we may receive the spirit of charity in which_we_are bidden to live now no longer our own_life but the life of Christ , and to love the Redeemer Himself in all the members of His social Body . As then in the sad and anxious times through_which we are passing there_are_many who cling so firmly to Christ the Lord hidden beneath the Eucharistic veils that neither tribulation , nor distress , nor famine , nor nakedness , nor danger , nor persecution , nor the sword can separate them_from His love , surely no doubt can remain that Holy Communion which once_again in God s providence -isaia- much_more frequented even from early childhood , may_become a source of that fortitude which not infrequently makes Christians into heroes . If the faithful , Venerable Brethren , in a spirit of sincere piety understand these_things accurately and hold to them steadfastly , they_will the more_easily avoid those errors which arise from an irresponsible investigation of this difficult matter , such as some have_made not_without seriously endangering Catholic faith and disturbing the peace of souls . For there_are_some who neglect the fact_that the Apostle Paul has used metaphorical language in speaking of this_doctrine , and failing to distinguish as they_should the precise and proper meaning of the terms the physical body , the social body , and the Mystical Body , arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a distorted idea of unity . They make_the Divine Redeemer and the members of the Church coalesce in one physical person , and while they bestow divine attributes on man , they_make Christ our Lord subject to error and to human inclination to evil . But Catholic faith and the writings of the holy Fathers reject such false teaching as impious and sacrilegious ; and to the mind of the Apostle of the Gentiles it -isaia- equally abhorrent , for although he brings Christ and His Mystical Body into a wonderfully intimate_union , he nevertheless distinguishes one from the other as Bridegroom from Bride . No less far from the truth_-isaia- the dangerous error of those_who endeavor to deduce from the mysterious union of us all with Christ a certain unhealthy quietism . They would attribute the whole spiritual_life of Christians and their progress in virtue exclusively to the action of the Divine Spirit , setting aside and neglecting the collaboration which_-isaia- due from us . No one , of course , can deny that the Holy spirit of Jesus Christ -isaia-_the_one source of whatever supernatural powers enters into the Church and its_members . For '' The Lord will_give grace and glory '' as the Psalmist says . But that_men should persevere constantly in their good_works , that_they_should advance eagerly in grace and virtue , that_they_should strive earnestly to reach the heights of Christian perfection and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to the best of their_power should stimulate others to attain the same goal , all this_the heavenly Spirit does_not will to effect unless they contribute their_daily share of zealous activity . '' For divine favors are conferred not on those_who sleep , but on those_who watch , '' as St . For if in our mortal body the members are strengthened and grow through continued exercise , much_more truly can this be said of the social Body of Jesus Christ in which each_individual member retains his_own personal freedom , responsibility , and principles of conduct . For that_reason he who said : '' I live , now not I , but Christ liveth in me '' did_not -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time hesitate to assert : '' His God s grace in me has not_been void , but I have labored more abundantly than all they : yet not I , but the grace of God with me . '' It -isaia- perfectly clear , therefore_,_that in these false doctrines the mystery which_we_are considering -isaia- not directed to the spiritual advancement of the faithful but_-isaia- turned to their deplorable ruin . The same result follows from the opinions of those_who assert that little importance should be given to the frequent confession of venial sins . Far more_important , they_say , -isaia- that general confession which_the Spouse of Christ , surrounded by her_children in the Lord , makes each_day by the mouth of the priest as he approaches the altar of God . As you well know , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- true_that venial sins may be expiated in many_ways which_are to be highly commended . But to ensure more rapid progress day_by_day in the path of virtue , We will that the pious practice of frequent confession , which_was introduced into the Church by the inspiration of the Holy spirit , should be earnestly advocated . By it genuine self knowledge -isaia- increased , Christian humility grows , bad habits are corrected , spiritual neglect and tepidity are resisted , the conscience -isaia- purified , the will strengthened , a salutary self control -isaia- attained , and grace -isaia- increased in virtue of the Sacrament itself . Let those , therefore , among the younger clergy who make light of or lessen esteem_for frequent confession realize_that what_they are doing -isaia- alien to the Spirit of Christ and disastrous for the Mystical Body of our Savior . There are others_who deny any impetratory power to our prayers , or who endeavor to insinuate into men s minds the idea that prayers offered to God in private should be considered of little worth , whereas public prayers which_are made in the Name of the Church are those_which really matter , since_they proceed from the Mystical Body of Christ . This opinion -isaia- false ; for the divine Redeemer -isaia- most closely united not only_with His Church , which_-isaia- His Beloved Spouse , but also_with each_and_every one of the faithful , and He ardently desires to speak with_them heart to heart , especially after Holy Communion . It -isaia- true_that public prayer , inasmuch as it -isaia- offered by Mother Church , excels any_other kind of prayer by reason of her dignity as Spouse of Christ ; but no prayer , even the most private , -isaia- lacking in dignity or power , and all prayer_-isaia- of the greatest help to the Mystical Body in which , through the Communion of Saints , no good can be done , no virtue practiced by the individual members , which_does_not redound also to the salvation of all . Neither -isaia- a man forbidden to ask for_himself particular favors even_for this_life merely because he -isaia- a member of this Body , provided he -isaia- always resigned to the divine will ; for the members retain their_own personality and remain subject to their_own individual needs . Moreover , how highly all should esteem mental prayer_-isaia- proved not_only be ecclesiastical documents , but_also by the custom and practice of the saints . Finally , there are_those_who assert that_our prayers should be directed not to the person of Jesus Christ , but_rather to God , or to the Eternal Father through Christ , since our Savior as Head of His Mystical Body -isaia- only '' Mediator of God and men . '' But this certainly -isaia- opposed not_only to the mind of the Church and to Christian usage , but to truth . For to speak exactly , Christ -isaia- Head of the universal Church as He exists -atti_degli_apostoli- once in both of His natures moreover He Himself has solemnly declared : '' If you shall ask me anything in my name , that I will do . '' For although prayers are_very often directed to the Eternal Father through the only_begotten Son , especially in the Eucharistic Sacrifice in which Christ , -atti_degli_apostoli- once Priest and Victim , exercises in a special manner the office of Mediator nevertheless not infrequently even in this Sacrifice , prayers are addressed to the Divine Redeemer also ; for all Christians must clearly know and understand_that the man Jesus Christ -isaia-_also the Son of God and God Himself . And thus , when_the Church Militant offers her adoration and prayers to the Immaculate Lamb , the Sacred Victim , her voice seems to re echo the never ending chorus of the Church Triumphant : '' To him_that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb benediction and honor and glory and power forever and ever . Venerable Brethren , in Our exposition of this_mystery which embraces the hidden union of us all with Christ , We have thus far , as Teacher of the Universal Church , illumined the mind with the light of truth , and Our pastoral_office now requires that We provide an incentive for the heart to love this Mystical Body with_that ardor of charity which_-isaia-_not confined to thoughts and words , but_which issues in deeds . If those_who lived under the Old Law could sing of their earthly city : '' If I forget thee , O Jerusalem , let my right hand be forgotten ; let my tongue cleave to my jaws if I do not remember thee , if I make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy , '' how_much greater then should be the joy and exultation that should fill our_hearts who dwell in a City built on the holy mountain of living and chosen stones , '' Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone . '' For nothing_more glorious , nothing nobler , nothing surely more honorable can be imagined than to belong to the One , Holy Catholic , Apostolic and Roman Church , in which we become members of One Body as venerable as it -isaia- unique ; are guided by one supreme Head ; are filled_with one divine Spirit ; are nourished during our earthly exile by one doctrine and one heavenly Bread , until -atti_degli_apostoli- last we enter_into the one , unending blessedness of heaven . But lest we be deceived by the angel of darkness who transforms himself into an angel of light , let this be the supreme law of our love : to love the Spouse of Christ as Christ willed her to be , and as He purchased her with His blood . Hence , not_only should we cherish exceedingly the Sacraments with_which holy Mother Church sustains our life , the solemn ceremonies which_she celebrates for our solace and our joy , the sacred chant and the liturgical rites by which_she lifts our minds up to heaven , but_also the sacramentals and all those exercises of piety by which_she consoles the hearts of the faithful and sweetly imbues them_with_the Spirit of Christ . As her_children , it -isaia-_our duty , not_only to make a return to her for her_maternal goodness to us , but_also to respect the authority which_she has received_from Christ in virtue of which_she brings into captivity our understanding unto the obedience of Christ . Thus we are commanded to obey her laws and her moral precepts , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- times they_are difficult to our fallen nature ; to bring our rebellious body into subjection through voluntary mortification ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- times we are warned to abstain even from harmless pleasures . Nor does it suffice to love this Mystical Body for the glory of its divine Head and for its heavenly_gifts ; we must love it with an effective love as it appears in this our mortal flesh made up , that_-isaia- , of weak human elements , even_though -atti_degli_apostoli- times they_are little fitted to the place which_they occupy in this venerable body . In order_that such a solid and undivided love may abide and increase in our souls day_by_day , we must accustom ourselves to see Christ Himself in the Church . For it -isaia- Christ who lives in His Church , and through_her , teaches , governs , and sanctifies ; it -isaia- Christ also who manifests Himself differently in different members of His society . If the faithful strive to live in a spirit of lively faith , they_will not_only pay due honor and reverence to the more exalted members of this Mystical Body , especially_those who according to Christ s mandate will_have to render an account of our souls , but they_will take to their_hearts those members who_are the object of our Savior s special love : the weak , We mean , the wounded , and the sick who_are in need of material or spiritual assistance ; children whose innocence -isaia- so easily exposed to danger in these_days , and whose young hearts can be molded as wax ; and finally the poor , in helping whom we recognize as it were , through His supreme mercy , the very person of Jesus Christ . For as the Apostle with good_reason admonishes us : '' Those that seem the more feeble members of the Body are_more necessary ; and those_that we think the less honorable members of the Body , we surround with more abundant honour . '' Conscious of the obligations of Our high office We deem it necessary to reiterate this grave statement today , when to Our profound grief We see -atti_degli_apostoli- times the deformed , the insane , and those suffering from hereditary disease deprived of their_lives , as though_they were a useless burden to Society ; and this procedure -isaia- hailed by some as a manifestation of human progress , and as something_that -isaia- entirely in accordance_with_the common_good . Yet who that_-isaia- possessed of sound judgment does_not recognize_that this not_only violates the natural and the divine_law written in the heart of every man , but_that it outrages the noblest instincts of humanity ? The blood of these unfortunate victims who_are all the dearer to our Redeemer because_they_are deserving of greater pity , '' cries to God from the earth . In order to guard against the gradual weakening of that sincere love_which requires us to see our Savior in the Church and in its_members , it -isaia- most fitting that_we_should look to Jesus Himself as a perfect model of love for the Church . And first of all let us imitate the breadth of His love . For the Church , the Bride of Christ , -isaia- one ; and yet so vast -isaia- the love of the divine Spouse that it embraces in His Bride the whole_human_race without exception . Our Savior shed His Blood precisely in order_that He might reconcile men to God through the Cross , and might constrain them to unite in one_body , however widely they_may differ in nationality and race . True love of the Church , therefore , requires not_only that_we_should be mutually solicitous one for another as members and sharing in their suffering but likewise that_we_should recognize in other men , although they_are_not yet joined to us in the body of the Church , our_brothers in Christ according to the flesh , called , together_with us , to the same eternal_salvation . It -isaia- true , unfortunately , especially today , that_there are are_some who extol enmity , hatred and spite as if they enhanced the dignity and the worth of man . Let us , however , while we look with sorrow on the disastrous consequences of this_teaching , follow our peaceful King who taught us to love not_only those_who_are of a different nation or race , but_even our enemies . While Our heart overflows with the sweetness of the teaching of the Apostle of the Gentiles , We extol with_him the length , and the breadth , and the height , and the depth of the charity of Christ , which neither diversity of race or customs can diminish , nor trackless wastes of the ocean weaken , nor wars , whether just or unjust , destroy . In this gravest of hours , Venerable Brethren , when bodies are racked with pain and souls are oppressed with grief , every_individual must be aroused to this supernatural charity so that , by the combined efforts of all good men , striving to outdo each_other in pity and mercy We have in mind especially , those_who_are engaged in any_kind of relief work the immense needs of mankind , both spiritual and corporal , may be alleviated , and the devoted generosity , the inexhaustible fruitfulness of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ , may shine resplendently throughout_the whole_world . As the vastness of the charity with_which Christ loved His Church -isaia- equalled by its constant activity , we all , with the same assiduous and zealous charity must love the Mystical Body of Christ . Now from the moment of His Incarnation , when he laid the first foundations of the Church , even to His last mortal breath , our Redeemer never ceased for an instant , though He was_the Son of God , to labor unto weariness in order to establish and strengthen His Church , whether by giving us the shining example of His holiness , or by preaching , or conversing , or gathering and instructing disciples . And so We desire_that all who claim the Church as their mother , should seriously consider that not_only the clergy and those_who_have consecrated themselves to God in the religious_life , but the other members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ as well have , each in his degree , the obligation of working hard and constantly for the building up and increase of this Body . We wish this to be borne in mind especially by members of Catholic Action who assist the Bishops and the priests in their apostolic labours and to their praise be it said , they do realize it and also by those members of pious associations which work_for the same end . There -isaia- no one who_does_not realize their energetic zeal -isaia- of the highest importance and of the greatest weight especially in the present circumstances . In this connection We cannot pass over in silence the fathers and mothers of families to whom our Savior has_entrusted the youngest members of His Mystical Body . We plead with_them most earnestly , for the love of Christ and the Church , to take the greatest possible care of the children confided to them , and to protect them_from the snares of every_kind into which_they can be lured so easily today . Our Redeemer showed His burning love for the Church especially by praying for_her to His heavenly Father . To recall but a few examples : everyone knows , Venerable Brethren , that just before the Crucifixion He prayed repeatedly for Peter , for the other Apostles , for all who , through the preaching of the holy Gospel would believe in Him . After the example of Christ we too should pray daily to the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into His harvest . Our united prayer should rise daily to heaven for all the members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ ; first for Bishops who_are responsible in a special_way for their_respective dioceses ; then for priests and religious , both men_and_women , who_have_been called to the service of God , and who , -atti_degli_apostoli- home and in the foreign missions , are protecting , increasing , and advancing the Kingdom of the Divine Redeemer . No member of this venerated Body must be forgotten in this common prayer ; and let there be a special remembrance of those_who_are weighed down with the sorrows and afflictions of this earthly exile , as also_for the suffering souls in Purgatory . Neither must those be neglected who are_being instructed in Christian doctrine , so that_they_may be able to receive baptism without delay . Likewise , We must earnestly desire_that this united prayer may embrace in the same ardent charity both those_who , not_yet enlightened by the truth of the Gospel , are_still outside the fold of the Church , and those_who , on account of regrettable schism , are separated_from Us , who though unworthy , represent the person of Jesus Christ on earth . Let us then re echo that divine prayer of our Savior to the heavenly Father : '' That they all may be one , as thou , Father , in me , and I in thee , that_they also may be one in us ; that_the_world may believe_that thou hast sent me . As you_know , Venerable Brethren , from the very_beginning of Our Pontificate , We have committed to the protection and guidance of heaven those who_do_not belong to the visible Body of the Catholic Church , solemnly declaring that after_the example of the Good Shepherd We desire nothing_more ardently than that_they_may have life and have it more abundantly . Imploring the prayers of the whole Church We wish to repeat this solemn declaration in this Encyclical Letter in which We have proclaimed the praises of the '' great and glorious Body of Christ '' and from a heart overflowing with love We ask each_and_every one of them to correspond to the interior movements of grace , and to seek to withdraw from that state in which they_cannot be sure of their salvation . For even_though by an unconscious desire and longing they_have a certain relationship_with the Mystical Body of the Redeemer , they still remain deprived of those many heavenly_gifts and helps which_can only be enjoyed in the Catholic Church . Therefore may_they enter_into Catholic unity and , joined with Us in the one , organic Body of Jesus Christ , may_they together_with us run on to the one Head in the Society of glorious love . Persevering in prayer to the Spirit of love and truth , We wait for them_with open and outstretched arms to come not to a stranger s house , but to their_own , their father s home . Though We desire this unceasing prayer to rise to God from the whole Mystical Body in common , that all the straying sheep may hasten to enter_the one fold of Jesus Christ , yet We recognize_that this_must be done of their_own free will ; for no one believes unless he wills to believe . Hence they are_most certainly not genuine Christians who against their belief are forced to go into a church , to approach the altar and to receive the Sacraments ; for the '' faith without which_it_-isaia- impossible to please God '' -isaia- an entirely free '' submission of intellect and will . '' Therefore , whenever it happens , despite the constant teaching of this Apostolic See , that anyone -isaia- compelled to embrace the Catholic faith against his_will , Our sense of duty demands_that We condemn the act . For men must be effectively drawn to the truth by the Father of light through the spirit of His beloved Son , because , endowed as they_are with free will , they_can misuse their freedom under the impulse of mental agitation and base desires . Unfortunately many are_still wandering far from the Catholic truth , being unwilling to follow_the inspirations of divine_grace , because neither they nor the faithful pray to God with sufficient fervor for_this intention . Again and again We beg all we ardently love the Church to follow_the example of the Divine Redeemer and to give themselves constantly to such prayer . And likewise , above all in the present crisis , it seems to Us not_only opportune but necessary_that earnest supplications should be offered for kings , princes , and for all those_who govern nations and are thus in a position to assist the Church by their protecting power , so that , the conflict ended , '' peace , the work of justice '' under the impulse of divine charity may emerge from out this raging tempest and be restored to wearied man , and that holy Mother Church '' may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all piety and chastity . '' We must plead with God to grant that the rulers of nations may love wisdom , so that the severe judgment of the Holy spirit may never fall on them : '' Because being ministers of His Kingdom you have_not judged rightly , not kept the law of Justice , nor walked according to the will of God ; horribly and speedily will he appear to you ; for a most severe judgment shall be for them that bear rule . For to him that_-isaia- little , mercy shall be granted ; but the mighty shall be mightily tormented . For God will_not except any man s person , neither will he stand in awe of any man s greatness ; for he made the little and the great , and he hath equally care of all . But a greater punishment -isaia- ready for the more mighty . To you , therefore , O Kings , these_are my words , that_you_may learn wisdom and not fall from it . Moreover , Christ proved His love for His spotless Bride not_only -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of immense labor and constant prayer , but by His sorrows and His sufferings which He willingly and lovingly endured for_her sake . '' Having loved His own . He loved them unto the end . '' Indeed it was only -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of His Blood that He purchased the Church . Let us then follow gladly in the bloodstained footsteps of our King , for this_-isaia- necessary to ensure our_salvation : '' For if we have_been planted together in the likeness of His Resurrection . '' and '' if we be dead with_him , we shall live also_with Him . '' Also our zealous love for the Church demands it , and our brotherly_love for the souls she brings forth to Christ . For although our Savior s cruel passion and death merited for His Church an infinite treasure of graces , God s inscrutable providence has decreed that_these graces should_not be granted to us all -atti_degli_apostoli- once ; but their greater or lesser abundance will depend in no small part on our_own good_works , which draw down on the souls of men a rain of heavenly_gifts freely bestowed by God . These heavenly_gifts will surely flow more abundantly if we not_only pray fervently to God , especially by participating every_day if possible in the Eucharistic Sacrifice ; if we not_only try to relieve the distress of the needy and of the sick by works of Christian charity , but if we also set our_hearts on the good things of eternity rather_than on the passing things of this_world ; if we restrain this mortal body by voluntary mortification , denying it what_-isaia- forbidden , and by forcing it to do what_-isaia- hard and distasteful ; and finally , if we humbly accept as from God s hands the burdens and sorrows of this present life . Thus , according to the Apostle , '' we shall fill up those things_that_are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in our flesh for His Body , which_-isaia- the Church . As We write these_words there passes before Our eyes , alas , an almost endless throng of unfortunate beings for_whom We shed tears of sorrow ; sick , poor , disabled , widows , orphans , and many not infrequently languishing even unto death on account of their_own painful trials or those of their_families . With the heart of a father We exhort all those_who from whatever cause are plunged in grief and anguish to lift their_eyes trustfully to heaven and to offer their sorrows to Him who_will one_day reward them abundantly . Let them all remember_that their sufferings are_not in vain , but that_they_will turn to their_own immense gain and that of the Church , if to this_end they bear them_with patience . The daily use of the offering made by the members of the Apostleship of Prayer will contribute very much to make_this intention more efficacious and We welcome this opportunity of recommending this Association highly , as one which_-isaia- most pleasing to God . There never was a time , Venerable Brethren , when_the salvation_of_souls did_not impose on all the duty of associating their sufferings with the torments of our Divine Redeemer . But today that duty -isaia- more clear than_ever , when a gigantic conflict has set almost the whole_world on fire and leaves in its wake so much death , so much misery , so much hardship ; in the same_way today , in a special manner , it -isaia-_the_duty of all to fly from vice , the attraction of the world , the unrestrained pleasures of the body , and also from worldly frivolity and vanity which contribute nothing to the Christian training of the soul nor to the gaining of Heaven . Rather let those weighty words of Our immortal predecessor Leo the Great be deeply engraven upon our minds , that by Baptism we are made_flesh of the Crucified : and that beautiful prayer of St . Ambrose : '' Carry me , Christ , on the Cross , which_-isaia- salvation to the wanderers , sole rest for the wearied , wherein alone_-isaia- life_for those_who die . Before concluding , We cannot refrain from again_and_again exhorting all to love holy Mother Church with a devoted and active love . If we have really -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the salvation of the whole human_family , purchased by the precious Blood , we must offer every_day to the Eternal Father our prayers , works and sufferings , for_her safety and for_her continued and ever_more fruitful increase . And while the skies are heavy with storm clouds , and exceeding great dangers threaten the whole of human Society and the Church herself , let us commit ourselves and all that_we_have to the Father of Mercies , crying out : '' Look down , we beseech Thee , Lord , on this Thy family , for_which our Lord Jesus Christ did not_hesitate to be betrayed into the hands of evil men and to undergo the torment of the Cross . Venerable Brethren , may the Virgin Mother of God hear_the prayers of Our paternal heart which_are yours also and obtain for all a true love of the Church she whose sinless soul was filled_with_the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls , who '' in the name of the whole_human_race '' gave her consent '' for a spiritual marriage between_the Son of God and human_nature . '' Within her virginal womb Christ our Lord already bore the exalted title of Head of the Church ; in a marvelous birth she brought Him forth as the source of all supernatural life , and presented Him newly born , as Prophet , King and Priest to those_who , from among Jews and Gentiles , were_the first to come to adore Him . Furthermore , her only Son , condescending to His mother s prayer in '' Cana of Galilee , '' performed the miracle by which '' his_disciples believed in Him . '' It was she , the second Eve , who , free_from all sin , original or personal , and always more intimately united with_her Son , offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father for all the children of Adam , sin stained by his unhappy fall , and her mother s rights and her mother s love were included in the holocaust . Thus she_who , according to the flesh , was_the mother of our Head , through the added title of pain and glory became , according to the Spirit , the mother of all His members . She it was through_her powerful prayers obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer , already given on the Cross , should be bestowed , accompanied by miraculous gifts , on the newly founded Church -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost ; and finally , bearing with courage and confidence the tremendous burden of her sorrows and desolation , she , truly the Queen of Martyrs , more_than all the faithful '' filled up those things_that_are wanting of the sufferings of Christ . for His Body , which_-isaia- the Church '' ; and she continues to have for the Mystical Body of Christ , born of the pierced Heart of the Savior , the same motherly care and ardent love with_which she cherished and fed the Infant Jesus in the crib . May she , then , the most_holy Mother of all the members of Christ , to whose Immaculate Heart We have trustfully consecrated all mankind , and who now reigns in heaven with_her Son , her body_and_soul refulgent with heavenly glory may she never cease to beg from Him that copious streams of grace may flow from its exalted Head into all the members of the Mystical Body . May she throw about the Church today , as in times gone by , the mantle of her protection and obtain from God that now -atti_degli_apostoli- least the Church and all mankind may enjoy more peaceful days . Confiding in this sublime hope , from an overflowing heart We impart to you , one and all , Venerable Brethren , and to the flocks entrusted_to_your care , as a pledge of heavenly graces and a token of Our special affection , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on the twenty ninth day of June , the Feast of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul , in the year , the fifth of Our Pontificate .

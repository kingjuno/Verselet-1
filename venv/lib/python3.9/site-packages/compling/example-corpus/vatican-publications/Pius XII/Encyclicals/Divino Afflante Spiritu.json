'' This heaven sent treasure Holy Church considers as the most_precious source of doctrine on faith_and_morals . No wonder herefore that , as she received it intact from the hands of the Apostles , so she kept it with all care , defended it from every false and perverse interpretation and used it diligently as an instrument for securing the eternal salvation_of_souls , as almost countless documents in every_age strikingly bear_witness . In more recent_times , however , since_the divine origin and the correct interpretation of the Sacred Writings have_been very specially called in question , the Church has with even greater zeal and care undertaken their defense and protection . The sacred Council of Trent ordained by solemn decree that '' the entire books with all their parts , as they_have_been wont to be read in the Catholic Church and are contained in the old vulgate Latin edition , are to be held sacred and canonical . '' In our own_time the Vatican Council , with the object of condemning false doctrines regarding inspiration , declared that_these same books were to be regarded by the Church as sacred and canonical '' not because , having_been composed by human industry , they_were afterwards approved by her authority , nor merely because_they contain revelation without error , but because , having_been written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , they_have God for their author , and as such were handed_down to the Church herself . '' When , subsequently , some Catholic writers , in spite of this solemn definition of Catholic doctrine , by which such divine authority_-isaia- claimed for the '' entire books with all their parts '' as to secure freedom from any error whatsoever , ventured to restrict the truth of Sacred Scripture solely to matters of faith_and_morals , and to regard other matters , whether in the domain of physical science or history , as '' obiter dicta '' and as they contended in no wise connected_with faith , Our Predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII in the Encyclical Letter Providentissimus Deus , published on November in the year , justly and rightly condemned these errors and safe guarded the studies of the Divine Books by most wise precepts and rules . Since then it -isaia- fitting_that We should commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of this Encyclical Letter , which_-isaia- considered the supreme guide in biblical studies , We , moved by that solicitude for sacred studies , which We manifested from the very_beginning of Our Pontificate , have considered that_this may most opportunely be done by ratifying and inculcating all that_was wisely laid_down by Our Predecessor and ordained by His Successors for the consolidating and perfecting of the work , and by pointing out what seems necessary in the present_day , in order to incite ever_more earnestly all those sons of the Church who devote_themselves to these studies , to so necessary and so praiseworthy an enterprise . The first and greatest care of Leo XIII was to set_forth the teaching on the truth of the Sacred Books and to defend it from attack . Hence with grave words did he proclaim that_there_-isaia- no error whatsoever if the sacred writer , speaking of things of the physical order '' went by what sensibly appeared '' as the Angelic Doctor says , speaking either '' in figurative language , or in terms which_were commonly used -atti_degli_apostoli- the time , and which in many instances are in daily use -atti_degli_apostoli- this_day , even among the most eminent men of science . '' For '' the sacred writers , or to speak more accurately the words are St . Augustine s the Holy Spirit , Who spoke by them , did_not intend to teach men these_things that_-isaia- the essential nature of the things of the universe things in no way profitable to salvation '' ; which principle '' will apply to cognate sciences , and especially to history , '' that_-isaia- , by refuting , '' in a somewhat similar way the fallacies of the adversaries and defending the historical truth of Sacred Scripture from their attacks . '' Nor -isaia- the sacred writer to be taxed with error , if '' copyists have_made mistakes in the text of the Bible , '' or , '' if the real meaning of a passage remains ambiguous . '' Finally it -isaia- absolutely wrong and forbidden '' either to narrow inspiration to certain passages of Holy Scripture , or to admit that the sacred writer has erred , '' since divine inspiration '' not_only -isaia- essentially incompatible with error but excludes and rejects it as absolutely and necessarily as it -isaia- impossible that God Himself , the supreme Truth , can utter that_which_-isaia- not true . This -isaia- the ancient and constant faith of the Church . This teaching , which Our Predecessor Leo XIII set_forth with_such solemnity , We also proclaim with Our authority and We urge all to adhere to it religiously . No less earnestly do We inculcate obedience -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day to the counsels and exhortations which he , in his day , so wisely enjoined . For whereas there arose new and serious difficulties and questions , from the wide spread prejudices of rationalism and more especially from the discovery and investigation of the antiquities of the East , this_same Our Predecessor , moved by zeal of the apostolic_office , not_only that_such an excellent source of Catholic revelation might be more securely and abundantly available to the advantage of the Christian flock , but_also that_he_might not suffer it to be in any_way tainted , wished and most earnestly desired '' to see an increase in the number of the approved and persevering laborers in the cause of Holy Scripture ; and more especially that_those whom Divine Grace has called to Holy Orders , should day_by_day , as their state demands , display greater diligence and industry in reading , meditating and explaining it . Wherefore the same Pontiff , as he had_already praised and approved the school for biblical studies , founded -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Stephen s , Jerusalem , by the Master General of the Sacred Order of Preachers from which , to use his_own words , '' biblical science itself had received no small advantage , while giving promise of more '' so in the last year of his_life he provided yet another way , by which these same studies , so warmly commended in the Encyclical Letter Providentissimus Deus , might daily make greater progress and be pursued with the greatest possible security . By the Apostolic Letter Vigilantiae , published on October in the year , he founded a Council or Commission , as it -isaia- called , of eminent men , '' whose duty it would be to procure by every_means that the sacred texts may receive everywhere among us that more thorough exposition which_the times demand , and be kept safe not_only from every breath of error , but_also from all inconsiderate opinions . '' Following the example of Our Predecessors , We also have effectively confirmed and amplified this Council using its good offices , as often before , to remind commentators of the Sacred Books of those safe rules of Catholic exegesis , which_have_been handed_down by the Holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church , as well as by the Sovereign Pontiffs themselves . It may_not be out of place here to recall gratefully the principal and more useful contributions made successively by Our Predecessors toward this_same end , which contributions may be considered as the complement or fruit of the movement so happily initiated by Leo XIII . And first of all Pius X , wishing '' to provide a sure way_for the preparation of a copious supply of teachers , who , commended by the seriousness and the integrity of their doctrine , might explain the Sacred Books in Catholic schools . '' instituted '' the academic_degrees of licentiate and doctorate in Sacred Scripture . ; to be conferred by the Biblical Commission '' ; he later enacted a law '' concerning the method of Scripture studies to be followed in Clerical Seminaries '' with this_end in view , viz . : that students of the sacred sciences '' not_only should themselves fully understand_the power , purpose and teaching of the Bible , but should_also be equipped to engage in the ministry of the Divine Word with elegance and ability and repel attacks against the divinely inspired books '' ; finally '' in order_that a center of higher biblical studies might be established in Rome , which in the best way possible might promote the study of the Bible and all cognate sciences in accordance_with_the mind of the Catholic Church '' he founded the Pontifical Biblical Institute , entrusted to the care of the illustrious Society of Jesus , which he wished endowed '' with a superior professorial staff and every facility for biblical research '' ; he prescribed its laws and rules , professing to follow in this_the '' salutary and fruitful project '' of Leo XIII . All this in fine Our immediate Predecessor of happy_memory Pius XI brought to perfection , laying down among other_things '' that_no_one should be appointed professor of Sacred Scripture in any Seminary , unless , having completed a special course of biblical studies , he had in due form obtained the academic_degrees before the Biblical Commission or the Biblical Institute . '' He wished that_these degrees should_have the same rights and the same effects as the degrees duly conferred in Sacred Theology or Canon Law ; likewise he decreed that_no_one should receive '' a benefice having attached the canonical obligation of expounding the Sacred Scripture to the people , unless , among other_things , he had obtained the licentiate or doctorate in biblical science . '' And having -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time urged the Superiors General of the Regular Orders and of the religious Congregations , as well as the Bishops of the Catholic world , to send the more suitable of their students to frequent the schools of the Biblical Institute and obtain there the academical degrees , he confirmed these exhortations by his_own example , appointing out of his bounty an annual sum for this_very purpose . Seeing that , in the year , with the benign approval of Pius X of happy_memory , '' to the Benedictine monks had_been committed the task of preparing the investigations and studies on which might be based a new edition of the Latin version of the Scripture , commonly called the Vulgate , the same Pontiff , Pius XI , wishing to consolidate more firmly and securely this '' laborious and arduous enterprise , '' which demands considerable time and great expense , founded in Rome and lavishly endowed_with a library and other means of research , the monastery of St . Jerome , to be devoted exclusively to this_work . Nor should We fail to mention here how earnestly these same Our Predecessors , when_the opportunity occurred , recommended the study or preaching or in fine the pious reading and meditation on the Sacred Scriptures . Pius X most heartily commended the society of St . Jerome , which strives to promote among the faithful and to facilitate with all its power the truly praiseworthy custom of reading and meditating on the holy Gospels ; he exhorted them to persevere in the enterprise they_had begun , proclaiming it '' a most useful undertaking , as well as most suited to the times , '' seeing that it helps in no small way '' to dissipate the idea that the Church -isaia- opposed to or in any_way impedes the reading of the Scriptures in the vernacular . '' And Benedict XV , on the occasion of the fifteenth centenary of the death of St . Jerome , the greatest Doctor of the Sacred Scriptures , after_having most solemnly inculcated the precepts and examples of the same Doctor , as well as the principles and rules laid_down by Leo XIII and by himself , and having recommended other_things highly opportune and never to be forgotten in this connection , exhorted '' all the children of the Church , especially clerics , to reverence the Holy Scripture , to read it piously and meditate it constantly '' ; he reminded them '' that in these pages -isaia- to be sought that food , by which_the spiritual_life -isaia- nourished unto perfection , '' and '' that the chief use of Scripture pertains to the holy and fruitful exercise of the ministry of preaching '' ; he likewise once_again expressed his warm approval of the work of the society called after St . Jerome himself , by means of which_the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles are_being so widely diffused , '' that_there_-isaia- no Christian family any more without them and that all are accustomed to read and meditate them daily . But it -isaia- right and pleasing to confess openly that it -isaia-_not_only by reason of these initiatives , precepts and exhortations of Our Predecessors that the knowledge and use of the Sacred Scriptures have_made great progress among Catholics ; for_this -isaia-_also due to the works and labors of all those_who diligently cooperated with_them , both by meditating , investigating and writing , as well as by teaching and preaching and by translating and propagating the Sacred Books . For from the schools in which_are fostered higher studies in theological and biblical science , and especially from Our Pontifical Biblical Institute , there have_already come forth , and daily continue to come forth , many students of Holy Scripture who , inspired with an intense love for the Sacred Books , imbue the younger clergy with this_same ardent zeal and assiduously impart to them the doctrine they_themselves have acquired . Many of them also , by the written word , have promoted and do still promote , far and wide , the study of the Bible ; as when_they edit the sacred text corrected in accordance_with_the rules of textual criticism or expound , explain , and translate it into the vernacular ; or when_they propose it to the faithful for their pious reading and meditation ; or finally when_they cultivate and seek the aid of profane sciences which_are useful for the interpretation of the Scriptures . From these therefore and from other initiatives which daily become more wide spread and vigorous , as , for example , biblical societies , congresses , libraries , associations for meditation on the Gospels , We firmly hope_that in the future reverence for , as well as the use and knowledge of , the Sacred Scriptures will everywhere more_and_more increase for the good of souls , provided the method of biblical studies laid_down by Leo XIII , explained more_clearly and perfectly by his Successors , and by Us confirmed and amplified which indeed -isaia-_the_only safe way and proved by experience be more firmly , eagerly and faithfully accepted by all , regardless of the difficulties which , as in all human affairs , so in this_most excellent work will_never be wanting . There -isaia- no one_who cannot easily perceive that the conditions of biblical studies and their subsidiary sciences have greatly changed within_the last fifty years . For , apart_from anything else , when Our Predecessor published the Encyclical Letter Providentissimus Deus , hardly a single place in Palestine had begun to be explored by means of relevant excavations . Now , however , this_kind of investigation -isaia- much_more frequent and , since more precise methods and technical skill have_been developed in the course of actual experience , it gives us information -atti_degli_apostoli- once_more abundant and more accurate . How much light has_been derived_from these explorations for the more correct and fuller understanding of the Sacred Books all experts know , as well as all those_who devote_themselves to these studies . The value of these excavations -isaia- enhanced by the discovery from time to time of written documents , which help much towards_the knowledge of the languages , letters , events , customs , and forms of worship of most ancient times . And of no less importance -isaia- papyri which_have contributed so much to the knowledge of the discovery and investigation , so frequent in our_times , of letters and institutions , both public_and_private , especially of the time of Our Savior . Moreover ancient codices of the Sacred Books have_been found and edited with discerning thoroughness ; the exegesis of the Fathers of the Church has_been more widely and thoroughly examined ; in fine the manner of speaking , relating and writing in use among the ancients -isaia- made clear by innumerable examples . All these advantages which , not_without a special design of Divine Providence , our_age has acquired , are as it were an invitation and inducement to interpreters of the Sacred Literature to make diligent use of this light , so abundantly given , to penetrate more_deeply , explain more_clearly and expound more lucidly the Divine Oracles . If , with the greatest satisfaction of mind , We perceive that_these same interpreters have resolutely answered and still continue to answer this call , this_-isaia- certainly not the last or least of the fruits of the Encyclical Letter Providentissimus Deus , by which Our Predecessor Leo XIII , foreseeing as it were this_new development of biblical studies , summoned Catholic exegetes to labor and wisely defined the direction and the method to be followed in that labor . We also , by this Encyclical Letter , desire to insure that the work may not_only proceed without interruption , but may also daily become more_perfect and fruitful ; and to that end We are specially intent on pointing out to all what yet remains to be done , with what spirit the Catholic exegete should undertake , -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day , so great and noble a work , and to give new incentive and fresh courage to the laborers who toil so strenuously in the vineyard of the Lord . The Fathers of the Church in their time , especially Augustine , warmly recommended to the Catholic scholar , who undertook the investigation and explanation of the Sacred Scriptures , the study of the ancient languages and recourse to the original texts . However , such was_the state of letters in those times , that_not many and these few but imperfectly knew the Hebrew language . In the middle ages , when Scholastic Theology was -atti_degli_apostoli- the height of its vigor , the knowledge of even the Greek language had long since become so rare in the West , that_even the greatest Doctors of that_time , in their exposition of the Sacred Text , had recourse only to the Latin version , known as the Vulgate . On the contrary in this our_time , not_only the Greek language , which since_the humanistic renaissance has_been , as it were , restored to new_life , -isaia- familiar to almost all students of antiquity and letters , but the knowledge of Hebrew also and of their oriental languages has spread far and wide among literary men . Moreover there_are now such abundant aids to the study of these languages that the biblical scholar , who by neglecting them would deprive himself of access to the original texts , could in no wise escape the stigma of levity and sloth . For it -isaia-_the_duty of the exegete to lay hold , so to speak , with the greatest care and reverence of the very least expressions which , under the inspiration of the Divine Spirit , have flowed from the pen of the sacred writer , so as to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper and fuller knowledge of his meaning . Wherefore let_him diligently apply himself so as to acquire daily a greater facility in biblical as well as in other oriental languages and to support his interpretation by the aids which all branches of philology supply . Jerome strove earnestly to achieve , as far as the science of his time permitted ; to this also aspired with untiring zeal and no small fruit not_a_few of the great exegetes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , although the knowledge of languages then was much less_than -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day . In like_manner therefore ought we to explain the original text which , having_been written by the inspired author himself , has more authority and greater weight than_any even the very best translation , whether ancient or modern ; this_can be done all the more_easily and fruitfully , if to the knowledge of languages be joined a real skill in literary criticism of the same text . The great_importance which_should be attached to this_kind of criticism was aptly pointed_out by Augustine , when , among the precepts to be recommended to the student of the Sacred Books , he put in the first_place the care to possess a corrected text . '' The correction of the codices '' so says this_most distinguished Doctor of the Church '' should first of all engage the attention of those_who wish to know_the Divine Scripture so that the uncollected may give place to the corrected . '' In the present_day indeed this art , which_-isaia- called textual criticism and which_-isaia- used with_great and praiseworthy results in the editions of profane writings , -isaia-_also quite rightly employed in the case of the Sacred Books , because of that_very reverence which_-isaia- due to the Divine Oracles . For its_very purpose -isaia- to insure that the sacred text be restored , as perfectly as possible , be purified from the corruptions due to the carelessness of the copyists and be freed , as far as may be done , from glosses and omissions , from the interchange and repetition of words and from all other kinds of mistakes , which_are wont to make_their way gradually into writings handed_down through many centuries . It -isaia- scarcely necessary to observe that_this criticism , which some fifty years_ago not_a_few made use of quite arbitrarily and often in such wise that_one would say they did so to introduce into the sacred text their_own preconceived ideas , today has rules so firmly established and secure , that it has become a most valuable aid to the purer and more accurate editing of the sacred text and that any abuse can easily be discovered . Nor -isaia- it necessary here to call to mind since_it_-isaia- doubtless familiar and evident to all students of Sacred Scripture to what extent namely the Church has held in honor these studies in textual criticism from the earliest centuries down even to the present_day . Today therefore , since_this branch of science has attained to such high perfection , it -isaia- the honorable , though not_always easy , task of students of the Bible to procure by every_means that as soon as possible may be duly published by Catholics editions of the Sacred Books and of ancient versions , brought out in accordance_with these standards , which , that_-isaia- to say , unite the greatest reverence for the sacred text with an exact observance of all the rules of criticism . And let all know_that this prolonged labor -isaia-_not_only necessary_for the right understanding of the divinely given writings , but_also -isaia- urgently demanded by that piety by which it behooves us to be grateful to the God of all providence , Who from the throne of His majesty has_sent these books as so many paternal letters to His own children . Nor should anyone think_that this use of the original texts , in accordance_with_the methods of criticism , in any_way derogates from those decrees so wisely enacted by the Council of Trent concerning the Latin Vulgate . It -isaia- historically certain_that the Presidents of the Council received a commission , which_they duly carried_out , to beg , that_-isaia- , the Sovereign Pontiff in the name of the Council that he should_have corrected , as far_as_possible , first a Latin , and then a Greek , and Hebrew edition , which eventually would be published for the benefit of the Holy Church of God . If this desire could_not then be fully realized owing to the difficulties of the times and other obstacles , -atti_degli_apostoli- present it can , We earnestly hope , be more perfectly and entirely fulfilled by the united efforts of Catholic scholars . And if the Tridentine Synod wished '' that all should use as authentic '' the Vulgate Latin version , this , as all know , applies only to the Latin Church and to the public use of the same Scriptures ; nor_does it , doubtless , in any_way diminish the authority and value of the original texts . For there_was no question then of these texts , but of the Latin versions , which_were in circulation -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , and of these the same Council rightly declared to be preferable that_which '' had_been approved by its long continued use for so many centuries in the Church . '' Hence this special authority or as they_say , authenticity of the Vulgate was_not affirmed by the Council particularly for critical reasons , but_rather because of its legitimate use in the Churches throughout so many centuries ; by which use indeed the same -isaia- shown , in the sense in which_the Church has understood and understands it , to be free_from any error whatsoever in matters of faith_and_morals ; so that , as the Church herself testifies and affirms , it may be quoted safely and without fear of error in disputations , in lectures and in preaching ; and so its authenticity -isaia- not specified primarily as critical , but_rather as juridical . Wherefore this authority of the Vulgate in matters of doctrine by no means prevents nay rather today it almost demands either the corroboration and confirmation of this_same doctrine by the original texts or the having recourse on any and every occasion to the aid of these same texts , by which_the correct meaning of the Sacred Letters -isaia- everywhere daily made more clear and evident . Nor -isaia- it forbidden by the decree of the Council of Trent to make translations into the vulgar tongue , even directly from the original texts themselves , for the use and benefit of the faithful and for the better understanding of the divine_word , as We know to have_been already done in a laudable manner in many countries with the approval of the Ecclesiastical authority . Being thoroughly prepared by the knowledge of the ancient languages and by the aids afforded by the art of criticism , let_the Catholic exegete undertake the task , of all those imposed on him the greatest , that namely of discovering and expounding the genuine meaning of the Sacred Books . In the performance of this_task let_the interpreters bear in mind that_their foremost and greatest endeavor should be to discern and define clearly that sense of the biblical words which_-isaia- called literal . Aided by the context and by comparison with similar passages , let_them therefore by means of their knowledge of languages search out with all diligence the literal meaning of the words ; all these helps indeed are wont to be pressed into service in the explanation also of profane writers , so that the mind of the author may be made abundantly clear . The commentators of the Sacred Letters , mindful of the fact_that here there_-isaia- question of a divinely inspired text , the care and interpretation of which_have_been confided to the Church by God Himself , should no less diligently take into_account_the explanations and declarations of the teaching_authority of the Church , as likewise the interpretation given by the Holy Fathers , and even '' the analogy of faith '' as Leo XIII most wisely observed in the Encyclical Letter Providentissimus Deus . With special zeal should they apply themselves , not_only to expounding exclusively these_matters which belong to the historical , archaeological , philological and other auxiliary sciences as , to Our regret , -isaia- done in certain commentaries but , having duly referred to these , in so far as they_may aid the exegesis , they_should set_forth in particular the theological doctrine in faith_and_morals of the individual books or texts so that_their exposition may not_only aid the professors of theology in their explanations and proofs of the dogmas of faith , but may also be of assistance to priests in their presentation of Christian doctrine to the people , and in fine may help all the faithful to lead a life that_-isaia- holy and worthy of a Christian . By making such an exposition , which_-isaia- above all , as We have_said , theological , they_will efficaciously reduce to silence those_who , affirming that_they scarcely ever find anything in biblical commentaries to raise their_hearts to God , to nourish their_souls or promote their interior life , repeatedly urge that_we_should have_recourse to a certain spiritual and , as they_say , mystical interpretation . With what little reason they thus speak -isaia- shown by the experience of many , who , assiduously considering and meditating the word of God , advanced in perfection and were moved to an intense love for God ; and this_same truth_-isaia- clearly proved by the constant tradition of the Church and the precepts of the greatest Doctors . Doubtless all spiritual sense -isaia- not excluded from the Sacred Scripture . For what_was said and done in the Old Testament was ordained and disposed by God with_such consummate wisdom , that things past prefigured in a spiritual way those_that were to come under the new dispensation of grace . Wherefore the exegete , just as he must search out and expound the literal meaning of the words , intended and expressed by the sacred writer , so also must he do likewise for the spiritual sense , provided it -isaia- clearly intended by God . For God alone could have known this spiritual meaning and have revealed it to us . Now Our Divine Savior Himself points_out to us and teaches us this_same sense in the Holy Gospel ; the Apostles also , following_the_example of the Master , profess it in their spoken and written words ; the unchanging tradition of the Church approves it ; and finally the most ancient usage of the liturgy proclaims it , wherever may be rightly applied the well_known principle : '' The rule of prayer_-isaia- the rule of faith . Let Catholic exegetes then disclose and expound this spiritual significance , intended and ordained by God , with_that care which_the dignity of the divine_word demands ; but let_them scrupulously refrain from proposing as the genuine meaning of Sacred Scripture other figurative senses . It may indeed be useful , especially in preaching , to illustrate , and present_the matters of faith_and_morals by a broader use of the Sacred Text in the figurative sense , provided this be done with moderation and restraint ; it should , however , never be forgotten that_this use of the Sacred Scripture -isaia- , as it were , extrinsic to it and accidental , and that , especially in these_days , it -isaia- not free_from danger , since_the faithful , in particular those_who_are well informed in the sciences sacred and profane , wish to know what God has told us in the Sacred Letters rather_than what an ingenious orator or writer may suggest by a clever use of the words of Scripture . Nor does '' the word of God , living and effectual and more piercing than_any two edged sword and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit , of the joints also and the marrow , and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart '' need artificial devices and human adaptation to move and impress souls ; for the Sacred Pages , written under the inspiration of the Spirit of God , are of themselves rich in original meaning ; endowed_with a divine power , they have_their own value ; adorned with heavenly beauty , they radiate of themselves light and splendor , provided they_are so fully and accurately explained by the interpreter , that all the treasures of wisdom and prudence , therein contained are brought to light . In the accomplishment of this_task the Catholic exegete will_find invaluable help in an assiduous study of those works , in which_the Holy Fathers , the Doctors of the Church and the renowned interpreters of past ages have explained the Sacred Books . For , although sometimes less instructed in profane learning and in the knowledge of languages than the scripture scholars of our_time , nevertheless by reason of the office assigned to them by God in the Church , they_are distinguished by a certain subtle insight into heavenly things and by a marvelous keenness of intellect , which enables them to penetrate to the very innermost meaning of the divine_word and bring to light all that can_help to elucidate the teaching of Christ and to promote holiness of life . It -isaia- indeed regrettable that_such precious treasures of Christian antiquity are almost unknown to many writers of the present_day , and that students of the history of exegesis have_not yet accomplished all that seems necessary_for the due investigation and appreciation of so momentous a subject . Would that_many , by seeking out the authors of the Catholic interpretation of Scripture and diligently studying their works and drawing thence the almost inexhaustible riches therein stored up , might contribute largely to this_end , so that it might be daily more apparent to what extent those authors understood and made_known the divine teaching of the Sacred Books , and that the interpreters of today might thence take example and seek suitable arguments . For thus -atti_degli_apostoli- long last will be brought_about the happy and fruitful union between_the doctrine and spiritual sweetness of expression of the ancient authors and the greater erudition and maturer knowledge of the modern , having as its result new progress in the never fully explored and inexhaustible field of the Divine Letters . Moreover we may rightly and deservedly hope_that our_time also can contribute something towards_the deeper and more accurate interpretation of Sacred Scripture . For not_a_few things , especially in matters pertaining to history , were scarcely -atti_degli_apostoli- all or not fully explained by the commentators of past ages , since_they lacked almost all the information which_was needed_for their clearer exposition . How difficult for the Fathers themselves , and indeed well nigh unintelligible , were certain passages -isaia- shown , among other_things , by the oft repeated efforts of many of them to explain the first chapters of Genesis ; likewise by the reiterated attempts of St . Jerome so to translate the Psalms that the literal sense , that , namely , which_-isaia- expressed by the words themselves , might be clearly revealed . There are , in fine , other books or texts , which contain difficulties brought to light only in quite recent_times , since a more profound knowledge of antiquity has_given rise to new questions , on the basis of which_the point -atti_degli_apostoli- issue may be more appropriately examined . Quite wrongly therefore do some pretend , not rightly understanding the conditions of biblical study , that_nothing remains to be added by the Catholic exegete of our_time to what Christian antiquity has produced ; since , on the contrary , these our_times have brought to light so many things , which call_for a fresh investigation , and which stimulate not a little the practical zest of the present_day interpreter . As in our_age , indeed new questions and new difficulties are multiplied , so , by God s favor , new means and aids to exegesis are_also provided . Among these it -isaia- worthy of special mention that Catholic theologians , following the teaching of the Holy Fathers and especially of the Angelic and Common Doctor , have examined and explained the nature and effects of biblical inspiration more exactly and more_fully than was wont to be done in previous ages . For having begun by expounding minutely the principle that the inspired writer , in composing the sacred book , -isaia- the living and reasonable instrument of the Holy Spirit , they rightly observe that , impelled by the divine motion , he so uses his faculties and powers , that_from the book composed by him all may easily infer '' the special character of each_one and , as it were , his personal traits . '' Let the interpreter then , with all care and without neglecting any light derived_from recent research , endeavor to determine the peculiar character and circumstances of the sacred writer , the age in which he lived , the sources written or oral to which_he_had recourse and the forms of expression he employed . Thus can he the better understand who was_the inspired author , and what he wishes to express by his writings . There -isaia- no one indeed but knows that the supreme rule of interpretation -isaia- to discover and define what_the writer intended to express , as St . Athanasius excellently observes : '' Here , as indeed -isaia- expedient in all other passages of Sacred Scripture , it should be noted , on what occasion the Apostle spoke ; we should carefully and faithfully observe to whom and why he wrote , lest , being ignorant of these points , or confounding one_with another , we miss the real meaning of the author . What -isaia- the literal sense of a passage -isaia- not_always as obvious in the speeches and writings of the ancient authors of the East , as it -isaia- in the works of our own_time . For what_they wished to express -isaia- not to be determined by the rules of grammar and philology alone , nor solely by the context ; the interpreter must , as it were , go back wholly in spirit to those remote centuries of the East and with the aid of history , archaeology , ethnology , and other sciences , accurately determine what modes of writing , so to speak , the authors of that ancient period would be likely to use , and in fact did use . For the ancient peoples of the East , in order to express their ideas , did not_always employ those forms or kinds of speech which we use today ; but_rather those used by the men of their times and countries . What those exactly were_the commentator cannot determine as it were in advance , but_only after a careful examination of the ancient literature of the East . The investigation , carried_out , on this_point , during the past forty or fifty years with_greater care and diligence than_ever before , has more_clearly shown what forms of expression were used in those far off times , whether in poetic description or in the formulation of laws and rules of life or in recording the facts and events of history . The same inquiry has_also shown the special preeminence of the people of Israel among all the other ancient nations of the East in their mode of compiling history , both by reason of its antiquity and by reasons of the faithful record of the events ; qualities which_may well be attributed to the gift of divine inspiration and to the peculiar religious purpose of biblical history . Nevertheless no one , who_has a correct idea of biblical inspiration , will be surprised to find , even in the Sacred Writers , as in other ancient authors , certain fixed ways of expounding and narrating , certain definite idioms , especially of a kind peculiar to the Semitic tongues , so called approximations , and certain hyperbolical modes of expression , nay , -atti_degli_apostoli- times , even paradoxical , which even help to impress the ideas more_deeply on the mind . For of the modes of expression which , among ancient peoples , and especially_those of the East , human language used to express its thought , none -isaia- excluded from the Sacred Books , provided the way of speaking adopted in no wise contradicts the holiness and truth of God , as , with_his customary wisdom , the Angelic Doctor already observed in these_words : '' In Scripture divine things_are presented to us in the manner which_-isaia- in common use amongst men . '' For as the substantial Word of God became like to men in all things , '' except sin , '' so the words of God , expressed in human language , are made like to human speech in every respect , except error . In this consists that '' condescension '' of the God of providence , which St . John Chrysostom extolled with the highest praise and repeatedly declared to be found in the Sacred Books . Hence the Catholic commentator , in order to comply with the present needs of biblical studies , in explaining the Sacred Scripture and in demonstrating and proving its immunity from all error , should_also make a prudent use of this_means , determine , that_-isaia- , to what extent the manner of expression or the literary mode adopted by the sacred writer may lead to a correct and genuine interpretation ; and let_him be convinced_that this part of his office cannot be neglected without serious detriment to Catholic exegesis . Not infrequently to mention only_one instance when some persons reproachfully charge the Sacred Writers with some historical error or inaccuracy in the recording of facts , on closer examination it turns out to be nothing else than those customary modes of expression and narration peculiar to the ancients , which used to be employed in the mutual dealings of social_life and which in fact were sanctioned by common usage . When then such modes of expression are met within_the sacred text , which , being meant for men , -isaia- couched in human language , justice demands_that they be no more taxed with error than when_they occur in the ordinary intercourse of daily_life . By this knowledge and exact appreciation of the modes of speaking and writing in use among the ancients can be solved many difficulties , which_are raised against the veracity and historical value of the Divine Scriptures , and no less efficaciously does this study contribute to a fuller and more luminous understanding of the mind of the Sacred Writer . Let those_who cultivate biblical studies turn their attention with all due diligence towards this_point and let_them neglect none of those discoveries , whether in the domain of archaeology or in ancient history or literature , which serve to make better known the mentality of the ancient writers , as well as their manner and art of reasoning , narrating and writing . In this connection Catholic laymen should consider that_they_will not_only further profane science , but moreover will render a conspicuous service to the Christian cause if they devote_themselves with all due diligence and application to the exploration and investigation of the monuments of antiquity and contribute , according_to_their abilities , to the solution of questions hitherto obscure . For all human knowledge , even the nonsacred , has indeed its_own proper dignity and excellence , being a finite participation of the infinite knowledge of God , but it acquires a new and higher dignity and , as it were , a consecration , when_it_-isaia- employed to cast a brighter light upon the things of God . The progressive exploration of the antiquities of the East , mentioned above , the more accurate examination of the original text itself , the more extensive and exact knowledge of languages both biblical and oriental , have with the help of God , happily provided the solution of not_a_few of those questions , which in the time of Our Predecessor Leo XIII of immortal memory , were raised by critics outside or hostile to the Church against the authenticity , antiquity , integrity and historical value of the Sacred Books . For Catholic exegetes , by a right use of those same scientific arms , not infrequently abused by the adversaries , proposed such interpretations , which_are in harmony_with Catholic doctrine and the genuine current of tradition , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time are seen to have proved equal to the difficulties , either raised by new explorations and discoveries , or bequeathed by antiquity for solution in our_time . Thus has it come about_that confidence in the authority and historical value of the Bible , somewhat shaken in the case of some by so many attacks , today among Catholics -isaia- completely restored ; moreover there_are not wanting even non Catholic writers , who by serious and calm inquiry have_been led to abandon modern opinion and to return , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in some points , to the more ancient ideas . This change -isaia- due in great part to the untiring labor by which Catholic commentators of the Sacred Letters , in no way deterred by difficulties and obstacles of all kinds , strove with all their strength to make suitable use of what learned men of the present_day , by their investigations in the domain of archaeology or history or philology , have_made available for the solution of new questions . Nevertheless no one will be surprised , if all difficulties are_not yet solved and overcome ; but that_even today serious problems greatly exercise the minds of Catholic exegetes . We should_not lose courage on this account ; nor_should we forget_that in the human sciences the same happens as in the natural world ; that_-isaia- to say , new beginnings grow little by little and fruits are gathered only after many labors . Thus it has happened that certain disputed points , which in the past remained unsolved and in suspense , in our days , with the progress of studies , have found a satisfactory solution . Hence there_are grounds for hope that_those also will by constant effort be -atti_degli_apostoli- last made clear , which now seem most complicated and difficult . And if the wished for solution be slow in coming or does_not satisfy us , since perhaps a successful conclusion may be reserved to posterity , let us not wax impatient thereat , seeing that in us also -isaia- rightly verified what_the Fathers , and especially Augustine , observed in their time viz : God wished difficulties to be scattered through the Sacred Books inspired by Him , in order_that we might be urged to read and scrutinize them more intently , and , experiencing in a salutary manner our_own limitations , we might be exercised in due submission of mind . No wonder if of one or other question no solution wholly satisfactory will ever be found , since sometimes we have to do with matters obscure in themselves and too remote from our_times and our experience ; and since exegesis also , like all other most important sciences , has its secrets , which , impenetrable to our minds , by no efforts whatsoever can be unraveled . But this state of things -isaia- no reason_why the Catholic commentator , inspired by an active and ardent love of his subject and sincerely devoted to Holy Mother Church , should in any_way be deterred from grappling again_and_again with_these difficult problems , hitherto unsolved , not_only that_he_may refute the objections of the adversaries , but_also may attempt to find a satisfactory solution , which_will be in full accord with the doctrine of the Church , in particular with the traditional teaching regarding the inerrancy of Sacred Scripture , and which_will -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time satisfy the indubitable conclusion of profane sciences . Let all the other sons of the Church bear in mind_that the efforts of these resolute laborers in the vineyard of the Lord should be judged not only_with equity and justice , but also_with the greatest charity ; all moreover should abhor that intemperate zeal which imagines that whatever_-isaia- new should for that_very reason be opposed or suspected . Let them bear in mind above all that in the rules and laws promulgated by the Church there_-isaia- question of doctrine regarding faith_and_morals ; and that in the immense matter contained in the Sacred Books legislative , historical , sapiential and prophetical there_are but few texts whose sense has_been defined by the authority of the Church , nor are_those more numerous about which_the teaching of the Holy Fathers -isaia- unanimous . There remain therefore many things , and of the greatest importance , in the discussion and exposition of which_the skill and genius of Catholic commentators may and ought to be freely exercised , so that_each may contribute his part to the advantage of all , to the continued progress of the sacred doctrine and to the defense and honor of the Church . This true liberty of the children of God , which adheres faithfully to the teaching of the Church and accepts and uses gratefully the contributions of profane science , this liberty , upheld and sustained in every way by the confidence of all , -isaia- the condition and source of all lasting fruit and of all solid progress in Catholic doctrine , as Our Predecessor of happy_memory Leo XIII rightly observes , when he says : '' unless harmony of mind be maintained and principle safeguarded , no progress can be expected in this_matter from the varied studies of many . Whosoever considers the immense labors undertaken by Catholic exegetes during well nigh two thousand years , so that the word of God , imparted to men through the Sacred Letters , might daily be more_deeply and fully understood and more intensely loved , will easily be convinced that_it_-isaia- the serious duty of the faithful , and especially of priests , to make free and holy use of this treasure , accumulated throughout so many centuries by the greatest intellects . For the Sacred Books were_not given by God to men to satisfy their curiosity or to provide them_with material for study and research , but , as the Apostle observes , in order_that these Divine Oracles might '' instruct us to salvation , by the faith which_-isaia- in Christ Jesus '' and '' that the man of God may be perfect , furnished to every good work . Let priests therefore , who are_bound by their office to procure the eternal_salvation of the faithful , after they_have themselves by diligent study perused the sacred pages and made them their_own by prayer and meditations , assiduously distribute the heavenly treasures of the divine_word by sermons , homilies and exhortations ; let_them confirm the Christian doctrine by sentences from the Sacred Books and illustrate it by outstanding examples from sacred history and in particular from the Gospel of Christ Our Lord ; and avoiding with the greatest care those purely arbitrary and far fetched adaptations , which_are not a use , but_rather an abuse of the divine_word let_them set_forth all this with_such eloquence , lucidity and clearness that_the_faithful may not_only be moved and inflamed to reform their_lives , but may also conceive in their_hearts the greatest veneration for the Sacred Scripture . The same veneration the Bishops should endeavor daily to increase and perfect among the faithful committed to their care , encouraging all those initiatives by which men , filled_with apostolic zeal , laudably strive to excite and foster among Catholics a greater knowledge of and love for the Sacred Books . Let them favor therefore and lend help to those pious associations whose aim it -isaia- to spread copies of the Sacred Letters , especially of the Gospels , among the faithful , and to procure by every_means that in Christian families the same be read daily with piety and devotion ; let_them efficaciously recommend by word and example , whenever the liturgical laws permit , the Sacred Scriptures translated , with the approval of the Ecclesiastical authority , into modern languages ; let_them themselves give public conferences or dissertations on biblical subjects , or see that_they_are given by other public orators well versed in the matter . Let the ministers of the Sanctuary support in every way possible and diffuse in fitting manner among all classes of the faithful the periodicals which so laudably and with_such heartening results are published from time to time in various parts_of_the_world , whether to treat and expose in a scientific manner biblical questions , or to adapt the fruits of these investigations to the sacred_ministry , or to benefit the faithful . Let the ministers of the Sanctuary be convinced_that all this , and whatsoever else an apostolical zeal and a sincere love of the divine_word may find suitable to this high purpose , will be an efficacious help to the cure of souls . But it -isaia- plain to everyone that priests cannot duly fulfill all this unless in their Seminary days they_have imbibed a practical and enduring love for the Sacred Scriptures . Wherefore let_the Bishops , on whom devolves the paternal care of their Seminaries , with all diligence see_to_it_that nothing be omitted in this_matter which_may help towards_the desired end . Let the professors of Sacred Scripture in the Seminaries give the whole course of biblical studies in such_a_way , that_they_may instruct the young aspirants to the Priesthood and to the ministry of the divine_word with_that knowledge of the Sacred Letters and imbue them_with that_love for the same , without which_it_-isaia- vain to hope_for copious fruits of the apostolate . Hence their exegetical explanation should aim especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the theological doctrine , avoiding useless disputations and omitting all that_-isaia- calculated rather to gratify curiosity than to promote true learning and solid piety . The literal sense and especially_the theological let_them propose with_such definiteness , explain with_such skill and inculcate with_such ardor that in their students may be in a sense verified what happened to the disciples on the way to Emmaus , when , having heard the words of the Master , they exclaimed : '' Was not our_heart burning within us , whilst He opened to us the Scriptures ? '' . Thus the Divine Letter will_become for the future priests of the Church a pure and never failing source for their_own spiritual_life , as well as food and strength for the sacred office of preaching which_they_are about to undertake . If the professors of this_most important matter in the Seminaries accomplish all this , then let_them rest joyfully assured that_they_have most efficaciously contributed to the salvation_of_souls , to the progress of the Catholic faith , to the honor and glory of God , and that_they_have performed a work most closely connected_with_the apostolic_office . If these_things which We have_said , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , are necessary in every_age , much_more urgently are they needed in our sorrowful times , when almost all peoples and nations are plunged in a sea of calamities , when a cruel war heaps ruins upon ruins and slaughter upon slaughter , when , owing to the most bitter hatred stirred up among the nations , We perceive with greatest sorrow that in not_a_few has_been extinguished the sense not_only of Christian moderation and charity , but_also of humanity itself . Who can heal these mortal wounds of the human_family if not He , to Whom the Prince of the Apostles , full of confidence and love , addresses these_words : '' Lord , to whom shall we go ? Thou hast the words of eternal_life . To this Our most merciful Redeemer we must_therefore bring all back by every_means in our power ; for He -isaia- the divine consoler of the afflicted ; He it -isaia- Who teaches all , whether_they be invested with public_authority or are_bound in duty to obey and submit , true honesty , absolute justice and generous charity ; it -isaia- He in fine , and He alone , Who can be the firm foundation and support of peace and tranquillity : '' For other foundation no man can lay , but that_which_-isaia- laid : which_-isaia- Christ Jesus . '' This author of salvation , Christ , will men more_fully know , more ardently love and faithfully imitate in proportion as they are_more assiduously urged to know and meditate the Sacred Letters , especially_the New Testament , for , as St . Jerome the Doctor of Stridon says : '' To ignore the Scripture -isaia- to ignore Christ '' ; and again : '' If there_-isaia- anything in this life_which sustains a wise man and induces him to maintain his serenity amidst the tribulations and adversities of the world , it -isaia- in the first_place , I consider , the meditation and knowledge of the Scriptures . There those_who_are wearied and oppressed by adversities and afflictions will_find true consolation and divine strength to suffer and bear with patience ; there that_-isaia- in the Holy Gospels Christ , the highest and greatest example of justice , charity and mercy , -isaia- present to all ; and to the lacerated and trembling human_race are laid open the fountains of that divine_grace without_which both peoples and their rulers can_never arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- , never establish , peace in the state and unity of heart ; there in fine will all learn Christ , '' Who -isaia- the head of all principality and power '' and '' Who of God -isaia- made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption . Having expounded and recommended those things_which are required_for the adaptation of Scripture studies to the necessities of the day , it remains , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , that to biblical scholars who_are devoted sons of the Church and follow faithfully her teaching and direction , We address with paternal affection , not_only Our congratulations that_they_have been chosen and called to so sublime an office , but_also Our encouragement to continue with ever renewed vigor with all zeal and care , the work so happily begun . Sublime office , We say ; for what_-isaia- more sublime than to scrutinize , explain , propose to the faithful and defend from unbelievers the very word of God , communicated to men under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit . With this spiritual food the mind of the interpreter -isaia- fed and nourished '' to the commemoration of faith , the consolation of hope , the exhortation of charity . '' '' To live amidst these_things , to meditate these_things , to know nothing else , to seek nothing else , does it not seem to you already here below a foretaste of the heavenly kingdom ? '' Let also the minds of the faithful be nourished with this_same food , that_they_may draw from thence the knowledge and love of God and the progress in perfection and the happiness of their_own individual souls . Let , then , the interpreters of the Divine Oracles devote_themselves to this_holy practice with all their heart . '' Let them pray , that_they_may understand '' ; let_them labor to penetrate ever more_deeply into the secrets of the Sacred Pages ; let_them teach and preach , in order to open to others also the treasures of the word of God . Let the present_day commentators of the Sacred Scripture emulate , according_to_their capacity , what those illustrious interpreters of past ages accomplished with such_great fruit ; so that , as in the past , so also in these_days , the Church may_have -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal learned doctors for the expounding of the Divine Letters ; and , through_their assiduous labors , the faithful may comprehend all the splendor , stimulating language , and joy contained in the Holy Scriptures . And in this_very arduous and important office let_them have '' for their comfort the Holy Books '' and be mindful of the promised reward : since '' they that_are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament , and they that instruct many unto justice , as stars for all eternity . And now , while ardently desiring for all sons of the Church , and especially_for the professors in biblical science , for the young clergy and for preachers , that , continually meditating on the divine_word , they_may taste how good and sweet -isaia- the spirit of the Lord ; as a presage of heavenly_gifts and a token of Our paternal goodwill , We impart to you one and all , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , most lovingly in the Lord , the Apostolic Benediction .

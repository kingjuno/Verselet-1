Mediator between God and men and High Priest who_has gone before us into_heaven , Jesus the Son of God quite clearly had one aim in view when He undertook the mission of mercy which_was to endow mankind with the rich blessings of supernatural grace . Sin had disturbed the right relationship_between man and his Creator ; the Son of God would restore it . The children of Adam were wretched heirs to the infection of original_sin ; He would bring them back to their heavenly Father , the primal source and final destiny of all things . For this_reason He was_not content , while He dwelt with us on earth , merely to give notice that redemption had begun , and to proclaim_the long awaited Kingdom of God , but gave Himself besides in prayer and sacrifice to the task of saving souls , even to the point of offering Himself , as He hung from the cross , a Victim unspotted unto God , to purify our conscience of dead works , to serve the living God . Thus happily were all men summoned back from the byways leading them down to ruin and disaster , to be set squarely once_again upon the path that leads to God . Thanks to the shedding of the blood of the Immaculate Lamb , now each might set about the personal task of achieving his_own sanctification , so rendering to God the glory due to Him . But what_-isaia- more , the divine Redeemer has so willed it that the priestly life begun with the supplication and sacrifice of His mortal body should continue without intermission down the ages in His Mystical Body which_-isaia- the Church . That -isaia- why He established a visible priesthood to offer everywhere the clean oblation which_would enable men from East to West , freed from the shackles of sin , to offer God that unconstrained and voluntary homage which their conscience dictates . In obedience , therefore , to her Founder s behest , the Church prolongs the priestly mission of Jesus Christ mainly by means of the sacred_liturgy . She does this in the first_place -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar , where constantly the sacrifice of the cross -isaia- represented and with a single difference in the manner of its offering , renewed . She does it next by means of the sacraments , those special channels through_which men_are made partakers in the supernatural life . She does it , finally , by offering to God , all Good and Great , the daily tribute of her prayer of praise . '' What a spectacle for heaven and earth , '' observes Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , '' -isaia- not the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer ! For centuries without interruption , from midnight to midnight , the divine psalmody of the inspired canticles -isaia- repeated on earth ; there_-isaia- no hour of the day that_-isaia-_not hallowed by its special liturgy ; there_-isaia- no state of human_life that_has not its part in the thanksgiving , praise , supplication and reparation of this common prayer of the Mystical Body of Christ which_-isaia- His Church ! '' . You are of course familiar with the fact , Venerable Brethren , that a remarkably widespread revival of scholarly interest in the sacred_liturgy took_place towards_the end of the last century and has continued through the early years of this one . The movement owed its rise to commendable private initiative and more particularly to the zealous and persistent labor of several monasteries within_the distinguished Order of Saint Benedict . Thus there developed in this_field among many European nations , and in lands beyond_the seas as well , a rivalry as welcome as it was productive of results . Indeed , the salutary fruits of this rivalry among the scholars were plain for all to see , both in the sphere of the sacred sciences , where_the liturgical rites of the Western and Eastern Church were made the object of extensive research and profound study , and in the spiritual_life of considerable numbers of individual Christians . The majestic ceremonies of the sacrifice of the altar became better known , understood and appreciated . With more widespread and more frequent reception of the sacraments , with the beauty of the liturgical prayers more_fully savored , the worship of the Eucharist came to be regarded for_what it really -isaia- : the fountain head of genuine Christian devotion . Bolder relief was_given likewise to the fact_that all the faithful make up a single and very compact body with Christ for its Head , and that the Christian community -isaia- in duty bound to participate in the liturgical rites according_to_their station . You are surely well aware_that this Apostolic See has_always made careful provision for the schooling of the people committed to its charge in the correct spirit and practice of the liturgy ; and that it has_been no less careful to insist that the sacred rites should be performed with due external dignity . In this connection We ourselves , in the course of our traditional address to the Lenten preachers of this gracious city of Rome in , urged them warmly to exhort their_respective hearers to more faithful participation in the eucharistic_sacrifice . Only a short while previously , with the design of rendering the prayers of the liturgy more correctly understood and their truth and unction more easy to perceive , We arranged to have_the Book of Psalms , which forms such an important part of these prayers in the Catholic Church , translated again into Latin from their original text . But while We derive no little satisfaction from the wholesome results of the movement just described , duty obliges Us to give serious attention to this '' revival '' as it -isaia- advocated in some quarters , and to take proper steps to preserve it -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset from excess or outright perversion . Indeed , though we are sorely grieved to note , on the one_hand , that_there are places_where the spirit , understanding or practice of the sacred_liturgy -isaia- defective , or all but inexistent , We observe with considerable anxiety and some misgiving , that elsewhere certain enthusiasts , over eager in their search_for novelty , are straying beyond_the path of sound doctrine and prudence . Not seldom , in fact , they interlard their plans and hopes for a revival of the sacred_liturgy with principles_which compromise this holiest of causes in theory or practice , and sometimes even taint it with errors touching Catholic faith and ascetical doctrine . Yet the integrity of faith_and_morals ought to be the special criterion of this sacred science , which_must conform exactly to what_the Church out of the abundance of her wisdom teaches and prescribes . It -isaia- , consequently , Our prerogative to commend and approve whatever_-isaia- done properly , and to check or censure any aberration from the path of truth and rectitude . Let not the apathetic or half hearted imagine , however_,_that We agree with_them when We reprove the erring and restrain the overbold . No more must the imprudent think that_we_are commending them when We correct the faults of those_who_are negligent and sluggish . If in this encyclical_letter We treat chiefly of the Latin liturgy , it -isaia- not because We esteem less highly the venerable liturgies of the Eastern Church , whose ancient and honorable ritual traditions are just as dear to Us . The reason lies rather in a special situation prevailing in the Western Church , of sufficient importance , it would seem , to require this exercise of Our authority . With docile hearts , then , let all Christians hearken to the voice of their Common Father , who would_have them , each_and_every one , intimately united with_him as they approach the altar of God , professing the same faith , obedient to the same law , sharing in the same Sacrifice with a single intention and one sole desire . This -isaia- a duty imposed , of course , by the honor due to God . But the needs of our_day and age demand it as well . After a long and cruel war which_has rent whole peoples asunder with it rivalry and slaughter , men_of_good will are spending themselves in the effort to find the best possible way to restore peace to the world . It -isaia- , notwithstanding , Our belief that no plan or initiative can_offer better prospect of success than_that fervent religious spirit and zeal by which Christians must be formed and guided ; in this_way their common and whole hearted acceptance of the same truth , along_with their united obedience and loyalty to their appointed pastors , while rendering to God the worship due to Him , makes of them one brotherhood : '' for we , being many , are one_body : all that partake of one bread . It -isaia- unquestionably the fundamental duty of man to orientate his person and his_life towards God . '' For He it -isaia- to whom we must first be bound , as to an unfailing principle ; to whom even our free choice must be directed as to an ultimate objective . It -isaia- He , too , whom we lose when carelessly we sin . It -isaia- He whom we must recover by our_faith and trust . '' But man turns properly to God when he acknowledges His Supreme majesty and supreme_authority ; when he accepts divinely revealed truths with a submissive mind ; when he scrupulously obeys divine_law , centering in God his every act and aspiration ; when he accords , in short , due worship to the One True God by practicing the virtue of religion . This duty -isaia- incumbent , first of all , on men as individuals . But it also binds the whole community of human_beings , grouped together by mutual social ties : mankind , too , depends on the sovereign authority of God . It should be noted , moreover , that_men are_bound by his obligation in a special_way in virtue of the fact_that God has raised them to the supernatural order . Thus we observe that_when God institutes the Old Law , He makes provision besides for sacred rites , and determines in exact detail the rules to be observed by His people in rendering Him the worship He ordains . To this_end He established various kinds of sacrifice and designated the ceremonies with which_they were to be offered to Him . His enactments on all matters relating to the Ark of the Covenant , the Temple and the holy days are minute and clear . He established a sacerdotal tribe with its high_priest , selected and described the vestments with_which_the sacred ministers were to be clothed , and every function in any_way pertaining to divine_worship . Yet this_was nothing_more than a faint foreshadowing of the worship which_the High Priest of the New Testament was to render to the Father in heaven . No sooner , in fact , '' -isaia- the Word made_flesh '' than he shows Himself to the world vested with a priestly office , making to the Eternal Father an act of submission which will_continue uninterruptedly as long as He lives : '' When He cometh into_the_world he saith . '' This act He was to consummate admirably in the bloody Sacrifice of the Cross : '' It -isaia- in this_will we are sanctified by the oblation of the Body of Jesus Christ once . '' He plans His active life among_men with no other purpose in view . As a child He -isaia- presented to the Lord in the Temple . To the Temple He returns as a grown boy , and often afterwards to instruct the people and to pray . He fasts for forty days before beginning His public ministry . His counsel and example summon all to prayer , daily and -atti_degli_apostoli- night as well . As Teacher of the truth He '' enlighteneth every man '' to the end that mortals may duly acknowledge_the immortal God , '' not withdrawing unto perdition , but faithful to the saving of the soul . '' As Shepherd He watches over His flock , leads it to life_giving pasture , lays down a law that none shall wander from His side , off the straight path He has pointed_out , and that all shall lead holy lives imbued_with His spirit and moved by His active aid . At the Last Supper He celebrates a new Pasch with solemn rite and ceremonial , and provides for its continuance through the divine institution of the Eucharist . On the morrow , lifted up between heaven and earth , He offers the saving sacrifice of His life , and pours forth , as it were , from His pierced Heart the sacraments destined to impart the treasures of redemption to the souls of men . All this He does with but a single aim : the glory of His Father and man s ever_greater sanctification . But it -isaia- His will , besides , that the worship He instituted and practiced during His life on earth shall continue ever afterwards without intermission . For he has not left mankind an orphan . He still offers us the support of His powerful , unfailing intercession , acting as our '' advocate with the Father . '' He aids us likewise through His Church , where He -isaia- present indefectibly as the ages run their course : through the Church which He constituted '' the pillar of truth '' and dispenser of grace , and which by His sacrifice on the cross , He founded , consecrated and confirmed forever . The Church has , therefore , in common with the Word Incarnate the aim , the obligation and the function of teaching all men the truth , of governing and directing them aright , of offering to God the pleasing and acceptable sacrifice ; in this_way the Church re establishes between_the Creator and His creatures that_unity and harmony to which_the Apostle of the Gentiles alludes in these_words : '' Now , therefore , you_are no more strangers and foreigners ; but you_are fellow citizens with the saints and domestics of God , built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone ; in whom all the building , being framed together , groweth up into a holy temple in the Lord , in whom_you also are built together in a habitation of God in the Spirit . '' Thus the society founded by the divine Redeemer , whether in her doctrine and government , or in the sacrifice and sacraments instituted by Him , or finally , in the ministry , which He has confided to her charge with the outpouring of His prayer and the shedding of His blood , has no other goal or purpose than to increase ever in strength and unity . This result -isaia- , in fact , achieved when Christ lives and thrives , as it were , in the hearts of men , and when men s hearts in turn are fashioned and expanded as though by Christ . This makes it possible_for the sacred temple , where_the Divine Majesty receives the acceptable worship which His law prescribes , to increase and prosper day_by_day in this land of exile of earth . Along with the Church , therefore , her Divine Founder -isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- every liturgical function : Christ -isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- the august sacrifice of the altar both in the person of His minister and above all under the eucharistic species . He -isaia- present in the sacraments , infusing into them the power which_makes them ready instruments of sanctification . He -isaia- present , finally , in prayer of praise and petition we direct to God , as it -isaia- written : '' Where there_are two or three gathered together in My Name , there -amos- I in the midst of them . '' The sacred_liturgy -isaia- , consequently , the public worship which_our Redeemer as Head of the Church renders to the Father , as well as the worship which_the community of the faithful renders to its Founder , and through Him to the heavenly Father . It -isaia- , in short , the worship rendered by the Mystical Body of Christ in the entirety of its Head and members . Liturgical practice begins with the very founding of the Church . The first Christians , in fact , '' were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers . '' Whenever their pastors can summon a little group of the faithful together , they set up an altar on which_they proceed to offer the sacrifice , and around which_are ranged all the other rites appropriate for the saving of souls and for the honor due to God . Among these latter rites , the first_place -isaia- reserved for the sacraments , namely , the seven principal founts of salvation . There follows the celebration of the divine praises in which_the faithful also join , obeying the behest of the Apostle Paul , '' In all wisdom , teaching and admonishing one_another in psalms , hymns and spiritual canticles , singing in grace in your hearts to God . '' Next comes the reading of the Law , the prophets , the gospel and the apostolic epistles ; and last of all the homily or sermon in which_the official head of the congregation recalls and explains the practical bearing of the commandments of the divine Master and the chief events of His life , combining instruction with appropriate exhortation and illustration of the benefit of all his listeners . As circumstances and the needs of Christians warrant , public worship -isaia- organized , developed and enriched by new rites , ceremonies and regulations , always with the single end in view , '' that_we_may use these external signs to keep us alert , learn from them what distance we have come along the road , and by them be heartened to go on further with more eager step ; for the effect will be more precious the warmer the affection which precedes it . '' Here then -isaia- a better and more suitable way to raise the heart to God . Thenceforth the priesthood of Jesus Christ -isaia- a living and continuous reality through all the ages to the end of time , since_the liturgy -isaia- nothing_more nor less_than the exercise of this priestly function . Like her_divine Head , the Church -isaia- forever present in the midst of her_children . She aids and exhorts them to holiness , so that_they_may one_day return to the Father in heaven clothed in that beauteous raiment of the supernatural . To all who_are born to life on earth she gives a second , supernatural kind of birth . She arms them_with_the Holy Spirit for the struggle against the implacable enemy . She gathers all Christians about her altars , inviting and urging them repeatedly to take_part in the celebration of the Mass , feeding them_with_the Bread of angels to make_them ever stronger . She purifies and consoles the hearts that sin has wounded and soiled . Solemnly she consecrates those_whom God has called to the priestly_ministry . She fortifies with new gifts of grace the chaste nupitals of those_who_are destined to found and bring up a Christian family . When as last she_has soothed and refreshed the closing hours of this earthly life by holy Viaticum and extreme unction , with the utmost affection she accompanies the mortal remains of her_children to the grave , lays them reverently to rest , and confides them to the protection of the cross , against the day when they_will triumph over death and rise again . She has a further solemn blessing and invocation for those of her_children who dedicate themselves to the service of God in the life of religious perfection . Finally , she extends to the souls in purgatory , who implore her intercession and her prayers , the helping hand which_may lead_them happily -atti_degli_apostoli- last to eternal blessedness in heaven . The worship rendered by the Church to God must be , in its entirety , interior as well as exterior . It -isaia- exterior because the nature of man as a composite of body_and_soul requires it to be so . Likewise , because divine Providence has disposed that '' while we recognize God visibly , we may be drawn by Him to love of things unseen . '' Every impulse of the human_heart , besides , expresses itself naturally through the senses ; and the worship of God , being the concern not merely of individuals but of the whole community of mankind , must_therefore be social as well . This obviously it cannot be unless religious activity -isaia-_also organized and manifested outwardly . Exterior worship , finally , reveals and emphasizes the unity of the mystical Body , feeds new fuel to its holy zeal , fortifies its energy , intensifies its action day_by_day : '' for although the ceremonies themselves can claim no perfection or sanctity in their won right , they_are , nevertheless , the outward acts of religion , designed to rouse the heart , like signals of a sort , to veneration of the sacred realities , and to raise the mind to meditation on the supernatural . They serve to foster piety , to kindle the flame of charity , to increase our_faith and deepen our devotion . They provide instruction for simple folk , decoration for divine_worship , continuity of religious practice . They make it possible to tell genuine Christians from their false or heretical counterparts . But the chief element of divine_worship must be interior . For we must_always live in Christ and give ourselves to Him completely , so that in Him , with Him and through Him the heavenly Father may be duly glorified . The sacred_liturgy requires , however_,_that both of these elements be intimately linked_with each another . This recommendation the liturgy itself_-isaia- careful to repeat , as often as it prescribes an exterior act of worship . Thus we are urged , when there_-isaia- question of fasting , for example , '' to give interior effect to our outward observance . '' Otherwise religion clearly amounts to mere formalism , without meaning and without content . You recall , Venerable Brethren , how the divine Master expels from the sacred temple , as unworthily to worship there , people_who pretend to honor God with nothing but neat and wellturned phrases , like actors in a theater , and think themselves perfectly capable of working out_their eternal_salvation without plucking their inveterate vices from their_hearts . It -isaia- , therefore , the keen desire of the Church that all of the faithful kneel -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of the Redeemer to tell Him how_much they venerate and love Him . She wants them present in crowds like the children whose joyous cries accompanied His entry into Jerusalem to sing their hymns and chant their song of praise and thanksgiving to Him who_-isaia- King of Kings and Source of every blessing . She would_have them move their lips in prayer , sometimes in petition , sometimes in joy and gratitude , and in this_way experience His merciful aid and power like the apostles -atti_degli_apostoli- the lakeside of Tiberias , or abandon themselves totally , like Peter on Mount Tabor , to mystic union with the eternal God in contemplation . It -isaia- an error , consequently , and a mistake to think of the sacred_liturgy as merely the outward or visible part of divine_worship or as an ornamental ceremonial . No less erroneous -isaia- the notion that it consists solely in a list of laws and prescriptions according to which_the ecclesiastical hierarchy orders the sacred rites to be performed . It should be clear to all , then_,_that God cannot be honored worthily unless the mind_and_heart turn to Him in quest of the perfect life , and that the worship rendered to God by the Church in union with her_divine Head -isaia-_the_most efficacious means of achieving sanctity . This efficacy , where there_-isaia- question of the eucharistic_sacrifice and the sacraments , derives first of all and principally from the act itself ex opere operato . But if one considers the part which_the Immaculate Spouse of Jesus Christ takes in the action , embellishing the sacrifice and sacraments with prayer and sacred ceremonies , or if one refers to the '' sacramentals '' and the other rites instituted by the hierarchy of the Church , then its effectiveness -isaia- due rather to the action of the church ex opere operantis Ecclesiae , inasmuch as she_-isaia- holy and acts always in closest union with_her Head . In this connection , Venerable Brethren , We desire to direct your attention to certain recent theories touching a so called '' objective '' piety . While these theories attempt , it -isaia- true , to throw light on the mystery of the Mystical Body , on the effective reality of sanctifying grace , on the action of God in the sacraments and in the Mass , it -isaia- nonetheless apparent that_they tend to belittle , or pass over in silence , what_they call '' subjective , '' or '' personal '' piety . It -isaia- an unquestionable fact_that the work of our redemption -isaia- continued , and that_its fruits are imparted to us , during the celebration of the liturgy , notable in the august sacrifice of the altar . Christ acts each_day to save us , in the sacraments and in His holy sacrifice . By means of them He -isaia- constantly atoning for the sins of mankind , constantly consecrating it to God . Sacraments and sacrifice do , then , possess that '' objective '' power to make us really and personally sharers in the divine_life of Jesus Christ . Not from any ability of our_own , but by the power of God , are they endowed_with the capacity to unite the piety of members with_that of the head , and to make_this , in a sense , the action of the whole community . From these profund considerations some are led to conclude that all Christian piety must be centered in the mystery of the Mystical Body of Christ , with no regard_for what_-isaia- '' personal '' or '' subjective , as they_would have it . As a result they feel_that all other religious exercises not directly connected_with_the sacred_liturgy , and performed outside public worship should be omitted . But though the principles set_forth above are excellent , it must be plain to everyone that the conclusions drawn_from them respecting two sorts of piety are false , insidious and quite pernicious . Very truly , the sacraments and the sacrifice of the altar , being Christ s own actions , must be held to be capable in themselves of conveying and dispensing grace from the divine Head to the members of the Mystical Body . But if they_are to produce their_proper effect , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that our_hearts be properly disposed to receive them . Hence the warning of Paul the Apostle with reference to holy communion , '' But let a man first prove himself ; and then let_him eat of this bread and drink of the chalice . '' This explains why_the Church in a brief and significant phrase calls the various acts of mortification , especially_those practiced during the season of Lent , '' the Christian army s defenses . '' They represent , in fact , the personal effort and activity of members who desire , as grace urges and aids them , to join forces with_their Captain '' that_we_may discover . in our Captain , '' to borrow St . Augustine s words , '' the fountain of grace itself . '' But observe that_these members are alive , endowed and equipped with an intelligence and will of their_own . It follows that_they_are strictly required to put their_own lips to the fountain , imbibe and absorb for themselves the life_giving water , and rid themselves personally of anything that might hinder its nutritive effect in their_souls . Emphatically , therefore , the work of redemption , which in itself_-isaia- independent of our will , requires a serious interior effort on our part if we are to achieve eternal_salvation . If the private and interior devotion of individuals were to neglect the august sacrifice of the altar and the sacraments , and to withdraw them_from the stream of vital energy that flows from Head to members , it would indeed be sterile , and deserve to be condemned . But when devotional exercises , and pious practices in general , not strictly connected_with_the sacred_liturgy , confine themselves to merely human acts , with the express purpose of directing these latter to the Father in heaven , of rousing people to repentance and holy fear of God , of weaning them_from the seductions of the world and its vice , and leading them back to the difficult path of perfection , then certainly such practices are not_only highly praiseworthy but absolutely indispensable , because_they expose the dangers threatening the spiritual_life ; because_they promote the acquisition of virtue ; and because_they increase the fervor and generosity with which_we_are bound to dedicate all that_we_are and all that_we_have to the service of Jesus Christ . Genuine and real piety , which_the Angelic Doctor calls '' devotion , '' and which_-isaia- the principal act of the virtue of religion that act which correctly relates and fitly directs men to God ; and by which_they freely and spontaneously give themselves to the worship of God in its fullest sense piety of this authentic sort needs meditation on the supernatural realities and spiritual_exercises , if it -isaia- to be nurtured , stimulated and sustained , and if it -isaia- to prompt us to lead a more_perfect life . For the Christian religion , practiced as it should be , demands_that the will especially be consecrated to God and exert its influence on all the other spiritual faculties . But every act of the will presupposes an act of the intelligence , and before one_can express the desire and the intention of offering oneself in sacrifice to the eternal Godhead , a knowledge of the facts and truths_which make religion a duty -isaia- altogether necessary . One must first know , for instance , man s last end and the supremacy of the Divine Majesty ; after that , our_common duty of submission to our Creator ; and , finally , the inexhaustible treasures of love with_which God yearns to enrich us , as well as the necessity of supernatural grace for the achievement of our destiny , and that special path marked out for us by divine Providence in virtue of the fact that_we_have been united , one and all , like members of a body , to Jesus Christ the Head . But further , since our_hearts , disturbed as they are_-atti_degli_apostoli- times by the lower appetites , do not_always respond to motives of love , it -isaia-_also extremely helpful to let consideration and contemplation of the justice of God provoke us on occasion to salutary fear , and guide us thence to Christian humility , repentance and amendment . But it will_not do to possess these facts and truths after_the fashion of an abstract memory lesson or lifeless commentary . They must lead to practical results . They must impel us to subject our senses and their faculties to reason , as illuminated by the Catholic faith . They must help to cleanse and purify the heart , uniting it to Christ more intimately every_day , growing ever_more to His likeness , and drawing from Him the divine inspiration and strength of which it stands in need . They must serve as increasingly effective incentives to action : urging men to produce good fruit , to perform their individual duties faithfully , to give themselves eagerly to the regular practice of their religion and the energetic exercise of virtue . '' You are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s . '' Let everything , therefore , have its_proper place and arrangement ; let everything be '' theocentric , '' so to speak , if we really wish to direct everything to the glory of God through the life and power which flow from the divine Head into our_hearts : '' Having therefore , brethren , a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ , a new and living way which He both dedicated for us through the veil , that_-isaia- to say , His flesh , and a high_priest over the house of God ; let us draw near with a true heart , in fullness of faith , having our_hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water , let us hold fast the confession of our_hope without wavering . and let us consider one_another , to provoke unto charity and to good_works . Here -isaia-_the_source of the harmony and equilibrium which prevails among the members of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ . When the Church teaches us our Catholic faith and exhorts us to obey the commandments of Christ , she_-isaia- paving a way for_her priestly , sanctifying action in its highest sense ; she disposes us likewise for more_serious meditation on the life of the divine Redeemer and guides us to profounder knowledge of the mysteries of faith where we may draw the supernatural sustenance , strength and vitality that enable us to progress safely , through Christ , towards a more_perfect life . Not only through_her ministers but_with the help of the faithful individually , who_have imbibed in this fashion the spirit of Christ , the Church endeavors to permeate with this same_spirit the life and labors of men their private and family_life , their social , even economic and political_life that all who are_called God s children may reach more readily the end He has proposed for them . Such action on the part of individual Christians , then , along_with the ascetic effort promoting them to purify their_hearts , actually stimulates in the faithful those energies which enable them to participate in the august sacrifice of the altar with better dispositions . They now can receive the sacraments with more abundant fruit , and come from the celebration of the sacred rites more eager , more firmly resolved to pray and deny themselves like Christians , to answer the inspirations and invitation of divine_grace and to imitate daily more_closely the virtues of our Redeemer . And all of this not_simply for their_own advantage , but_for that of the whole Church , where whatever good -isaia- accomplished proceeds from the power of her Head and redounds to the advancement of all her members . In the spiritual_life , consequently , there_can be no opposition between_the action of God , who pours forth His grace into men s hearts so that the work of the redemption may always abide , and the tireless collaboration of man_,_who must_not render vain the gift of God . No more can the efficacy of the external administration of the sacraments , which_comes_from the rite itself ex opere operato , be opposed to the meritorious action of their ministers of recipients , which we call the agent s action opus operantis . Similarly , no conflict exists between public prayer and prayers in private , between morality and contemplation , between_the ascetical life and devotion to the liturgy . Finally , there_-isaia- no opposition between_the jurisdiction and teaching office of the ecclesiastical hierarchy , and the specifically priestly power exercised in the sacred_ministry . Considering their special designation to perform the liturgical functions of the holy sacrifice and divine office , the Church has serious reason_for prescribing that the ministers she assigns to the service of the sanctuary and members of religious institutes betake themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- stated times to mental prayer , to examination of conscience , and to various other spiritual_exercises . Unquestionably , liturgical prayer , being the public supplication of the illustrious Spouse of Jesus Christ , -isaia- superior in excellence to private prayers . But this superior worth does_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all imply contrast or incompatibility between these_two kinds of prayer . For both merge harmoniously in the single spirit_which animates them , '' Christ -isaia- all and in all . '' Both tend to the same objective : until Christ be formed in us . For a better and more accurate understanding of the sacred_liturgy another of its characteristic features , no less important , needs to be considered . The Church -isaia- a society , and as such requires an authority and hierarchy of her_own . Though it -isaia- true_that all the members of the Mystical Body partake of the same blessings and pursue the same objective , they_do_not all enjoy_the same powers , nor are they all qualified to perform the same acts . The divine Redeemer has willed , as a matter of fact , that His Kingdom should be built and solidly supported , as it were , on a holy order , which resembles in some sort the heavenly hierarchy . Only to the apostles , and thenceforth to those on whom their successors have imposed hands , -isaia- granted the power of the priesthood , in virtue of which_they represent the person of Jesus Christ before their_people , acting -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as representatives of their_people before God . This priesthood -isaia- not transmitted by heredity or human descent . It does_not emanate from the Christian community . It -isaia- not a delegation from the people . Prior to acting as representative of the community before the throne of God , the priest_-isaia- the ambassador of the divine Redeemer . He -isaia- God s vice gerent in the midst of his flock precisely_because Jesus Christ -isaia- Head of that body of which Christians are the members . The power entrusted to him , therefore , bears no natural resemblance to anything human . It -isaia- entirely supernatural . It comes_from God . '' As the Father hath sent me , I also send you . he that heareth you heareth me . go ye into the whole_world and preach_the_gospel to every_creature ; he that believeth and -isaia- baptized shall be saved . That -isaia- why_the visible , external priesthood of Jesus Christ -isaia- not handed_down indiscriminately to all members of the Church in general , but_-isaia- conferred on designated men , through what may be called the spiritual generation of holy_orders . This latter , one of the seven sacraments , not_only imparts the grace appropriate to the clerical function and state of life , but imparts an indelible '' character '' besides , indicating the sacred ministers conformity to Jesus Christ the Priest and qualifying them to perform those official acts of religion by which men_are sanctified and God -isaia- duly glorified in keeping_with_the divine laws and regulations . In the same_way , actually that baptism -isaia- the distinctive mark of all Christians , and serves to differentiate them_from those_who_have not_been cleansed in this purifying stream and consequently are_not members of Christ , the sacrament of holy_orders sets the priest apart_from the rest of the faithful_who have_not received this consecration . For they alone , in answer to an inward supernatural call , have entered the august ministry , where_they are assigned to service in the sanctuary and become , as it were , the instruments God uses to communicate supernatural life from on high to the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ . Add to this , as We have noted above , the fact_that they alone have_been marked with the indelible sign '' conforming '' them to Christ the Priest , and that_their hands alone have_been consecrated '' in order_that whatever they bless may be blessed , whatever they consecrate may_become sacred and holy , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ '' Let all , then , who_would live in Christ flock to their priests . By them they_will be supplied with the comforts and food of the spiritual_life . From them they_will procure the medicine of salvation assuring their cure and happy recovery from the fatal sickness of their sins . The priest , finally , will bless their homes , consecrate their_families and help_them , as they breathe their last , across the threshold of eternal happiness . Since , therefore , it -isaia- the priest chiefly who performs the sacred_liturgy in the name of the Church , its organization , regulation and details cannot_but be subject to Church authority . This conclusion , based on the nature of Christian worship itself , -isaia- further confirmed by the testimony of history . Additional proof of this indefeasible right of the ecclesiastical hierarchy lies in the circumstances that the sacred_liturgy -isaia- intimately bound up with doctrinal propositions which_the Church proposes to be perfectly true and certain , and must as a consequence conform to the decrees respecting Catholic faith issued by the supreme teaching_authority of the Church with_a_view to safeguarding the integrity of the religion revealed by God . On this_subject We judge it Our duty to rectify an attitude with_which you_are doubtless familiar , Venerable Brethren . We refer to the error and fallacious reasoning of those_who_have claimed that the sacred_liturgy -isaia- a kind of proving ground for the truths to be held of faith , meaning by this_that the Church -isaia- obliged to declare such a doctrine sound when_it_-isaia- found to have produced fruits of piety and sanctity through the sacred rites of the liturgy , and to reject it otherwise . Hence the epigram , '' Lex orandi , lex credendi '' the law for prayer_-isaia- the law for faith . But this_-isaia-_not what_the Church teaches and enjoins . The worship she offers to God , all good and great , -isaia- a continuous profession of Catholic faith and a continuous exercise of hope and charity , as Augustine puts it tersely . '' God -isaia- to be worshipped , '' he says , '' by faith , hope and charity . '' In the sacred_liturgy we profess the Catholic faith explicitly and openly , not_only by the celebration of the mysteries , and by offering the holy sacrifice and administering the sacraments , but_also by saying or singing the credo or Symbol of the faith it -isaia- indeed the sign and badge , as it were , of the Christian along_with other texts , and likewise by the reading of holy_scripture , written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost . The entire liturgy , therefore , has the Catholic faith for its content , inasmuch as it bears public witness to the faith of the Church . For this_reason , whenever there_was question of defining a truth revealed by God , the Sovereign Pontiff and the Councils in their recourse to the '' theological sources , '' as they_are_called , have_not seldom drawn many an argument from this sacred science of the liturgy . For an example in point , Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , so argued when he proclaimed the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary . Similarly during the discussion of a doubtful or controversial truth , the Church and the Holy Fathers have_not failed to look to the age old and age honored sacred rites for enlightenment . Hence the well_known and venerable maxim , '' Legem credendi lex statuat supplicandi '' let_the rule for prayer determine the rule of belief . The sacred_liturgy , consequently , does_not decide or determine independently and of itself what_-isaia- of Catholic faith . More properly , since_the liturgy -isaia-_also a profession of eternal truths , and subject , as such , to the supreme teaching_authority of the Church , it can supply proofs and testimony , quite clearly , of no little value , towards_the determination of a particular point of Christian doctrine . But if one desires to differentiate and describe the relationship_between faith and the sacred_liturgy in absolute and general terms , it -isaia- perfectly correct to say , '' Lex credendi legem statuat supplicandi '' let_the rule of belief determine the rule of prayer . The same holds true for the other theological virtues also , '' In . fide , spe , caritate continuato desiderio semper oramus '' we pray always , with constant yearning in faith , hope and charity . From time immemorial the ecclesiastical hierarchy has exercised this right in matters liturgical . It has organized and regulated divine_worship , enriching it constantly with new splendor and beauty , to the glory of God and the spiritual profit of Christians . What -isaia- more , it has not_been slow keeping the substance of the Mass and sacraments carefully intact to modify what it deemed not altogether fitting , and to add what appeared more likely to increase the honor paid to Jesus Christ and the august Trinity , and to instruct and stimulate the Christian people to greater advantage . The sacred_liturgy does , in fact , include divine as well as human elements . The former , instituted as they_have_been by God , cannot be changed in any_way by men . But the human components admit of various modifications , as the needs of the age , circumstance and the good of souls may require , and as the ecclesiastical hierarchy , under guidance of the Holy Spirit , may_have authorized . This will explain the marvelous variety of Eastern and Western rites . Here -isaia- the reason_for the gradual addition , through successive development , of particular religious customs and practices of piety only faintly discernible in earlier times . Hence likewise it happens from time to time that certain devotions long since forgotten are revived and practiced anew . All these developments attest the abiding life of the immaculate Spouse of Jesus Christ through these many centuries . They are the sacred language she uses , as the ages run their course , to profess to her_divine Spouse her_own faith along_with that of the nations committed to her charge , and her_own unfailing love . They furnish proof , besides , of the wisdom of the teaching method she employs to arouse and nourish constantly the '' Christian instinct . Several causes , really have_been instrumental in the progress and development of the sacred_liturgy during the long and glorious life of the Church . Thus , for example , as Catholic doctrine on the Incarnate Word of God , the eucharistic sacrament and sacrifice , and Mary the Virgin Mother of God came to be determined with_greater certitude and clarity , new ritual forms were introduced through_which the acts of the liturgy proceeded to reproduce this brighter light issuing from the decrees of the teaching_authority of the Church , and to reflect it , in a sense so that it might reach the minds and hearts of Christ s people more readily . The subsequent advances in ecclesiastical discipline for the administering of the sacraments , that of penance for example ; the institution and later suppression of the catechumenate ; and again , the practice of eucharistic communion under a single species , adopted in the Latin Church ; these developments were assuredly responsible in no little measure for the modification of the ancient ritual in the course of time , and for the gradual introduction of new rites considered more in accord with prevailing discipline in these_matters . Just as notable a contribution to this progressive transformation was_made by devotional trends and practices not directly related to the sacred_liturgy , which began to appear , by God s wonderful design , in later periods , and grew to be so popular . We may instance the spread and ever mounting ardor of devotion to the Blessed Eucharist , devotion to the most bitter passion of our Redeemer , devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus , to the Virgin Mother of God and to her most chaste spouse . Other manifestations of piety have_also played their circumstantial part in this_same liturgical development . Among them may be cited the public pilgrimages to the tombs of the martyrs prompted by motives of devotion , the special periods of fasting instituted for the same reason , and lastly , in this gracious city of Rome , the penitential recitation of the litanies during the '' station '' processions , in which even the Sovereign Pontiff frequently joined . It -isaia- likewise easy to understand_that the progress of the fine arts , those of architecture , painting and music above all , has exerted considerable influence on the choice and disposition of the various external features of the sacred_liturgy . The Church has further used her right of control over liturgical observance to protect the purity of divine_worship against abuse from dangerous and imprudent innovations introduced by private individuals and particular_churches . Thus it came about during the th century , when usages and customs of this_sort had become increasingly prevalent and exaggerated , and when private initiative in matters liturgical threatened to compromise the integrity of faith and devotion , to the great advantage of heretics and further spread of their errors that in the year , Our predecessor Sixtus V of immortal memory established the Sacred Congregation of Rites , charged with the defense of the legitimate rites of the Church and with the prohibition of any spurious innovation . This body fulfills even today the official function of supervision and legislation with_regard to all matters touching the sacred_liturgy . It follows from this_that the Sovereign Pontiff alone enjoys the right to recognize and establish any practice touching the worship of God , to introduce and approve new rites , as also to modify those he judges to require modification . Bishops , for their_part , have_the right and duty carefully to watch over the exact observance of the prescriptions of the sacred canons respecting divine_worship . Private individuals , therefore , even_though they be clerics , may_not be left to decide for themselves in these holy and venerable matters , involving as they do the religious_life of Christian society along_with the exercise of the priesthood of Jesus Christ and worship of God ; concerned as they_are with the honor due to the Blessed Trinity , the Word Incarnate and His august mother and the other saints , and with the salvation_of_souls as well . For the same reason no private person has any authority to regulate external practices of this_kind , which_are intimately bound up with Church discipline and with the order , unity and concord of the Mystical Body and frequently even with the integrity of Catholic faith itself . The Church -isaia- without question a living organism , and as an organism , in respect of the sacred_liturgy also , she grows , matures , develops , adapts and accommodates herself to temporal needs and circumstances , provided only that the integrity of her doctrine be safeguarded . This notwithstanding , the temerity and daring of those_who introduce novel liturgical practices , or call_for the revival of obsolete rites out of harmony_with prevailing laws and rubrics , deserve severe reproof . It has pained Us grievously to note , Venerable Brethren , that_such innovations are actually being introduced , not merely in minor details but in matters of major importance as well . We instance , in point of fact , those_who make_use of the vernacular in the celebration of the august eucharistic_sacrifice ; those_who transfer certain feast days which_have_been appointed and established after mature deliberation to other dates ; those , finally , who delete from the prayerbooks approved for public use the sacred texts of the Old Testament , deeming them little suited and inopportune for modern times . The use of the Latin language , customary in a considerable portion of the Church , -isaia- a manifest and beautiful sign of unity , as well as an effective antidote for_any corruption of doctrinal truth . In spite of this , the use of the mother tongue in connection_with several of the rites may be of much advantage to the people . But the Apostolic See alone_-isaia- empowered to grant this permission . It -isaia- forbidden , therefore , to take any action whatever of this nature without having requested and obtained such consent , since_the sacred_liturgy , as We have_said , -isaia- entirely subject to the discretion and approval of the Holy See . The same reasoning holds in the case of some persons_who are bent on the restoration of all the ancient rites and ceremonies indiscriminately . The liturgy of the early ages -isaia- most certainly worthy of all veneration . But ancient usage must_not be esteemed more suitable and proper , either in its_own right or in its significance for later times and new situations , on the simple ground that it carries the savor and aroma of antiquity . The more_recent liturgical rites likewise deserve reverence and respect . They , too , owe their inspiration to the Holy Spirit , who assists the Church in every_age even to the consummation of the world . They are equally the resources used by the majestic Spouse of Jesus Christ to promote and procure the sanctity of man . Assuredly it -isaia- a wise and most laudable thing to return in spirit and affection to the sources of the sacred_liturgy . For research in this_field of study , by tracing it back to its origins , contributes valuable assistance towards a more thorough and careful investigation of the significance of feast days , and of the meaning of the texts and sacred ceremonies employed on their occasion . But it -isaia- neither wise nor laudable to reduce everything to antiquity by every possible device . Thus , to cite some instances , one would be straying from the straight path were he to wish the altar restored to its primitive tableform ; were he to want black excluded as a color for the liturgical vestments ; were he to forbid the use of sacred images and statues in Churches ; were he to order the crucifix so designed that the divine Redeemer s body shows no trace of His cruel sufferings ; and lastly were he to disdain and reject polyphonic music or singing in parts , even where it conforms to regulations issued by the Holy See . Clearly no sincere Catholic can refuse to accept the formulation of Christian doctrine more recently elaborated and proclaimed as dogmas by the Church , under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit with abundant fruit for souls , because it pleases him to hark back to the old formulas . No more can any Catholic in his right senses repudiate existing legislation of the Church to revert to prescriptions based on the earliest sources of canon_law . Just as obviously unwise and mistaken -isaia- the zeal of one_who in matters liturgical would go back to the rites and usage of antiquity , discarding the new patterns introduced by disposition of divine Providence to meet_the changes of circumstances and situation . This way of acting bids fair to revive the exaggerated and senseless antiquarianism to which_the illegal Council of Pistoia gave rise . It likewise attempts to reinstate a series of errors which_were responsible_for the calling of that meeting as well as for those resulting from it , with grievous harm to souls , and which_the Church , the ever watchful guardian of the '' deposit of faith '' committed to her charge by her_divine Founder , had every right and reason to condemn . For perverse designs and ventures of this_sort tend to paralyze and weaken that process of sanctification by which_the sacred_liturgy directs the sons of adoption to their Heavenly Father of their_souls salvation . In every measure taken , then , let proper contact_with_the ecclesiastical hierarchy be maintained . Let no one arrogate to himself_the right to make regulations and impose them on others -atti_degli_apostoli- will . Only the Sovereign Pontiff , as the successor of Saint Peter , charged by the divine Redeemer with the feeding of His entire flock , and with_him , in obedience to the Apostolic See , the bishops '' whom_the Holy Ghost has placed . to rule_the Church of God , '' have_the right and the duty to govern_the Christian people . Consequently , Venerable Brethren , whenever you assert your authority even on occasion with wholesome severity you are_not merely acquitting yourselves of your duty ; you_are defending the very will of the Founder of the Church . The mystery of the most Holy Eucharist which Christ , the High Priest instituted , and which He commands to be continually renewed in the Church by His ministers , -isaia- the culmination and center , as it were , of the Christian religion . We consider it opportune in speaking about the crowning act of the sacred_liturgy , to delay for a little while and call your attention , Venerable Brethren , to this_most important subject . Christ the Lord , '' Eternal Priest according to the order of Melchisedech , '' '' loving His own who_were of the world , '' '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the last supper , on the night He was betrayed , wishing to leave His beloved Spouse , the Church , a visible sacrifice such as the nature of men requires , that_would re present_the bloody sacrifice offered once on the cross , and perpetuate its memory to the end of time , and whose salutary virtue might be applied in remitting those sins which we daily commit , . offered His body_and_blood under the species of bread and wine to God the Father , and under the same species allowed the apostles , whom he -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time constituted the priests of the New Testament , to partake thereof ; commanding them and their successors in the priesthood to make_the same offering . The august sacrifice of the altar , then , -isaia- no mere empty commemoration of the passion and death of Jesus Christ , but a true and proper act of sacrifice , whereby_the High Priest by an unbloody immolation offers Himself a most acceptable victim to the Eternal Father , as He did upon the cross . '' It -isaia- one_and_the_same victim ; the same person now offers it by the ministry of His priests , who then offered Himself on the cross , the manner of offering alone being different . The priest -isaia-_the_same , Jesus Christ , whose sacred Person His minister represents . Now the minister , by reason of the sacerdotal consecration which he has_received , -isaia- made like to the High Priest and possesses the power of performing actions in virtue of Christ s very person . Wherefore in his priestly activity he in a certain manner '' lends his tongue , and gives his hand '' to Christ . Likewise the victim -isaia-_the_same , namely , our_divine Redeemer in His human_nature with His true body_and_blood . The manner , however , in which Christ -isaia- offered -isaia- different . On the cross He completely offered Himself and all His sufferings to God , and the immolation of the victim was brought_about by the bloody death , which He underwent of His free will . But on the altar , by reason of the glorified state of His human_nature , '' death shall_have no more dominion over Him , '' and so the shedding of His blood -isaia- impossible ; still , according to the plan of divine wisdom , the sacrifice of our Redeemer -isaia- shown forth in an admirable manner by external signs which_are the symbols of His death . For by the '' transubstantiation '' of bread into the body of Christ and of wine into His blood , His body_and_blood are both really present : now the eucharistic species under which He -isaia- present symbolize the actual separation of His body_and_blood . Thus the commemorative representation of His death , which actually took_place on Calvary , -isaia- repeated in every sacrifice of the altar , seeing that Jesus Christ -isaia- symbolically shown by separate symbols to be in a state of victimhood . Moreover , the appointed ends are the same . The first of these -isaia- to give glory to the Heavenly Father . From His birth to His death Jesus Christ burned with zeal for the divine glory ; and the offering of His blood upon the cross rose to heaven in an odor of sweetness . To perpetuate this praise , the members of the Mystical Body are_united with_their divine Head in the eucharistic_sacrifice , and with Him , together_with_the Angels and Archangels , they sing immortal praise to God and give all honor and glory to the Father Almighty . The second end -isaia- duly to give thanks to God . Only the divine Redeemer , as the eternal Father s most beloved Son whose immense love He knew , could offer Him a worthy return of gratitude . This was His intention and desire -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper when He '' gave thanks . '' He did not_cease to do so when hanging upon the cross , nor_does He fail to do so in the august sacrifice of the altar , which_-isaia- an act of thanksgiving or a '' eucharistic '' act ; since_this '' -isaia- truly meet and just , right and availing unto salvation . The third end proposed -isaia- that of expiation , propitiation and reconciliation . Certainly , no one was better fitted to make satisfaction to Almighty God for all the sins of men than was Christ . Therefore , He desired to be immolated upon the cross '' as a propitiation for our sins , not_for ours only but_also_for those of the whole_world '' and likewise He daily offers Himself upon our altars for our redemption , that_we_may be rescued from eternal damnation and admitted into the company of the elect . This He does , not_for us only who_are in this mortal life , but_also '' for all who rest in Christ , who_have gone before us with the sign of faith and repose in the sleep of peace ; '' for whether we live , or whether we die '' still we are_not separated_from the one and only Christ . The fourth end , finally , -isaia- that of impetration . Man , being the prodigal son , has made bad use of and dissipated the goods which he received_from his heavenly Father . Accordingly , he has_been reduced to the utmost poverty and to extreme degradation . However , Christ on the cross '' offering prayers and supplications with a loud cry and tears , has_been heard for His reverence . '' Likewise upon the altar He -isaia-_our mediator with God in the same efficacious manner , so that_we_may be filled_with every blessing and grace . It -isaia- easy , therefore , to understand why_the holy Council of Trent lays down that by means of the eucharistic_sacrifice the saving virtue of the cross -isaia- imparted to us for the remission of the sins we daily commit . Now the Apostle of the Gentiles proclaims_the copious plenitude and the perfection of the sacrifice of the cross , when he says_that Christ by one oblation has perfected for ever them that_are sanctified . For the merits of this sacrifice , since_they are altogether boundless and immeasurable , know no limits ; for they_are meant for all men of every time_and_place . This follows from the fact_that in this sacrifice the God Man -isaia- the priest and victim ; that His immolation was entirely perfect , as was His obedience to the will of His eternal Father ; and also_that He suffered death as the Head of the human_race : '' See how we were bought : Christ hangs upon the cross , see -atti_degli_apostoli- what a price He makes His purchase . He sheds His blood , He buys with His blood , He buys with the blood of the Spotless Lamb , He buys with the blood of God s only Son . He who buys -isaia- Christ ; the price -isaia- His blood ; the possession bought -isaia- the world . This purchase , however , does_not immediately have its_full effect ; since Christ , after redeeming the world -atti_degli_apostoli- the lavish cost of His own blood , still must come into complete possession of the souls of men . Wherefore , that the redemption and salvation of each_person and of future generations unto the end of time may be effectively accomplished , and be acceptable to God , it -isaia- necessary_that men should individually come into vital contact_with_the sacrifice of the cross , so that the merits , which flow from it , should be imparted to them . In a certain_sense it can_be_said that on Calvary Christ built a font of purification and salvation which He filled_with_the blood He shed ; but if men do not bathe in it and there wash away the stains of their iniquities , they can_never be purified and saved . The cooperation of the faithful -isaia- required so that sinners may be individually purified in the blood of the Lamb . For though , speaking generally , Christ reconciled by His painful death the whole_human_race with the Father , He wished that all should approach and be drawn to His cross , especially by means of the sacraments and the eucharistic_sacrifice , to obtain the salutary fruits produced by Him upon it . Through this active and individual participation , the members of the Mystical Body not_only become daily more like to their divine Head , but the life flowing from the Head -isaia- imparted to the members , so that_we_can each repeat the words of St . Paul , '' With Christ I -amos- nailed to the cross : I live , now not I , but Christ liveth in me . '' We have_already explained sufficiently and of set purpose on another occasion , that Jesus Christ '' when dying on the cross , bestowed upon His Church , as a completely gratuitous gift , the immense treasure of the redemption . But when it -isaia-_a_question of distributing this treasure , He not_only commits the work of sanctification to His Immaculate Spouse , but_also wishes that , to a certain extent , sanctity should derive from her activity . The august sacrifice of the altar -isaia- , as it were , the supreme instrument whereby_the merits won by the divine Redeemer upon the cross are distributed to the faithful : '' as often as this commemorative sacrifice -isaia- offered , there_-isaia- wrought the work of our Redemption . '' This , however , so far from lessening the dignity of the actual sacrifice on Calvary , rather proclaims and renders more manifest its greatness and its necessity , as the Council of Trent declares . Its daily immolation reminds us that_there_-isaia- no salvation except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ and that God Himself wishes that there_should be a continuation of this sacrifice '' from the rising of the sun till the going down thereof , '' so that_there may be no cessation of the hymn of praise and thanksgiving which_man owes to God , seeing that he required His help continually and has need of the blood of the Redeemer to remit sin which challenges God s justice . It -isaia- , therefore , desirable , Venerable Brethren , that all the faithful should be aware_that to participate in the eucharistic_sacrifice -isaia- their chief duty and supreme dignity , and that_not in an inert and negligent fashion , giving way to distractions and day dreaming , but with_such earnestness and concentration that_they_may be united as closely as possible with the High Priest , according to the Apostle , '' Let this mind be in you which_was also in Christ Jesus . '' And together_with Him and through Him let_them make_their oblation , and in union with Him let_them offer up themselves . It -isaia- quite true_that Christ -isaia- a priest ; but He -isaia- a priest not_for Himself but_for us , when in the name of the whole_human_race He offers our prayers and religious homage to the eternal Father ; He -isaia-_also a victim and for us since He substitutes Himself for sinful man . Now the exhortation of the Apostle , '' Let this mind be in you which_was also in Christ Jesus , '' requires that all Christians should possess , as far as -isaia- humanly possible , the same dispositions as those_which the divine Redeemer had when He offered Himself in sacrifice : that_-isaia- to say , they_should in a humble attitude of mind , pay adoration , honor , praise and thanksgiving to the supreme majesty of God . Moreover , it means_that they_must assume to some extent the character of a victim , that_they deny themselves as the Gospel commands , that freely and of their_own accord they do penance and that_each detests and satisfies for his sins . It means , in a word , that we must all undergo with Christ a mystical death on the cross so that_we_can apply to ourselves the words of St . Paul , '' With Christ I -amos- nailed to the cross . The fact , however , that_the_faithful participate in the eucharistic_sacrifice does_not_mean that_they also are endowed_with priestly power . It -isaia-_very necessary_that you make_this quite clear to your flocks . For there_are today , Venerable Brethren , those_who , approximating to errors long since condemned teach that in the New Testament by the word '' priesthood '' -isaia- meant only that priesthood which applies to all who_have_been baptized ; and hold that the command by which Christ gave power to His apostles -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper to do what He Himself had done , applies directly to the entire Christian Church , and that thence , and thence only , arises the hierarchical priesthood . Hence they assert that the people_are possessed of a true priestly power , while the priest only acts in virtue of an office committed to him by the community . Wherefore , they look on the eucharistic_sacrifice as a '' concelebration , '' in the literal meaning of that term , and consider it more fitting_that priests should '' concelebrate '' with the people present than that_they_should offer the sacrifice privately when_the people_are absent . It -isaia- superfluous to explain how captious errors of this_sort completely contradict the truths which_we_have just stated above , when treating of the place of the priest in the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ . But we deem it necessary to recall that the priest acts for the people only_because he represents Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- Head of all His members and offers Himself in their stead . Hence , he goes to the altar as the minister of Christ , inferior to Christ but superior to the people . The people , on the other_hand , since_they in no sense represent the divine Redeemer and are_not mediator between themselves and God , can in no way possess the sacerdotal power . All this_has the certitude of faith . However , it must_also be said that_the_faithful do offer the divine Victim , though in a different sense . This has_already_been stated in the clearest terms by some of Our predecessors and some Doctors of the Church . '' Not only , '' says Innocent III of immortal memory , '' do the priests offer the sacrifice , but_also all the faithful : for_what the priest does personally by virtue of his_ministry , the faithful do collectively by virtue of their intention . '' We are happy to recall one of St . Robert Bellarmine s many statements on this_subject . '' The sacrifice , '' he says '' -isaia- principally offered in the person of Christ . Thus the oblation that follows the consecration -isaia- a sort of attestation that_the_whole Church consents in the oblation made by Christ , and offers it along_with Him . Moreover , the rites and prayers of the eucharistic_sacrifice signify and show no less clearly that the oblation of the Victim -isaia- made by the priests in company with the people . For not_only does the sacred minister , after_the oblation of the bread and wine when he turns to the people , say the significant prayer : '' Pray brethren_,_that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father Almighty ; '' but_also the prayers by which_the divine Victim -isaia- offered to God are generally expressed in the plural number : and in these it -isaia- indicated more_than_once that the people also participate in this august sacrifice inasmuch as they offer the same . The following words , for example , are used : '' For whom we offer , or who offer up to Thee . We therefore beseech thee , O Lord , to be appeased and to receive this offering of our bounded duty , as also of thy whole household . We thy servants , as also thy whole_people . do offer unto thy most excellent majesty , of thine own gifts bestowed upon us , a pure victim , a holy victim , a spotless victim . Nor -isaia- it to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- , that_the_faithful should be raised to this dignity . By the waters of baptism , as by common right , Christians are made members of the Mystical Body of Christ the Priest , and by the '' character '' which_-isaia- imprinted on their_souls , they_are appointed to give worship to God . Thus they participate , according_to_their condition , in the priesthood of Christ . In every_age of the Church s history , the mind of man , enlightened by faith , has aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the greatest possible knowledge of things divine . It -isaia- fitting , then_,_that the Christian people should_also desire to know in what sense they_are said in the canon of the Mass to offer up the sacrifice . To satisfy such a pious desire , then , We shall here explain the matter briefly and concisely . First of all the more extrinsic explanations are these : it frequently happens that_the_faithful assisting -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass join their prayers alternately with_those of the priest , and sometimes a more frequent occurrence in ancient times they offer to the ministers -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar bread and wine to be changed into the body_and_blood of Christ , and , finally , by their alms they get the priest to offer the divine victim for their intentions . But there_-isaia-_also a more profound reason_why all Christians , especially_those who_are present -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass , are said to offer the sacrifice . In this_most important subject it -isaia- necessary , in order to avoid giving rise to a dangerous error , that we define the exact meaning of the word '' offer . '' The unbloody immolation -atti_degli_apostoli- the words of consecration , when Christ -isaia- made present upon the altar in the state of a victim , -isaia- performed by the priest and by him alone , as the representative of Christ and not as the representative of the faithful . But it -isaia- because the priest places the divine victim upon the altar that he offers it to God the Father as an oblation for the glory of the Blessed Trinity and for the good of the whole Church . Now the faithful participate in the oblation , understood in this limited sense , after their_own fashion and in a twofold manner , namely , because_they not_only offer the sacrifice by the hands of the priest , but_also , to a certain extent , in union with_him . It -isaia- by reason of this participation that the offering made by the people -isaia-_also included in liturgical worship . Now it -isaia- clear that_the_faithful offer the sacrifice by the hands of the priest from the fact_that the minister -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar , in offering a sacrifice in the name of all His members , represents Christ , the Head of the Mystical Body . Hence the whole Church can rightly be said to offer up the victim through Christ . But the conclusion that the people offer the sacrifice with the priest himself_-isaia- not based on the fact_that , being members of the Church no less_than the priest himself , they perform a visible liturgical rite ; for this_-isaia- the privilege only of the minister who has_been divinely appointed to this office : rather it -isaia- based on the fact_that the people unite their_hearts in praise , impetration , expiation and thanksgiving with prayers or intention of the priest , even of the High Priest himself , so that in the one and same offering of the victim and according to a visible sacerdotal rite , they_may be presented to God the Father . It -isaia- obviously necessary_that the external sacrificial rite should , of its_very nature , signify the internal worship of the heart . Now the sacrifice of the New Law signifies that supreme worship by which_the principal Offerer himself , who_-isaia- Christ , and , in union with Him and through Him , all the members of the Mystical Body pay God the honor and reverence that_are due to Him . We are_very pleased to learn that this_teaching , thanks to a more intense study of the liturgy on the part of many , especially in recent_years , has_been_given full recognition . We must , however , deeply deplore certain exaggerations and over statements which_are not in agreement with the true teaching of the Church . Some in fact disapprove altogether of those Masses which_are offered privately and without_any congregation , on the ground that_they_are a departure from the ancient way of offering the sacrifice ; moreover , there_are_some who assert that priests cannot offer Mass -atti_degli_apostoli- different altars -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , because , by doing so , they separate the community of the faithful and imperil its unity ; while some go so far as to hold that the people must confirm and ratify the sacrifice if it -isaia- to have its_proper force and value . They are mistaken in appealing in this_matter to the social character of the eucharistic_sacrifice , for as often as a priest repeats what_the divine Redeemer did -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , the sacrifice -isaia- really completed . Moreover , this sacrifice , necessarily and of its_very nature , has_always and everywhere the character of a public and social act , inasmuch as he who offers it acts in the name of Christ and of the faithful , whose Head -isaia- the divine Redeemer , and he offers it to God for the holy Catholic Church , and for the living and the dead . This -isaia- undoubtedly so , whether the faithful_are present as we desire and commend them to be in great numbers and with devotion or are_not present , since_it_-isaia- in no wise required that the people ratify what_the sacred minister has done . Still , though it -isaia- clear from what We have_said that the Mass -isaia- offered in the name of Christ and of the Church and that_it_-isaia- not robbed of its social effects though it be celebrated by a priest without a server , nonetheless , on account of the dignity of such an august mystery , it -isaia-_our earnest desire as Mother Church has_always commanded that no priest should say Mass unless a server -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand to answer the prayers , as canon prescribes . In order_that the oblation by which_the faithful offer the divine Victim in this sacrifice to the heavenly Father may_have its_full effect , it -isaia- necessary_that the people add something else , namely , the offering of themselves as a victim . This offering in fact -isaia- not confined merely to the liturgical sacrifice . For the Prince of the Apostles wishes us , as living stones built upon Christ , the cornerstone , to be able as '' a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ . Paul the Apostle addresses the following words of exhortation to Christians , without distinction of time , '' I beseech you therefore , . that_you present your bodies , a living sacrifice , holy , pleasing unto God , your reasonable service . '' But -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time especially_when the faithful take_part in the liturgical service with_such piety and recollection that it can truly be said of them : '' whose faith and devotion -isaia- known to Thee , '' it -isaia- then , with the High Priest and through Him they offer themselves as a spiritual sacrifice , that_each one s faith ought to become more ready to work through charity , his piety more real and fervent , and each one_should consecrate himself to the furthering of the divine glory , desiring to become as like as possible to Christ in His most grievous sufferings . This we are_also taught by those exhortations which_the Bishop , in the Church s name , addresses to priests on the day of their ordination , '' Understand what_you do , imitate what_you handle , and since you celebrate the mystery of the Lord s death , take good care to mortify your members with_their vices and concupiscences . '' In almost the same manner the sacred_books of the liturgy advise Christians who come to Mass to participate in the sacrifice : '' At this . altar let innocence be in honor , let pride be sacrificed , anger slain , impurity and every evil desire laid low , let_the sacrifice of chastity be offered in place of doves and instead of the young pigeons the sacrifice of innocence . '' While we stand before the altar , then , it -isaia-_our duty so to transform our_hearts , that_every trace of sin may be completely blotted out , while whatever promotes supernatural life through Christ may be zealously fostered and strengthened even to the extent_that , in union with the immaculate Victim , we become a victim acceptable to the eternal Father . The prescriptions in fact of the sacred_liturgy aim , by every_means -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal , -atti_degli_apostoli- helping the Church to bring_about this most_holy purpose in the most suitable manner possible . This -isaia- the object not_only of readings , homilies and other sermons given by priests , as also the whole cycle of mysteries which_are proposed for our commemoration in the course of the year , but_it_-isaia- also the purpose of vestments , of sacred rites and their external splendor . All these_things aim -atti_degli_apostoli- '' enhancing the majesty of this_great Sacrifice , and raising the minds of the faithful by means of these visible signs of religion and piety , to the contemplation of the sublime truths contained in this sacrifice . All the elements of the liturgy , then , would_have us reproduce in our_hearts the likeness of the divine Redeemer through the mystery of the cross , according to the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles , '' With Christ I -amos- nailed to the cross . I live , now not I , but Christ liveth in me . '' Thus we become a victim , as it were , along_with Christ to increase the glory of the eternal Father . Let this , then , be the intention and aspiration of the faithful , when_they offer up the divine Victim in the Mass . Augustine writes , our mystery -isaia- enacted on the Lord s table , that_-isaia- Christ our Lord Himself , who_-isaia- the Head and symbol of that union through_which we are the body of Christ and members of His Body ; if St . Robert Bellarmine teaches , according to the mind of the Doctor of Hippo , that in the sacrifice of the altar there_-isaia- signified the general sacrifice by which_the whole Mystical Body of Christ , that_-isaia- , all the city of redeemed , -isaia- offered up to God through Christ , the High Priest : nothing can be conceived more just or fitting than_that all of us in union with_our Head , who suffered for our sake , should_also sacrifice ourselves to the eternal Father . For in the sacrament of the altar , as the same St . Augustine has it , the Church -isaia- made to see_that in what she offers she herself -isaia- offered . Let the faithful , therefore , consider to what a high dignity they_are raised by the sacrament of baptism . They should_not think it enough to participate in the eucharistic_sacrifice with_that general intention which befits members of Christ and children of the Church , but let_them further , in keeping_with_the spirit of the sacred_liturgy , be most closely united with the High Priest and His earthly minister , -atti_degli_apostoli- the time the consecration of the divine Victim -isaia- enacted , and -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time especially_when those solemn words are pronounced , '' By Him and with Him and in Him -isaia- to Thee , God the Father almighty , in the unity of the Holy Ghost , all honor and glory for ever and ever '' ; to these_words in fact the people answer , '' Amen . '' Nor should Christians forget to offer themselves , their cares , their sorrows , their distress and their necessities in union with_their divine Savior upon the cross . Therefore , they_are to be praised who , with the idea of getting the Christian people to take_part more_easily and more fruitfully in the Mass , strive to make_them familiar with the '' Roman Missal , '' so that_the_faithful , united with the priest , may pray together in the very words and sentiments of the Church . They also are to be commended who strive to make_the liturgy even in an external way a sacred act in which all who_are present may share . This can be done in more_than one way , when , for instance , the whole congregation , in accordance_with_the rules of the liturgy , either answer the priest in an orderly and fitting manner , or sing hymns suitable to the different parts of the Mass , or do both , or finally in high Masses when_they answer the prayers of the minister of Jesus Christ and also sing the liturgical chant . These methods of participation in the Mass are to be approved and recommended when_they_are in complete agreement with the precepts of the Church and the rubrics of the liturgy . Their chief aim -isaia- to foster and promote the people s piety and intimate_union with Christ and His visible minister and to arouse those internal sentiments and dispositions which_should make our_hearts become like to that of the High Priest of the New Testament . However , though_they show also in an outward manner that the very nature of the sacrifice , as offered by the Mediator between God and men , must be regarded as the act of the whole Mystical Body of Christ , still they_are by no means necessary to constitute it a public act or to give it a social character . And besides , a '' dialogue '' Mass of this_kind cannot replace the high Mass , which , as a matter of fact , though it should be offered with only the sacred ministers present , possesses its_own special dignity due to the impressive character of its ritual and the magnificence of its ceremonies . The splendor and grandeur of a high Mass , however , are_very much increased if , as the Church desires , the people_are present in great numbers and with devotion . It -isaia- to be observed , also , that_they_have strayed from the path of truth and right_reason who , led away by false opinions , make so much of these accidentals as to presume to assert that without them the Mass cannot fulfill its appointed end . Many of the faithful_are unable to use the Roman missal even_though it -isaia- written in the vernacular ; nor are all capable of understanding correctly the liturgical rites and formulas . So varied and diverse are men s talents and characters that_it_-isaia- impossible for all to be moved and attracted to the same extent by community prayers , hymns and liturgical services . Moreover , the needs and inclinations of all are_not the same , nor are they always constant in the same individual . Who , then , would say , on account of such a prejudice , that all these Christians cannot participate in the Mass nor share its fruits ? On the contrary , they_can adopt some other method which proves easier for certain people ; for instance , they_can lovingly meditate on the mysteries of Jesus Christ or perform other exercises of piety or recite prayers which , though_they differ from the sacred rites , are_still essentially in harmony_with them . Wherefore We exhort you , Venerable Brethren , that_each in his diocese or ecclesiastical jurisdiction supervise and regulate the manner and method in which_the people take_part in the liturgy , according to the rubrics of the missal and in keeping_with_the injunctions which_the Sacred Congregation of Rites and the Code of canon_law have published . Let everything be done with due order and dignity , and let no one , not_even a priest , make_use of the sacred edifices according_to_his whim to try out experiments . It -isaia-_also Our wish_that in each diocese an advisory committee to promote the liturgical apostolate should be established , similar to that_which cares for sacred_music and art , so that_with your watchful guidance everything may be carefully carried_out in accordance_with_the prescriptions of the Apostolic See . In religious communities let all those regulations be accurately observed which_are laid_down in their_respective constitutions , nor let any innovations be made which_the superiors of these communities have_not previously approved . But however much variety and disparity there_may be in the exterior manner and circumstances in which_the Christian laity participate in the Mass and other liturgical functions , constant and earnest effort must be made to unite the congregation in spirit as much as possible with the divine Redeemer , so that their_lives may be daily enriched with more abundant sanctity , and greater glory be given to the heaven Father . The august sacrifice of the altar -isaia- concluded with communion or the partaking of the divine feast . But , as all know , the integrity of the sacrifice only requires that the priest partake of the heavenly food . Although it -isaia- most desirable that the people should_also approach the holy table , this_-isaia-_not required_for the integrity of the sacrifice . We wish in this_matter to repeat the remarks which Our predecessor Benedict XIV makes with_regard to the definitions of the Council of Trent : '' First We must state that none of the faithful can hold that private Masses , in which_the priest alone receives holy communion , are therefore unlawful and do not fulfill the idea of the true , perfect and complete unbloody sacrifice instituted by Christ our Lord . For the faithful know quite well , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least can easily be taught , that the Council of Trent , supported by the doctrine which_the uninterrupted tradition of the Church has preserved , condemned the new and false opinion of Luther as opposed to this tradition . '' '' If anyone shall say that Masses in which_the priest only receives communion , are unlawful , and therefore should be abolished , let_him be anathema . They , therefore , err from the path of truth who_do_not want to have Masses celebrated unless the faithful communicate ; and those are still_more in error who , in holding that_it_-isaia- altogether necessary_for the faithful to receive holy communion as well as the priest , put forward the captious argument that here there_-isaia- question not of a sacrifice merely , but of a sacrifice and a supper of brotherly union , and consider_the general communion of all present as the culminating point of the whole celebration . Now it cannot be over emphasized that the eucharistic_sacrifice of its_very nature_-isaia- the unbloody immolation of the divine Victim , which_-isaia- made manifest in a mystical manner by the separation of the sacred species and by their oblation to the eternal Father . Holy communion pertains to the integrity of the Mass and to the partaking of the august sacrament ; but while it -isaia- obligatory for the priest who says the Mass , it -isaia- only something earnestly recommended to the faithful . The Church , as the teacher of truth , strives by every_means in her power to safeguard the integrity of the Catholic faith , and like a mother solicitous for the welfare of her_children , she exhorts them most earnestly to partake fervently and frequently of the richest treasure of our religion . She wishes in the first_place that Christians especially_when they_cannot easily receive holy communion should do so -atti_degli_apostoli- least by desire , so that_with renewed faith , reverence , humility and complete trust in the goodness of the divine Redeemer , they_may be united to Him in the spirit of the most ardent charity . But the desire of Mother Church does_not stop here . For since by feasting upon the bread of angels we can by a '' sacramental '' communion , as we have_already said , also become partakers of the sacrifice , she repeats the invitation to all her_children individually , '' Take and eat . Do this in memory of Me '' so that '' we may continually experience within us the fruit of our redemption '' in a more efficacious manner . For this_reason_the Council of Trent , reechoing , as it were , the invitation of Christ and His immaculate Spouse , has earnestly exhorted '' the faithful when_they attend Mass to communicate not_only by a spiritual communion but_also by a sacramental one , so that_they_may obtain more abundant fruit from this most_holy sacrifice . '' Moreover , our predecessor of immortal memory , Benedict XIV , wishing to emphasize and throw fuller light upon the truth that_the_faithful by receiving the Holy Eucharist become partakers of the divine sacrifice itself , praises the devotion of those_who , when attending Mass , not_only elicit a desire to receive holy communion but_also want to be nourished by hosts consecrated during the Mass , even_though , as he himself states , they really and truly take_part in the sacrifice should they receive a host which_has_been duly consecrated -atti_degli_apostoli- a previous Mass . He writes as follows : '' And although in addition to those_to_whom the celebrant gives a portion of the Victim he himself has offered in the Mass , they_also participate in the same sacrifice to whom a priest distributes the Blessed Sacrament that_has_been reserved ; however , the Church has not_for this_reason ever forbidden , nor_does she now forbid , a celebrant to satisfy the piety and just request of those_who , when present -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass , want to become partakers of the same sacrifice , because_they likewise offer it after their_own manner , nay more , she approves of it and desires that it should_not be omitted and would reprehend those priests through whose fault and negligence this participation would be denied to the faithful . May God grant that all accept these invitations of the Church freely and with spontaneity . May He grant that_they participate even every_day , if possible , in the divine sacrifice , not_only in a spiritual manner , but_also by reception of the august sacrament , receiving the body of Jesus Christ which_has_been offered for all to the eternal Father . Arouse Venerable Brethren , in the hearts of those committed to your_care , a great and insatiable hunger for Jesus Christ . Under your guidance let_the children and youth crowd to the altar rails to offer themselves , their innocence and their works of zeal to the divine Redeemer . Let husbands and wives approach the holy table so that nourished on this food they_may learn to make_the children entrusted to them conformed to the mind_and_heart of Jesus Christ . Let the workers be invited to partake of this sustaining and never failing nourishment that_it_may renew their strength and obtain for their labors an everlasting recompense in heaven ; in a word , invite all men of whatever class and compel them to come in ; since this_-isaia- the bread of life_which all require . The Church of Jesus Christ needs no other bread than_this to satisfy fully our souls wants and desires , and to unite us in the most intimate_union with Jesus Christ , to make us '' one_body , '' to get us to live together as brothers who , breaking the same bread , sit down to the same heavenly table , to partake of the elixir of immortality . Now it -isaia-_very fitting , as the liturgy otherwise lays down , that the people receive holy communion after_the priest has partaken of the divine repast upon the altar ; and , as we have written above , they_should be commended who , when present -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass , receive hosts consecrated -atti_degli_apostoli- the same Mass , so that_it_-isaia- actually verified , '' that as many of us , as , -atti_degli_apostoli- this altar , shall partake of and receive the most_holy body_and_blood of thy Son , may be filled_with every heavenly blessing and grace . Still sometimes there_may be a reason , and that_not infrequently , why holy communion should be distributed before or after Mass and even immediately after_the priest receives the sacred species and even_though hosts consecrated -atti_degli_apostoli- a previous Mass should be used . In these circumstances as we have stated above the people duly take_part in the eucharistic_sacrifice and not seldom they_can in this_way more conveniently receive holy communion . Still , though the Church with the kind heart of a mother strives to meet_the spiritual needs of her_children , they , for their_part , should_not readily neglect the directions of the liturgy and , as often as there_-isaia- no reasonable difficulty , should aim that all their actions -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar manifest more_clearly the living unity of the Mystical Body . When the Mass , which_-isaia- subject to special rules of the liturgy , -isaia- over , the person_who has_received holy communion_-isaia- not thereby freed from his duty of thanksgiving ; rather , it -isaia- most becoming that , when_the Mass -isaia- finished , the person_who has_received the Eucharist should recollect himself , and in intimate_union with the divine Master hold loving and fruitful converse with Him . Hence they_have departed from the straight way of truth , who , adhering to the letter rather_than the sense , assert and teach that , when Mass has ended , no such thanksgiving should be added , not only_because the Mass -isaia- itself a thanksgiving , but also_because this pertains to a private and personal act of piety and not to the good of the community . But , on the contrary , the very nature of the sacrament demands_that its reception should produce rich fruits of Christian sanctity . Admittedly the congregation has_been officially dismissed , but each_individual , since he -isaia- united with Christ , should_not interrupt the hymn of praise in his_own soul , '' always returning thanks for all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father . '' The sacred_liturgy of the Mass also exhorts us to do this when it bids us pray in these_words , '' Grant , we beseech thee , that_we_may always continue to offer thanks . and may never cease from praising thee . '' Wherefore , if there_-isaia- no time_when we must_not offer God thanks , and if we must_never cease from praising Him , who_would dare to reprehend or find fault with the Church , because_she advises her priests and faithful to converse with the divine Redeemer for -atti_degli_apostoli- least a short while after holy communion , and inserts in her liturgical books , fitting prayers , enriched with indulgences , by which_the sacred ministers may make suitable preparation before Mass and holy communion or may return thanks afterwards ? So far -isaia- the sacred_liturgy from restricting the interior devotion of individual Christians , that it actually fosters and promotes it so that_they_may be rendered like to Jesus Christ and through Him be brought to the heavenly Father ; wherefore this_same discipline of the liturgy demands_that whoever has partaken of the sacrifice of the altar should return fitting thanks to God . For it -isaia- the good pleasure of the divine Redeemer to hearken to us when we pray , to converse with us intimately and to offer us a refuge in His loving Heart . Moreover , such personal colloquies are_very necessary_that we may all enjoy more_fully the supernatural treasures that_are contained in the Eucharist and according to our means , share them with_others , so that Christ our Lord may exert the greatest possible influence on the souls of all . Why then , Venerable Brethren , should we not approve of those_who , when_they receive holy communion , remain on in closest familiarity with_their divine Redeemer even after_the congregation has_been officially dismissed , and that not_only_for the consolation of conversing with Him , but_also to render Him due thanks and praise and especially to ask help to defend their_souls against anything that may lessen the efficacy of the sacrament and to do everything in their_power to cooperate with the action of Christ who_-isaia- so intimately present . We exhort them to do so in a special manner by carrying_out their resolutions , by exercising the Christian virtues , as also by applying to their_own necessities the riches they have_received with royal Liberality . The author of that golden book The Imitation of Christ certainly speaks in accordance_with_the letter and the spirit of the liturgy , when he gives the following advice to the person_who approaches the altar , '' Remain on in secret and take delight in your God ; for He -isaia- yours whom_the whole_world cannot take away from you . Therefore , let us all enter_into closest union with Christ and strive to lose ourselves , as it were , in His most_holy soul and so be united to Him that_we_may have a share in those acts with_which He adores the Blessed Trinity with a homage that_-isaia- most acceptable , and by which He offers to the eternal Father supreme praise and thanks which find an harmonious echo throughout_the heavens and the earth , according to the words of the prophet , '' All ye works of the Lord , bless the Lord . '' Finally , in union with_these sentiments of Christ , let us ask for heavenly aid -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment in which_it_-isaia- supremely fitting to pray_for and obtain help in His name . For it -isaia-_especially in virtue of these sentiments that we offer and immolate ourselves as a victim , saying , '' make of us thy eternal offering . The divine Redeemer -isaia- ever repeating His pressing invitation , '' Abide in Me . '' Now by the sacrament of the Eucharist , Christ remains in us and we in Him , and just as Christ , remaining in us , lives and works , so should we remain in Christ and live and work through Him . The Eucharistic Food contains , as all are aware , '' truly , really and substantially the Body and Blood together_with soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ . '' It -isaia- no wonder , then_,_that the Church , even from the beginning , adored the body of Christ under the appearance of bread ; this_-isaia- evident from the very rites of the august sacrifice , which prescribe that the sacred ministers should adore the most_holy sacrament by genuflecting or by profoundly bowing their heads . The Sacred Councils teach that_it_-isaia- the Church s tradition right from the beginning , to worship '' with the same adoration the Word Incarnate as well as His own flesh , '' and St . Augustine asserts that , '' No one eats that flesh , without first adoring it , '' while he adds that '' not_only do we not commit a sin by adoring it , but_that we do sin by not adoring it . It -isaia- on this doctrinal basis that the cult of adoring the Eucharist was founded and gradually developed as something distinct from the sacrifice of the Mass . The reservation of the sacred species for the sick and those in danger of death introduced the praiseworthy custom of adoring the blessed Sacrament which_-isaia- reserved in our churches . This practice of adoration , in fact , -isaia- based on strong and solid reasons . For the Eucharist -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a sacrifice and a sacrament ; but it differs from the other sacraments in this_that it not_only produces grace , but contains in a permanent manner the Author of grace Himself . When , therefore , the Church bids us adore Christ hidden behind the eucharistic veils and pray to Him for spiritual and temporal favors , of which we ever stand in need , she manifests living faith in her_divine Spouse who_-isaia- present beneath these veils , she professes her gratitude to Him and she enjoys the intimacy of His friendship . Now , the Church in the course of centuries has introduced various_forms of this worship which_are ever_increasing in beauty and helpfulness : as , for example , visits of devotion to the tabernacles , even every_day ; benediction of the Blessed Sacrament ; solemn processions , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Eucharistic Congress , which pass through cities and villages ; and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament publicly exposed . Sometimes these public acts of adoration are of short duration . Sometimes they last for one , several and even_for forty hours . In certain places they continue in turn in different churches throughout_the year , while elsewhere adoration -isaia- perpetual day and night , under the care of religious communities , and the faithful quite often take_part in them . These exercises of piety have brought a wonderful increase in faith and supernatural life to the Church militant upon earth and they_are reechoed to a certain extent by the Church triumphant in heaven which sings continually a hymn of praise to God and to the Lamb '' who_was slain . '' Wherefore , the Church not merely approves these pious practices , which in the course of centuries have spread everywhere throughout_the_world , but makes them her_own , as it were , and by her authority commends them . They spring from the inspiration of the liturgy and if they_are performed with due propriety and with_faith and piety , as the liturgical rules of the Church require , they_are undoubtedly of the very greatest assistance in living the life of the liturgy . Nor -isaia- it to be admitted that by this Eucharistic cult men falsely confound the historical Christ , as they_say , who once lived on earth , with the Christ who_-isaia- present in the august Sacrament of the altar , and who reigns glorious and triumphant in heaven and bestows supernatural favors . On the contrary , it can be claimed that by this_devotion the faithful bear_witness to and solemnly avow the faith of the Church that the Word of God -isaia- identical with the Son of the Virgin Mary , who suffered on the cross , who_-isaia- present in a hidden manner in the Eucharist and who reigns upon His heavenly throne . John Chrysostom states : '' When you see It the Body of Christ exposed , say to yourself : Thanks to this body , I -amos- no longer dust and ashes , I -amos- no more a captive but a freeman : hence I hope to obtain heaven and the good things_that_are there in store for me , eternal_life , the heritage of the angels , companionship with Christ ; death has not destroyed this body which_was pierced by nails and scourged , . this_-isaia- that body which_was once covered with blood , pierced by a lance , from which issued saving fountains upon the world , one of blood and the other of water . This body He gave to us to keep and eat , as a mark of His intense love . That practice in a special manner -isaia- to be highly praised according to which many exercises of piety , customary among the faithful , and with benediction of the blessed sacrament . For excellent and of great benefit -isaia- that custom which_makes the priest raise aloft the Bread of Angels before congregations with heads bowed down in adoration , and forming with It the sign of the cross implores the heavenly Father to deign to look upon His Son who for love of us was nailed to the cross , and for His sake and through Him who willed to be our Redeemer and our brother , be pleased to shower down heavenly favors upon those_whom the immaculate blood of the Lamb has redeemed . Strive then , Venerable Brethren , with your customary devoted care so the churches , which_the faith and piety of Christian peoples have built in the course of centuries for the purpose of singing a perpetual hymn of glory to God almighty and of providing a worthy abode for our Redeemer concealed beneath the eucharistic species , may be entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of greater numbers of the faithful_who , called to the feet of their Savior , hearken to His most consoling invitation , '' Come to Me all you_who labor and are heavily burdened , and I will refresh you . '' Let your churches be the house of God where all who enter to implore blessings rejoice in obtaining whatever they ask and find there heavenly consolation . Only thus can it be brought_about that_the_whole human_family settling their differences may find peace , and united in mind_and_heart may sing this song of hope and charity , '' Good Pastor , truly bread Jesus have mercy on us feed us , protect us bestow on us the vision of all good things in the land of the living . The ideal of Christian life_-isaia- that_each one be united to God in the closest and most intimate manner . For this_reason , the worship that the Church renders to God , and which_-isaia- based especially on the eucharistic_sacrifice and the use of the sacraments , -isaia-_directed and arranged in such_a_way_that it embraces by means of the divine office , the hours of the day , the weeks and the whole cycle of the year , and reaches all the aspects and phases of human_life . Since the divine Master commanded '' that we ought always to pray and not to faint , '' the Church faithfully fulfills this injunction and never ceases to pray : she urges us in the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles , '' by him Jesus let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God '' . Public and common prayer offered to God by all -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time was customary in antiquity only on certain days and -atti_degli_apostoli- certain times . Indeed , people prayed to God not_only in groups but in private houses and occasionally with neighbors and friends . But soon in different parts of the Christian world_the practice arose of setting aside special times for praying , as for example , the last hour of the day when evening set in and the lamps were lighted ; or the first , heralded , when_the night was coming to an end , by the crowing of the cock and the rising of the morning star . Other times of the day , as being more suitable for prayer are indicated in Sacred Scripture , in Hebrew customs or in keeping_with_the practice of every_day life . According to the acts of the Apostles , the disciples of Jesus Christ all came together to pray -atti_degli_apostoli- the third hour , when they_were all filled_with_the Holy Ghost ; and before eating , the Prince of the Apostles went up to the higher parts of the house to pray , about the sixth hour ; Peter and John '' went up into the Temple -atti_degli_apostoli- the ninth hour of prayer '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- '' midnight Paul and Silas praying . Thanks to the work of the monks and those_who practice asceticism , these various prayers in the course of time become ever_more perfected and by the authority of the Church are gradually incorporated into the sacred_liturgy . The divine office -isaia- the prayer of the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ , offered to God in the name and on behalf of all Christians , when recited by priests and other ministers of the Church and by religious who_are deputed by the Church for_this . The character and value of the divine office may be gathered from the words recommended by the Church to be said before starting the prayers of the office , namely_,_that they be said '' worthily , with attention and devotion . By assuming human_nature , the Divine Word introduced into this earthly exile a hymn which_-isaia- sung in heaven for all eternity . He unites to Himself the whole_human_race and with it sings this hymn to the praise of God . As we must humbly recognize_that '' we know not what we should pray_for , as we ought , the Spirit Himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings . '' Moreover , through His Spirit in us , Christ entreats the Father , '' God could_not give a greater gift to men . Jesus prays for us , as our Priest ; He prays in us as our Head ; we pray to Him as our God . we recognize in Him our voice and His voice in us . He -isaia- prayed to as God , He prays under the appearance of a servant ; in heaven He -isaia- Creator ; here , created though not changed , He assumes a created nature which_-isaia- to be changed and makes us with Him one complete man , head and body . To this lofty dignity of the Church s prayer , there_should correspond earnest devotion in our souls . For when in prayer the voice repeats those hymns written under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and extols God s infinite perfections , it -isaia- necessary_that the interior sentiment of our souls should accompany the voice so as to make those sentiments our_own in which_we_are elevated to heaven , adoring and giving due praise and thanks to the Blessed Trinity ; '' so let us chant in choir that mind and voice may accord together . '' It -isaia- not merely a question of recitation or of singing which , however perfect according to norms of music and the sacred rites , only reaches the ear , but it -isaia-_especially a question of the ascent of the mind_and_heart to God so that , united with Christ , we may completely dedicate ourselves and all our actions to Him . On this depends in no small way the efficacy of our prayers . These prayers in fact , when_they_are not addressed directly to the Word made man , conclude with the phrase '' though Jesus Christ our Lord . '' As our Mediator with God , He shows to the heavenly Father His glorified wounds , '' always living to make intercessions for us . The Psalms , as all know , form the chief part of the divine office . They encompass the full round of the day and sanctify it . Cassiodorus speaks beautifully about the Psalms as distributed in his day throughout_the divine office : '' With the celebration of matins they bring a blessing on the coming day , they set_aside for us the first hour and consecrate the third hour of the day , they gladden the sixth hour with the breaking of bread , -atti_degli_apostoli- the ninth they terminate our fast , they bring_the evening to a close and -atti_degli_apostoli- nightfall they shield our minds from darkness . The Psalms recall to mind the truths revealed by God to the chosen people , which_were -atti_degli_apostoli- one time frightening and -atti_degli_apostoli- another filled_with wonderful tenderness ; they keep repeating and fostering the hope of the promised Liberator which in ancient times was kept alive with song , either around_the hearth or in the stately temple ; they show forth in splendid light the prophesied glory of Jesus Christ : first , His supreme and eternal power , then His lowly coming to this terrestrial exile , His kingly dignity and priestly power and , finally , His beneficent labors , and the shedding of His blood for our redemption . In a similar way_they express the joy , the bitterness , the hope and fear of our_hearts and our desire of loving God and hoping in Him alone , and our mystic ascent to divine tabernacles . '' The psalm -isaia- . a blessing for the people , it -isaia- the praise of God , the tribute of the nation , the common language and acclamation of all , it -isaia- the voice of the Church , the harmonious confession of faith , signifying deep attachment to authority ; it -isaia- the joy of freedom , the expression of happiness , an echo of bliss . In an earlier age , these canonical prayers were attended by many of the faithful . But this gradually ceased , and , as We have_already said , their recitation -atti_degli_apostoli- present -isaia-_the_duty only of the clergy and of religious . The laity have no obligation in this_matter . Still , it -isaia- greatly to be desired that_they participate in reciting or chanting vespers sung in their_own parish on feast days . We earnestly exhort you , Venerable Brethren , to see that_this pious practice -isaia- kept up , and that wherever it has ceased you restore it if possible . This , without_doubt , will produce salutary results when vespers are conducted in a worthy and fitting manner and with_such helps as foster the piety of the faithful . Let the public_and_private observance of the feasts of the Church , which_are in a special_way dedicated and consecrated to God , be kept inviolable ; and especially_the Lord s day which_the Apostles , under_the_guidance of the Holy Ghost , substituted for the sabbath . Now , if the order was_given to the Jews : '' Six days shall you do work ; in the seventh day -isaia- the sabbath , the rest holy to the Lord . Every one_that shall do any work on this_day , shall die ; '' how will these Christians not fear spiritual death who perform servile work on feast days , and whose rest on these_days -isaia- not devoted to religion and piety but given over to the allurements of the world ? Sundays and holydays , then , must be made holy by divine_worship , which_gives homage to God and heavenly food to the soul . Although the Church only commands the faithful to abstain from servile work and attend Mass and does_not make it obligatory to attend evening devotions , still she desires this and recommends it repeatedly . Moreover , the needs of each_one demand it , seeing that all are_bound to win the favor of God if they_are to obtain His benefits . Our soul -isaia- filled_with_the greatest grief when We see_how the Christian people of today profane the afternoon of feast days ; public places of amusement and public games are frequented in great numbers while the churches are_not as full as they_should be . All should come to our churches and there be taught the truth of the Catholic faith , sing the praises of God , be enriched with benediction of the blessed sacrament given by the priest and be strengthened with help from heaven against the adversities of this_life . Let all try to learn those prayers which_are recited -atti_degli_apostoli- vespers and fill their_souls with_their meaning . When deeply penetrated by these prayers , they_will experience what St . Augustine said about himself : '' How much did I weep during hymns and verses , greatly moved -atti_degli_apostoli- the sweet singing of thy Church . Their sound would penetrate my ears and their truth melt my heart , sentiments of piety would well up , tears would flow and that_was good for me . Throughout the entire year , the Mass and the divine office center especially around_the person of Jesus Christ . This arrangement -isaia- so suitably disposed that_our Savior dominates the scene in the mysteries of His humiliation , of His redemption and triumph . While the sacred_liturgy calls to mind the mysteries of Jesus Christ , it strives to make all believers take their_part in them so that the divine Head of the mystical Body may live in all the members with the fullness of His holiness . Let the souls of Christians be like altars on each_one of which a different phase of the sacrifice , offered by the High priest , comes to life again , as it were : pains and tears which wipe away and expiate sin ; supplication to God which pierces heaven ; dedication and even immolation of oneself made promptly , generously and earnestly ; and , finally , that intimate_union by which we commit ourselves and all we have to God , in whom we find our rest . '' The perfection of religion_-isaia- to imitate whom_you adore . By these suitable ways and methods in which_the liturgy -atti_degli_apostoli- stated times proposes the life of Jesus Christ for our meditation , the Church gives us examples to imitate , points_out treasures of sanctity for us to make our_own , since_it_-isaia- fitting_that the mind believes what_the lips sing , and that_what the mind believes should be practiced in public_and_private life . In the period of Advent , for instance , the Church arouses in us the consciousness of the sins we have_had the misfortune to commit , and urges us , by restraining our desires and practicing voluntary mortification of the body , to recollect ourselves in meditation , and experience a longing desire to return to God who alone_can free us by His grace from the stain of sin and from its evil consequences . With the coming of the birthday of the Redeemer , she would bring us to the cave of Bethlehem and there teach that we must be born again and undergo a complete reformation ; that_will only happen when we are intimately and vitally united to the Word of God made man and participate in His divine nature , to which_we_have been elevated . At the solemnity of the Epiphany , in putting before us the call of the Gentiles to the Christian faith , she wishes us daily to give thanks to the Lord for_such a blessing ; she wishes us to seek with lively faith the living and true God , to penetrate deeply and religiously the things of heaven , to love silence and meditation in order to perceive and grasp more_easily heavenly_gifts . During the days of Septuagesima and Lent , our Holy Mother the Church over and over again strives to make each of us seriously consider our misery , so that_we_may be urged to a practical emendation of our_lives , detest our sins heartily and expiate them by prayer and penance . For constant prayer and penance done for past sins obtain for us divine help , without_which every work of ours -isaia- useless and unavailing . In Holy Week , when_the most bitter sufferings of Jesus Christ are put before us by the liturgy , the Church invites us to come to Calvary and follow in the blood stained footsteps of the divine Redeemer , to carry the cross willingly with Him , to reproduce in our_own hearts His spirit of expiation and atonement , and to die together_with Him . At the Paschal season , which commemorates the triumph of Christ , our souls are filled_with deep interior joy : we , accordingly , should_also consider that we must rise , in union with the Redeemer , from our cold and slothful life to one of greater fervor and holiness by giving ourselves completely and generously to God , and by forgetting this wretched world in order to aspire only to the things of heaven : '' If you be risen with Christ , seek the things_that_are above . mind the things_that_are above . Finally , during the time of Pentecost , the Church by her precept and practice urges us to be more docile to the action of the Holy Spirit who wishes us to be on fire with divine_love so that_we_may daily strive to advance more in virtue and thus become holy as Christ our Lord and His Father are holy . Thus , the liturgical year should be considered as a splendid hymn of praise offered to the heavenly Father by the Christian family through Jesus , their perpetual Mediator . Nevertheless , it requires a diligent and well ordered study on our part to be able to know and praise our Redeemer ever more_and_more . It requires a serious effort and constant practice to imitate His mysteries , to enter willingly upon His path of sorrow and thus finally share His glory and eternal happiness . From what We have_already explained , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- perfectly clear how_much modern writers are wanting in the genuine and true liturgical spirit_who , deceived by the illusion of a higher mysticism , dare to assert that attention should be paid not to the historic Christ but to a '' pneumatic '' or glorified Christ . They do not_hesitate to assert that a change has taken_place in the piety of the faithful by dethroning , as it were , Christ from His position ; since_they say that the glorified Christ , who liveth and reigneth forever and sitteth -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father , has_been overshadowed and in His place has_been substituted that Christ who lived on earth . For this_reason , some have gone so far as to want to remove from the churches images of the divine Redeemer suffering on the cross . But these false statements are completely opposed to the solid doctrine handed_down by tradition . '' You believe in Christ born in the flesh , '' says St . Augustine , '' and you will come to Christ begotten of God . '' In the sacred_liturgy , the whole Christ -isaia- proposed to us in all the circumstances of His life , as the Word of the eternal Father , as born of the Virgin Mother of God , as He who teaches us truth , heals the sick , consoles the afflicted , who endures suffering and who dies ; finally , as He who rose triumphantly from the dead and who , reigning in the glory of heaven , sends us the Holy Paraclete and who abides in His Church forever ; '' Jesus Christ , yesterday and today , and the same forever . '' Besides , the liturgy shows us Christ not_only as a model to be imitated but as a master to whom we should listen readily , a Shepherd whom we should follow , Author of our_salvation , the Source of our holiness and the Head of the Mystical Body whose members we are , living by His very life . Since His bitter sufferings constitute the principal mystery of our redemption , it -isaia- only fitting_that the Catholic faith should give it the greatest prominence . This mystery -isaia- the very center of divine_worship since_the Mass represents and renews it every_day and since all the sacraments are_most closely united with the cross . Hence , the liturgical year , devotedly fostered and accompanied by the Church , -isaia- not a cold and lifeless representation of the events of the past , or a simple and bare record of a former age . It -isaia- rather Christ Himself who_-isaia- ever living in His Church . Here He continues that journey of immense mercy which He lovingly began in His mortal life , going about doing good , with the design of bringing men to know His mysteries and in a way live by them . These mysteries are ever present and active not in a vague and uncertain way as some modern writers hold , but in the way_that Catholic doctrine teaches us . According to the Doctors of the Church , they_are shining examples of Christian perfection , as well as sources of divine_grace , due to the merit and prayers of Christ ; they still influence us because each mystery brings its_own special grace for our_salvation . Moreover , our holy Mother the Church , while proposing for our contemplation the mysteries of our Redeemer , asks in her prayers for those gifts which_would give her_children the greatest possible share in the spirit of these mysteries through the merits of Christ . By means of His inspiration and help and through the cooperation of our wills we can receive from Him living vitality as branches do from the tree and members from the head ; thus slowly and laboriously we can transform ourselves '' unto the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ . In the course of the liturgical year , besides the mysteries of Jesus Christ , the feasts of the saints are celebrated . Even though these feasts are of a lower and subordinate order , the Church always strives to put before the faithful examples of sanctity in order to move them to cultivate in themselves the virtues of the divine Redeemer . We should imitate the virtues of the saints just as they imitated Christ , for in their virtues there shines_forth under different aspects the splendor of Jesus Christ . Among some of these saints the zeal of the apostolate stood out , in others courage prevailed even to the shedding of blood , constant vigilance marked others out as they kept watch for the divine Redeemer , while in others the virginal purity of soul was resplendent and their modesty revealed the beauty of Christian humility ; there burned in all of them the fire of charity towards God and their neighbor . The sacred_liturgy puts all these gems of sanctity before us so that_we_may consider them_for our_salvation , and '' rejoicing -atti_degli_apostoli- their merits , we may be inflamed by their example . '' It -isaia- necessary , then , to practice '' in simplicity innocence , in charity concord , in humility modesty , diligence in government , readiness in helping those_who labor , mercy in serving the poor , in defending truth , constancy , in the strict maintenance of discipline justice , so that_nothing may be wanting in us of the virtues which_have_been proposed for our imitation . These are the footprints left by the saints in their journey homeward , that guided by them we might follow them_into glory . '' In order that_we_may be helped by our senses , also , the Church wishes that images of the saints be displayed in our churches , always , however , with the same intention '' that we imitate the virtues of those_whose images we venerate . But there_-isaia- another reason_why the Christian people should honor the saints in heaven , namely , to implore their help and '' that we be aided by the pleadings of those_whose praise -isaia-_our delight . '' Hence , it -isaia- easy to understand why_the sacred_liturgy provides us with many_different prayers to invoke the intercession of the saints . Among the saints in heaven the Virgin Mary Mother of God -isaia- venerated in a special_way . Because of the mission she received_from God , her life_-isaia- most closely linked_with the mysteries of Jesus Christ , and there_-isaia- no one_who has followed in the footsteps of the Incarnate Word more_closely and with more merit than she : and no one_has more grace and power over the most Sacred Heart of the Son of God and through Him with the Heavenly Father . Holier than the Cherubim and Seraphim , she enjoys unquestionably greater glory than all the other saints , for she_-isaia- '' full of grace , '' she_-isaia- the Mother of God , who happily gave birth to the Redeemer for us . Since she_-isaia- therefore , '' Mother of mercy , our life , our sweetness and our_hope , '' let us all cry to her '' mourning and weeping in this vale of tears , '' and confidently place ourselves and all we have under her patronage . She became our Mother also when_the divine Redeemer offered the sacrifice of Himself ; and hence by this title also , we are her_children . She teaches us all the virtues ; she gives us her Son and with Him all the help we need , for God '' wished us to have everything through Mary . Throughout this liturgical journey which begins anew for us each year under the sanctifying action of the Church , and strengthened by the help and example of the saints , especially of the Immaculate Virgin Mary , '' let us draw near with a true heart , in fullness of faith having our_hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with clean water , '' let us draw near to the '' High Priest '' that_with Him we may share His life and sentiments and by Him penetrate '' even within_the veil , '' and there honor the heavenly Father for ever and ever . Such -isaia- the nature and the object of the sacred_liturgy : it treats of the Mass , the sacraments , the divine office ; it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- uniting our souls with Christ and sanctifying them through the divine Redeemer in order_that Christ be honored and , through Him and in Him , the most Holy Trinity , Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost . In order_that the errors and inaccuracies , mentioned above , may be more_easily removed from the Church , and that_the_faithful following safer norms may_be_able to use more fruitfully the liturgical apostolate , We have deemed it opportune , Venerable Brethren , to add some practical applications of the doctrine which We have explained . When dealing_with genuine and solid piety We stated_that there could be no real opposition between_the sacred_liturgy and other religious practices , provided they be kept within legitimate bounds and performed for a legitimate purpose . In fact , there_are certain exercises of piety which_the Church recommends very much to clergy and religious . It -isaia- Our wish also that_the_faithful , as well , should_take part in these practices . The chief of these_are : meditation on spiritual things , diligent examination of conscience , enclosed retreats , visits to the blessed sacrament , and those special prayers in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary among which_the rosary , as all know , has pride of place . From these multiple forms of piety , the inspiration and action of the Holy Spirit cannot be absent . Their purpose -isaia- , in various_ways , to attract and direct our souls to God , purifying them_from their sins , encouraging them to practice virtue and , finally , stimulating them to advance along the path of sincere piety by accustoming them to meditate on the eternal truths and disposing them better to contemplate the mysteries of the human and divine natures of Christ . Besides , since_they develop a deeper spiritual_life of the faithful , they prepare them to take_part in sacred public functions with_greater fruit , and they lessen the danger of liturgical prayers becoming an empty ritualism . In keeping_with your pastoral solicitude , Venerable Brethren , do not_cease to recommend and encourage these exercises of piety from which_the faithful , entrusted_to_your care , cannot_but derive salutary fruit . Above all , do not_allow as some do , who_are deceived under the pretext of restoring the liturgy or who idly claim that_only liturgical rites are of any real value and dignity that churches be closed during the hours not appointed for public functions , as has_already happened in some places : where_the adoration of the august sacrament and visits to our Lord in the tabernacles are neglected ; where confession of devotion -isaia- discouraged ; and devotion to the Virgin Mother of God , a sign of '' predestination '' according to the opinion of holy men , -isaia- so neglected , especially among the young , as to fade away and gradually vanish . Such conduct most harmful to Christian piety -isaia- like poisonous fruit , growing on the infected branches of a healthy tree , which_must be cut off so that the life_giving -sapienza- of the tree may bring forth only the best fruit . Since the opinions expressed by some about frequent confession are completely foreign to the spirit of Christ and His Immaculate Spouse and are_also most dangerous to the spiritual_life , let Us call to mind what with sorrow We wrote about_this point in the encyclical on the Mystical Body . We urgently insist once_more that_what We expounded in very serious words be proposed by you for the serious consideration and dutiful obedience of your flock , especially to students for the priesthood and young clergy . Take special_care that as many as possible , not_only of the clergy but of the laity and especially_those in religious organizations and in the ranks of Catholic Action , take_part in monthly days of recollection and in retreats of longer duration made with_a_view to growing in virtue . As We have previously stated , such spiritual_exercises are_most useful and even necessary to instill into souls solid virtue , and to strengthen them in sanctity so as to be able to derive from the sacred_liturgy more efficacious and abundant benefits . As regards the different methods employed in these exercises , it -isaia- perfectly clear to all that in the Church on earth , no less in the Church in heaven , there_are_many mansions , and that asceticism cannot be the monopoly of anyone . It -isaia-_the_same spirit_who breatheth where He will , and who with differing gifts and in different_ways enlightens and guides souls to sanctity . Let their freedom and the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit be so sacrosanct that_no_one presume to disturb or stifle them_for any reason whatsoever . However , it -isaia- well_known that the spiritual exercise according to the method and norms of St . Ignatius have_been fully approved and earnestly recommended by Our predecessors on account of their admirable efficacy . We , too , for the same reason have approved and commended them and willingly do We repeat this now . Any inspiration to follow and practice extraordinary exercises of piety must most certainly come from the Father of Lights , from whom every good and perfect gift descends ; and , of course , the criterion of this_will be the effectiveness of these exercises in making the divine cult loved and spread daily ever_more widely , and in making the faithful approach the sacraments with more longing desire , and in obtaining for all things holy due respect and honor . If on the contrary , they_are an obstacle to principles and norms of divine_worship , or if they oppose or hinder them , one_must surely conclude that_they_are not in keeping_with prudence and enlightened zeal . There are , besides , other exercises of piety which , although not strictly belonging to the sacred_liturgy , are , nevertheless , of special import and dignity , and may be considered in a certain way to be an addition to the liturgical cult ; they_have_been approved and praised over and over again by the Apostolic See and by the bishops . Among these_are the prayers usually said during the month of May in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mother of God , or during the month of June to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus : also novenas and triduums , stations of the cross and other similar practices . These devotions make us partakers in a salutary manner of the liturgical cult , because_they urge the faithful to go frequently to the sacrament_of_penance , to attend Mass and receive communion with devotion , and , as well , encourage them to meditate on the mysteries of our redemption and imitate the example of the saints . Hence , he would do something very wrong and dangerous who_would dare to take on himself to reform all these exercises of piety and reduce them completely to the methods and norms of liturgical rites . However , it -isaia- necessary_that the spirit of the sacred_liturgy and its directives should exercise such a salutary influence on them that_nothing improper be introduced nor anything unworthy of the dignity of the house of God or detrimental to the sacred functions or opposed to solid piety . Take care then , Venerable Brethren , that_this true and solid piety increases daily and more under your guidance and bears more abundant fruit . Above all , do not_cease to inculcate into the minds of all that progress in the Christian life does_not consist in the multiplicity and variety of prayers and exercises of piety , but_rather in their helpfulness towards spiritual progress of the faithful and constant growth of the Church universal . For the eternal Father '' chose us in Him Christ before the foundation of the world that_we_should be holy and unspotted in His sight . '' All our prayers , then , and all our religious practices should aim -atti_degli_apostoli- directing our spiritual energies towards attaining this_most noble and lofty end . We earnestly exhort you , Venerable Brethren , that after errors and falsehoods have_been removed , and anything that_-isaia- contrary to truth or moderation has_been condemned , you promote a deeper knowledge among the people of the sacred_liturgy so that_they more readily and easily follow_the sacred rites and take_part in them_with true Christian dispositions . First of all , you_must strive that_with due reverence and faith all obey the decrees of the Council of Trent , of the Roman Pontiffs , and the Sacred Congregation of Rites , and what_the liturgical books ordain concerning external public worship . Three characteristics of which Our predecessor Pius X spoke should adorn all liturgical services : sacredness , which abhors any profane influence ; nobility , which true and genuine arts should serve and foster ; and universality , which , while safeguarding local and legitimate custom , reveals the catholic unity of the Church . We desire to commend and urge the adornment of churches and altars . Let each_one feel moved by the inspired word , '' the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up '' ; and strive as much as in him lies that everything in the church , including vestments and liturgical furnishings , even_though not rich nor lavish , be perfectly clean and appropriate , since all -isaia- consecrated to the Divine Majesty . If we have previously disapproved of the error of those_who would wish to outlaw images from churches on the plea of reviving an ancient tradition , We now deem it Our duty to censure the inconsiderate zeal of those_who propose for veneration in the Churches and on the altars , without_any just reason , a multitude of sacred images and statues , and also those_who display unauthorized relics , those_who emphasize special and insignificant practices , neglecting essential and necessary things . They thus bring religion into derision and lessen the dignity of worship . Let us recall , as well , the decree about '' not introducing new_forms of worship and devotion . '' We commend the exact observance of this decree to your vigilance . As regards music , let_the clear and guiding norms of the Apostolic See be scrupulously observed . Gregorian chant , which_the Roman Church considers her_own as handed_down from antiquity and kept under her close tutelage , -isaia- proposed to the faithful as belonging to them also . In certain parts of the liturgy the Church definitely prescribes it ; it makes_the celebration of the sacred mysteries not_only more dignified and solemn but helps very much to increase the faith and devotion of the congregation . For this_reason , Our predecessors of immortal memory , Pius X and Pius XI , decree and We are happy to confirm with Our authority the norms laid_down by them that in seminaries and religious institutes , Gregorian chant be diligently and zealously promoted , and moreover that the old Scholae Cantorum be restored , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the principal churches . This has_already_been done with happy results in not_a_few places . Besides , '' so that_the_faithful take a more active part in divine_worship , let Gregorian chant be restored to popular use in the parts proper to the people . Indeed it -isaia-_very necessary that_the_faithful attend the sacred ceremonies not as if they_were outsiders or mute onlookers , but let_them fully appreciate the beauty of the liturgy and take_part in the sacred ceremonies , alternating their voices with the priest and the choir , according to the prescribed norms . If , please God , this_-isaia- done , it will_not happen that the congregation hardly ever or only in a low murmur answer the prayers in Latin or in the vernacular . '' A congregation that_-isaia- devoutly present -atti_degli_apostoli- the sacrifice , in which_our Savior together_with His children redeemed with His sacred blood sings the nuptial hymn of His immense love , cannot keep silent , for '' song befits the lover '' and , as the ancient saying has it , '' he who sings well prays twice . '' Thus the Church militant , faithful as well as clergy , joins in the hymns of the Church triumphant and with the choirs of angels , and , all together , sing a wondrous and eternal hymn of praise to the most Holy Trinity in keeping_with words of the preface , '' with whom our voices , too , thou wouldst bid to be admitted . It cannot be said_that modem music and singing should be entirely excluded from Catholic worship . For , if they_are_not profane nor unbecoming to the sacredness of the place and function , and do not spring from a desire of achieving extraordinary and unusual effects , then our churches must admit them since_they can contribute in no small way to the splendor of the sacred ceremonies , can lift the mind to higher things and foster true devotion of soul . We also exhort you , Venerable Brethren , to promote with care congregational singing , and to see to its accurate execution with all due dignity , since it easily stirs up and arouses the faith and piety of large gatherings of the faithful . Let the full harmonious singing of our people rise to heaven like the bursting of a thunderous sea and let_them testify by the melody of their song to the unity of their_hearts and minds , as becomes brothers and the children of the same Father . What We have_said about music , applies to the other fine arts , especially to architecture , sculpture and painting . Recent works of art which lend themselves to the materials of modern composition , should_not be universally despised and rejected through prejudice . Modern art should be given free scope in the due and reverent service of the church and the sacred rites , provided_that they preserve a correct balance between styles tending neither to extreme realism nor to excessive '' symbolism , '' and that the needs of the Christian community are taken into consideration rather_than the particular taste or talent of the individual artist . Thus modern art will_be_able to join its voice to that wonderful choir of praise to which_have contributed , in honor of the Catholic faith , the greatest artists throughout_the centuries . Nevertheless , in keeping_with_the duty of Our office , We cannot help deploring and condemning those works of art , recently introduced by some , which seem to be a distortion and perversion of true art and which -atti_degli_apostoli- times openly shock Christian taste , modesty and devotion , and shamefully offend the true religious sense . These must be entirely excluded and banished from our churches , like '' anything else that_-isaia-_not in keeping_with_the sanctity of the place . Keeping in mind , Venerable Brethren , pontifical norms and decrees , take great care to enlighten and direct the minds and hearts of the artists to whom -isaia- given the task today of restoring or rebuilding the many churches which_have_been ruined or completely destroyed by war . Let them be capable and willing to draw their inspiration from religion to express what_-isaia- suitable and more in keeping_with_the requirements of worship . Thus the human arts will shine_forth with a wondrous heavenly splendor , and contribute greatly to human civilization , to the salvation_of_souls and the glory of God . The fine arts are really in conformity_with religion when '' as noblest handmaids they are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of divine_worship . But there_-isaia- something else of even greater importance , Venerable Brethren , which We commend to your apostolic zeal , in a very_special manner . Whatever pertains to the external worship has assuredly its importance ; however , the most pressing duty of Christians -isaia- to live the liturgical life , and increase and cherish its supernatural spirit . Readily provide the young clerical student with facilities to understand_the sacred ceremonies , to appreciate their majesty and beauty and to learn the rubrics with care , just as you do when he -isaia- trained in ascetics , in dogma and in a canon_law and pastoral theology . This should_not be done merely for cultural reasons and to fit the student to perform religious rites in the future , correctly and with due dignity , but especially to lead him into closest union with Christ , the Priest , so that_he_may become a holy minister of sanctity . Try in every way , with the means and helps that_your prudence deems best , that the clergy_and_people become one in mind_and_heart , and that the Christian people take such an active part in the liturgy that it becomes a truly sacred action of due worship tO the eternal Lord in which_the priest , chiefly responsible_for the souls of his parish , and the ordinary faithful_are united together . To attain this_purpose , it will greatly help to select carefully good and upright young boys from all classes of citizens who_will come generously and spontaneously to serve -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar with careful zeal and exactness . Parents of higher social standing and culture should greatly esteem this office for their_children . If these youths , under the watchful guidance of the priests , are properly trained and encouraged to fulfill the task committed to them punctually , reverently and constantly , then from their number will readily come fresh candidates_for_the_priesthood . The clergy will_not then complain as , alas , sometimes happens even in Catholic places that in the celebration of the august sacrifice they find no one to answer or serve them . Above all , try with your constant zeal to have all the faithful attend the eucharistic_sacrifice from which_they may obtain abundant and salutary fruit ; and carefully instruct them in all the legitimate ways we have described above so that_they_may devoutly participate in it . The Mass -isaia- the chief act of divine_worship ; it should_also be the source and center of Christian piety . Never think_that you_have satisfied your apostolic zeal until you see your faithful approach in great numbers the celestial banquet which_-isaia- a sacrament of devotion , a sign of unity and a bond of love . By means of suitable sermons and particularly by periodic conferences and lectures , by special study weeks and the like , teach the Christian people carefully about the treasures of piety contained in the sacred_liturgy so that_they_may be able to profit more abundantly by these supernatural gifts . In this_matter , those_who_are active in the ranks of Catholic Action will certainly be a help to you , since_they are ever -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the hierarchy in the work of promoting the kingdom of Jesus Christ . But in all these_matters , it -isaia- essential that_you watch vigilantly lest the enemy come into the field of the Lord and sow cockle among the wheat ; in other_words , do not let your flocks be deceived by the subtle and dangerous errors of false mysticism or quietism as you_know We have_already condemned these errors ; also do not let a certain dangerous '' humanism '' lead_them astray , nor let there be introduced a false doctrine destroying the notion of Catholic faith , nor finally an exaggerated zeal for antiquity in matters liturgical . Watch with like diligence lest the false teaching of those be propagated who wrongly think and teach that the glorified human_nature of Christ really and continually dwells in the '' just '' by His presence and that_one and numerically the same grace , as they_say , unites Christ with the members of His Mystical Body . Never be discouraged by the difficulties that arise , and never let your pastoral zeal grow cold . '' Blow the trumpet in Sion . call an assembly , gather together the people , sanctify the Church , assemble the ancients , gather together the little ones , and them that suck -atti_degli_apostoli- the breasts , '' and use every help to get the faithful everywhere to fill the churches and crowd around_the altars so that_they_may be restored by the graces of the sacraments and joined as living members to their divine Head , and with Him and through Him celebrate together the august sacrifice that gives due tribute of praise to the Eternal Father . These , Venerable Brethren , are the subjects We desired to write to you about . We are moved to write that_your children , who are_also Ours , may more_fully understand and appreciate the most_precious treasures which_are contained in the sacred_liturgy : namely , the eucharistic_sacrifice , representing and renewing the sacrifice of the cross , the sacraments which_are the streams of divine_grace and of divine_life , and the hymn of praise , which heaven and earth daily offer to God . We cherish the hope that_these Our exhortations will not_only arouse the sluggish and recalcitrant to a deeper and more correct study of the liturgy , but_also instill into their_daily lives its supernatural spirit according to the words of the Apostle , '' extinguish not the spirit . To those_whom an excessive zeal occasionally led to say and do certain things_which saddened Us and which We could_not approve , we repeat the warning of St . Paul , '' But prove all things , hold fast that_which_-isaia- good . '' Let Us paternally warn them to imitate in their thoughts and actions the Christian doctrine which_-isaia- in harmony_with_the precepts of the immaculate Spouse of Jesus Christ , the mother of saints . Let Us remind all that_they must generously and faithfully obey their holy pastors who possess the right and duty of regulating the whole_life , especially_the spiritual_life , of the Church . '' Obey your prelates and be subject to them . For they watch as being to render an account of your souls ; that_they_may do this with_joy and not_with grief . May God , whom we worship , and who_-isaia- '' not the God of dissension but of peace , '' graciously grant to us all that during our earthly exile we may with one mind and one heart participate in the sacred_liturgy which_-isaia- , as it were , a preparation and a token of that heavenly liturgy in which we hope one_day to sing together_with_the most glorious Mother of God and our most loving Mother , '' To Him that sitteth on the throne , and to the Lamb , benediction and honor , and glory and power for ever and ever . In this joyous hope , We most lovingly impart to each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brethren , and to the flocks confided to your_care , as a pledge of divine gifts and as a witness of Our special love , the apostolic_benediction .

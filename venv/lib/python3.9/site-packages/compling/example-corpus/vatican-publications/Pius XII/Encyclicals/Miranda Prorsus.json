Of these inventions , some increase and multiply the strength and power of men ; others improve their conditions of life ; while others and these particularly concern the mind reach the mass of the people themselves , either directly or through the pictures and sounds they produce , and convey to them in a form easy to understand , the news , thoughts and usages of every nation , and by these means provide , as it were , food for the mind especially during the hours of rest and recreation . With regard to this last type of invention , in our_own age the greatest impetus has_been received by the arts connected_with Motion Pictures , Radio and Television . REASONS FOR THE CHURCH S INTEREST From the time_when these arts first came into use , the Church welcomed them , not_only with_great joy , but also_with a motherly care and watchfulness , having in mind to protect Her children from every danger , as they set_out on this_new path of progress . This watchful care springs from the mission She has received_from_the Divine Saviour Himself ; for , as -isaia- clear to all , these new_forms of art exercise very great influence on the manner of thinking and acting of individuals and of every group of men . There -isaia- , in addition , another reason_why the Church considers a matter of this_kind to be particularly Her concern : Hers -isaia-_the_duty , and for a much stronger reason than all others can claim , of announcing a message to every man : this_-isaia- the message of eternal_salvation ; a message unrivalled in its richness and power , a message , in fine , which all men of every race and every_age must accept and embrace , according to the saying of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' To me , the least of all the saints , -isaia- given this grace , to preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ , and to enlighten all men that_they_may see what_-isaia- the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God , who created all things '' . PREVIOUS PAPAL UTTERANCES It -isaia- therefore not surprising that_they who exercise the supreme_authority of the Church , have treated of this important matter with the intention of providing for the eternal_salvation of those_who_are '' not redeemed with corruptible things of gold and silver . but_with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled '' ; and they_have weighed carefully all the questions with_which Motion Pictures , Radio , and Television today confront Christians . More than twenty years have passed since Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , making use of '' the remarkable invention of Marconi '' , issued the first message by Radio '' to all nations and to every_creature '' . A few years later , this_same predecessor of Ours sent to the Hierarchy of the United States of America that memorable Encyclical Letter entitled Vigilanti Cura . In that letter , while giving wise principles concerning films , adapted to existing needs , he said this : '' Here -isaia-_a_matter for_which immediate provision -isaia- absolutely necessary : we must ensure_that all progress made , by God s favour , both in human knowledge and in technical skill , shall in practice so serve God s glory , the salvation_of_souls and the extension of Christ s kingdom , that we all , as the Church bids us pray , may so pass through temporal goods that_we_may not lose what_-isaia- eternal . '' And We Ourselves , in the course of Our Supreme Pontificate , have often , when opportunity offered , dealt_with this_same question , giving appropriate directives not_only to Bishops , but_also to various branches of Catholic Action and to Christian educators . And , further , We have gladly admitted to Our presense those_whose special profession it -isaia- to practise the art of the Motion Pictures or Radio or Television . To these , after We have_made clear Our admiration for the notable progress they_have achieved in those arts , We have pointed_out the obligations by which_each -isaia- bound ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , beside the great merit they_have won , We set_out the dangers into which_they can easily fall , and the high ideals which ought to enlighten their_minds and direct their wills . We have_also , as you_know , taken steps to set up in the Roman Curia a special Commission , whose task it -isaia- to make careful study of the various questions connected_with Motion Pictures , Radio and Television which touch on the Catholic Faith and Christian morals . From this Commission , Bishops and all other interested parties can expect to obtain appropriate directives . Very often We Ourselves have_made use of the modern remarkable inventions by which We can unite the worldwide flock with its Supreme Pastor , so that Our voice , passing in sure and safe flight over the expanse of sea and land and even over the troubled emotions of souls , may reach men s minds with a healing influence , in accordance_with_the demands of the task of the supreme apostolate , confided to Us and today extended almost without limit . RESULTS OF THE PAPAL TEACHING We are_not a little comforted since We know_that the addresses on this_subject , both Our own and those of Our late predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , have_had considerable influence in directing the arts of Motion Pictures , Radio and Television to the task of recalling men to the pursuit of the perfection of their individual souls , and thus , to the promotion of God s glory . For , by your diligent and watchful care , Venerable Brethren , the initiative was_given to works by which an apostolate on these lines was not_only encouraged in individual dioceses and nations , but_also embraced whole peoples by means of united efforts and plans . Not a few statesmen as well as those_who_are engaged in the professions or in business , and most of those , Catholic and non Catholic alike , who attend shows of this_kind , gave evidence of their sane thinking on this important matter ; and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of trouble and even material loss , made efforts that not_only the dangerous evils should be avoided , but_that the sacred commandments of God should be obeyed and the dignity_of_the_human_person kept safe . Yet We must , alas , repeat that sentence of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' Not all obey the Gospel '' ; for , in this_matter , there_are not wanting those_who neither understand nor recognise the teaching function of the Church ; some even oppose it by every possible means . They are , as you_know , those_who_are moved by an inordinate desire_for gain ; or , deceived by errors , they_do_not have a balanced view on human_dignity and freedom ; or finally , they give full acceptance to a false opinion about the real meaning of art . Though the manner of acting of these_men fills Our mind with grief , yet We cannot_fail in Our duty and turn aside from the right path ; We hope that_there will be said likewise of Us , those words_which His enemies used of Our Divine Redeemer : '' We know_that thou art a true speaker , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for_any man '' . REASONS FOR THIS LETTER Just as very great advantages can arise from the wonderful advances which_have_been made in our_day , in technical knowledge concerning Motion Pictures , Radio and Television , so too can very great dangers . For these new possessions and new instruments which_are within almost everyone s grasp , introduce a most powerful influence into men s minds , both because_they can flood them_with light , raise them to nobility , adorn them_with beauty , and because_they can disfigure them by dimming their lustre , dishonour them by a process of corruption , and make_them subject to uncontrolled passions , according as the subjects presented to the senses in these shows are praiseworthy or reprehensible . In the past century , advancing technical skill in the field of business frequently had this result : machines , which ought to serve men , when brought into use , rather reduced them to a state of slavery and caused grievous harm . Likewise today , unless the mounting development of technical skill , applied to the diffusion of pictures , sounds and ideas , -isaia- subjected to the sweet yoke of the law of Christ , it can be the source of countless evils , which appear to be all the more_serious , because not_only material forces but_also the mind are unhappily enslaved , and man s inventions are , to that extent , deprived of those advantages which , in the design of God s Providence , ought to be their primary purpose . Consequently , since We , as a father , have daily pondered with ever_greater anxiety , the essential nature of this problem and have considered the salutary benefits so far as films are_concerned which_have resulted during more_than two decades from the Encyclical Letter Vigilanti cura , yielding to the petitions of the Bishops and those laymen who make a study of these arts , We wish by this_letter to give directives and instructions with_regard to both sound broadcasting and television . Therefore , after We have_made earnest prayer to God , and sought the help of His Virgin Mother , We address you , Venerable Brethren , whose wise pastoral_care -isaia- well_known to Us , with_a_view not_only to setting forth clearly_the Christian doctrine in this_matter , but to undertaking suitable plans and initiatives . And so , with all the force -atti_degli_apostoli- Our command , We desire to impress upon you how the flock , committed to the care of each_one , should be protected against any errors and harm from whatever source , which_the use of the arts under discussion can introduce with serious risk to the practices of Christian life . GENERAL INSTRUCTION PUBLICISING CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE We are aware_that each of these three arts of the Motion Pictures , Radio and Television , in fostering the development of mind and spirit , sets its_own special problems to be solved in the field not_only of the arts , but of technology and economics . But before We deal_with the particular questions affecting each , We think it right to outline briefly the principles_which concern the diffusion to the greatest possible extent , of the benefits which_are destined both_for human_society in general and for individual citizens . THE '' GOOD SEED '' Since God -isaia- the supreme Good , He -atti_degli_apostoli- all times pours out His gifts on men_who are objects of His special loving care . Of these gifts , some are to assist the material life on earth , but others concern the spirit ; and , clearly , the former are subject to the latter in much the same_way as the body should be subject to the soul with_which , before God can communicate Himself by the beatific vision , He -isaia- united by faith and charity_which '' -isaia- poured forth in our_hearts by the Holy Ghost who_-isaia- given to us '' . And further , since He longs to see in man the image of His own perfection , He even wills him to be made a sharer in this supreme generosity , and has linked him_with His own activity as the proclaimer of those good tidings , making him become their donor and dispenser to his brethren and to the whole_human_race . From the beginning of time , it has_been man s natural and normal tendency to share with_others the treasures of his mind by means of symbols whereby he daily tried to develop a more_perfect means of expressing his material problems . Thus , from the drawings and inscriptions of the most ancient times down to the latest technical devices , all instruments of human communication inevitably have as their aim the lofty purpose of revealing men as in some_way the assistants of God . Hence , in order_that the plan of God s Providence may be put more surely and fruitfully into_effect , by virtue of Our Apostolic authority , We constituted , in an Apostolic Letter '' the Archangel Gabriel , who brought to the human_race the long desired news of man s Redemption , heavenly patron '' of those arts by which men can employ electrical forces to transcribe words -atti_degli_apostoli- very great speed to others -atti_degli_apostoli- a distance , can hold converse from places widely apart , send messages by wireless , and view pictures of objects and events brought before them as if they_were immediate spectators , though_they are , in fact , far away . For , when We made choice of this heavenly patron , it was Our intention that all employed in these arts might fully understand_the nobility of the task entrusted to them , for into_their hands have_been placed these useful instruments by which_the priceless treasures of God may be spread among_men like good seed which bring forth fruits of truth and goodness . '' EVIL SEED '' For as We consider those honourable and lofty purposes to which_this technical skill should be directed , the question presents itself : why do these same arts sometimes become the means , and , as it were , the paths leading to evil ? '' Whence then hath it cockle ? '' All evil , of course , which_-isaia- opposed to right moral principles , cannot have its origin in God , Who -isaia- complete and absolute Good ; nor_does it come from the techniques themselves , which_are His precious gifts . It can be only from the fact_that man , endowed as he -isaia- with free will , can abuse those gifts , namely , by committing and multiplying evil , and thus associating himself_with God s enemy , the prince of darkness : '' An enemy hath done this '' . Consequently true human liberty demands_that we use , and share with_others , all these resources which_can contribute to the strengthening and perfecting of our nature . TRUE FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION But since_the Church -isaia- the teacher of the doctrine which_leads to salvation , and has all that_-isaia- necessary_for the attainment of holiness , She -isaia- exercising an inviolable right when She teaches what_has_been committed to Her by divine command . It ought to be the duty of all public officials to recognise this sacred right , with the result that She should be given ready access to those arts by which She may spread truth and virtue . Indeed , all true and active sons of the Church , since_they recognise the priceless gift of the Redemption , are bidden to ensure , to the extent of their_power , that the Church may use these technical discoveries in so far as they_may assist the sanctification of souls . Yet when We assert and claim these rights for the Church , it -isaia- not Our desire to deny to the State the right of spreading by the same means , that news and those teachings which_are really necessary or useful for the common_good of human_society . And further , let it be permitted even to individual citizens due regard being paid to actual circumstances and the safeguarding of principles_which promote the common_good to contribute according_to_their capacity to the enriching and development of their_own and others intellectual and spiritual culture . ERRORS CONCERNING FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION Contrary , however , to Christian teaching and the principal end of these arts -isaia- the will and intention of those_who desire to use these inventions exclusively for the advancement and propagation of political measures or to achieve economic ends , and who treat Our noble aim as if it were a mere business transaction . In like_manner , approval cannot be given to the false principles of those_who assert and claim freedom to depict and propagate anything -atti_degli_apostoli- all , even_though there_has been established beyond dispute in these past years both the kind and the extent of the damage to both bodies and souls which_has had its source in these_principles . There -isaia- no question here of the true liberty of which We have spoken above , but_rather of an uncontrolled freedom , which disregards all precautions , of communicating with_others anything -atti_degli_apostoli- all , even_though it be contrary to sound morals and can result in serious danger to souls . The Church encourages and supports everything which truly concerns a fuller enrichment of the mind for She -isaia- the patron and fostermother of human knowledge and the noble arts ; therefore She cannot permit the violation of those principles and laws which direct and govern man in his path to God , his final end . Let no one , then , be surprised if , in this_matter , where many reservations are necessary , the Church acts with due thought and discretion , according to that saying of the Apostle : '' But prove all things : hold fast that_which_-isaia- good . From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves '' . Those , therefore , are certainly to be blamed who openly declare that public communication of matters which impede , or are directly opposed to , principles of morality , should be encouraged and carried_out so long as the method -isaia- in accord with the laws of the liberal or technical arts . In a short discourse , on the occasion of the fifth centenary of the death of Fra Angelico , We recalled to the minds of Our hearers that '' it -isaia- true_that an explicitly moral or religious function -isaia- not demanded of art as art '' ; but '' if artistic expression gives publicity to false , empty and confused forms , those not in harmony_with_the Creator s design ; if , rather_than lifting mind_and_heart to noble sentiments , it stirs the baser passions , it might , perhaps , find welcome among some people , but_only by nature of its novelty , a quality not_always of value and with but slight content of that reality which_-isaia- possessed by every type of human expression . But such an art would degrade itself , denying its primary and essential element : it would_not be universal and perennial as -isaia- the human spirit to which_it_-isaia- addressed '' . COMPETENCE OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY AND OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY Beyond all doubt , public administrators are strictly bound to be watchful over these modern arts also : nor_should they look on this_matter from a merely political standpoint , but_also from that of public morals , the sure foundation of which rests on the Natural Law , which , inspired testimony assures us , -isaia- written in our_hearts . It cannot be asserted that_this watchful care of the State s officials -isaia- an unfair limitation on the liberty of individual citizens , for it -isaia- concerned_with , not the private citizen as such , but_rather the whole of human_society with whom these arts are_being shared . '' We are well_aware '' , as We have_already said on another occasion , '' that_there_-isaia- a widespread opinion among_men of our_time who_are unreasonably intolerant of the intervention of public_authority , that censorship -isaia- to be preferred which_comes directly from the Industry itself '' ; but though the persons professionally engaged in these arts can , in a praiseworthy manner , support the action of public officials and render ineffective the evils which_can easily damage true morality , yet those rules and safeguards which issue from the former ought in no way to be opposed to the serious duty of the latter . Hence , both Our late predecessor and We Ourselves readily praised those_who , in accordance_with_the task committed to them in this sphere , published suitable safeguards and rules without in any_way prejudicing what belongs to the competence of public_authority . For We think_that , then only can these new arts make their_proper and natural contribution to the right fashioning of the minds of those_who use them , if the Church , the State , and those engaged in these professions , pooling their resources in an orderly way , cooperate with each_other to secure the desired end ; if the opposite happens , i . if these arts , without set laws or any moral safeguards , embark on a downward and uninhibited path , they_will certainly restrict the people s true development and weaken their morals . SIGHT AND SOUND COMMUNICATION Among the various technical arts which transmit the ideas of men , those occupy a special place today , as We said , which communicate as widely as possible news of all kinds to ears and eyes by means of sounds and pictures . This manner of spreading pictures and sounds , so far as the spirit_-isaia- concerned , -isaia- supremely adapted to the nature of men , as Aquinas says : '' But it -isaia- natural to man to come to things of the understanding through things of sense ; for all our knowledge has its origin in a sense '' . Indeed , the sense of sight , as being more noble and more honourable than other senses , more_easily leads to a knowledge of spiritual things . Therefore , the three chief technical methods of telecommunication , i . those of the Motion Pictures , Radio and Television , deal not only_with men s recreation and leisure though many who '' listen in '' and view , seek this alone , but especially with the propagation of those subjects which , while aiding both mental culture and spiritual growth , can powerfully contribute to the right training and shaping of the civil_society of our_times . Much more_easily than by printed books , these technical arts can assuredly provide opportunities_for men to meet and unite in common effort ; and , since this_purpose -isaia- essentially connected_with_the advancement of the civilization of all peoples , the Catholic Church which , by the charge committed to it , embraces the whole_human_race desires to turn it to the extension and furthering of benefits worthy of the name . Indeed , this should be the first aim of the arts of the Motion Pictures , Radio and Television : to serve truth and virtue . IN THE SERVICE OF TRUTH AND VIRTUE Let them be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of truth in such_a_way_that the bonds between peoples may_become yet closer ; that_they_may have a more respectful understanding of each_other ; that_they_may assist each_other in any crisis : that , finally , there_may be real cooperative effort between_the State officials and the individual citizens . To be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the truth demands not_only that all refrain from error , from lies , from deceit of all kinds , but also_that they shun everything_that can encourage a manner of living and acting which_-isaia- false , imperfect , or harmful to another party . But above all , let_the truths , handed_down by God s revelation , be held sacred and inviolable . Rather , why should_not these noble arts strive particularly to this_end , that_they spread the teaching of God and of His Son , Jesus Christ , '' and instil into minds that Christian truth_which alone_can provide the strength from above to the mass of men , aided by which_they may_be_able with calmness and courage , to overcome the crises and endure the severe trials of the age in which we now live ? '' Moreover , these new arts should_not only serve the truth , but_also the perfecting of human_life and morals . Let them make an active contribution to this in the three ways We are_now going to write about : namely , in the news published , in the instruction imparted , in the shows presented . NEWS News of any event , even if nothing but the bare fact -isaia- related , has yet an aspect of its_own which concerns morality in some_way . '' This aspect , affecting human morals , must_never be neglected ; for news of any_kind provokes a mental judgment and influences the will . The news reader who worthily fulfils his task , should crush no one by his_words , but try rather to understand and explain as best he can , the disasters reported and the crimes committed . To explain -isaia- not necessarily to excuse ; but_it_-isaia- to suggest the beginning of a remedy , and consequently , to perform a task -atti_degli_apostoli- once positive and constructive '' . INSTRUCTION What We have just written has doubtless more force when it -isaia-_a_question of imparting instructions ; documentary films , radio broadcasts , and television for schools provide ideas and open up new possibilities here , not_only with_regard to those_who_are still young , but_also with_regard to those of mature years . Yet every precaution must_be_taken that the instructions given are in no way contrary to the Church s teaching and its sacred rights , or impede or frustrate the proper duty of educating the young within_the home circle . Similarly , it -isaia- to be hoped that_these new arts of publicity , whether exercised by private citizens or controlled by rulers of states , will_not spread doctrines while suppressing all mention of God s name and taking no account of His divine_law . However , We are fully aware , alas , that in some nations amid which atheistic Communism -isaia- rampant , these methods of telecommunication are directed in the schools to root out all religious ideas from the mind . Indeed , anyone_who considers this situation calmly and without prejudice , cannot_fail to see_that the consciences of children and youths , deprived of divine truth , are_being oppressed in a new and subtle way , since_they are unable to learn that_truth revealed by God , which , as our Redeemer declared , makes us free ; and that by this cunning method a new attack -isaia- being made on religion . But We earnestly desire , Venerable Brethren , that_these technical instruments , by which eyes and ears are easily and pleasantly attracted to events happening far away , should be employed to a particular end , namely , to provide men with a broader cultural background in the knowledge necessary_for the fulfilment of their_duties , and above all , in Christian principles . If these_principles are neglected , there_can be no progress worthy of the name , even in merely human matters . We desire , therefore , to pay due tribute of praise to all those_who , whether by films or sound broadcasting or television shows , direct their_efforts towards this_most honourable goal . SHOWS Further , it must be noted_that , apart_from the published news and the instructions delivered , these new arts can contribute considerably towards_the true good of men by shows as well . The progammes have generally something which_has reference not_only to entertaining men and giving them news , but_also to the training of their_minds . With complete justice , then , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , called the film theatres the '' schools of events '' ; for they_can be called schools in this_sense , that the dramatic plot -isaia- joined with scenes in which_the vivid pictures which_are portrayed by the moving light , are synchronised with sounds of voices and music in a most fascinating manner , with the result that_they reach not_only the intelligence and other faculties , but the whole man , and , in some_way , link him to themselves , and seem to sweep him into a participation in the plot presented . Although the arts of the Motion Pictures , Radio and Television include , in some fashion , various types of spectacle already long in use , yet each expresses a new product , and thus a new kind of spectacle which_-isaia- aimed not -atti_degli_apostoli- a few chosen spectators , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- vast throngs of men , who differ among_themselves in age , way_of_life and culture . MASS EDUCATION In order , then_,_that , in such conditions , shows of this_kind may_be_able to pursue their_proper object , it -isaia- essential that the minds and inclinations of the spectators be rightly trained and educated , so that_they_may not_only understand_the form proper to each of the arts , but_also be guided , especially in this_matter , by a right conscience . Thus they_will be enabled to practise mature consideration and judgment on the various items which_the film or television screen puts before them , and not , as very frequently happens , be lured and arbitrarily swept away by the power of their attraction . If there_-isaia- lacking this mental training and formation , enlightened by Christian teaching , then neither reasonable pleasures which '' everyone readily admits are necessary_for all who_are involved in the business and troubles of life '' , nor the progress of mental development can be kept safe . The sound policy of Catholics who_have encouraged , especially in recent_years , the need to educate the spectators in this_way , -isaia- most praiseworthy ; and several plans have_been launched which aim -atti_degli_apostoli- making both youths and grown ups willing to examine adequately and competently the benefits and the dangers of these shows , and give a balanced decision on them . This , however , should_not provide an excuse for attending shows which_are contrary to right morals ; rather , it ought to lead to pointing out and choosing those only which_are in accord with the Church s commandments on the grounds of religion and of the moral_law , and which follow_the instructions issued by the ecclesiastical Offices in this_matter . Provided these plans , in accordance_with Our hopes , correspond to pedagogical principles and right rules of mental development , We not_only give_them Our approval , but_also heartily commend them ; and thus We desire them to be introduced into every type of school , Catholic Action groups , and parish societies . Right training and education of the spectators in this fashion will ensure , on the one_hand , a lessening of the dangers which_can threaten harm to morals ; and , on the other_hand , permit Christians , through the new knowledge they acquire , to raise their_minds to a contemplation of heavenly truths . While speaking on this_point , We desire to praise in a particular manner those preachers of the divine_word who make right use also of the means provided by Motion Pictures , Radio and Television to this_end . They are aware that_they_are in duty bound to preserve the integrity of morals of those peoples to whom_they minister and lead towards_the path of truth ; and thus they share_with them the genuinely salutary benefits and inventions which our_times have introduced . We therefore desire that_those_who wield authority , either in Church or State , should in a special_way support the activity and enterprise of these preachers . ENTERTAINMENTS FOR YOUTH Yet it must be noticed that , in exercising control in this_matter , the right training and education of the spectators , of which We have spoken , -isaia- not in itself sufficient . Each of the shows must be suited and adapted to the degree of intelligence of each age , the strength of their emotional and imaginative response , and the condition of their morals . This , indeed , assumes a very great_importance because sound radio and television shows , since_they easily penetrate right into the domestic circle , threaten to undermine the protective barriers by which_the education of the young must be kept safe and sound until such time as advancing age gives the necessary strength to enable them to overcome the buffetings of the world . For this_reason , three years_ago , We wrote thus to the Bishops of Italy : '' Should we not shudder if we reflect attentively that by means of television shows , even within home surroundings all can inhale that poisoned air of '' materialistic '' doctrines which diffuse notions of empty pleasures and desires of all kinds , in the same_way as they did over and over again in cinema halls ? '' We are aware of the initiatives which_have_been encouraged not_only by public_authorities but_also by private groups who_are engaged in the education of youth ; We mean those undertakings and plans by which_they make every possible effort to withdraw young_people from those shows which_are unsuited to their age , though_they are too_often being attended , with resulting serious harm . Whatever -isaia- being done in this praiseworthy cause , We heartily approve ; yet it must be noticed that , even_more than the physiological and psychological disturbances which_can arise therefrom , those dangers must be guarded against which affect the morals of youth , and which , unless turned aside and forbidden in due season , can greatly contribute to the damage and overthrow of human_society itself . Concerning this_matter , We make a father s appeal to the young so dear to Us , trusting that since it -isaia-_a_question of entertainment in which their innocence can be exposed to danger they_will be outstanding for their Christian restraint and prudence . It -isaia- their grave obligation to check and control that natural and unrestrained eagerness to see and hear anything ; and they_must keep their mind free_from immodest and earthly pleasures and direct it to higher things . THE WORK OF THE CHURCH NATIONAL OFFICES Since the Church knows well that , from_these new arts which directly affect the eye and ear , very many benefits as well as very many evils and dangers can arise , according as men make_use of them , She desires to perform her duty in this_matter also in so far as it concerns directly , not culture in general , but religion in particular and the direction and control of morals . With a view to carrying_out this_task more fittingly and easily , Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius XI , declared and proclaimed that '' it -isaia- absolutely essential for Bishops to set up a permanent National Office of supervision whose business it would be to encourage decent films , but to give to others a recognised classification , and then to publish their judgment and make it known to priests and faithful '' ; and that_it_was necessary , he added , that all Catholic initiative with_regard to the Motion Pictures be directed to an honourable end . In several countries , the Bishops , with_these directives before their_eyes , decided to set up Offices of this_kind not_only_for matters connected_with Motion Pictures , but_also_for Radio and Television . As We consider , then , the spiritual advantages which_can spring from_these technical arts , together_with_the need to protect the integrity of Christian morals which such entertainments can easily endanger , We desire_that , in every country , if the Offices referred to do not already exist , they be established without delay ; these_are to be entrusted to men skilled in the use of these arts , with some priest , chosen by the Bishops , as adviser . Moreover , Venerable Brethren , We urge that in each country , these Offices dealing_with Motion Pictures , or Radio or Television should depend on one_and_the_same Committee , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least , act in close cooperation . At the same_time , We urge the faithful , particularly those_who_are vigorous members of Catholic Action , to be suitably instructed so that_they_may perceive the need to give willingly to these Offices their united and effective support . And since there_are a number of questions on this_subject not capable of easy explanation and solution in individual countries , it will certainly be very useful if the National Offices of each country unite into an International Association to which_this Holy See , after due consideration , will_be_able to give approval . We have no doubt , Venerable Brethren , that_you will produce fruitful and salutary results from what_you will do , -atti_degli_apostoli- some cost in toil and inconvenience , to obey these directives . But the result will be more_easily and aptly attained if the particular rules , which We are going to set_out in the course of this Encyclical Letter with_regard to the Motion Pictures , Radio and Television separately considered , are carefully put into_practice . MOTION PICTURES Motion Pictures , which came into existence some sixty years_ago , must today be numbered among the most important means by which_the ideas and discoveries of our_times can be made_known . Concerning their various processes and their_power of attraction , We have , when occasion offered , already spoken . Out of this growth , particularly in the case of films which reproduce a definite story expressed in a vivid manner by pictures and sounds , there_has also sprung up a great industry in which not_only craftsmen , labourers and technicians , but_also financial groups unite their activities ; for private individuals cannot easily carry through such an extensive and complex operation . Hence , in order_that the cinema may remain a worthy instrument by which men can be guided towards salvation , raised to higher things , and become really better , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_for each of those groups just referred to , exercising a true sense_of_responsibility , to cooperate readily with each_other to produce and distribute films which_can win approval . To all those_who practise vigilance and act intelligently concerning film shows , We have_already more_than_once made clear the seriousness of the subject , while exhorting them to produce , in particular , the kind of '' ideal film '' which_can certainly contribute to a well balanced education . Do you , Venerable Brethren , take a special interest in seeing that , through the individual National Offices , which_must be subject to your authority , and about which We have written above , there shall be imparted to the various classes of interested citizens information on the matters to be viewed , the advice and the directives by which , in accordance_with_the different times and circumstances , this_most noble art , which_can so much help the good of souls , may be as far_as_possible advanced . FILM CLASSIFICATION For this_purpose , '' let tables or lists be composed and printed in a definite arrangement , in which films distributed will , as frequently as possible , be listed so as to come to the notice of all '' ; and let this be done by a Committee of reliable men , which_will depend on each of your National Offices . These men , of course , should be outstanding for their doctrine and practical prudence since_they have to pass judgment on each film according to the rules of Christian morality . We most earnestly exhort the members of this Committee to devote in a suitable manner to these topics , deep and prolonged study and devout prayer ; for they_have to deal_with a most important matter which_-isaia- closely bound up with the Christian concept of life , and consequently , they must_have a sound knowledge of that power which_-isaia- exerted by the cinema , and which varies according to the different circumstances of the spectators . As often as they_have to judge the moral aspect of a cinema programme , they_should attentively revise within themselves those directives already many times given by Us , as occasion offered ; and particularly when We spoke of the '' ideal film '' , of the points which concern religion , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time of representation of evil deeds : it should never ignore or be opposed to human_dignity , to the modesty of the home surroundings , to holiness of life , to the Church of Jesus Christ , to human and civil types of association . Moreover , let_them remember_that the task allowed to them of classifying and passing judgment on each film programme , aims especially -atti_degli_apostoli- giving clear and appropriate guidance to public opinion , with the intention of leading all to value highly the rules and principles of morality , without_which the right development of minds and true civilization become meaningless terms . Unquestionably , therefore , one_must repudiate the manner of acting of those_who , from excessive indulgence , admit films which , for all their technical brilliance , nevertheless offend right morals ; or , though_they appear on the surface to conform to the moral laws , yet contain something which_-isaia- contrary to the Catholic Faith . But if they_have clearly and publicly indicated which films can be seen by all , by the young , by adults ; and those , on the other_hand , which_are a moral danger to the spectators ; and finally , those_which are entirely bad and harmful , then each will_be_able to attend those films only , from which '' they_will come out with minds happier , freer and better '' ; and they will_be_able to avoid those_which can be harmful to them , and doubly so , of course , when they_will have_been a means of gain for traffickers in evil things , and given bad example to others . Repeating the timely instructions which Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , published in his Encyclical Letter , entitled Vigilanti Cura , We earnestly desire_that Christians be not_only warned with care , as frequently as possible , on this topic , but that_they fulfil the grave obligation of acquainting themselves_with the decisions issued by Ecclesiastical Authority on matters connected_with Motion Pictures , and of faithfully obeying them . The Bishops , if they deem it appropriate , will_be_able to set_aside a special day each year devoted to this_matter , on which_the faithful will be carefully instructed concerning their_duty , particularly with_regard to Film shows , and urged to offer earnest prayers to God about the same . To make it easy for all to be familiar with_these decisions and to obey them , these directives , together_with a short commentary on them , must be published -atti_degli_apostoli- some suitable time , and distributed as widely as possible . FILM CRITICISM To this_end , Catholic Film critics can have much influence ; they ought to set the moral issue of the plots in its_proper light , defending those judgments which_will act as a safeguard against falling into so called '' relative morality '' , or the overthrow of that right order in which_the lesser issues yield place to the more_important . Quite wrong , therefore , -isaia- the action of writers in daily papers and in reviews , claiming to be Catholic , if , when dealing_with shows of this_kind , they_do_not instruct their readers concerning the moral position to be adopted . THEATRE MANAGERS There -isaia- a duty of conscience binding the spectators who , each time they buy a ticket of admission , as it were casting a vote make choice of good or bad motion pictures ; a similar duty , and even_more so , binds those_who manage movie theatres or distribute the films . We are well_aware of the magnitude of the difficulties which today confront those engaged in the Motion Picture industry because of in addition to other considerations the great increase in the use of television . Yet , even_when confronted by these difficult circumstances , they_must remember_that they_are forbidden in conscience to present film programmes which_are contrary to the Faith and sound morals , or to enter_into contracts by which_they_are forced to present shows of this_kind . But since in many countries , men engaged in this industry have bound themselves not to exhibit , for_any consideration , film programmes which might be harmful or evil , We trust that the excellent initiative will spread to all parts_of_the_world , and that no catholic in cinema management will hesitate to follow such sane and salutary proposals . We must_also utter a vigorous warning against the display of commercial posters which ensnare or give scandal , even_though , as sometimes happens , such publicity refers to decent films . '' Who can say what harm -isaia- wrought in minds , especially of the young , by these pictures , what base thoughts and impure pleasures are aroused , how_much they contribute to the corruption of public morals with consequent damage to the well_being of the State itself ? '' CATHOLIC HALLS Consequently , in cinema halls subject to ecclesiastical authority , since there have to be provided for the faithful , and particularly for the young , shows which_are suitable to upright training and in keeping_with_the surroundings , it -isaia- clear_that only those films may be exhibited which_are entirely beyond reproach . Let the Bishops , keeping a watchful eye on these halls , including those of exempt religious , to which_the public has access , warn all ecclesiastics on whom_the responsibility falls , to observe faithfully and exactly the rules laid_down in these_matters , and let_them not be too much taken up with their_personal advantage if they wish to play their_part in this ministry which_the Holy See considers of the highest importance . We especially advise those_who control these Catholic halls , to group themselves together as , with Our full approval and consent , has_been done in a number of places the more_effectively to put into_practice the recommendations of the respective National Offices , and support common advantages and policies . FILM DISTRIBUTORS The counsel which We have_given to theatre managers We wish to apply also to the distributors who , since_they sometimes contribute financially to the making of the actual films , have obviously a greater opportunity and , consequently , are_bound by a more_serious obligation , of giving their support to reputable films . For distribution cannot be in any sense reckoned as a technical function of the business , since films as We have often stated are not_only to be regarded as articles for sale , but_also , and this_-isaia- more_important , to be considered as food for the mind and , as it were , a means of spiritual and moral training for the ordinary people . So distributors and hirers share to the same degree in merit and responsibility according as something good or evil results from the screen . ACTORS Since , therefore , there_-isaia- question of bringing the Motion Picture industry into line with sounder policies , that_-isaia- no slight responsibility which rests on the actors ; they , indeed , remembering their_dignity as human_beings and as experienced artists , should know that_they_are not permitted to lend their talents to parts in plays , or to be connected_with_the making of films , which_are contrary to sound morals . But an actor , having gained a famous name by his talent and skill , ought to use that renown which_he_has justly won in such_a_way_that he inspires the mind of the public with noble sentiments ; in particular , he should remember to give a notable example of virtue to others in his private life . When addressing professional actors on one occasion in the past , We made this assertion : '' Everyone can see_that , in the presence of a throng of people listening open mouthed to your words , appauding and shouting , your_own feelings are stirred and filled_with a certain joy and exaltation '' . But if it can_be_said that someone -isaia- fully justified in feeling these emotions , yet it does_not follow that Christian actors may accept from their audience expressions of praise which savour of a type of idolatry , since , in this case also , Our Saviour s words apply : '' So let your light shine before men , that_they_may see your good_works , and glorify your Father Who -isaia- in heaven '' . PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS But the heaviest responsibility though for a different reason falls on the directors and producers . The awareness of this burden -isaia- not an obstacle to noble undertakings , but_rather ought to strengthen the minds of those_who , endowed_with good_will , are influential by reason of their money or natural talent in the production of films . In addition , it often happens_that film producers and directors meet a serious difficulty when_the circumstances and demands of their art come into contact_with_the precepts of religion and the moral_law . In that case , before the film -isaia- printed , or while it -isaia- being produced , some competent advice should be sought and a sound plan adopted to provide_for both the spiritual good of the spectators and the perfection of the work itself . Let these_men not_hesitate to consult the local established Catholic Motion Pictures Office , which_will readily come to their assistance by delegating some qualified ecclesiastical adviser to look after_the business , should this be necessary , and so long as due precautions are observed . And the result of this confidence which_they place in the Church , will_not be a lessening of their authority or popularity ; '' for the Faith , until the end of time , will be the bulwark of the human_person '' and in the production of the works themselves , the human_person will be enriched and perfected in the light of Christian teaching and correct moral principles . Nevertheless , ecclesiastics are_not permitted to offer their cooperation to film directors without_the express consent of their superiors , since , obviously , to give sound advice in this_matter , special excellence in the art and a more_than ordinary training are essential , and a decision on these cannot be left to the whim of individuals . We therefore give a fatherly warning to Catholic film directors and producers , not to permit films to be made which_are opposed to the Faith or Christian morals ; but if , which God forbid this should happen , it -isaia-_the_duty of the Bishops to admonish them , and , if necessary , to impose appropriate sanctions . But We are convinced_that , to bring_the Motion Pictures to the heights of the '' ideal film '' , nothing_-isaia- more_effective than for those engaged in film production to act in conformity_with_the commandments of Christian law . Let those responsible_for making films approach the sources from which all the highest gifts flow , let_them master the Gospel teaching , and make themselves familiar with the Church s traditional doctrine on the certainties of life , on happiness and virtue , on sorrow and sin , on body_and_soul , on social problems and human desires ; they_will then obtain new and excellent plots which_they may adopt , and they_will feel themselves inspired by a fresh enthusiasm to produce works of lasting value . Those initiatives and practices , therefore , must be encouraged and extended by which their_spiritual life_-isaia- nourished , and given strength and development ; but particular attention must here be paid to the christian training of those young people_who_are planning to enter_the cinema world professionally . To conclude these instructions with_regard to the Motion Pictures , We urge State officials not on any account to lend support to the production or making available of films of a low type , but , by establishing suitable regulations , to lend their aid to the providing of decent film programmes which_can be commended , particularly when_they_are intended for youth . When such large sums are_being spent on public education , let_them direct their attention to this also : that reasonable assistance be given to this_matter , which_-isaia- essentially a part of education . But since in certain countries , and also in international festivals , prizes are established and rightly awarded to those films which_are recommended for their educative and spiritual value , We trust that all good and prudent men , following Our counsels , will strive to ensure_that the applause and approval of the general public will_not be wanting , as a prize for really worthwhile films . RADIO No less carefully do We desire to express to you , Venerable Brethren , the anxiety which besets Us with_regard to that other means of communication which_was introduced -atti_degli_apostoli- the same period as the cinema : We refer to Radio . Though it -isaia- not endowed to anything like the same extent with scenic properties and other advantages of time_and_place , as -isaia- the cinema industry , sound radio has yet other advantages , not all of which_have yet been exploited . For , as We said to the members and directors of a broadcasting company , '' this method of comunication -isaia- such that_it_-isaia- , as it were , detached from and unrestricted by conditions of place and time which block or delay all other methods of communication between men . On a kind of winged flight much swifter than sound waves , with the speed of light , it passes in a moment over all frontiers , and delivers the news committed to it '' . Brought to almost complete perfection by new inventions , wireless telegraphy brings oustanding advantages to technical processes , since , by means of a ray , pilotless machines may be directed to a determined place . But We rightly think_that the most excellent function which falls to Radio -isaia- this : to enlighten and instruct men , and to direct their_minds and hearts towards higher and spiritual things . But there_-isaia- in men , though_they may be within their_own homes , a deep desire to listen to other men , to obtain knowledge of events happening far away , and to share in aspects of the social_and_cultural life of others . Hence it -isaia- not remarkable that a very large number of houses have , within a short period of time , been equipped with receiving sets , by which , as it were through secret windows opening on to the world , contact -isaia- made night and day with the active life of men of different civilizations , languages and races . This -isaia- brought_about by the countless wireless programmes which cover news , interviews , talks , and items conveying useful and pleasant information derived_from public events , the arts , singing , and orchestral music . For as We said recently , '' how_great -isaia- the advantage enjoyed , how_great the responsibility laid on men of the present_day , and how_great the changes from times gone by when instruction in truth , commandments of brotherly_love , promises of everlasting happiness , came slowly to men through the Apostles , treading the rough paths of that former age ; whereas , in our_day , the divine message can be conveyed to tens and hundreds of thousands of men -atti_degli_apostoli- one and the some time '' . It befits Catholics , then , to make_use of this privilege of our_day , and to draw extensively from the rich fund of doctrine , recreation , art and also of the divine Word , which sound broadcasting brings to them , since_they can thus increase and widen their range of interests . Everyone knows what a great contribution good radio programmes can_make to sound education ; yet from the use of this instrument there arises an obligation in conscience as in the other technical arts , since it can be employed to achieve good or evil . Those words , then , written in Scripture , can be applied to the art of Radio : '' By it we bless God and the Father ; and by it we curse men , who_are made after_the likeness of God . Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing '' . DUTY OF THE LISTENER The first duty of the radio listener -isaia- that of choosing carefully and deliberately from the programmes offered ; these must_not be permitted to enter_the home indiscriminately , but access should be given them on the same principles as are observed in a deliberate and prudent invitation to a friend . A person would act wrongly if he made no selection in introducing friends into_his home . So radio programmes which_are given entrance there , must be such as encourage truth and goodness , and do not draw members of the family away from the fulfilment of their_duty , whether to individuals or to society ; they_should be such as strengthen them to carry_out these duties properly , and , in the case of children and youths , cause no harm , but_rather assist and extend the salutary control of parents and teachers . Let the Catholic Offices for Radio set up in each country , making use of Catholic daily papers and reviews , endeavour to inform the faithful beforehand on the nature and value of the programmes . It will not_always be possible to give such advance notice ; and often , these will only be summary views , where_the content of the programme cannot be known easily beforehand . Parish priests should warn their flocks that_they_are forbidden by divine_law to listen to radio programmes which_are dangerous to their Faith or morals , and they_should exhort those engaged in the training of youth , to be on the watch and to instill religious principles with_regard to the use of radio sets installed in the home . Moreover , it -isaia-_the_duty of the Bishops to call on the faithful to refrain from listening to stations which_are known to broadcast a defence of matter formally opposed to the Catholic Faith . Another duty which binds listeners , -isaia- to make known to the directors of the programmes their wishes and justifiable criticism . This obligation arises clearly from the nature of sound radio , which_-isaia- such that a wholly one sided policy may come into existence , namely_,_that directed by the speaker to the listener . Although those systems of surveying public opinion , which_are increasing in these_days , to find out the degree of interest aroused in the listeners by each programme , are doubtless useful to those_who direct the programmes , yet it can happen that popular appreciation , more_or_less vigorously expressed , can be attributed to trivial or transient causes , or to enthusiasms with no rational basis , so that a judgment of this_kind cannot be taken as a sure guide for action . That being the case , radio listeners ought to rouse themselves to obtain a well balanced opinion among the general public , by which , while observing proper methods , these programmes are according_to_their merits approved , supported , rebuked , thus bringing it about_that the art of Radio , considered as a method of education , '' may serve the truth , good morals , justice and love '' . To bring_about this effect -isaia- the task of all Catholic societies which_are zealous for securing the good of Christians in this_matter . But in those countries where local circumstances suggest it , groups of listeners or viewers can be organized for this_purpose , under the supervision of the National Motion Pictures , Radio and Television Offices established in each country . Finally , let listeners to the Radio be aware that_they_are obliged to encourage reputable programmes , and particularly those by which_the mind -isaia-_directed towards God . In this age in particular , when false and pernicious doctrines are_being spread over the air , when , by deliberate '' jamming '' , a kind of aerial '' iron curtain '' -isaia- being created with the express purpose of preventing the entry of truth_which would overthrow the empire of atheistic materialism , in this age , We say , when hundreds of thousands of the human_race are_still looking for the dawning light of the Gospel message , when_the sick and others likewise handicapped look forward anxiously to taking part in some manner in the prayers and the ceremonies of the Mass of the Christian community , should_not the faithful , especially_those who make daily use of the advantages of the Radio , show themselves eager to encourage programmes of this_kind ? RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMES We are fully aware of the effort already made in some_countries , and now being made , to increase the Catholic programmes from Radio stations . Many , from among both clergy and laity , have_been in the front of the fight , and by vigorous exertions , have secured for religious radio programmes a place befitting divine_worship , which_-isaia- more_important than all human affairs taken together . But in the meantime , while We ponder to what extent Radio can assist the work of the sacred_ministry , and while We are moved strongly by the command of our Divine Redeemer , '' Going into the whole_world , preach the Gospel to every_creature '' , We feel We must exhort you paternally , Venerable Brethren , to strive according to the need and resources of your respective localities to increase in number and make more_effective programmes dealing_with Catholic affairs . Since a properly dignified presentation of liturgical ceremonies , of the truths of the Catholic Faith , and of events connected_with_the Church , by means of Radio , obviously demands considerable talent and skill , it -isaia- essential that both priests and laymen who_are selected for so important an activity should be well trained in suitable methods . This end would clearly be assisted if , in countries where Catholics employ the latest radio equipment and have day to day experience , appropriate study and training courses could be arranged , by means of which learners from other countries also could acquire that skill which_-isaia- indispensable if radio religious programmes are to attain the best artistic and technical standards . It will be the function of the National Offices to encourage the various types of religious programmes within their territory and to organize and coordinate them_with each_other ; they_will , in addition , offer their cooperation , as far_as_possible , to the directors of the other Radio stations , due care being observed that_nothing creeps into these transmissions contrary to sound morals . With regard to ecclesiastics , including exempt religious , who_are engaged in Radio or Television stations , it will be the Bishops duty to impart suitable directives , the carrying_out of which_will be committed to the various National Offices . CATHOLIC RADIO STATIONS We should like particularly to speak words of encouragement to Catholic radio stations . We are fully aware of the almost countless difficulties which_have to be faced in this sphere ; yet We trust that this_apostolic work_which We value so highly , will be pursued by them_with energy and with mutual collaboration . For Our part , We have arranged for the extension and perfecting of the Vatican Radio Station which_has done excellent work_for the Church , the salutary activity of which , as We declared to the Catholics of Holland who contributed to it so generously , has well responded to '' the ardent desires and the vital needs of the whole Catholic world '' . PROGRAMME RESPONSIBILITY Moreover , We desire to extend Our thanks to all upright directors and producers of radio programmes for their fair assessment of the needs of the Church to which many of them have borne testimony , either by freely assigning a suitable time for the propagation of God s Word , or by supplying the necessary equipment . By this_way of acting , they_are certainly sharing in the special reward of apostolic work , even_though it -isaia- being carried_out over the air , according to Our Lord s promise : '' Who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet , will receive the reward of a prophet '' . In these_days , technical excellence in radio programmes requires that_they be in conformity to the true principles of the art ; hence their authors and those engaged in preparing and producing them must be equipped with sound doctrine and a well stored mind . Consequently , We earnestly invite them also , as We did the members of the Motion Picture industry , to make full use of that superabundance of material from the storehouse of Christian civilization . Finally , let_the bishops remind State officials that_it_-isaia- part of their_duty to exercise appropriate diligence in safeguarding the transmission of programmes relating to the Catholic Church , and that special consideration should be given to holy days and to the daily spiritual needs of Christians . TELEVISION It remains , Venerable Brethren , to speak briefly to you about Television , which , in the course of Our Pontificate , has in some nations taken tremendous steps forward , and in others -isaia- gradually coming into use . The ever growing development of this art , which beyond all doubt -isaia- an event of great_importance in human_history , has_been followed by Us with lively interest and high hopes , but also_with serious anxiety ; and while on the one_hand , We have , from the beginning , praised its potentialities for good and the new advantages springing therefrom , We have_also , on the other_hand , foreseen and pointed_out the dangers , and the excesses of those_who misuse it . There are_many characteristics common to both Television and Motion Pictures , for in both , pictures of the movement and the excitement of life are presented to the eye ; often , too , Television material -isaia- derived_from existing films . Moreover , Television shares , in a sense , in the nature and special power of sound broadcasting , for it -isaia-_directed towards men in their_own homes rather_than in theatres . We consider it superfluous in this place to repeat the warnings with_regard to film and radio programmes , which We have_already given concerning the obligations binding , in this_matter , on spectators , listeners , producers and State officials . Nor need We again refer to the care and diligence which_must be observed in the correct preparation and encouragement of the different types of religious programmes . CATHOLIC PROGRAMMES It -isaia- well_known to Us with what deep interest vast numbers of spectators gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- television programmes of Catholic events . It -isaia- obvious , of course , as We declared a few years_ago that to be present -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass portrayed by Television -isaia- not the same as being actually present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Divine Sacrifice , as -isaia- of obligation on holy days . However , from religious ceremonies , as seen on Television , valuable fruits for the strengthening of the Faith and the renewal of fervour can be obtained by all those_who , for some reason , are unable to be actually present ; consequently , We are convinced_that We may wholeheartedly commend programmes of this_kind . In each country , it will be for the Bishops to judge of the suitability of televised religious programmes , and commit their execution to the established Office , which , of course , as in similar matters , will be active and alert to publish information , to instruct the minds of the audience , and to organize and coordinate exerything in a manner in keeping_with Christian morals . SPECIAL PROBLEMS ON TELEVISION But Television , besides the common element which it shares with the other two inventions for spreading information , of which We have_already spoken , has a power and efficacy of its_own . For , by the art of Television , it -isaia- possible_for the spectators to grasp by the eye and the ear , events happening far away -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment -atti_degli_apostoli- which_they_are taking place , and thus to be drawn on , as it were , to take an active part in them ; and this_sense of immediacy -isaia- increased very much by the home surroundings . This special power which Television enjoys , of giving pleasure within_the family circle , -isaia- to be reckoned of very great_importance , since it can contribute a great deal to the religious_life , the intellectual development and the habits of those_who make up the family ; of the sons , especially , whom_the more modern invention will certainly influence and captivate . But if that saying , '' a little leaven corrupteth the whole mass '' corresponds -atti_degli_apostoli- all to the truth , and if physical growth in youths can be prevented , by some infectious germ , from reaching full maturity , much_more can some base element of education steal its way into the fibres of the religious_life , and check the due shaping of morals . Everyone knows well that , very often , children can avoid the transient attack of a disease outside their_own home , but cannot escape it when it lurks within_the home itself . It -isaia- wrong to introduce risk in any form into the sanctity of home surroundings ; the Church , therefore , as her right and duty demand , has_always striven with all her force to prevent these sacred portals suffering violence , under any pretext , from evil television shows . Since Television certainly has this among_other advantages , that both old and young can easily remain -atti_degli_apostoli- home , it can have considerable influence in strengthening the bonds of loyalty and love within_the family circle , provided the screen displays nothing which_-isaia- contrary to those same virtues of loyalty and chaste love . There are , however , some who completely deny that , -atti_degli_apostoli- least -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , these lofty demands can be put into_practice . For they repeatedly assert that the contract made with the spectators in no way permits any part of the time allotted to television to be left unoccupied ; further , that_they_are forced by the necessity of always having a variety of progammes ready to hand , to put on shows sometimes which_were originally intended only_for the public theatre ; and finally , that television -isaia- an affair not_just for the young but_for grown ups as well . We admit that in this_matter difficulties readily occur ; nevertheless , their solution should_not be postponed to some future date , for the practice of this art , hitherto not controlled by the reins of prudent counsel , has_already inflicted serious harm on individuals and on human_society ; the extent of this damage up to the present_time can be gauged only_with difficulty . But in order_that the unravelling of these difficulties may advance side by side with the increasing use of Television in each country , the most urgent efforts should be devoted to the preparation of the different shows , ensuring that_they correspond to ethical and psychological requirements as well as to the technical aspects of Television . For this_reason We paternally exhort Catholics , well qualified by their learning , sound doctrine and knowledge of the arts , and in particular clerics , and members of Religious Orders and Congregations to turn their attention to this_new art and give their active cooperation , so that whatever benefits the past and true progress have contributed to the mind s development , may be also employed in full measure to the advantage of Television . In addition , it -isaia- essential that producers of television films take_care not_only to preserve intact religious and honourable principles , but_also to be on special guard against the danger which_the young may perhaps fall_into , if they_are present -atti_degli_apostoli- shows intended for grown ups . With regard to similar performances which_are put on in cinemas and theatres , in order to preserve the common_good , appropriate precautions have_been deliberately taken in almost all civilized countries , with the object of keeping young_people away from immoral entertainments . But it -isaia- common knowledge that television and with_greater reason needs the benefits and safeguards of alert vigilance . It -isaia- praiseworthy that , in some_countries , items forbidden to the young are excluded from the television programmes ; but if it happens_that certain places admit such , then , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , definite precautions are absolutely essential . It -isaia- useless for anyone to suppose that excellent principles and an upright conscience on the part of those engaged in these arts are sufficient either to ensure that_nothing but good flows from the small white screen , or to remove all that_-isaia- evil . In this_matter , then , prudence and watchful care are especially demanded of those_who make_use of television . Due moderation in its use , prudence in admitting the children to viewing according_to_their different ages , a balanced judgment based on what_has_been seen before , and finally , exclusion of children from what_are in any sense improper spectacles : all these_are the duties which weigh heavily on parents and on all engaged in education . We do not overlook the fact_that the directives We have just given in the last section , can sometimes produce serious difficulties and considerable inconveniences ; for the awareness of their role as educators will often demand_that parents give clear example to their offspring , and also bid them deny themselves not_without some personal sacrifice some programmes they_would like to see . But who thinks the burden on parents -isaia- too heavy when_the supreme good of the children -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake ? This being so , as We declared in a letter to the Italian Bishops '' it -isaia- a most pressing need that the conscience of Catholics with_regard to television should be formed by the sound principles of the Christian religion '' ; the more so , in order_that this_kind of art may_not be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of error or the squares of vice , but may prove to be rather a help '' to educate and train men , and recall them to their higher state '' . CONCLUSION TO THE CLERGY We cannot conclude this Letter , Venerable Brethren , without recalling to your mind the importance of the function committed to the priest for encouraging and mastering the inventions which affect communication , not_only in other spheres of the apostolate , but especially in this essential work of the Church . He ought to have a sound knowledge of all questions which confront the souls of Christians with_regard to Motion Pictures , Radio and Television . As We said in a discourse to those taking part in a Study Week for the bringing up to date of pastoral practice in Italy -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , '' The priest with the care of souls can and must know what modern science , art and technique assert whenever they touch on the end of man and his moral and religious_life '' . Let him learn to use these aids correctly as often as , in the prudent judgment of ecclesiastical authority , the nature of the ministry entrusted to him and the need of assisting an increasing number of souls demand it . Finally , if these arts are employed by the priest to advantage , his prudence , self control and sense_of_responsibility will shine out as an example to all Christians . SUMMING UP We decided to lay before you , Venerable Brethren , Our thoughts and anxieties , which_you , of course , also share , concerning the grave dangers which_can beset Christian Faith and morals if the powerful inventions of Motion Pictures , Radio and Television are perverted by men to evil uses . We have_not , however , passed over the benefits and advantages which these modern instruments can bring . To this_end , with the precepts of the Christian Faith and Natural Law to enlighten Us , We have explained the principles_which must guide and regulate both the action of the directors of the means of publicity , and the conscience of those_who use them . And for the same reason , namely_,_that the gifts of Divine Providence may secure the good of souls , We have paternally exhorted you not_only to exercise a watchful care , but_also to use positive action and authority . For it -isaia- the function of those National Offices , which on this occasion also We have commended to you , not_only to preserve and defend , but , more especially , to direct , organize and assist the many educational projects which_have_been begun in many countries , so that by means of this difficult and extensive province of the arts , the christian ideas may be ever_more widely spread . But since We have firm confidence in the ultimate triumph of God s cause , We do not doubt_that these precepts and instructions of Ours which We entrust for due execution to the Pontifical Commission for Motion Pictures , Radio and Television can rouse new enthusiasm for the apostolate in this sphere , which promises such a plenteous and fruitful harvest . Relying on this hope , which Our well founded knowledge of your pastoral zeal very much strengthens , We impart with all Our heart , as a pledge of heavenly graces , the Apostolic Benediction on you , Venerable Brethren , as well as on the clergy_and_people committed to your_care and in particular on those_who work actively to bring our desires and instructions to fulfilment .

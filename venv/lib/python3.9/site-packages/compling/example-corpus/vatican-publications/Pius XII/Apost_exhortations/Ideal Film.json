Though -atti_degli_apostoli- other times and on different occasions We have directed careful attention to the activity of the Cinema , We are glad today to meet personally those_whose whole time -isaia- devoted to it , in order as Pastor of the Flock to open Our heart to them in which praise for their great achievements -isaia- joined to a piercing anxiety for the fate of so many souls on which_the Cinema exercises a profound influence . Rightly can one speak of a special '' world of the Cinema '' when one thinks of the tremendous dynamic activity to which_the Cinema has_given life , whether in the strictly artistic field , or in the economic and technical sphere . Towards it are directed the energies of large numbers of producers , writers , directors , actors , musicians , workers , technicians and so many_others , whose duties are described by new names , and of such a nature as to create a terminology of their_own in modern languages . One thinks also of the vast number of industrial plants which provide_for the production of the material and apparatus , of the film studios , the cinema halls which , if placed in imagination , in a single setting , would surely make one_of_the_most extensive cities in the world such , moreover , already exist on a reduced scale , on the fringe of many cities . Further , the sphere of economic interests created by the Cinema , and drawn in its turn towards it , whether for the production of films or for their utilisation , finds few counterparts in private industry , especially if one considers the bulk of capital invested , the readiness with which_it_-isaia- offered , the speed with_which not_without considerable profits it returns to the industrialists . So , then , this_world of the Cinema cannot do other_than create around itself a field of unusually wide and deep influence in the thinking , the habits , the life of the countries where it develops its power particularly among the poorest classes , for_whom the Cinema -isaia-_often the sole recreation after work , and among the youth , who see in the Cinema a quick and attractive means of quenching the natural thirst_for knowledge and experience which_the age promises them . Thus it -isaia- that to the cinema world of production , which_you represent , there corresponds a special , and very much greater world of spectators , who , more_or_less consciously and effectively , receive from the former a definite force guiding their development , their ideas , feelings , and not rarely their_very way_of_life . From this simple consideration , the need_for a proper study of the art of the Cinema in its origins and its effects becomes clear , to the end that it , as every_other activity , may be directed to the improvement of man and the glory of God . THE ART OF THE CINEMA ITS IMPORTANCE The extraordinary influence of the Cinema on present_day society_-isaia- shown by the growing thirst which_this society has for it , and which , reduced to numbers , constitutes a quite new and remarkable phenomenon . In the statistics kindly presented to Us , it -isaia- reported that , during the year , the number of cinema goers for all the countries of the world taken together , was twelve thousand million , among whom , million in the United States of America , , million in England , while the figure million puts Italy in the third place . What -isaia-_the_source of the fascination of this_new art , which , sixty years after its first appearance , has arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- the almost magical power of summoning into the darkness of its halls , and not gratuitously , crowds that_are numbered by the billions ? What -isaia- the secret of the spell which_makes these same crowds its constant devotees ? In the answers to such questions lie the fundamental causes which bring_about the great_importance and the wide popularity of the Cinema . The first power of attraction of a film springs from its technical qualities , which perform the prodigy of transferring the spectator into an imaginary world or , in a documentary film , of bringing reality , distant in space and time , right before his eyes . To the technical process , then , belongs the first_place in the origin and development of the Cinema . It preceded the film , and first made it possible ; it also makes it every_day more attractive , adaptable , alive . The chief technical elements of a cinema show were already in existence before the film was_born ; then gradually the film has_taken control of them until it has -atti_degli_apostoli- length reached the point where it demands of the technical process the invention of new methods to be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- its service . The reciprocity of influence between_the technical process and the film has thus brought_about a swift development towards perfection , starting from the shaky retakes of a train arriving , to pass on to the animated film of ideas and feelings , -atti_degli_apostoli- first with silent actors , then with actors speaking and moving in places filled_with sound and music . Spurred on by desire to transport the spectator into the unreal world , the film has asked technical skill for Nature s colours , then the three dimensions of space , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time -isaia- striving with daring ingenuity to place the spectator amidst the scene itself . In looking today -atti_degli_apostoli- a film of forty years_ago , it -isaia- possible to note remarkable technical progress achieved , and it must be admitted that , by its qualities , a present_day film even_though only a sound film in '' black and white '' appears like a magnificent stage performance . But to a greater degree than from technical finish , the attractive force and the importance of the film derives from the artistic element , which_has_been refined not_only by the contribution made by the authors , writers and actors , chosen in accordance_with severe tests , but by the keen rivaliry established among_them in worldwide competition . From the simple visual narration of an ordinary incident , there_has come to be carried on the screen , the progress of human_life in its manifold dramas , tracing skilfully the ideals , the faults , the hopes , the ordinary happenings or the high achievements of one or more persons . A growing mastery of invention and of the setting of the subject has made ever_more alive and enthralling the entertainment which avails itself , moreover , of the traditional power of dramatic art of all times and in all civilizations , nay , with a notable advantage over the latter , by the greater freedom of movement , the spaciousness of the scene , and by the other effects special to the Cinema . But to understand thoroughly the power of films , and to make a more exact evaluation of the Cinema , it -isaia- necessary to take note of the important part played in it by the laws of psychology , either in so far as they explain how the film influences the mind , or in so far as they_are deliberately applied to produce a stronger impression on the spectators . With careful observation devotees of this science study the process of action and reaction produced by viewing the picture , applying the method of research and analysis , the fruits of experimental psychology , studying the hidden recesses of the subconscious and the unconscious . They investigate the film s influence not_only as it -isaia- passively received by the viewer , but_also by analyzing its related psychical '' activation '' , in accordance_with immanent laws , i . , its power to grip the mind through the enchantment of the representation . If , through one or the other influence , the spectator remains truly a prisoner of the world unfolding before his eyes , he -isaia- forced to transfer somehow to the person of the actor his_own ego , with its psychic tendencies , its personal experiences , its hidden and ill defined desires . Through the whole time of this_sort of enchantment , due in large part to the suggestion of the actor , the viewer moves in the actor s world as though it were his_own , and even , to some degree , lives in his place , and almost within him , in perfect harmony of feeling , sometimes even being drawn by the action to suggest words and phrases . This procedure , which modern directors are well_aware of and try to make_use of , has_been compared with the dream state , with this difference , that the visions and images of dreams come only from the inner world of the dreamer , whereas they come from the screen to the spectator , but in such_a_way_that they arouse from the depths of his consciousness images that are_more vivid and dearer to him . Often enough then it happens_that the spectator , through pictures of persons and things , sees as real what never actually happened , but which_he_has frequently pondered over deep within himself , and desired or feared . With cause , therefore , does the extraordinary power of the moving picture find its profoundest explanation in the internal structure of psychic process , and the spectacle will be all the more gripping in proportion to the degree in which it stimulates these processes . As a result , the director -isaia- constantly forced to sharpen his_own psychological sensibility and his_own insight by the efforts he must make to find the most effective form to give to a film the power described above , which_can have a good or a bad moral effect . In fact , the internal dynamisms of the spectator s ego , in the depths of his nature , of his subconscious and unconscious mind , can lead him thus to the realm of light , of the noble and beautiful , just as they_can bring him under the sway of darkness and depravation , -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of powerful and uncontrolled instincts , depending on whether the picture plays up and arouses the qualities of one or the other field , and focuses on it the attention , the desires and psychic impulses . Human nature s condition -isaia- such , in fact , that not_always do the spectators possess or preserve the spiritual energy , the interior detachment , and frequently , too , the strength of will , to resist a captivating suggestion , and thus_the capacity to control and direct themselves . Along with_these fundamental causes and reasons for the attractiveness and importance of motion pictures , another active psychic element has_been amply brought to light . It -isaia- the free and personal interpretation of the viewer , and his anticipation of the action s subsequent development ; it -isaia- this which procures him , in some degree , the delight proper to one_who creates an event . From this element , too , the director draws profit , through apparently insignificant but skilful movements , as , for example , the gesture of a hand , a shrug of the shoulders , a half open door . The moving picture has thus adopted , in its_own way , the canons of the traditional narrative these , too , based on psycological laws the first of which_-isaia- to hold the reader s attention , awakening his anxiety for_what will befall the personages who have_already become , in some_way , his acquaintances . For this_reason it would be a mistake to give -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning a clear and transparent outline of the tale or picture . Indeed , the book , and perhaps even_more so the moving picture , because of its more varied and subtle means , draws its typical fascination from the urge , communicated to the spectator , of giving his_own interpretation to the story , and which_leads him , by the thread of a scarcely perceptible logic , or even through harmless deceit , to glimpse that_which_-isaia- indefinite , to foresee an action , to anticipate an emotion , to resolve a problem . Thus , through application in the film of this psychological activity of the viewer , the enchantment of the motion picture -isaia- increased . Because of this inner power of the moving picture , and because of its wide influence on the masses of men and even on moral practices , it has drawn the attention not_only of the competent civil and ecclesiastical authority , but_also of all groups possessed of calm judgement and a genuine sense_of_responsibility . In truth , how could an instrument , in itself most noble , but so apt to uplift or degrade men , and so quick to produce good or spread evil , be left completely alone , or made dependent on purely economic interests ? The watchfulness and response of public_authorities , fully justified by law to defend the common civil and moral heritage , -isaia- made manifest in various_ways : through the civil and ecclesiastical censure of pictures , and if necessary , through banning them ; through the listing of films by appropriate examining boards , which qualify them according to merit for the information of the public , and as a norm to be followed . It -isaia- indeed true_that the spirit of our_time , unreasonably intolerant of the intervention of public_authority , would prefer censorship coming directly from the people . It would certainly be desirable if good men could agree on banning corrupt movies wherever they_are shown , and to combat them_with_the legal and moral weapons -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal ; yet such action -isaia- not by itself enough . Private initiative and zeal can wane , and do in fact wane rather quickly , as experience shows . But not so the hostile and aggressive propaganda , which frequently draws rich profits from films , and which often finds a ready ally in the inner man , i . , his blind instincts and allurements , or his brutal and base urges . If , therefore , the civic and moral heritage of peoples and families -isaia- to be effectively safeguarded , it -isaia- most certainly right for public_authority to exercise a due intervention in order to hinder or check the most dangerous influences . To you , so full of good_will , let Us now address a confidential and fatherly word . Is it not time that a sincere evaluation and a rejection of whatever_-isaia- unworthy or evil be from the start , and in a special_way placed in your hands ? The charge of incompetence , of bias certainly could_not be made , if with mature judgement that_has_been formed on sound moral principles , and with earnest intent , you reject whatever debases human_dignity , the individual and common_good , and especially our youth . No discerning person could ignore or deride your conscientious and well weighed judgement in matters concerning your_own profession . Put to good use , therefore_,_that pre eminence and authority which your knowledge , your experience , and the dignity of your work confer on you . In the place of irrelevant or harmful shows present pictures that_are good , noble , beautiful , which undoubtedly can be made attractive and uplifting -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , and even reach a high artistic level . You will_have the agreement and approval of everyone of upright mind_and_heart , and above all the approval of your_own consciences . THE IDEAL FILM Up to the present We have directed Our remarks to the moving picture as it actually -isaia- . In this second part We should like to speak of the moving picture as it ought to be i . First of all a premise : can one talk of an ideal moving picture ? That -isaia- called ideal which lacks nothing of what_-isaia- proper to it , and which possesses to a perfect degree what_-isaia- due . In this_sense can there be an ideal film ? Some deny that an absolute ideal can exist ; in other_words , they affirm that the ideal -isaia- a relative concept , meaning something only_for a definite person or thing . This difference of opinion -isaia- caused in great measure by the different criteria used in distinguishing essential elements from the accidental . Actually , notwithstanding the affirmation of relativity , the ideal will_always be found in something absolute , which_-isaia- verified in every case , though in the midst of multiple and diverse secondary elements , which_are demanded by their relation to a definite case . With this as a premise , We think the ideal film must be considered under three aspects : in relation to the subject , i . , the spectator to whom it -isaia-_directed ; in relation to the object , i . , the content of the film ; in relation to the community , upon which , as We have_already noted , it exercises a particular influence . Since We wish to dwell -atti_degli_apostoli- some length on this important matter , today We will limit Ourselves to a treatment of the first heading , and leave the second and third to another Audience , if the opportunity arises . THE IDEAL FILM CONSIDEREDIN RELATION TO THE SPECTATOR a The first quality which in this_regard should mark the ideal film -isaia- respect_for man . For there_-isaia- indeed no motive whereby it can be excepted from the general norm which demands_that he who deals with men fully respect man . However much differences of age , condition and sex may suggest a difference in conduct and bearing , man_-isaia- always man , with the dignity and nobility bestowed on him by the Creator , in Whose image_and_likeness he was_made Gen . In man there_-isaia- a spiritual and immortal soul ! There -isaia- the universe in miniature , with its multiplicity and variety of form , and the marvellous order of all its parts ; there_-isaia- thought and will , with a vast field in which to operate ; there_-isaia- emotional life , with its heights and depths ; there_-isaia- the world of the senses , with its numerous powers , perceptions and feelings ; there_-isaia- the body , formed even to its minutest parts according to a teleology not_yet fully grasped . Man has been_made lord in this universe ; he must freely direct his actions in accordance_with_the laws of truth , goodness and beauty , as they_are manifested in Nature , his social relations with_his fellow men and Divine revelation . Since the moving picture , as has_been noted , can incline the soul of the viewer to good or to evil , We will call ideal only that film which not_only does_not offend what We have just described , but treats it respectfully . Even that -isaia-_not_enough ! Rather We should say : that_which strengthens and uplifts man in the consciousness of his dignity , that_which increases his knowledge and love of the lofty natural position conferred on him by his Creator ; that_which tells him it -isaia- possible_for him to increase the gifts of energy and virtue he disposes of within himself ; that_which strengthens his conviction_that he can overcome obstacles and avoid erroneous solutions , that he can rise after every fall and return to the right path , that he can , in short , go from good to better through the use of his freedom and his faculties . b Such a moving picture would already contain the basic element of an ideal film ; but more still can be attributed to it , if to respect_for man_-isaia- added loving understanding . Recall the touching phrase of Our Lord : '' I have pity on this people '' Mark , , . Human life here below has its high points and low , its rises and falls , it moves amidst virtue and vice , amidst conflicts , difficulties and compromises ; it knows victory and defeat . Each man experiences all that , in his_own way , and according_to_his own interior and exterior circumstances and different ages , which , river like , bear him from mountain uplands through wooded hills down to broad plains baked by the sun . Thus vary the conditions of man s movement and struggle : in the babe , as the first glimmerings of consciousness stir ; in the child , as he enters into full use and control of his reason ; in the youth , during the years of development , when great storms alternate with periods of marvellous sunshine ; in the adult , frequently so completely absorbed in the struggle for existence , with its inevitable shocks ; in the aged person , who turns back to view the past with regret , nostalgia , repentance , and examines himself and ponders events as only he can who_has sailed afar . The ideal moving picture must show the spectator that it knows , understands and values properly all these_things ; but it must speak to the child in language suited to a child , to youth in way fitted to it , to the adult as he expects to be spoken to , i . , using his_own manner of seeing and understanding things . But a general understanding of man -isaia-_not_enough , when_the film -isaia- intended for a given profession or class ; a more special understanding of the particular conditions of various classes of society_-isaia- also needed . The moving picture must give to him_who sees and hears a sense of reality , but of a reality seen through the eyes of one_who knows more_than he , and handled with the will of one_who stands beside the spectator to help and comfort him , if necessary . With this_spirit the reality reproduced by the film -isaia- presented artistically , for it -isaia- proper to the artist that he does_not reproduce reality in a mechanical way , nor_does he subordinate himself to the merely technical capacities of his tools ; rather in using them he elevates and dominates matter , without changing it or removing it from reality . An excellent example can be seen in the enchanting parables of Holy Scripture : their subject matter -isaia- taken from the daily_life and tasks of the hearers , with a fidelity We might call photographic , but_it_-isaia- mastered and raised in such wise that real and ideal are fused in perfect art form . c To respect and understanding ought to be added the fulfilment of the promises held out and the satisfaction of the desires aroused perhaps from the beginning . Moreover , in general , the millions of people_who flock to the cinema are driven there by a vague hope of finding the contentment of their secret and undefined desires , of their inner longings ; in the dryness of their_own life , they take refuge in the cinema , as with a magician who_can transform all -atti_degli_apostoli- the touch of his wand . The ideal film , therefore , ought to know_how to respond to this expectation , and bring to it , not any_kind of satisfaction but_one which_-isaia- complete : not indeed , of all desires , even false and unreasonable the unjust and the amoral do not come into the question here , but of those_which the spectator nourishes quite legitimately . Under one form or another , the expectations are , -atti_degli_apostoli- one time , relief , -atti_degli_apostoli- another , instruction , or joy , or encouragement , or stimulus ; some are deep , others superficial . The film answers now to one , now to another demand , or else it will_give an answer which_can satisfy several of them -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time . Leaving however to your judgement as specialists what belongs to the technical aesthetic aspect , We prefer to turn Our attention to the psychico personal element , to draw from it too , the assurance that in spite of relativity there always remains that irresolvable absolute which dictates the principles for granting or denying the answer to the demands of the spectator . To form an idea of the question , there_-isaia- no need to turn to a consideration of the principles of filmology or of psychology , which_have held Our attention thus far ; it -isaia- sufficient to let oneself be guided in this also , by sound common sense . In the normal human_being , indeed , there_-isaia-_also a psychology , so to speak , not learnt from books , but derived_from his_very nature , which puts him on the path to directing himself aright in the ordinary things of everyday life , provided he follows his sound powers of reasoning , his sense of reality , and the guidance of his experience ; but , above all , provided_that the emotional element in him -isaia- controlled and directed , for , in the end , what determines a human_person to judge and act -isaia-_his own emotional disposition . On the basis of this simple psychology , it -isaia- clear_that the man_who goes to see a serious instructional film has a right to the teaching it promises ; he who goes to an historical film , wishes to find presented the actual facts , even_though technical and artistic needs modify and elaborate the form in which_they_are presented ; he who_was promised the picture of a story or a novel , ought not to go away from it disappointed -atti_degli_apostoli- not having seen the unfolding of its plot . But there_-isaia- , on the other_hand , the man_who , weary of the monotony of his_life or weakened by his struggles , looks primarily to the film for relief , forgetfulness , relaxation ; perhaps also_for flight into a dream world . Are these legitimate demands ? Can the ideal film adapt itself to these expectations and seek to satisfy them ? Modern man it -isaia- asserted in the evening of his crowded or monotonous day , feels the need to alter the circumstances of people and places ; so he desires entertainments which , with the multiplicity of images , linked it -isaia- true by a slight guiding thread , can calm the spirit even if they remain on the surface and do not penetrate very deeply , provided_that they bring relief to his depressing state of weariness and banish his boredom . It -isaia- possible that_this may be so even frequently . In that case , the film can seek to meet such a condition in an ideal form , avoiding , of course , any lapse into vulgarity or unseemly sensationalism . It -isaia- not to be denied that_even a somewhat superficial entertainment can rise to high artistic levels , and be classed even as ideal , since man_has shallows as well as depths . Dull , however , -isaia- the man who_-isaia- entirely superficial , and -isaia- unable to add depth to his thoughts and feelings . Doubtless , the ideal film -isaia- allowed to lead the weary and jaded spirit to the thresholds of the world of illusion , so that_it_may enjoy a brief respite from the pressure of real existence . However , it should_take care not to clothe the illusion with_such a form that_it_-isaia- taken for reality by minds which_are weak and without sufficient experience . The film , indeed , which_leads from reality to illusion , ought then in some_way to lead back from illusion to reality with the same gentleness that Nature employs in sleep . That also attracts man , wearied by reality , and plunges him for a short time into the illusory world of dreams : but , after sleep , it restores him refreshed , and as it were , renewed , to the bustle of reality , the reality he -isaia- used to , in which he lives , and of which , by his_work and his struggle , he must_always remain master . Let the film follow Nature in this : it will then have fulfilled a notable part of its function . d But the ideal film , considered in reference to the spectator , has , finally , a lofty and positive mission to accomplish . Respect for and understanding of the spectator in responding to his legitimate expectations and just desires are not_enough for appraising a film . It must_also measure up to duty which_-isaia- inherent in the nature of the human_person , and in particular , of the human spirit . From the moment when his reason -isaia- awakened until it -isaia- extinguished , man_has an image of each single duty to fulfil , -atti_degli_apostoli- the base of which , as the foundation of all , lies that of disposing of himself rightly , that_-isaia- to say , in accordance_with bright thought and sentiment , understanding and conscience . The essential directing principle to such an end man derives from the consideration of his_own nature , from others teaching , from God s word to men . To detach him from this principle would mean to make him incapable of carrying_out his essential mission to its conclusion , just as it would paralyse him if one were to cut the tendons and ligaments that join together and support the limbs and parts of his_body . An ideal film , then , has truly the high office of putting the great possibilities and power of influence , which we already recognise in the craft of the Cinema , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of man , and of being an aid to him in maintaining and rendering effective his self expression in the path of right and goodness . It -isaia- no secret that for_this , outstanding artistic gifts are necessary in the director , since everyone knows that_there_-isaia- no difficulty -atti_degli_apostoli- all in producing seductive films , by making them accomplices of the lower instincts and passions which overthrow man , luring him from the precepts of his sane thinking and better will . The temptation of the easy path -isaia- great , all the more so as the film the poet would call it '' galley slave '' can easily fill halls and coffers , evoke frenzied applause , and assemble in the columns of some newspapers reviews which_are too subservient and favourable . But all this_has nothing in common with the accomplishment of an ideal duty . It -isaia- , in reality , decadence and degradation ; above all , it -isaia- the refusal to rise to worthy ideals . The ideal film , on the other_hand , intends to use every power to serve them , even_though this_means refusal to serve unscrupulous buyers . It does_not make an empty show of moralizing , but more_than makes up for_this lack by positive work_which , as circumstances demand , instructs , delights , diffuses genuine and noble joy and pleasure , and cuts off every approach to boredom . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once light and profound , imaginative and real . In a word , it knows how to lead without interruption or shocks to the bright realms of art and enjoyment , in such a manner that the spectator , -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion , leaves the hall , more light hearted , relaxed , and better within himself , than he entered . If -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment , he were to meet_the producer or the director of the writer , he would_not fail , perhaps , to take him in a friendly embrace in a burst of admiration and thanks , as We personally , in a fatherly manner , would thank them in the name of so many persons changed for the better . We have outlined , gentlemen , an ideal without concealing the difficulty of its attainment ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , We express confidence in your outstanding ability and your good_will . To bring into existence the ideal film -isaia- a privilege of artists gifted beyond_the ordinary ; certainly , it -isaia- an exalted goal toward which , fundamentally , your ability and your vocation summon you . God grant that all who_are capable of it may assist you ! That these wishes of Ours may find fulfilment in this important branch of activity , so near to the realms of the spirit , We call down on you and on your families , on the artists and groups of workers of the world of the Cinema , God s blessing , in token of which_may Our paternal Apostolic Benediction descend upon you all . II TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF CINEMA THEATRE MANAGERS AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF FILM DISTRIBUTORS Audience of th October , THE IDEAL FILM A POWERFUL MEANS OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT , EDUCATION AND IMPROVEMENT Gentlemen , in extending once_more with a Father s tenderness Our welcome to you , who devote your lives to the cinema industry , We desire to confirm not_only Our esteem_for you as individuals and for your profession , but_also the Church s watchful care over a means as important_for the spread of opinion and custom as -isaia- the Cinema , in order to help raise it to the dignity of an instrument devoted to God s glory and man s full development . In reverting , therefore , to this_matter in this_new meeting with the representatives of '' the World of the Cinema '' , We propose , moved by the conviction of their importance , to complete the points We previously set_out , the motives of which We then indicated -atti_degli_apostoli- some length . To some , faced_with the grave problems which harass the present age , and which certainly invite Our most earnest solicitude , this_question of the Cinema might appear a subject of minor importance , and one not deserving the special_attention which We pay to it . Certainly it seems that the Cinema , being by its_nature an art and a diversion , ought to remain confined , as it were , to the fringe of life , governed , of course , by the common laws which regulate ordinary human activities ; but since , in fact , it has become for the present generation a spiritual and moral problem of enormous importance , it cannot be passed over by those_who_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the fate of the greater part of mankind and of its future . Above all , then , it cannot be neglected by the Church and Her Bishops , from whose watchfulness no moral question should be withdrawn , particularly if it reacts with consequences beyond calculation on countless souls , and in addition , by all upright men thoughtful for the common_good , who_are rightly persuaded that every_human problem , great or small , goes down to the roots of the spirit more_or_less in darkness , and that in the spirit , once given light , it -isaia- duly solved . It will perhaps redound to the disgrace of our_age that_many , particularly if their_spiritual formation_-isaia- weak , are allowing themselves to be brought to adopting behaviour in their private and public lives , which_-isaia- determined by the artistic fictions and the unsubstantial shadows of the screen ; yet this_fact does not_cease to be important and worthy of serious consideration proportionate to its effects . In a tomorrow of spiritual and civic decadence , for_which the undisciplined liberty of the film would share responsibility , what a reproof would rise therefrom against the wisdom of the men of today , as men_who did_not know_how to direct an instrument so suited to the education and development of souls , and instead left it to be turned into a vehicle of evil . This confidence which We have in the Cinema as an effective and positive instrument of mental development , education and improvement , moves Us to exhort the makers and producers to spare no effort to free it not_only from artistic decadence , but particularly from any share in a lowering of morals , and to present to them in perspective the unsullied regions of the ideal film . Of this We previously set_out the essential characteristics , but_only in the first of the three aspects which it offers for examination , namely , in relation to the subject , that_-isaia- to say , to the man to whom_the ideal film -isaia- presented . Now We pass on to explain the second point , viz . THE IDEAL FILM CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE OBJECT , OR TO ITS CONTENT In tracing the lines of the ideal film with_respect to its content , in order to avoid over stepping the limits with unsuitable demands , and so that the essential elements may be gathered together , it -isaia- necessary to keep present_the consideration already set_forth on the absolute nucleus contained within_the relativity of the ideal , i . the real essence of the film , its specific goodness , its_proper worth . So it -isaia- to the point to recall to mind the concept of the ideal , viz . that_which lacks nothing of what it ought to have , but_which , on the contrary , possesses this to a perfect degree . In so far as the film has reference to man , it will be ideal in content to the extent_that , in perfect and harmonious form , it measures up to the original and essential demands of man_himself . Basically , these demands are three : truth , goodness , beauty refractions , as it were , across the prism of consciousness , of the boundless realm of being , which extends beyond man , in whom_they actuate an ever_more extensive participation in Being itself . It -isaia- true_that , in individual cases , he who devotes himself , through art and culture , to provide man with a share in this realm , becomes aware in the end of having very inadequately satisfied his insatiable thirst ; yet there remains to him the merit of having known how to divert to his advantage part of the stream of the original fullness of truth , goodness and beauty , in the measure of the possible and free_from contamination : in other_words , he has reconciled the relativity of the ideal with its absolute concept . Well then , can the film be a suitable vehicle for_this triad in the mind of the spectator ? Can an excellent means come therefrom , and within_the limits of its_own proper method one which_-isaia- also perfect ? The reply ought to be in the affirmative , even_though it -isaia- not_always verified even , in the case of a film worthy to be classified as good , but_which , by defect of some one of the elements and of the harmony between these , remains outside the ideal region . It -isaia- clear_that the content , or rather the choice of the plot , such as comes_from looking with all possible fidelity -atti_degli_apostoli- reality in its goodness and beauty , -isaia- of fundamental importance in the creation of the ideal film ; but_it_-isaia- equally recognised by the specialists that_not every choice -isaia- possible , since not rarely obstacles of an entirely practical nature interfere , which check the film maker on the threshold of the ideal , as , for example , the intrinsic impossibility of giving a visible representation to some truths , goodness or beauty . The film cannot presume , nor_should it run the risk of challenging plots which escape the control of the objective , which_cannot be reduced to images , being rebels , as it were , to scenic representation , for reasons either technical or artistic , or because of other considerations , such as reasons of social or natural delicacy , of respect or of piety , or even of prudence and the safeguarding of human_life . Yet , in spite of these limitations , some intrinsic , others practical , the range of plots remains wide , rich , rewarding and attractive , no matter what may be the element of the triad which predominates in the individual film . INSTRUCTIONAL FILMS Taking each point in turn , we shall name first the film which sets instruction as its end , of which_the principal attraction -isaia- founded on truth , in so far as it increases the acquired knowledge of the spectator . There -isaia- undoubtedly in this type a possible ideal to follow and its principles can be summarised thus : what it offers in information , explanation , depth , ought to be accurate , clearly intelligible , carried_out by a perfect teaching method and artistic forms of a high order Films solely for instructional purposes are relatively rare ; more usually , perhaps out of regard_for the varying background of the public , instead of deepening the subject matter , they weaken it and limit themselves to giving the essential notions . And yet , if one takes account of the thirst_for learning which_the public shows and of the lack of which_there -isaia-_often complaint , this_kind of film , provided it -isaia- executed with ideal perfection , would be well received by all , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time if duly developed and extended would prove to be beneficial to civil progress . The proof -isaia- given by the frequent production and the success of films based on the natural sciences , some of which deserve the title of ideal film . Nature , which offers itself to the inspection of the attentive observer , reveals an inexhaustible wealth of goodness and beauty , reflecting back with transparent sincerity the infinite superabundance of the perfection and beauty of nature s Creator . The film can yield an abundant harvest in its three fold realm , and can traverse , using the technical means -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal , the harmonious paths of creation , opened by the physical and biological sciences , whether in the heaven s immensity or in the intimate secret places of the world of the microscope . It -isaia- not_without emotions of wonder that one_-isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- films which carry one into worlds unknown and sometimes unsuspected , which no other means can represent more vividly than does the cinema . Sometimes one_-isaia- enchanted and overcome by the majesty of towering mountains , -atti_degli_apostoli- other times by the irresistible fury of the ocean tempest , the solitude of polar glaciers , the vast stretch of virgin forests , the melancholy of the desert sands , the loveliness of flowers , the limpid quality of water , the violent rush of waterfalls , the distinctive beauty of the Northern Lights , visions all , which , reproduced with fidelity , and accompanied by a restrained commentary of words and music , impress themselves on the mind like the pictures of a journey . Greater astonishment and wealth of knowledge are offered by the unfolding of life in the films and these_are not infrequent which reveal the secrets of the animal kingdom , and are obtained by expert photographers and producers after exhausting days and months lying in wait and observing , carried_out in uncomfortable conditions in forests and in inhospitable deserts , on rivers and in the depths of the sea . What a testimony to the richness and manifold variety of nature , no less_than to other activities , -isaia- drawn_from such films , to soothe , recreate and refresh the spirit . With equal pleasure and instruction , other films can look carefully -atti_degli_apostoli- man_himself , in whom_the organic structure , the functional behaviour and the therapeutic and surgical processes for restoring him to health , offer objects of deep interest . If then one passes to the works of man , subjects suitable to being artistically elaborated and for the spreading of learning on a large scale , are equally plentiful . Those films are appropriately called educational which describe the different races , customs , folklore , civilizations , and , more in detail , the methods of work , the agricultural systems , the traffic routes by land , sea and air , means of communication , types of houses and residences in different ages , gathered from the objects in many stages of their development , which includes the movements from the primitive huts of leaves and branches and goes on to the stately dwellings , the architectural monuments , the lofty skyscrapers of modern cities . These indications are enough to show that the instructional film , provided it -isaia- treated according to the exact range of scientific data , presented in a new light and enlivened by a fresh breath of art sufficient to drive away the idea of a rigorously scholastic instruction , can , with_respect to the content , offer with ease to the spectator , all that he expects from an ideal film in this class . ACTION FILMS On the other_hand , it -isaia- difficult to present_the end proposed in action films that_-isaia- to say films , which represent and interpret the life and behaviour of men , their passions , longings and conflicts . In this_kind of subject matter , the ideal film -isaia- no everyday affair ; and yet such films are numerous , and by far the most common . While that shows_that a similar type -isaia- much in request and appreciated by the public , it -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time demonstrates the serious difficulties with_which_the ideal film -isaia- confronted in actual production . We showed previously speaking of the importance of the Cinema and studying the matter from the point_of_view of the spectator in what consists the attraction of the plot films , what influences are exerted on the mind and what psychological reactions are thereby produced . The same considerations now return for review , dealt_with , however , in their causes , the first of which_-isaia- certainly the content or the matter which_-isaia- chosen for treatment . Now it -isaia- precisely in the choice of content that the difficulties begin for the author or conscientious producer who puts before himself_the ideal film ; some of them come almost immediately from the shaping and the fixing of the limits of the matter itself , especially in the most important moments ; others again , and these sometimes insuperable , from the availability of the actors who_would be capable of giving humanly and aesthetically perfect expression to the chosen subject . Is it possible , then , for_every matter capable of representation to be accepted by one_who sets before himself_the ideal film ? Some reasons for exclusions have already_been indicated : they_are based on moral , social , human considerations which of necessity restrict absolute freedom of choice . Two particular questions , however , deserve to be treated with_greater care . FILMS ON A RELIGIOUS SUBJECT The first : in the plot films , -isaia- it permitted to take religious topics as subject matter of plot films ? The answer -isaia- that_there seems no reason_why such topics should be , in general and on principle , excluded ; the more so , since experience , tested in this type , has_already given some good results in films whose content -isaia- strictly religious . But further , when_the theme -isaia- not expressly such , the ideal plot film should_not pass over the religious element . Indeed , it has_been noted_that even films morally above reproach can yet be spiritually harmful if they offer the spectator a world in which no sign -isaia- given of God or of men who_believe in and worship Him , a world in which people live as though God did not_exist . A brief moment in a film can sometimes be sufficient , a word on God , a thought directed towards Him , a sigh of confidence in Him , an appeal for divine help . The great majority of people believe in God , and in their_lives religious feeling plays a considerable part . Nothing , then , -isaia- more natural and more suitable than for due account to be taken of this in films . On the other_hand , we must recognise that_not every religious action or occurrence can be transferred to the screen , because either a scenic representation of it -isaia- intrinsically impossible , or piety and reverence are opposed to it . Moreover , religious topics often present particular difficulties to authors and actors , among which perhaps the chief -isaia- how to avoid all trace of artificiality and affectation , every impression of a lesson learnt mechanically since true religious feeling -isaia- essentially the opposite of external show , and does_not easily allow itself to be '' declaimed '' . Religious interpretation , even when_it_-isaia- carried_out with a right intention , rarely receives the stamp of an experience truly lived and as a result , capable of being shared with the spectator . Another question to which_it_-isaia- difficult to give a definitive answer -isaia- whether the portrayal side by side of different_forms of religious belief -isaia- a suitable or opportune topic for a plot film . Examples of such films are_not lacking , produced with the purpose of representing the various types of religiousness , derived either from real actions or from scenes portrayed with_that end in view . In every case , whether films of an instructive nature are handled , or the intention -isaia- to offer the spectators the drama of struggle between two lives religiously different in their orientation , there_-isaia- need of considerable finesse and depth of religious sentiment and human tact , in order not to offend and profane what men hold sacred even_though they be motivated by objectively erroneous thoughts and feelings . The same precautions and needed limitations are imposed in historical films which treat of men and events -atti_degli_apostoli- the core of which_are religious quarrels not_yet completely calmed : the prime requisite here -isaia- truth , which however must be united with charity in such_a_way_that one does_not suffer -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the other . FILMS AND REPRESENTATION OF EVIL The second question about the content of the ideal film of action concerns the representation of evil : -isaia- it lawful to choose , and with what precautions must one treat , evil and scandal , which without_doubt have such an important part in the lives of men ? Surely human_life would_not be understood , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in its great and momentous conflicts , if our_eyes were closed to the faults which often cause these conflicts . Pride , unbounded ambition , lust for power , covetousness , infidelity , injustice , depravity such , unhappily , are the marks of the characters and actions of many , and history -isaia- bitterly interwoven with_them . But it -isaia- one_thing to know evil , and to seek from philosophy and religion its explanation and cure ; quite another to make it an object of spectacle and amusement . Yet for_many there_-isaia- an irresistible fascination in giving artistic shape to wrongdoing , in describing its power and its growth , its open and hidden paths , and the conflicts it generates or by means of which it advances . One might say that_for a basis of story and picture many know not where to look for artistic inspiration and dramatic interest except in the realm of evil , even if only as background for good , as shadow from which light may reflect more_clearly . To this psychological attitude of many artists corresponds an analogous one in the spectators , about which We have spoken previously . Now then , can the ideal film take such matter for its theme ? The greatest poets and writers of all times and of all peoples have grappled with this hard and thorny theme , and will_continue to do so in the future . To such a question a negative answer -isaia- natural , whenever perversity and evil are presented for their_own sakes ; if the wrongdoing represented -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- least in fact , approved ; if it -isaia- described in stimulating , insidious or corrupting ways ; if it -isaia- shown to those_who_are not capable of controlling and resisting it . But when none of these causes for exclusion are present ; when_the struggle with evil , and even its temporary victory , serves , in relation to the whole , to a deeper_understanding of life and its_proper ordering , of self control , of enlightenment and strengthening of judgement and action ; then such matter can be chosen and inserted , as a part of the whole action of the film . The same criterion applies here that_must rule any like artistic medium : novel , drama , tragedy , every literary work . Even the Sacred Books of the Old and New Testaments , faithful mirrors of real life , contain in their pages stories of evil , of its action and influence in the lives of individuals , as well as in families , and peoples . They too allow a glimpse of the intimate and frequently tumultuous world of those men , telling of their failures , their rise , or their final end . Though strictly historical , the narrative frequently has the pace of fine drama , the dark colouring of tragedy . The reader -isaia- struck by the unusual artistic and liveliness of descriptions , which even from the merely psychological point_of_view , are superb masterpieces . It -isaia- enough to recall_the names of Judas , Caiphas , Pilate , Peter , Saul . Or from the age of the Patriarchs : the story of Jacob , the events of Joseph s life in Egypt , in the house of Potiphar ; from the Book of Kings : the choice , the rejection , the tragic end of King Saul ; or the fall of David and his repentance ; the rebellion and death of Absalom and numberless other happenings . Their wrongdoing and guilt are_not masked by deceitful veils , but told as they really happened ; nay , even that part of a world stained by guilt -isaia- enveloped in an aura of uprightness and purity , produced by an author , who , while faithful to history , does_not exalt or justify , but clearly urges the condemnation of wickedness ; in such wise the crude truth does_not arouse disordered passions or impulses , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in mature persons . On the contrary : the serious reader becomes more reflective , more clear sighted , his mind , turning inwards , -isaia- led to say '' take heed lest you too be led into temptation '' cf . , '' if you stand take heed lest you fall '' cf . Such conclusions are_not suggested only by Holy Scripture , but are a legacy of ancient wisdom and the fruit of bitter experience . Let Us leave , then , the topic that an ideal film can_also represent evil , sin and corruption ; but let it do so with serious intent and in becoming manner , in such_a_way_that its vision may help deepen knowledge of life and of man , and improve and elevate the soul . Therefore the ideal film should flee from any form of apology , much less of glorification , of evil , and should show its condemnation through the entire course of the film and not merely -atti_degli_apostoli- the end ; frequently it would come too late , i . after_the spectator -isaia-_already beguiled and entrapped by evil promptings . Such are the points We wished to expound to you on the ideal film in relation to its object , i . There remains only_for Us to add a brief word concerning the ideal film in relation to the Community . THE IDEAL FILM SEEN AND CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE COMMUNITY When , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this discourse , We remarked that the film producer , in a short span of years , has practically given our century its characteristic mark , We implicitly affirmed the existence of a relationship_between him and the community . From this immense influence on the community and on the common_good , We drew strong arguments to stress the importance of films , and the duty of the community to exercise a lawful watch over their moral quality . Now it -isaia- time to consider_the relation between films and the community itself , in whatever they_have that_-isaia- positive , or , as -isaia- more commonly said , constructive ; this in conformity to Our purpose , which_-isaia-_not to make empty accusations , but to bring_the cinema to become an ever_more fit tool for the common_good . What can an ideal film offer of value to the family , the State , the Church ? a The family The family . In subdividing Our discussion , let Us give first_place to the family , also because_it_-isaia- often called on to assist -atti_degli_apostoli- showings of films from which , however , it does not_always return with its high and sacred dignity unsullied . The family was , -isaia- , and will remain the source and channel of the human_race and of mankind . Masterpiece of the Creator s supreme wisdom and goodness , from Him has it received_the laws , the prerogatives , the duties which open for it the road towards_the fulfillment of its_own high destiny . Based on love and for love , the family can and should be for its_members : spouses , parents , children , their_own small world , refuge , oasis , earthly paradise in the fullest measure attainable here below . Thus it will be in reality , if it -isaia- allowed to be what_the Creator willed , what_the Saviour confirmed and sanctified . Meanwhile , much more_than in the past , today s confusion of mind , as , also , the not infrequent scandals , have induced not_a_few to belittle the vast treasury of good the family can dispense : hence its praises may easily be listened to with a smile tinged with scepticism and irony . A useful study would be to examine the degree to which some films have helped spread such an attitude , or whether_they merely servilely adopt that outlook to satisfy such desires , if only_with fictions . Surely it -isaia- deplorable that_some films are in agreement with the irony and scepticism directed -atti_degli_apostoli- the traditional institution of the family , by exalting its erroneous conditions , and especially casting empty and frivolous disdain on the dignity of spouses and parents . But what other human good would remain for_man on earth if the family , as ordained by God , were destroyed ? It -isaia- , therefore , a lofty and delicate task to restore to men an esteem_for and trust in the family . The motion picture which_every day shows such_great interest in and efficacy with_regard to this_point , should consider as its_own that task , and perform it , portraying and spreading a concept of the family which_-isaia- naturally correct and humanly noble , describing the happiness of spouses , parents and children , the great worth of being united by the bonds of love in repose and in struggle , in joy and in sacrifice . All that_can be gotten without many words , but_with fit pictures and by developing attractive situations : now , of a man , endowed_with a strong character , who_does his duty , who dares and struggles , who knows also how to endure and wait , how to act manfully and firmly , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time maintain and prove an unshakeable fidelity , sincere conjugal love and the constant solicitude of a father ; again , of a woman , in the worthiest and noblest sense of the word , wife and mother of stainless conduct , open minded , capable within and without_the family , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time devoted to home and its intimacy , because_she knows how to find there all her happiness ; and again , of children , respectful to their_parents , earnest in their ideals , serious in searching for the better things , always lively and jovial , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time obliging , generous , intrepid . An action film , which translates all that by lively and interesting plots , by perfect art forms , such as experts are_not incapable of producing , would be , in what concerns the good of the community , an ideal film in the full and true meaning of the term . b The State Let Us briefly study the ideal film in its relationship_with the State . It -isaia- helpful to agree on the meaning of this word , and determine that here there_-isaia- question of deciding how the film , which more_or_less expressly concerns itself with subjects treating the political community , can play a part in attaining the good of that community . We prescind , therefore , in Our remarks from the so called political films , those of parties , classes and such , which_are propagandistic in purpose , or even foment struggle , and serve a given political aim , a party , a class , a system . At the bottom of all these exists the natural institution of the State , whose concept -isaia- distinct from the various_forms which in the concrete express its development ; forms which come and go , which change , which often are repeated -atti_degli_apostoli- intervals in the course of history , along_with the modifications and adjustments brought_about by new conditions . The State , however , -isaia- something stable and necessary in its_nature and essence ; it remains , despite the vicissitudes of its concrete variable forms . To this essence , which_-isaia- good in itself and a source of good for_every member of the community , We now turn Our thoughts . The State -isaia- of natural origin , no less_than the family ; this means_that in its essence it -isaia- an institution willed and given by the Creator . The same holds for its necessary elements , such as power and authority , which flow from nature and from God . Man , indeed , -isaia- inclined by nature , and hence by God , to unite in society , to collaborate for his fulfillment through a mutual exchange of good deeds , to organize a social body in accordance_with_the variety of individual aptitudes and actions , to strive for a common goal , which consists in the realization and preservation of the true common_good through the harmonising of individual activity . Men , therefore , are obliged to acknowledge , accept and respect the State , its authority , its right to direct the common_good as its_proper end . Yet , because in this_field also , the confusion of minds frequently begets hindrances or even repugnances , it will_always be to the point to lead the minds_of_men to strengthen the true bases of social_life . The film producer can_give important help in this_matter , too , though it -isaia- not his_first and most important task . Still , with_that effectiveness peculiar to it , his activity can usefully enter to block divisive tendencies , to remind men of whatever good has_been neglected , lead_them to esteem correctly what_has_been falsely valued . That can be done when state institutions or activities , such as the provisions of legislation , of administration , of justice , are touched on and are aptly portrayed , as nature has designed them and in accordance_with her norms . Using the artistic resources -atti_degli_apostoli- their command , capable authors and producers , can , without stopping -atti_degli_apostoli- abstract teaching , easily show and bring before the spectator s attention what_-isaia- helpful to all , what truly protects and aids them in the community of the State , the reasons for exercising or not exercising State authority . Did We perhaps fail to point_out forcefully enough how profound -isaia- the influence of a well made film , and how_much it bends men s minds to what it intends ? Well then , an action film , such as the one described above , would calm and instruct the mind , would lessen selfish and harmful attitudes in the community , would spread a more firmly based awareness of the need_for cooperation , and larger ideas , helping men , in the interest of the public good , to rise above errors that otherwise might be inevitable and perhaps irremediable . Thus the cinema , without renouncing its_own characteristics or suffering any loss , can fulfill its role to the community s advantage , strengthen the sense of loyalty to the State , and promote its progress . Such a film would be far indeed from political films , those of party and class and even of a given country ; it could be everyone s film , because serving the fundamental nature of every State . Our development of the ideal film in its relation to the community would_not be complete without a word concerning its relation with the Church . c The Church Christ s Church , unlike the family and the State , does_not owe its origin to nature , but rests on the positive foundation of the Redeemer , Who has_entrusted to her His truth and grace , that_she may be the light and strength of men as they journey through earthly life towards_the heavenly country . Such a noble organism , which embraces a whole spiritual and supernatural world , completely escapes any artistic portrayal , since it transcends the very possibilities of human instruments of expression . Yet a basic awareness of her presence will assure for_her that respect and reverence she deserves . If it should happen as not infrequently occurs that a film deals with events in which_the subject of the Church enters with more_or_less importance , then the film should treat that subject according to truth and knowledge with religious tact , simplicity and decorum . For the rest , We have_already expressed Our thoughts when treating in general the choice of religious themes . Now We add only_one suggestion : if a film , especially an action film , wishes to be faithful to the ideal in whatever touches the Church of Christ , it should , besides being perfect in artistic form , be conceived and executed in a way_that inspires in the spectator understanding , respect , devotion to the Church , and joy and love in her_children , and a holy pride in belonging to her . It -isaia- not impossible that historical motives , demands of plot , or even sober realism make it necessary to present failures and defects of ecclesiastical persons , of their characters and perhaps also failures in the performance of their office ; in such cases , however , let_the distinction between institution and person , between person and office , be made clear to the spectator . For the Catholic , especially , that film will be ideal in which_the Church emerges radiant in her title of '' Holy Mother Church '' ; Holy Mother , in whom he trusts , to whom he clings , in whom he lives , from whom his_soul and innermost being draw human perfection and eternal happiness . That , Gentlemen , -isaia- what We wished to say to you about the cinema , to which_you have dedicated your activity , your talents , your daily labour . We would_like now to close Our discourse on the importance of the cinema and on its ideals by revealing to you Our deepest feelings . As We spoke , there came before Our mind the immense crowds of men_and_women , of youths and of children , to whom daily the film speaks its powerful language ; We gathered up their longings and hopes with love and fatherly solicitude . The majority of them who_are , in the depths of their_souls , good and sound , ask no more from the cinema than some reflection of the true , the good , the beautiful : in a word , a ray of God . You , too , listen to their plea , and answer their expectations , so that the image of God , stamped on their_souls , may always glow clear in the thoughts , the feelings , the deeds inspired by your art . With this wish , which_-isaia- also a new proof of the esteem and interest We have in your work , We call down on you the blessings of heaven , and as their pledge We give_you , from the depths of Our heart , Our Paternal Apostolic Blessing .

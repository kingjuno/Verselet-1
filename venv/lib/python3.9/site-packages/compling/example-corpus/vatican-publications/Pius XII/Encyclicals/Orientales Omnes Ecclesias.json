All the Eastern Churches , as history proves , have ever been_the object of the deep affection of the Roman pontiffs , who , grieving as deeply over their leaving the one fold and '' not for_any human motive , but impelled by divine charity and a desire_for the salvation of all , '' have again_and_again called_upon them to return speedily to the unity_which they_had unhappily abandoned . They were absolutely convinced_that if this union were happily restored the most fruitful consequences would result both_for the whole of Christendom and for the orientals in particular ; for the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ and all its_members cannot_but greatly benefit from the full and perfect unity of all Christians . In this connection it should be borne in mind_that the orientals need have no fear -atti_degli_apostoli- all of being compelled to abandon their lawful rites and customs if unity of faith and government -isaia- restored ; our_predecessors have more_than_once made this absolutely clear . '' Nor -isaia- there any reason_for you to fear on that account that we or any of our successors will ever diminish your rights , the privileges of your patriarchs , or the established ritual of any_one of your churches . The happy day has not_yet come on which , all the peoples of the East returning to the fold , we should be able to embrace them all with the affection of the father . Nonetheless we have_the happiness of seeing not_a_few of our sons from those countries ; these , since_they have recognized the Chair of Peter as the center of Catholic unity , persevere with the greatest tenacity in defending and strengthening this_same unity . Among them there_-isaia- special reason_why it pleases us to speak -atti_degli_apostoli- present of the Church of the Ruthenians ; not_only -isaia- it outstanding for the number of its_members and its zeal in retaining the faith , but_also this_-isaia- the three hundred and fiftieth year since it was happily restored to communion with the Apostolic See . It -isaia- , indeed , especially incumbent on those directly involved to celebrate this happy event in a spirit of gratitude , but we think it opportune also to recall it to the memory of all Catholics , so that_they_may ceaselessly give thanks to God for this_great blessing , and also may join with us in earnest prayer that He would mercifully ease and alleviate the present distress and apprehension of this beloved people , would protect its most_holy region , direct its constancy and preserve its faith unharmed . We think it will be useful if in this_letter we give a brief historical summary of the events with_which we are_concerned . It must be observed in the first_place that_even before the union of the Ruthenians with the Apostolic See was happily concluded -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome and confirmed -atti_degli_apostoli- Brest in and , these_people had more_than_once looked to the Roman Church as the one mother of the whole Christian community and dutifully paid it due obedience and reverence . Thus , for instance , the noble prince who_-isaia- reverenced by the numberless peoples of the Russian empire as the author and promoter of their conversion to the Christian faith , St . Vladimir , borrowed liturgical rites and sacred ceremonies from the Eastern Church ; but he not_only dutifully persevered in the unity of the Catholic Church , but_also took pains to establish friendly relations_between his nation and the Apostolic See . Not a few of his descendants also received_the legates of the Roman pontiffs with due honor and were fraternally united with_other Catholic communities , even after_the Church of Constantinople was separated by the lamentable schism . It follows_that the action of the metropolitan Isidore of Kiev and the Russians was in harmony_with_the most ancient tradition of the Ruthenian Church when , in , -atti_degli_apostoli- the ecumenical_council of Florence he signed the decree which solemnly united the Greek to the Latin Church . Nevertheless upon his return from the council , although he was joyfully welcomed -atti_degli_apostoli- Kiev , his titular see , shortly afterwards -atti_degli_apostoli- Moscow he was cast into prison and compelled to take to flight and leave the country . However , although it might well have_been totally blotted out on account of the sorry conditions of the period , the memory of this happy union of the Ruthenians with the Apostolic See was_not wholly lost with the passage of time . For example in Gregory Mammas , patriarch of Constantinople , in this_holy city , consecrated a certain Gregory as metropolitan of the Ruthenians , who_were then subject to the grand duke of Lithuania ; and again , more_than one of the successors of this metropolitan strove to restore the bond of unity with the Roman Church , although adverse circumstances did_not permit the solemn public promulgation of union . Towards the end of the sixteenth century , however , it became daily more obvious that_there was no hope of achieving the desired renewal and reform of the Ruthenian Church , which w as then borne down by grave abuses , except by restoring union with the Apostolic See . Even dissident historians describe and freely admit the wretched state this Church was then in . In the Ruthenian nobles , meeting together in Warsaw , asserted , in the course of a sharp and vivid exposition to the metropolitan of their grievances , that_their Church was plagued by greater evils than had ever previously existed or could ever be in the future . These nobles did not_hesitate to arraign the metropolitan himself , the bishops and the superiors of monasteries , bringing serious charges against them . The mere fact_that laymen should thus rise up against the hierarchy made it evident_that ecclesiastical discipline was_not a little relaxed . It -isaia- not surprising therefore that the bishops themselves , after vainly trying various remedies , concluded that the only hope_for the Ruthenian Church lay in bringing_about its return to Catholic unity . At that_time the most powerful man among the Ruthenians was prince Constantine Ostrozhsky and he was in favor of this return , but_only on condition that_the_whole Eastern Church should come to an agreement with the Western ; later , when he saw that the plan was_not going to be carried_out in the way he desired , he became a violent opponent of the restoration of unity . None the less , on nd December , the metropolitan and six bishops , after taking counsel together , published a joint declaration in which_they proclaimed themselves ready to promote agreement and the long desired union . We have come to this determination , they wrote , '' from the consideration , full of sadness for us , of how_great are the hindrances men find in the way of salvation in the absence of this union of the Churches of God . From the time of Christ our Savior and his holy apostles , as the canons and councils make clear , our_predecessors long continued in this union ; they acknowledged one supreme pastor and first bishop in the Church of God on earth , no other_than the holy pope of Rome , and obeyed him in all things . While this state of affairs remained in its vigor there_was ever order in the Church of God and increase of divine_worship . However , long and difficult negotiations were necessary before they could give effect to this praiseworthy determination . A new declaration of the same kind was first issued in the name of all the bishops on nd June , and -atti_degli_apostoli- length towards_the end of September such progress had been_made that Cyril Terletski , bishop of Lutsk , and Hypatius Pociei , bishop of Vladimir were able to set_out for Rome as representatives of all the rest of the bishops . They took with_them on this journey a document setting out the conditions on which all the Ruthenian bishops were ready to embrace the unity of the Church . Our predecessor Clement VIII received them very benevolently and committed the document they_had brought to a committee of cardinals for careful examination and approval . Discussions of the whole matter began -atti_degli_apostoli- once and finally reached the desired happy result . On rd December the emissaries were admitted to the presence of the supreme pontiff ; they read the declaration of all the bishops before the illustrious assembly and then in their_own name and that of the other bishops made a solemn profession_of_faith and promised due obedience and respect . On the same day our predecessor Clement VIII joyfully communicated the news of this happy event to the world by the Apostolic constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis . How great was_the joy and goodwill with_which_the Roman Church welcomed the Ruthenian people on their reception into the unity of the fold may be seen also from the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor , issued on th February , in which_the supreme pontiff informed the metropolitan and the other Ruthenian bishops of the happy establishment of the union of their whole Church with the Apostolic See . In this_letter the Roman pontiff briefly set_forth what had_been done in the matter -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome ; he gratefully extolled the work they_had by God s mercy -atti_degli_apostoli- length undertaken , and then decreed that the legitimate uses and rites of the Ruthenian Church could be preserved inviolate . '' In the same manner as the council of Florence permitted , we too permit you to retain your rites and ceremonies , which in no way injure the integrity of the Catholic faith or our union . '' He goes on to say that_he_has asked the king of Poland to extend the protection of his patronage to the bishops and all appertaining to them , and also to pay them the fullest honor and , as they desired , to admit them to the senate of the kingdom . Finally he fraternally exhorts the bishops to meet as soon as possible in a full provincial council to ratify and confirm the union of the Ruthenians with the Catholic Church . This council was held -atti_degli_apostoli- Brest . There were present , besides all the Ruthenian bishops , many_other ecclesiastics and representatives of the king , the Latin bishops of Lvov , Lutsk and Chelm as papal legates . The bishops of Lvov and Przemysl unhappily withdrew the consent they_had previously given , but in spite of this on th October the union of the Ruthenian community with the Catholic Church was happily confirmed and proclaimed . It was_the general hope_that this union and association , which answered so perfectly the needs of the Ruthenian people , would be abundantly fruitful of good . However , '' an enemy came and scattered tares among the wheat '' ; whether the cause was_the greed of some of the nobles , or political quarrels , or that the previous instruction and preparation of clergy_and_people in the matter had_been neglected , there followed sharp conflicts and protracted calamities , so that_there was cause to fear that the work so happily begun would be utterly destroyed . That this did_not befall -atti_degli_apostoli- the very outset on account of calumnies and dissensions , in which not_only the dissident brethren but_also some Catholics took part , was chiefly due to the metropolitans Hypatius Pociei and Joseph Velamin Rutsky . They were indefatigable in their_efforts to protect and promote the cause of the union ; in particular they brought it about_that priests and the members of monasteries should conform to ecclesiastical law and the requirements of good morals , and that all the faithful should be instructed in the virtuous ordinances of the true faith . This work of conciliation was consecrated not many years later by the blood of martyrdom . Josaphat Kuntzevitch , archbishop of Polotsk and Vitebsk , was famed for his_holiness of life and apostolic zeal , and was an intrepid champion of Catholic unity . He was hunted down with bitter hatred and murderous intent by the schismatics and on th November he was inhumanly wounded and slain with a halberd . But the hallowed blood of this martyr too became in a manner the seed of the Church , for all the parricides save one , repenting of their deed , renounced schism and execrated their crime before they_were put to death . It may also be attributed to the prayers of the holy martyr that Melety Smotritzky , who_had been_the bitter rival of Josaphat for possession of the see of Polotsk , returned to the Catholic faith in and , after a period of vacillation , for the rest of his_life stoutly defended the return of the Ruthenians to the Catholic Church . Nonetheless the difficulties of every_kind hindering reconciliation increased from year to year . The most serious of these was that the kings of Poland , who -atti_degli_apostoli- first were regarded as patrons and promoters of the scheme , were now compelled by the fear of their foreign foes and by domestic factions to make ever_greater concessions to those , and there_were not wanting some , who hated Catholic unity . The result was that in a short time , as the Ruthenian bishops themselves confessed , this_holy cause was left with no other protection to rely upon but_that of the Roman pontiffs . They for their_part supported the Ruthenian Church by affectionate letters , such helps as they could supply , and particularly by means of the Apostolic Nuncio in Poland . The sadder the times became , the more the prudence of the Ruthenian bishops was_made manifest ; they made every_effort to instruct the uncultivated populace in Christian doctrine , to raise the insufficiently instructed clergy to a higher degree of learning in sacred doctrine , and to imbue monks whose observance had become slack with a new zeal for discipline and spirit of holiness . They did_not lose heart even in , when a great part of the goods of the Church was handed over to the recently established hierarchy of the dissident brethren and when it was decreed in the treaty between_the Cossacks and the Polish king that the union of the Ruthenians with the Apostolic See was to be destroyed ; on the contrary , they continued with tenacious constancy to defend the flocks entrusted to them . But God does_not permit his_people to be tried by excessive affliction and -atti_degli_apostoli- length , after_the peace of Andrussovia in , he bade more peaceful days dawn for_this people after so many trials and perils . The peace thus obtained resulted daily in greater blessings for our holy religion . In fact Christian faith and Christian morals so flourished that in the two eparchies which in had unhappily remained separated_from unity opinion every_day grew more favorable to a return to the Catholic fold . Thus it happily came about_that in the eparchy of Przemysl , and in that of Lvov were united to the Apostolic See , and so , that almost the whole of the Ruthenian people then inhabiting Poland were in enjoyment of Catholic unity . All prospered more from day to day , to the great gain of Christianity , and so in the metropolitan and the rest of the bishops of the Ruthenian Church met in council -atti_degli_apostoli- Zamosc to provide to the best of their ability by common counsel for the growing needs of the faithful ; from the decrees of this council confirmed by our predecessor Benedict XIII in the Apostolic Constitution Apostolatus officium of th July no small benefit resulted to the Ruthenian community . However it came about by the inscrutable will of God that towards_the end of the century this community was harassed by many persecutions and vexations , and after_the partition of Poland these became ever harder and more bitter in the areas which_were annexed to the Russian Empire . After the death of Alexander I the rash policy was deliberately adopted of entirely breaking the union of the Ruthenians with the Roman Church . Already most of their eparchies had_been almost cut off from any intercourse with the Apostolic See . Soon bishops were chosen who_were imbued and inspired with zeal for schism , and so would become the lackeys and applauders of the civil_power . In the seminary of Vilna , founded by the tsar Alexander I , teaching hostile to the Roman pontiffs was imparted to the clergy of both rites . The Basilian Order , whose members had always_been a great support to the Catholic Church of the Eastern rite , was deprived of its_own government and administration , and its monks and monasteries were entirely subjected to the consistories of the eparchies . Then the priests of the Latin rite were prohibited under grave penalties from administering the sacraments or other religious helps to the Ruthenians . Finally , alas , in the union of the Ruthenian Church with the dissident Russian Church was solemnly proclaimed . It -isaia- impossible to describe the miseries , perils and hardships with_which_the most noble nation of the Ruthenians was afflicted -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , for no other crime or guilt but_that of crying out against the wrong done it and striving to retain its faith , when it had_been driven by force and fraud into schism . Justly and rightly , therefore , our predecessor Gregory XVI deplored and lamented this deed , and denounced its shamefulness to the whole Catholic world , in his allocution of nd November . But his solemn protest and reprobation went unheard ; the Catholic Church had to lament the tearing by iniquitous violence from her motherly embrace of these her sons . Moreover not many years later the eparchy of Chelm , belonging to the Polish kingdom united to Russia , suffered the same wretched fate . Those of the faithful_who would_not depart from the true faith , and dutifully and undauntedly resisted the union with the dissident Church imposed in , were shamefully punished with fines and flogging and exile . On the other_hand , during_this same period the Ruthenians enjoyed peace and tranquillity in the eparchies of Lvov and Przemysl , which_had_been united to the empire of Austria -atti_degli_apostoli- the partition of Poland . In the metropolitan title of Halicz was restored there and permanently attached to the archdiocese of Lvov . This province flourished so much that two of its metropolitans , Michael Levitsky and Sylvester Sembratovitch , who both displayed great prudence and zeal in their rule , were honored for their_personal qualities and notable merits with the Roman purple , and appointed to the supreme senate of the Church . Moreover , since_the number of Catholics was ever_increasing , our predecessor Leo XIII formally erected a new eparchy , that of Stanislavov in . Six years later the prosperity of the Galician Church was consolidated in an extraordinary manner when all the bishops with the legate of the supreme pontiff and many_other clergy met -atti_degli_apostoli- Lvov to hold there a provincial council and issue opportune liturgical and disciplinary regulations . At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century economic conditions led to the emigration of many Ruthenians from Galicia to the U . , Canada and South America . Our predecessor Pius X was therefore fearful that_these beloved_sons , not knowing the language of the place and unaccustomed to Latin rites , might be caught by the fallacies of heretics and schismatics , or might be ensnared by doubt and error and miserably abandon all religion . In , therefore , he appointed a bishop with_special faculties for them . Later on , since_the number and the needs of these Catholics were increasing , a special ordinary bishop was appointed for Galician Catholics in the U . , and another in Canada , besides the ordinary bishop for the faithful of this rite who_had emigrated from the Podkarpatska Rus , Hungary or Jugoslavia . Since then , both the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda and that of the Eastern Church have issued opportune and appropriate decrees regulating the ecclesiastical affairs of the Ruthenians in these jurisdictions and in the South American countries . It -isaia- not , therefore , surprising that the Catholic Ruthenian community has more_than_once desired , when opportunity offered , to give public expression to its gratitude for so many benefits and to its attachment to the Roman pontiffs . A notable instance occurred in , the third centenary of the happy union of their fathers with the Apostolic See achieved -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome and confirmed -atti_degli_apostoli- Brest . Not only was_the happy event recalled with appropriate celebrations in every_part of Galicia , but a most distinguished delegation of the metropolitan and bishops was sent to Rome to express the love of the Ruthenian Church for the chief bishop , the successor of St . Peter , and to offer him their respect , reverence and obedience . Receiving this delegation with due honors , our predecessor Leo XIII addressed them_with fatherly joy and benevolence , and he extolled the union of the Ruthenians with the Apostolic See as the salutary source of true light , unshakable peace and supernatural fruit to all those_who sincerely held fast to it . In our_own days the benefits which_the Roman pontiffs have bestowed on this beloved people_have been no less . Especially when_the first world war devastated those regions and during the following years they left nothing undone which_could bring any help or solace to the Ruthenian community . When the difficulties which oppressed this Catholic community had , by God s help , been overcome , it was seen to respond with a ready and active will to the indefatigable zeal of its bishops and the labor of the rest of the clergy , their fellow workers . Then , alas , came the second war and , as -isaia- well_known it was much_more grievous and harmful to the Ruthenian hierarchy and their faithful flock . But , before we proceed to a brief account of the present hardships and miseries which_this Church -isaia- suffering to the grave peril of its_very existence , we will add some fuller and clearer account of the great and high blessings brought to the Ruthenian Church and people by the union happily concluded three hundred and fifty years_ago . For indeed , after summarily and hastily outlining the history of this_most auspicious union and seeing its vicissitudes , sometimes happy , sometimes very sad , we are faced_with the question : what benefit was this union to the Ruthenian people and their Church ? What profit and advantage did they receive from this Apostolic See and the Roman pontiffs ? We shall be performing an opportune and useful service in duly answering this_question , especially because there_are not wanting some who hate and bitterly repudiate this union of Brest . In the first_place it must be noted_that our_predecessors have_always shown the greatest zeal in protecting and preserving the lawful rites of the Ruthenians . For when_the bishops , through the bishops of Vladimir and Lutsk who_were sent to Rome on this business , asked '' that His Holiness , for_himself and his_successors , who_were never to make any change in this_matter , would deign to preserve and confirm to the Eastern Church its administration of the sacraments , its rites and ceremonies , involate and entire , as in use -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the union . '' Clement VIII graciously acceded to their petition , and prescribed that no alteration was to be made in these_matters . Not even the use of the new Gregorian calendar was afterwards imposed on them , although it seemed -atti_degli_apostoli- first that the Ruthenians ought to employ it while retaining the liturgical calendar of the Eastern rite ; so that_even now the Julian calendar can remain in force among_them . Furthermore , our same predecessor by a letter of rd February conceded that the election of those_who had_been duly nominated as suffragan bishops of the Ruthenians should be confirmed by the metropolitan , as was proposed in the pact of reconciliation , and in accordance_with_the ancient discipline of the Eastern Church . Others of our_predecessors permitted the metropolitans to establish schools in any part of Russia and freely and lawfully to commit them to any directors and teachers they pleased . They also decreed that the Ruthenians should_not be -atti_degli_apostoli- a disadvantage compared with the rest of Catholics as regards the distribution of spiritual favors ; they wished them to share_with the rest of the faithful in all grants of indulgences , on condition that_they_should also fulfill the necessary conditions . Paul V extended to all those_who attended the schools established by the metropolitans the special spiritual privileges granted by the Roman pontiffs to members of the sodalities of the Blessed Virgin established in the churches of the Society of Jesus ; and Urban VIII granted to all who made retreats with the Basilian monks the same indulgences as had_been bestowed on the clerks regular of the Society of Jesus . From all this it -isaia- evident_that our_predecessors have_always shown the same fatherly love to the Ruthenians as to the Catholics of the Latin rite . They have_also considered it most important to defend the rights and privileges of their hierarchy . When many Latins asserted that the Ruthenian rite was of inferior standing , and some Latin bishops even declared that the Ruthenian prelates did_not enjoy full episcopal rights and functions but were subject to them , this Apostolic See rejected these unjust and fanciful opinions ; on th September a decree was published to the following effect : '' Cardinal Pamphili reported divers decrees of the special Congregation for the united Ruthenians and His Holiness approved the decree of the same special Congregation of the preceding st August , that the Ruthenian bishops in union were bishops , and were to be so called and regarded . He approved the decree of the same Congregation that the Ruthenian bishops should be able to erect schools in their dioceses for the instruction of their youth in letters and sciences , and that the Ruthenian ecclesiastics enjoyed the privileges fori , canonis , immunitatis , libertatis , which_the priests of the Latin Church enjoy . The tireless and solicitous care of the Roman pontiffs for the preservation and protection of the Ruthenian rites -isaia- best seen from the course of the long drawn out question of the change of rite . Although , for special reasons which_were utterly alien to their will , they could_not through a long period impose on the laity an absolute prohibition of this change , none the less their repeated efforts to establish that prohibition , and their exhortations to the Latin bishops and priests , clearly show how_much our_predecessors had this_matter -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . In the actual decree which in happily established the union of the Ruthenians with the Apostolic See there_-isaia- no clear and open prohibition of going over from the Easter to the Latin rite . Nonetheless , what_the mind of the Apostolic See then already was -isaia- shown by the letter sent in by the general of the Society of Jesus to his subjects in Poland . He tells them that_those_who had never belonged to the Latin rite could_not embrace it after_the reconciliation , '' because it was_the precept of the Church , and was specially laid_down in the documents of the union under Clement VIII that everyone should remain in the rite of his_own Church . But , as complaints became more_and_more frequent that young Ruthenian nobles were adopting the Latin rite , the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda by a decree of th February ordered that '' in future it should_not be lawful for_any of the united Ruthenians , whether lay folk or ecclesiastics , secular or regular , and especially monks of St . Basil the Great , to go over to the Latin rite , for_any reason , however urgent , without_the special permission of the Apostolic See . However , when king Sigismund III of Poland petitioned that_this prohibition should_not be absolutely enforced he wished it to apply only to ecclesiastics our predecessor Urban VIII could_not but assent to this_most illustrious supporter of Catholic unity . The Apostolic See therefore endeavored to obtain by advice and admonition what , for special reasons , was_not enjoined by law , and there_are_many proofs of this . Thus already in the preamble of the decree of th July , by which_the adoption of the Latin rite was forbidden only to the clergy , it was laid_down that priests of the Latin rite were to be warned not , when hearing confessions , to encourage the lay_faithful to adopt it . Warnings to the same effect were repeated again_and_again , and the Apostolic Nuncios in Poland by order of the supreme pontiffs made every_effort that_they_should have_the desired result . That the mind and judgment of the Apostolic See on this_subject did_not change even in later times -isaia- shown by the letter of our predecessor Benedict XIV to the bishops of Lvov and Przemysl in in which inter alia this_-isaia- found : '' Your letter written on th July has reached us ; in it you justly complain of Ruthenians going over from the Greek to the Latin rite , whereas you_are well_aware , venerable_brethren_,_that our_predecessors have detested and we detest these changes of rite , since we very much desire_that preservation and not the destruction of the Greek rite . '' The same pontiff therefore promised that he would remove all hindrances in the matter and would finally prohibit such going over to the Latin rite in a solemn decree . However , the adverse circumstances and conditions of the times did_not permit that_his wishes and promises should_have their desired outcome . But the Roman pontiffs Clement XIV and Pius VII decreed that Catholics of the Ruthenian rite living in Russia could_not change over to the Latin rite ; and then -atti_degli_apostoli- length , in the agreement styled Concordia entered into by the Latin and Ruthenian bishops under the auspices of the congregation_for the promotion of the faith in , it was laid_down that_this prohibition bound all Ruthenians . From this brief historical summary it -isaia- easily seen with what care the Apostolic See has watched over the integral preservation of the Ruthenian rite , both as regards the community as a whole and as regards individuals . However , no one will be surprised if it has permitted or temporarily approved some minor changes on account of the special circumstances of the times , provided always that the chief and essential rites remained whole and entire . Thus , for example , it has permitted no changes to be made in the rites of the liturgy , save the few decreed by the Ruthenian bishops themselves in the council of Zamosc . However , ostensibly for the protection of the complete integrity of their rite but in reality so that the unlearned people might more_easily fall off from the Catholic faith , some crafty promoters of schism endeavored to reintroduce old customs , already in part obsolete . The Roman pontiffs , therefore , as in duty bound , openly denounced their clever and hidden machinations and decreed that '' without consulting the Apostolic See no innovation was to be made in the rites of the liturgy , even on the grounds of restoring ceremonies thought to be more in conformity_with liturgies approved by the same See , but_only for very grave reason and by the authority of the Apostolic See . For the rest , far from its being the mind of the Apostolic See to damage the integrity or hinder the preservation of this rite , it rather caused the Ruthenian Church to cherish most religiously the traditions in liturgical matters handed_down from antiquity . An outstanding sign of this zealous favor towards_the Ruthenian rite may be seen in the new Roman edition of its liturgical books begun in our_pontificate and already in part happily accomplished . In this edition the Apostolic See , gladly assenting to the wishes of the Ruthenian bishops , has endeavored to restore their liturgical rites in accordance_with their venerated ancient traditions . There now comes to our_mind another benefit which_the Ruthenian community certainly derived_from this union with the Apostolic See . Through this_unity this_most noble people was joined to the Catholic Church , by whose life accordingly it lives , by whose truth it -isaia- enlightened , in whose grace it shares . From this proceed streams from the heavenly fountain which so penetrate and permeate all things_that the most beautiful flowers of all virtues and an abundance of salutary fruit are brought forth . Before the return to unity our dissident brethren themselves lamented that_our holy religion was in a ruinous state in those regions , that the vice of simony everywhere prevailed in the choice of bishops and other sacred ministers , that Church goods were dissipated , the morals of monks corrupt , the discipline of monasteries in decay , and even the bond of obedience between_the faithful and their pastors every_day further weakened and imperiled . But , on the contrary , after_the establishment of unity , by the inspiration and help of God , the state of affairs gradually improved . How great was_the strength of mind and constancy needed by the bishops to restore Church discipline everywhere , especially in the early days ; so troubled by every_kind of disturbance and opposition ! What persevering work and patient labor they_had to devote to raising up a clergy of the highest moral standard ; to consoling the flocks committed to them , harassed by such harsh circumstances ; and finally to sustaining and strengthening in every way those_whose faith was wavering and faltering ! None the less , contrary to all human calculation , not_only did this auspicious union triumphantly overcome all the contrary storms , but it emerged from its victorious battle with increased vitality and strength . Thus it came about that_it_was not by the sword or the scourge , not by promises or threats , but by an outstanding example of religious_life and a kind of manifest display of divine_grace , that the Catholic Ruthenians finally brought the dissident eparchies of Lvov and Przemysl to enter_the one fold . When -atti_degli_apostoli- last peace and tranquillity were restored , especially in the eighteenth century , the flourishing state of the Ruthenian Church manifested itself even externally . Witnesses to this are the great monuments of this period , the chief church of the city of Lvov , dedicated to St . George , and the churches and monasteries built -atti_degli_apostoli- Polshayev , Torokan , Zhirovitse and elsewhere . It seems useful to make a brief reference here to the Basilian monks , who in all these_matters have deserved so well , so excellently , by their great and zealous work . After their monasteries under the influence of Velamin Rutsky had_been brought back to a better and holier state and formed into a congregation , many of their members gave such an example of piety , learning and apostolic zeal that_they became the leaders and teachers of religious living to the Christian people . In the schools which_they opened they not_only imparted to youths , often of outstanding ability , an excellent education in divine and human knowledge , but communicated to them their_own solid virtue , so that_they were in no way surpassed by those educated in the Latin schools . Our dissident brethren clearly perceived this , since many of them gladly left home and country to betake themselves to these homes of learning and share in their attractions and advantages . In more recent_times the Ruthenian community has benefited no less from its union with the Apostolic See . This may easily be seen by a consideration of the state of the Galician Church as it was before the ruin and devastation wrought by this savage war . In this province the faithful numbered about , , , the priests , , and places of worship or parishes , . Besides this , outside Galicia but springing from it , there_were many Catholic Ruthenians , especially in America they_may be estimated -atti_degli_apostoli- , or , . Thus the number of the faithful was perhaps greater_than -atti_degli_apostoli- any time in their history , and in every eparchy they showed a correspondingly outstanding zeal for virtue , piety and religious living . In the seminaries of the eparchies students were duly and diligently educated in preparation_for the sacred_ministry . The Christian faithful , participating with_great love and reverence in divine_worship according_to_their own rite , brought forth abundantly the goodly fruit of religion . While cursorily and briefly recalling the flourishing state of the Ruthenian Church , we cannot pass over in silence the illustrious metropolitan Andrew Szepticky . For nearly forty five years he labored with tireless assiduity , making himself most acceptable to his flock on more_than one account besides what concerned their_spiritual profit . In the course of his episcopate a theological society was founded to encourage the clergy in a deeper and more fruitful study of the sacred science ; an ecclesiastical academy was erected in Lvov in which Ruthenian youths of superior intellectual gifts could apply themselves to philosophy , theology and other higher studies in the manner customary in universities ; every_kind of literary production , books , newspapers and reviews , greatly increased and won a good reputation even among foreign nations . Besides all this , sacred art was cultivated in accordance_with_the tradition of the nation and its particular genius ; a museum and other homes of art were equipped with outstanding works of antiquity , and finally , a number of institutions were begun and developed to meet_the needs of the poorer classes of citizens and to assist the indigent . We must mention , too , the outstanding merits of the religious societies both of men_and_women , whose work in these_matters brought too great spiritual profit . We will speak first of the monasteries of Basilian monks and nuns . In the time of the emperor Joseph II of Austria they_had suffered great harm from the invasion of the civil_power into_their affairs , but later , in and the following years , they_were restored to their glory by the reform of Dobromil , as it -isaia- called ; they join an ardent apostolic zeal to the love of the life of seclusion and the inspiration from on high which_they draw from the rules and example of their holy founder . To these old monastic communities have_been added equally praiseworthy new religious societies of men_and_women ; such are the Order of Studites , whose monks devote_themselves above all to heavenly contemplation and works of holy penance , and the religious congregation of the Holy Redeemer , of the Ruthenian rite , whose members work most fruitfully both in Galicia and in Canada . Finally , there_are_many institutes of religious women the Servants of Mary Immaculate , the Myrrhbearers Myrophorae , the Sisters of St . Josaphat , of the Holy Family , of St . Vincent de Paul who work_for the education of girls and undertake the care of the sick . Mention must_also be made here of the college dedicated to St . Josaphat , erected on the Janiculum and munificently endowed by our predecessor Pius XI . Selected young_men had for centuries been prepared_for the priesthood in the Pontifical College of the Greeks , and then in another of our_predecessors , Leo XIII , established a special college -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome for young Ruthenians divinely called to the priesthood . Finally , as we have_said , since_this building had become inadequate for the increasing number of students , our immediate predecessor , conformably to his special love for the Ruthenian people , built it new and larger premises , so that in them candidates_for_the_priesthood should be instructed and formed in sacred learning and the special discipline of their rite , and should happily grow in reverence , obedience and love towards_the Vicar of Jesus Christ , for the future welfare of the Ruthenian Church . The Ruthenian community received another not less important ornament and benefit from its union with the Apostolic See in being graced with a noble company of confessors and martyrs . To preserve their_faith unimpaired and to maintain their zealous loyalty to the Roman pontiffs , these did not_hesitate to endure every_kind of labor and hardship , or even to go gladly to their death , in the spirit of that maxim of the Divine Redeemer : '' Blessed are you , when men hate you and cast you off and revile you , when_they reject your name as something evil , for the Son of Man s sake . When that day comes , rejoice and exult over it ; for behold , a rich reward awaits you in heaven . The first of their number to come to our_mind -isaia- the holy pontiff Josaphat Kuntzevitch , whose unconquerable fortitude we have briefly praised above . When he was murderously sought out by abandoned enemies of the Catholic name , he freely offered himself to the murderers , and gave himself as a victim to bring_about as soon as possible the return of his dissident brethren . He was_the outstanding martyr for Catholic faith and unity -atti_degli_apostoli- that period , but_not the only_one ; not_a_few both of the clergy and the laity received_the same palm of victory after him ; some were slain with the sword , some atrociously flogged to death , some drowned in the Dnieper , so passing from their triumph over death to heaven . Not much later , in the middle of the seventeenth century , the Cossacks openly took up arms against Poland . Then the hatred of those_who opposed religious unity became ever stronger and more violent ; they_were convinced_that the introduction of this union was_the cause of all the calamities and evils that had befallen them ; they_were determined therefore to use every way and means to cast it down and destroy it . There resulted almost innumerable wrongs to the Catholic Church of the Ruthenians ; many churches were profaned , pillaged , demolished , and their furnishing and property destroyed . Not a few of the clergy and a great number of the faithful were severely flogged , terribly tortured , most cruelly done to death . Even the bishops themselves were despoiled of their goods , ejected from their sees and forced to flee . However , even amid the raging of this storm , their spirit did not_fail ; they did everything possible_for the protection and safe keeping of the flocks entrusted to them , and , more_than that , in their dire straits they exerted every_effort , by prayer and argument and labor , to bring_the whole Russian Church with the tsar Alexis into the unity of the fold . Besides all this a new and no less bitter persecution of Catholicism was begun a few years before the partition of Poland . At the time_when the troops of the Russian emperor had invaded Poland many churches of the Ruthenian rite were taken away from the Catholics by force of arms ; the priests_who refused to abjure their_faith were put in chains , insulted , scourged and cast into prison , where_they suffered cruelly from hunger , thirst and cold . Not inferior to these in constancy and fortitude were_the clergy who , about the year , suffered the loss of their goods and even of their liberty , rather_than abandon their religious duties . Among these we wish to recall in a special_way the well_known priest , Joseph Ancewski , who_was kept in harsh confinement in the monastery of Suzdal for thirty two years , attaining the reward of his singular steadfastness in , when he died a most_holy death . We recall also the one hundred and sixty priests , who for open profession of the Catholic faith were torn away from their_families , which_were left in wretchedness , were transported into the interior of Russia and imprisoned in monasteries , but could_not be turned from their holy resolve by hunger or any_other affliction . Equally conspicuous for fortitude were_the many , both clergy and laity , of the eparchy of Chelm , who with unconquerable courage resisted the persecutors of the Catholic faith . For example , when troops came to seize their church and hand it over to the schismatics , the inhabitants of Pratolin did_not resist force by force , but , unarmed , put their crowded bodies in the way of their attackers like a living wall ; some were wounded and savagely ill treated , some suffered long imprisonment or were deported to the icy regions of Siberia , some , finally , were put to the sword and shed their blood for Christ . The cause of those_who sealed their Catholic faith by death has_been begun in their eparchy , and so there_-isaia- hope_that -atti_degli_apostoli- length it may be permitted to number them among the blessed . These iniquitous crimes were_not , however , perpetrated in only_one place , but in many cities , towns and villages . First , all the churches of the Catholics were handed over to the followers of schism , all the clergy driven from their places and forced to leave unguarded the flock committed to them . Then the faithful , with no account taken of their_own wishes , were enrolled in the dissident Church . However , although orphaned of their pastors and deprived of the offices and helps of their religion , they made supreme efforts to hold fast to their_faith . Thus it was that later when members of the Society of Jesus secretly went to them , in disguise and -atti_degli_apostoli- the peril of their_lives , to instruct , to exhort and to comfort them , they welcomed them_with_the greatest joy and devotion . But a wonderful and happy spectacle was to be seen in the Ruthenian districts in , when liberty to profess any religion was to some extent granted . Innumerable Catholics came forth_from their retreats into open day . They had no priests of their_own Eastern rite , so they went in a body , singing their thanks and praise to God , with the standard of the cross carried on high and their sacred pictures publicly exposed for veneration , to the churches of the Latin rite , entry to which_had previously been prohibited to them under severe penalties . There they begged the lawful ministers of the Church to open their doors to them , receive their profession_of_faith and enroll them again among the Catholics . In this_way in a short time , faithful were duly received back into the Church . However , even in more recent_times the bishops and priests and their faithful flocks have needed fortitude and constancy of spirit to retain their Catholic faith , protect the Church and defend its sacred liberty . Among them we must recall here , with_special honor , the metropolitan Andrew Szepticky . During the first European war , when Galicia was occupied by Russian armies , he was expelled from his see and deported to a monastery , where he was for a time -atti_degli_apostoli- least kept in prison ; he had no greater desire than to testify to his great veneration for the Apostolic See , and even , sustained by God s grace , gladly to suffer martyrdom for his flock , for whose welfare he had_already long spent his strength and solicitude . We have now seen , from the brief historical relation of events in this_letter , how_many and how_great were_the benefits and blessings brought to the Ruthenian people by its union with the Catholic Church . This -isaia- not , indeed , to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- ; for if '' it was God s good pleasure to let all completeness dwell '' in Christ , no one_can enjoy this completeness who_-isaia- separated_from the Church which '' -isaia-_his body . '' As our predecessor Pelagius II asserts , '' whoever -isaia- not in the peace and unity of the Church will_not be able to possess God . '' We have_seen , too , that_this beloved Ruthenian people has had to suffer great hardships , perils and vexations in defending to the best of its power its Catholic unity , but from_these Divine Providence has freed it again_and_again and restored peace to it . But now , with the greatest fatherly anguish of heart , we see a new and terrible storm threatening this Church . The information which reaches us -isaia- scanty , but_-isaia- sufficient to cause solicitude and fill us with anxiety . It -isaia- the anniversary of the day three hundred and fifty years_ago , when this ancient community of Christians was happily united to the supreme pastor , the successor of St . Peter ; but this_same day has become for us '' a day of tribulation and distress , a day of calamity and misery , a day of darkness and obscurity , a day of clouds and whirlwinds . For we have learnt with_great grief that , in those territories which_have recently been_made over to the sway of Russia , our dear brethren and sons of the Ruthenian people_are in dire straits in consequence of their fidelity to the Apostolic See ; every_means are_being employed to take them away from the bosom of their mother , the Church , and to induce them , against their will and against their known religious duty , to enter_the communion of the dissidents . Thus it -isaia- reported that the clergy of the Ruthenian rite have complained in a letter to the civil government that in the Western Ukraine , as it -isaia- called today , their Church has_been placed in an extremely difficult position ; all its bishops and many of its priests have_been arrested ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it has_been prohibited that anyone should_take up the government of the same Ruthenian Church . We are_well aware_that this harsh and severe treatment -isaia- speciously attributed to political reasons . But this_-isaia- no new procedure used today for the first time ; very often in the course of the centuries the enemies of the Church have hesitated to make public profession of their opposition to the Catholic faith and to attack it openly ; they brought cunning and subtle allegations that Catholics were plotting against the State . In the very same_way the Jews accused the Divine Redeemer himself before the Roman governor , saying '' We have discovered that_this man_-isaia- subverting the loyalty of our people , forbids the payment of tribute to Caesar . '' But faces and events themselves plainly manifest , and show in its true light , what_was and -isaia- the real cause of this savagery . For , as -isaia- well_known , the patriarch Alexis , recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia , openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church , a letter which contributed not a little to the initiation of this persecution . These griefs cut us the more_deeply because while the cruel war was yet raging almost all the nations of the world , through a gathering of their representatives , solemnly proclaimed among other_things that no persecution of religion must ever be undertaken . This had given us hope_that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church , the more so since_the Church has_always taught , and teaches , that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil_power , within_the sphere and bounds of its authority , -isaia- a duty of conscience . But , unfortunately , the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened , have almost destroyed , our_hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are_concerned . Amid these heavy calamities , since human help -isaia- seen to be of no avail , nothing remains , venerable_brethren , but earnestly to implore the most merciful God , who '' will do justice to the needy and will avenge the poor , '' that of his loving kindness he would himself calm this terrible storm and -atti_degli_apostoli- length bring it to an end . We again_and_again exhort you and the flock committed to you to join with us by humble prayer and works of penance in imploring him by whose heavenly light the minds_of_men are illumined , by whose heavenly command their wills are directed , to spare his_people and not to give up his heritage to reproach , and speedily to free the Church of the Ruthenians from this hurtful crisis . In this sad and anxious state of affairs our fatherly heart goes out especially to those_who_are so harshly and bitterly oppressed by it , and first of all to you_,_venerable_brothers , the bishops of the Ruthenian people . Great as are the trials which afflict you , you are_more burdened with anxiety for the safety of your flocks than for the injuries and sufferings inflicted upon yourselves , in accordance_with_the words : '' the good_shepherd lays down his_life for his sheep . '' The present -isaia- dark and the future uncertain and full of cares , but do not lose heart . Rather so display yourselves , presenting '' such a spectacle . to the whole creation , men and angels alike , '' that all the faithful of Christ may see in your endurance and courage a shining example . Courageously , and steadfastly enduring this attack of your enemies , and afire with a divine_love for the Church , you become '' the good odor of Christ unto God , in them that_are saved and in them that perish . '' In bonds as you_are , and separated_from your sons , it -isaia- not in your power to give_them instruction in our holy religion , but your very bonds more_fully and profoundly proclaim and preach Christ . As a father we next address you , our beloved_sons who have_received the seal of the priesthood , and must_therefore follow more_closely in the footsteps of Christ , '' who suffered for us , '' and still_more than others must bear the brunt of battle . We are deeply moved by your distress , but rejoice that_we_can say to the greater number of you , borrowing the words of the Divine Redeemer : '' I know of all thy doings , thy faith , thy love , thy generosity , thy endurance , how in these last days thou art more active than -atti_degli_apostoli- first . '' We exhort you to continue steadfastly and inflexibly to stand firm in your faith in these lamentable times ; continue to uphold the weak and support the wavering . So far as there_-isaia- need , warn the faithful of Christ entrusted to you that_it_-isaia- absolutely unlawful , even merely exteriorly or verbally , to deny or abandon Christ and His Church ; expose the cunning wiles of those_who promise men earthly advantages and greater happiness in this_life , but destroy their_souls . Show yourselves '' as the ministers of God , in much patience , in tribulation , in necessities , in distresses . in chastity , in knowledge , in long suffering , in sweetness , in the Holy Ghost , in charity unfeigned , in the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the armor of justice on the right hand and on the left . Lastly we address all of you , Catholics of the Ruthenian Church . We share your sorrows and afflictions with a father s heart . We know_that grievous snares are_being set for your faith . There seems ground for fear that in the near future still greater hardships will befall those_who refuse to betray their sacred religious allegiance . For that_reason we even_now exhort you in the Lord , beloved_sons , to be terrified by no menaces or injuries , to be moved by no danger of exile or risk even of life ever to abjure your faith and your fidelity to Mother Church . That treasure -isaia- involved which_-isaia- hidden in a field and the man_who finds it '' hides it again , and now , for the joy it gives him -isaia- going home to sell all that_he_has and buy that field . '' Remember , too , what_the Divine Redeemer Himself said in the Gospel : '' He -isaia- not worthy of me , that loves father or mother more ; he -isaia- not worthy of me , that loves son or daughter more ; he -isaia- not worthy of me , that does_not take up his cross and follow me . He who secures his own_life will lose it ; it -isaia- the man_who loses his_life for my sake that_will secure it . '' To this_divine pronouncement we will add the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' It -isaia- well said , We are to share his_life , because we have shared his_death ; if we endure , we shall reign with_him , if we disown him , he in his turn will disown us . If we play him false , he remains true to his_word ; he cannot disown himself . We think , beloved_sons , that we cannot reinforce this fatherly exhortation of ours and bring it to an end more fittingly than by these admonitions of the same Apostle of the Gentiles : '' Be on the watch , stand firm in the faith , play the man , be full of courage . '' '' Obey those_who_have charge of you , '' your bishops and priests , when_they give_you instructions for your salvation and in accordance_with_the prescriptions of the Church . Offer active resistance to all those_who in any_way whatever scheme against your faith . Be '' eager to preserve that_unity the Spirit gives you , whose bond -isaia- peace . You are one_body , with a single Spirit ; each of you , when he was called , called in the same hope . '' In the midst of every_kind of sorrow and affliction remember '' that the sufferings of this_time are_not worthy to be compared to the glory to come that shall be revealed in us . '' '' But the Lord keeps faith with us ; he will strengthen you , and keep you from all harm . We have absolute confidence that , by the inspiration and help of divine_grace , you will respond courageously and with a will to these exhortations of ours ; and we foresee and humbly pray that better and more peaceful times will come for you from the merciful Father , the God who_gives all encouragement . Meanwhile , as a pledge of heavenly_gifts and a witness of our goodwill , with_all_our heart we give the Apostolic Blessing to all of you_,_venerable_brethren , and to your flocks , and especially to the bishops_,_priests and all the faithful of the Ruthenian Church .

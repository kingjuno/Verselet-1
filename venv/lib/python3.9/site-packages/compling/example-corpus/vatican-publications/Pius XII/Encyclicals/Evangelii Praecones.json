Catholic missionaries toiling in a vast field of labor '' that the word of the Lord may run its course triumphantly '' are in Our thoughts in a special_way on the occasion of the th anniversary of the Encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae of Our Predecessor of immortal memory Pius XI , wherein he laid_down wise norms for the greater development of Catholic missions . The consideration of the progress this_holy cause has made in the intervening years has brought Us no small consolation . As We remarked in an audience on June , , to the directors of the Pontifical Missionary Work ; '' The Catholic missionary movement both in Christian and pagan lands has gained such force and momentum and -isaia- of such proportions as perhaps was never witnessed before in the annals of Catholic missions . In view of the upheavals and dangers of the present_time , when not_a_few peoples are divided by conflicting interests , We consider it very opportune on the present occasion to reiterate Our approval of this_work . For missionaries preach to all men the practice of natural and Christian virtues and that brotherly and common fellowship which transcends racial conflicts and national frontiers . On that occasion when We addressed the directors of the above mentioned Work , We made the following observations among others : '' . It -isaia- in keeping_with your apostolate not to be hampered by any national frontiers ; for your work_which unites you in fraternal cooperation , clearly manifests to all that note of the Catholic Church which rejects discord , flees division , and abhors all disputes which agitate nations and sometimes bring them to utter ruin . We refer to that Christian faith and universal Christian charity_which transcend all opposing camps and national boundaries and reach out to the ends of the earth . They are the motives that spur each_one of you on to reach your goal , which_-isaia- the establishment of the Kingdom of God throughout_the whole_world . We gladly avail Ourselves of the th anniversary of the Encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae to express Our appreciation of the work which_has_been accomplished and the great consolation it has_given Us , and further to exhort all to go forward with still greater zeal : all Our venerable_brethren in the Episcopacy , We mean , all missionaries , priests and individual faithful , both in missionary lands and throughout_the whole_world , who by their prayers , by training and helping future missionaries , or by obtaining material aid promote this_most important work . We should like first of all to touch here briefly on the progress that_has happily been_made . In the number of Catholic missions amounted to , but today it -isaia- almost . At that date the number of Catholics in the missions did_not exceed , , while today it -isaia- almost , , . At that_time the number of native and foreign priests in the missions was about , ; today their number -isaia- more_than , . Then all Bishops in the missions were foreigners ; during the past years missions have_been entrusted to native clergy ; moreover with the establishment of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy and the appointment of native Bishops in quite a few places , it has become more apparent that the religion of Jesus Christ -isaia- really Catholic and that no part_of_the_world -isaia- excluded from it . For instance in Pakistan and in some parts of Africa the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy has_been juridically established ; three very_important Plenary Councils have_been held , the first in in Indochina , the second in in Australia and the third last year in India . Minor seminaries have_been greatly increased and strengthened . The number of those studying in major seminaries , which years_ago was only , -isaia-_now , ; moreover , many regional seminaries have_been built . Attached to the College of Propaganda Fide in Rome a Missionary Institute has_been founded . Likewise in this beloved city the College of St . Peter has_been equipped to give a more thorough and better adapted theological , moral and apostolic training to native priests . Moreover , two universities have_been founded ; high schools which formerly numbered , today number more_than , ; the number of elementary and primary schools has_been almost doubled ; the same can_be_said for dispensaries and hospitals where every_kind of sick and infirm , including lepers , are cared for . In addition there have_been the following developments : '' The Missionary Union of the Clergy '' during_this period has increased greatly ; '' Fides '' news service has_been established ; almost everywhere missionary periodicals are growing in number and enjoy a wide circulation ; many missionary congresses have_been held , among which that held in Rome during the Holy Year deserves special mention , giving as it did a clear picture of the nature and extent of the missionary work being done ; a short time ago a Eucharistic congress was held -atti_degli_apostoli- Wumasi in the Gold Coast of Africa which_was remarkable alike for the number and piety of its participants ; and lastly a special day in the year has_been appointed by Us to help with prayer and alms the Pontifical Work of the Holy Childhood . All these developments make it obvious that the work of the apostolate has adapted itself to changing conditions and growing needs of our_times by employing new and more modern methods . Nor must We omit to mention that during_this period there_were duly established in different regions five Apostolic Delegations , which_are under the jurisdiction of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide ; moreover Apostolic Nuncios or Internuncios have_been appointed to a number of missionary territories . In this connection it may be asserted that the presence and activity of these prelates have borne abundant fruit . It -isaia- their special merit that greater coordination and collaboration have_been realized among missionaries who_are working toward a common end , Our Legates likewise have contributed considerably to this result . They often visit each district and also from time to time take_part in Our name in meetings of the Hierarchy during which_the experiments which_have_been prudently tried out by different local Ordinaries are pooled to the common advantage , and by common agreement easier and more efficient methods of apostolate have_been adopted . Besides , this fraternal coordination of the activities of the faith_has also been conducive to a better appreciation of the Catholic religion on the part of public_authorities , even when_they_are non Catholic . What We have briefly written here about the progress of the missions during the past years , and what We had the pleasure of witnessing during the Holy Year , when considerable numbers from distant missionary countries flocked to Rome to obtain grace and to receive Our blessing this , We say , strongly urges Us to repeat the burning desire expressed by the Apostle of the Gentiles when writing to the Romans : '' . that I may_have some spiritual gift to share_with you so as to strengthen your resolve ; or rather , that the faith we find in each_other , you and I , may be encouragement to you and to me as well . It seems to Us that the Divine Master Himself -isaia- repeating to everyone those words of consolation and exhortation : '' Lift up your eyes and see the countries ; for they_are white already to harvest . '' But since_the number of missionaries -isaia- inadequate for present needs , the following words are in a way the counterpart of that invitation : '' The harvest indeed -isaia- great , but the laborers are few . Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers into_his harvest . It -isaia- a great consolation to Us to know_that the number of missionary vocations -isaia- happily on the increase -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time and promises well for the Church ; still very much remains to be done ; there_-isaia- still much need of prayer . When We consider_the countless peoples who_are to be called to the one fold and to the one haven of salvation by the preaching of these missionaries , We address to the heavenly Prince of Pastors the words of Ecclesiasticus : '' For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight , so thou shalt be magnified among_them in our presence , that_they_may know thee , as we also have known thee . that_there_-isaia- no God beside thee . Now this salutary progress of the work of the missions has cost not_only the ceaseless and great labors of those_who sowed the seed of the Gospel , but_also much blood of Martyrs . During the course of the centuries there have_not been lacking in some_countries most violent persecutions of the nascent Church ; and in our own_time there_are countries in the Far East which are_being purpled with martyrs blood in the same cause . We have learned that_many of the faithful and also nuns , missionaries , native priests and even Bishops have_been driven from their homes , despoiled of their possessions and languish in want as exiles or have_been arrested , thrown into prison or into concentration camps , or sometimes cruelly done to death , because_they were devoutly attached to their_faith . Our heart_-isaia- overwhelmed with grief when We think of the hardships , suffering and death of these our beloved_children . Not only do We love them_with a fatherly love , but We reverence them_with a fatherly veneration , since We are fully aware_that their high sense of duty -isaia- sometimes crowned with martyrdom . Jesus Christ , the first martyr , said : '' If they_have persecuted me , they_will also persecute you . '' '' In the world you will_have distress . But have confidence . I have overcome the world . '' '' Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die , itself remaineth alone . But if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . Missionaries in foreign lands who die in the fulfilment of their sacred duty are seeds destined , when God so wills , to bear abundant fruit . Wherefore the Apostle Paul asserted : '' We glory in tribulations . Cyprian , Bishop and Martyr , consoled and animated the Christians of his day with these_words : '' The Lord has willed that_we_should even rejoice over persecutions because , when persecutions occur , then the faith_-isaia- crowned , God s soldiers are put to the test , and heaven -isaia- opened to martyrs . We have_not enlisted in an army merely to think of peace and to decline battle , seeing that the Lord , the master of humility , tolerance and suffering , has_taken the first_place in the conflict , that He might first do what He taught us to do and that He might Himself first endure for us what He exhorts us to endure . The missionaries who toil in distant lands are championing a cause not unlike that of the early Church . For those_who along_with the Princes of the Apostles , Peter and Paul , brought the Gospel to the citadel of the Roman Empire found themselves in a rather similar situation in Rome . If one remembers that the infant Church -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time was devoid of all natural means and was exposed to hardships , trials and persecutions , he must be deeply struck with admiration -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of a handful of unarmed Christians overthrowing what_was perhaps the greatest power that ever existed . What happened then , will undoubtedly often happen again . just as the youth David , who put his trust more in God s help than in his_own sling , laid low the armorclad giant Goliath , so the Divine society , which Christ founded , can_never be overcome by an earthly power , but_-isaia- destined to come forth the serene conqueror of all persecutions . Though We know well that_this_-isaia- due to the indefectible Divine promises , still We cannot_but express Our gratitude to all those_who_have borne witness to their unshaken and invincible faith in Jesus Christ and in His Church , the pillar and ground of truth , exhorting them -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to continue in their constancy . News very frequently reaches Us of their invincible and virile faith_,_which fills Our heart with_great consolation . Though some have tried to separate the children of the Catholic Church from Rome and from this Apostolic See , as though patriotism and loyalty so required , yet Catholics have_been and are_able to make_the fully justified rejoinder that , while they_are second to none in the matter of patriotism , they genuinelv desire to enjoy a rightful liberty . Now what We have touched upon above , must be particularly borne in mind , namely_,_that what still remains to be accomplished in this_field calls for an enormous effort and innumerable laborers . Let us remember_that our brethren '' who sat in darkness and shadow '' form an immense multitude that_can be reckoned -atti_degli_apostoli- about , , , . Hence it appears that the ineffable sigh of the most loving Heart of Christ -isaia- echoing still : '' And other sheep I have that_are not of this fold : them also I must bring . And they_shall hear my voice : and there shall be one fold and one shepherd . There are_some shepherds , as you_know , Venerable Brethren , who strive to lead away the sheep from this one fold and haven of salvation ; you likewise know_that this danger -isaia- daily growing greater . When We consider before God the immense number of men without_the truth of the Gospel , and duly reckon the grave danger that faces many from the prevalence of atheistic materialism or from a certain so called Christian creed which_-isaia- infected by the tenets and errors of communism , We feel the deepest concern and solicitude that_nothing be left undone to promote the work of the apostolate throughout_the_world . We make Our own the exhortation of the Prophet saying : '' Cry , cease not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet . We pray God especially_for those missionaries who labor in the interior of Latin America , since We are aware of the dangerous pitfalls to which_they_are exposed from the open and covert attacks of heretical teaching . With a view to promoting still more_effectively the work_of_evangelization by our missionaries and to prevent one drop of their sweat and blood from being shed in vain , We should like here to explain briefly the principles and norms that_must guide the zeal and activity of Catholic missionaries . First of all it -isaia- to be observed that the person_who had been_called by God to evangelize distant non Christian lands , has_received a very great and sublime vocation . He consecrates his_life to God in order to spread His Kingdom to the farthest ends of the earth . He does_not seek what_-isaia- his , but what_-isaia- Christ s . He can apply to himself in a special_way those beautiful sayings of St . Paul : '' For Christ . '' '' Though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh . '' '' To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak . '' He must , therefore , consider_the country he -isaia- going to evangelize as a second fatherland and love it with due charity . Furthermore let_him not seek any earthly advantage for his_own country or religious Institute , but_rather what may help towards_the salvation_of_souls . Certainly he should dearly love his fatherland and his Order , but the Church should be loved with a still_more ardent devotion . And let_him remember_that nothing will be to the advantage of his_own Order that_-isaia- detrimental to the good of the Church . Moreover it -isaia- necessary_that those_who_are called to this_kind of apostolate should_not only get the spiritual and intellectual training that befits ecclesiastical students , before going out on the mission field , but should learn in addition those subjects which_will be most useful to them when_they come to preach the Gospel in foreign lands . Hence they_should be given a sound knowledge of languages , especially of those_which they_will require -atti_degli_apostoli- some future date . Besides , they_should be sufficiently instructed in the sciences of medicine , agriculture , ethnography , history , geography , etc . The object of missionary_activity , as all know , -isaia- to bring_the light of the Gospel to new races and to form new Christians . However , the ultimate goal of missionary endeavor , which_should never be lost sight of , -isaia- to establish the Church on sound foundations among nonChristian peoples , and place it under its_own native Hierarchy . In a letter which We wrote on August last year to Our beloved son Peter Cardinal Fumasoni Biondi , Prefect of the S . Congregation of Propaganda Fide , We mentioned the following points among others : '' The Church s aim -isaia- not the domination of peoples or the gaining of temporal dominions ; she_-isaia- eager only to bring_the supernatural light_of_faith to all peoples , and to promote the interests of civilization and culture , and fraternal concord among nations . In the Apostolic Letter Maximum illud of Our Predecessor of immortal memory , Benedict XV , given in the year , and in the Encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae , of Our immediate Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius XI , it was laid_down that the missions would_have as the final goal of their activities the establishment of the Church in new territiories . And We Ourselves when , as We have_said , received in audience the directors of mission activities in , made the following statement : '' The magnanimous and noble purpose which missionaries have -isaia- the propagation_of_the_faith in new lands in such_a_way_that the Church may ever become more firmly established in them and as soon as possible reach such a stage of development that it can continue to exist and flourish without_the aid of missionary organizations . These missionary organizations do not serve their_own ends , but_it_-isaia- their task to use every endeavor to realize the lofty purpose We have_already mentioned . When that_has_been attained , then let_them be happy to turn to other fields . '' '' Wherefore let_the missionary take up no permanent abode in those places_where the work of the apostolate has reached full development , since_it_-isaia- up to him to evangelize and sanctify the whole_world . The missionary s appointed task -isaia- to promote ever_more rapidly in district after district till the last man in the most remote corner of the earth has_been reached , the Kingdom of the Divine Redeemer Who rose triumphant from the dead and to Whom -isaia- given all power in heaven and on earth . It -isaia- clear , however_,_that the Church cannot be properly and duly established in new territories , unless all -isaia- there organized as time and circumstances require and especially unless a native clergy equal to the need has_been properly educated and trained . In this connection We should like to borrow the grave and wise directives of the Encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae : '' . While each of you_should try to have as large a number of native students as possible , you_must further make it your aim to fashion and develop in them sacerdotal sanctity and such an apostolic spirit and zeal for the salvation of their_own people that_they_will be ready to lay_down their_lives for their fellow tribesmen and fellow countrymen . '' Suppose owing to war or political upheavals there_-isaia- a change of government in some missionary territory , and the request -isaia- made or a law_-isaia- passed that the foreign missionaries of a certain country must leave : suppose again a more unlikely case , that the native population raised to a higher degree of culture and political development , in order to attain its freedom , wants to drive out of their territory all governors , armed forces and missionaries belonging to the occupying foreign power and that it cannot do so otherwise than by force . What then , We ask , would be the disaster that_would threaten the Church throughout all that territory , unless full provision has been_made for the needs of the Christian populace by a network of native priests throughout_the whole country ? '' . We are profoundly grieved as We behold these conditions which Our immediate Predecessor described with almost prophetic vision verified in many_parts of the Far East . There what were most flourishing missions ripe for the harvest , are_now , alas , reduced to the direst straits . Would that it were permitted Us to hope_that the peoples of Korea and China , who_are naturally cultured and honorable and have_been renowned from early times for their high standard of civilization , may as soon as possible be freed not_only from turbulent factions and wars , but_from the inimical doctrine which seeks only the things of earth and scorns the things of heaven ; and , moreover that_they_may appraise rightly the Christian charity and virtue of foreign missionaries and native priests_who strive only to promote the genuine good of the people by their labors and if necessary , by the sacrifice of their_lives . We return heartfelt thanks to God that in both countries a numerous clergy chosen from among the people has grown up as the future hope of the Church , and that not_a_few dioceses have_been entrusted to the care of native Bishops . That this stage of development should_have been reached redounds to the credit of the foreign missionaries . In this respect We think fit to point_out something which_should be carefully borne in mind when mission territory that_has_been under the care of foreign missionaries -isaia- entrusted to a native Bishop and clergy . It -isaia- not necessary_that the religious institute whose members tilled the mission field with_their sweat , should leave it altogether when by decree of the S . Congregation of Propaganda Fide the vineyard , which_was cultivated by them and -isaia- not flourishing , -isaia- handed over to other husbandmen . It will be advantageous and becoming that_such a religious institute remain on to cooperate with the newly appointed native Bishop . As in the rest of the Catholic dioceses of the world Religious usually assist the local Ordinary , so in mission countries let_them not_cease , though foreigners , to labor for the Church in an auxiliary capacity . Thus what_the Divine Master proclaimed -atti_degli_apostoli- the well of Sichar will be happily fulfilled : '' And he that reapeth , receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together . We desire to address and exhort in this Encyclical Letter not_only missionary priests but_also those laymen who '' with a great heart and a willing mind '' collaborate with the missionaries in the ranks of Catholic Action . It can certainly be claimed that the lay cooperation which we today call Catholic Action , has existed since_the foundation of the Church . Indeed the Apostles and other preachers of the Gospel received no little help from it and the Christian religion thereby made great advances . In this respect Apollo , Lydia , Aquila , Priscilla and Philemon are mentioned by the Apostle of the Gentiles . We have_also these_words of his to the Philippians : '' Yes , and I ask thee , who sharest the yoke so loyally , to take_part with_them ; they_have worked for the Gospel -atti_degli_apostoli- my side , as much as Clement and those other fellowlaborers of mine , whose names are recorded in the book of life . Likewise all know_that the Gospel followed the great Roman roads and was spread not_only by Bishops and priests but_also by public officials , soldiers and private citizens . Thousands of Christian neophytes , whose names are today unknown , were fired with zeal to promote the new religion they_had embraced and endeavored to prepare the way_for the coming of the Gospel . That explains why after about years Christianity had penetrated into all the chief cities of the Roman Empire . Justinus , Minucius Felix , Aristides , the consul Acilius Glaber , the patrician Flavius Clemens , St . Tarsicius and countless holy martyrs of both sexes , who strengthened and enriched the growth of the Church by their labors and the shedding of their blood , can in a certain_sense be called the advance guard and forerunners of Catholic Action . Here We wish to cite the striking observation of the author of the letter to Diognetus , which even today has a message for us : '' Christians dwell in their native countries as though aliens ; . every foreign land -isaia- their home and the land of their birth -isaia- foreign soil . During the barbarian invasions of the Middle Ages , we see men_and_women of royal rank and even workmen and valiant Christian women of the common people using every endeavor to convert their fellow citizens to the religion of Jesus Christ and to fashion their morals according to its pattern , so as to safeguard both religion and the state from approaching danger . Tradition tells us that_when our immortal Predecessor , Leo the Great , courageously opposed Attila , when he invaded Italy , two Roman consuls stood by his side . When formidable hordes of Huns were besieging Paris , the holy virgin Genevieve , who was_given to a life of continuous prayer and austere penance , cared for the souls and bodies of her fellow citizens with wondrous charity . Theodolinda , Queen of the Lombards , zealously summoned her people to embrace the Christian religion . King Reccaredus of Spain endeavored to rescue his_people from the Arian heresy and to lead_them back to the true Faith . In France , there_were not_only bishops , such as Remigius of Rheims , Caesarius of Arles , Gregory of Tours , Eligius of Noyon and many_others , who_were eminent for virtue and apostolic zeal , but queens also can be found during that period who taught the truths of Christianity to the untutored masses and who gave food and shelter and renewed strength to the sick , the hungry and the victims of every_human misfortune . For example , Clotilda so influenced Clovis in favor of the Catholic religion that_she had the great joy of bringing him into the true Church . Radegunda and Bathilda cared for the sick with supreme charity and even restored lepers to health . In England , Queen Bertha welcomed St . Augustine when he came to evangelize that nation and earnestly exhorted her husband Ethelbert to accept the teachings of the Gospel . No sooner had the Anglo Saxons , of both high and low degree , men_and_women , young and old , embraced the Christian faith , than they_were led as though by divine inspiration to unite themselves to this Apostolic See by the closest bonds of piety , fidelity and devotion . In Germany , we witness the admirable spectacle of St . Boniface and his companions traversing those regions in their apostolic journeys and making them fruitful by their generous labors . The sons_and_daughters of that valiant and noble land felt inspired to offer their efficient collaboration to monks , priests and Bishops in order_that the light of the Gospel might be daily more widely diffused throughout those vast regions and that Christian doctrine and Christian virtue might ever make greater advances and reap a rich harvest of souls . Thus in every_age , thanks to the tireless labors of the clergy and also to the cooperation of the laity , the Catholic Church has not_only advanced its spiritual kingdom , but has_also led nations to increased social prosperity . Everybody knows the social reforms of St . Ferdinand in Castile and of St . By their holy lives and zealous labors they brought_about salutary improvement in the different classes of society by instituting reforms , by spreading the true faith everywhere , by valiantly defending the Church and above all by their_personal example . Nor are We unaware of the excellent merits of the guilds during the Middle Ages . In these guilds artisans and skilled workers of both sexes were enrolled , who , notwithstanding the fact_that they lived in the world , kept their_eyes fixed upon the sublime ideal of evangelical perfection . Not only did they eagerly pursue this ideal , but together_with_the clergy they exerted every_effort to bring all others to do the same . The same conditions which prevailed in the early days of the Church are_still to be found in many areas which_have_been evangelized by missionaries ; or -atti_degli_apostoli- least their peoples suffer disadvantages which_had to be left to a future generation to face and remedy . For that_reason it -isaia- imperative that the laity should in great numbers enter_the serried ranks of Catholic action , and thus cooperate generously , earnestly and diligently with the Hierarchy in promoting the apostolate . The work of catechists -isaia- assuredly necessary and we wish to give_them due praise ; yet no less necessary -isaia- the industry and skill of those_who out of pure charity are ready to help gratuitously the ministers of God in the performance of their_duties . We therefore desire_that there be everywhere erected . as far as -isaia- possible , associations of men_and_women , and also of students , of workers , of artists , of athletes , and other clubs and sodalities , which_can be considered the auxiliaries of the missionaries . In the erection and constitution of these organizations , let character , virtue and zeal be preferred to numbers . It -isaia- to be borne in mind_that nothing_-isaia- more efficacious in winning for missionaries the confidence of fathers and mothers than devoted care bestowed upon their_children . If the minds of the young are moulded to Christian truth and their characters fashioned according to Christian virtue , they_will enrich and bring distinction to not_only their_families but_also their communities . It not rarely happens_that if the life of a Christian community be in any_way remiss or lax , they succeed in restoring it to its pristine vigor . Although it -isaia- clear_that Catholic Action should exercise its influence primarily in promoting the works of the apostolate , its_members are_not prevented from joining other organizations whose purpose -isaia- to reform social and political_life according to the principles and teaching of the Gospel ; in fact , their participation not_only as citizens , but as Catholics also , -isaia- a right which_they possess and a duty to which_they_are bound . Since young_men , and those especially who have_had the advantage of a classical and liberal education , will direct the course of the future , no one_can be blind to the supreme importance of devoting the best of care to elementary schools , high schools and colleges . Therefore , with paternal solicitude We exhort superiors of missions to spare neither labor nor expense in proportion to their means in vigorously promoting this phase of missionary_activity . The utility of schools for the young lies especially in this that_they establish advantageous relationships between_the missionaries and pagans of every class , and above all , they more_easily influence the docile minds of the young to understand , appreciate and embrace Catholic doctrine . As we all know , the educated youth of today will form the governments of tomorrow and the masses will follow their leadership and guidance . The Apostle of the Gentiles propounded the sublime wisdom of the Gospel before a learned audience when in the Areopagus of Athens he proclaimed the unknown God . Even though this method does_not make many converts outright to the teaching of our Divine Redeemer , still there_will be many who , as they contemplate the supernatural beauty of this religion and the charity of its disciples , will feel its benign influence . Schools and colleges are moreover especially helpful in refuting the errors which now especially are daily infecting more_and_more nonCatholic and communist activities and which are_being openly and overtly instilled into the minds especially of youth . An equally useful service -isaia- the dissemination of timely publications . It -isaia- scarcely necessary_for Us to dwell -atti_degli_apostoli- length on this_point , for everyone knows how effectively newspapers , magazines and reviews can be employed either to present truth and virtue in their_proper light and inculcate them deeply upon men , or to expose fallacies masquerading under the guise of truth , or to refute certain false opinions which_are hostile to religion , or which do great spiritual harm by distorted presentation of vexed social questions . Hence We warmly commend those Bishops who interest themselves in the widest possible distribution of printed works of this_sort which_have_been carefully edited . Though much has_already_been done in this_regard , much remains to be done . We also wish -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point to pay the highest tribute of praise to the care taken of the sick , the infirm and affflicted of every_kind ; We mean hospitals , leprosaria , dispensaries and homes for the aged and for maternity cases , and orphanages . These are to Our eyes the fairest flowers of missionary endeavor ; they give us as it were a vision of the Divine Redeemer Himself , who '' went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed . Such outstanding works of charity are undoubtedly of the highest efficacy in preparing the souls of non Christians and in drawing them to the Faith and to the practice of Christianity ; besides , Our Lord said to His Apostles : '' Into what city soever you enter , and they receive you , . heal the sick that_are therein , and say to them : the Kingdom of God -isaia- come nigh unto you . However , the Brothers and nuns who feel_that they_are_called to undertake such work must , before leaving their_own country , acquire the professional training and knowledge which_are today required in these_matters . We know that_there are nuns with full professional qualifications who_have earned well merited recognition by the special study of loathsome diseases , such as leprosy , and by discovering remedies for them . These and all other missionaries who_are giving their service so generously in leper hospitals , have Our paternal blessing , and their exalted charity compels Our admiration and praise . With regard to medicine and surgery , however , it will certainly be advisable to enlist the services also of laymen , provided not_only that_they_have taken the necessary degrees for this_work , and are willing to leave their homeland in order to help the missionaries , but also_that in the matter of faith_and_morals they leave nothing to be desired . Passing now to another aspect of the subject which_-isaia- of no less importance , We wish to speak of social reforms demanded by justice and charity . Whilst the propaganda of communism , today so widespread , -isaia- readily deceiving the minds of the simple and untutored , We seem to hear an echo of those words of the Divine Saviour : '' I have compassion on the multitude . '' It -isaia- imperative to put into_practice with zeal and diligence the right principles taught by the Church in this_matter . It -isaia- imperative to keep all nations free_from those pernicious errors , or , in case they are_already tainted with_them , to set them free from_these inimical doctrines which represent the enjoyment of this_world as the unique goal to be attained by men in this mortal life . At the same_time , by subjecting everything to state ownership and control , they reduce the dignity_of_the_human_person almost to zero . It -isaia- imperative to proclaim in private and in public that_we_are all exiles making our way to our immortal home ; and are destined to eternal happiness , to which truth and virtue must lead us . Christ -isaia-_the_only real defender of human justice , the only true consoler of the human misery that in this life_-isaia- unavoidable . He alone points_out to us that haven of peace , justice , and everlasting happiness which all of us , redeemed by His blood , are to gain after our earthly pilgrimage -isaia- finished . However , it -isaia-_the_duty of all , as far_as_possible , to mitigate the distress , sweeten the sorrow and relieve the anguish of their brethren during_this life . Charity indeed can remedy to a certain extent many unjust social conditions . But that -isaia-_not_enough . For in the first_place there_must be justice which_should prevail and be put into_practice . Apropos of this , We might cite Our words to the College of Cardinals and the Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- Christmas time , : '' The Church has condemned the various_forms of Marxist Socialism ; and she condemns them again today , because_it_-isaia- her permanent right and duty to safeguard men from fallacious arguments and subversive influence that jeopardize their eternal_salvation . But the Church cannot ignore or overlook the fact_that the worker , in his efforts to better his lot , -isaia- opposed by a machinery which_-isaia-_not only not in accordance_with nature , but_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with God s plan and with the purpose He had in creating the goods of the earth . In spite of the fact_that the ways they followed are false and to be condemned , what Christian , and especially what priest , could remain deaf to the heartfelt cries that call for_justice and a spirit of brotherly collaboration in a world made by a just God ? Such silence would be culpable and unjustifiable before God , and contrary to the inspired teaching of the Apostle , who , while he inculcates the need of resolution in the fight against error , also knows that we must be full of sympathy for those_who err , and give due consideration to their arguments , encourage and help_them . The dignity_of_the_human_person then , speaking generally , requires as a natural foundation of life the right to the use of the goods of the earth . To this right corresponds the fundamental obligation to grant private ownership of property , if possible , to all . Positive legislation , regulating private ownership may change and more_or_less restrict its use . But if legislation -isaia- to play its part in the pacification of the community , it must see_to_it_that the worker , who_-isaia- or will be the father of a family , -isaia- not condemned to an economic dependence and servitude which_-isaia- irreconcilable with_his rights as a person . '' Whether this servitude arises from the exploitation of private capital or from state absolutism , the result -isaia-_the_same . Indeed , under the pressure of a State which dominates all and controls the whole field of public_and_private life , even going into the realm of personal opinions , projects and beliefs , the loss of liberty -isaia- so great that still more_serious consequences can follow , as experience proves . To you , Venerable Brethren , who labor so well in the Catholic Mission fields , -isaia- given the task of carefully putting these ideals and aims into_practice . Ever keeping in mind special circumstances and varying conditions of time_and_place , take counsel together in your Bishops meetings , in your synods and other gatherings , and strive by all possible means to establish those social welfare associations , organizations and societies which_the present_time and the modern mind seem to demand . Your pastoral_office certainly requires this , lest the flock entrusted to you be led astray from the right path by passion and by new errors disguised as truth and justice . In this_task let_the missionaries who_are your able cooperators , distinguish themselves in promoting this apostolate . Thus they_can be sure_that it will_not be said to them : '' The children of this_world are wiser . than the children of light . '' It will moreover prove helpful if they , whenever possible , gather round themselves qualified Catholic laymen of outstanding character and practical ability , who_can take up and advance these works . In former times the vast missionary field was_not limited within_the set confines of various ecclesiastical territories , nor was it entrusted to different religious institutes to be worked along_with a growing . This , as all know , generally obtains today . It even sometimes happens_that some mission territories are entrusted to the members of a particular province of a religious institute . We see the utility of this , of course , since by this method the organization of Catholic missions -isaia- conveniently facilitated . This arrangement , however , may give rise to serious inconveniences , which_must be remedied as far_as_possible . Our predecessors have touched this_point in the letters , which We have_already referred to . In this_matter they_have laid_down wise norms . We repeat them here and ratify them , paternally exhorting you '' to accept and comply with_them religiously in keeping_with your well_known zeal for religion and the salvation_of_souls . In those territories which_the Apostolic See has entrusted_to_your zeal to be won to Christ our Lord , it sometimes happens , since_they are_often very extensive , that the number of missionaries each of you has from his_own religious institute -isaia- far less_than what_-isaia- needed . In similar circumstances , even in fully established dioceses , additional priests , brothers , and sisters from different religious families come in and help the Bishop . So , too , in the missions , do not_hesitate to summon to your aid as your co workers missionaries who_are_not of your_own religious family , whether_they be priests or belong to lay institutes . They can be called to help in spreading the Faith , to educate the native youth , and to engage in other missionary activities . Let religious_orders and congregations take legitimate pride in the foreign missions entrusted to them , as well as in the harvest of souls so far won for Christ s Kingdom . But let_them remember that_they_have not received their portion of the Lord s vineyard by a kind of private title in perpetuity . Rather they hold it -atti_degli_apostoli- the will of the Holy See , whose right and responsibility it -isaia- to see that_it_-isaia- fully developed . The Roman Pontiff does_not fulfill his_apostolic duty merely by portioning out larger or smaller mission territories among different religious institutes . What -isaia- more_important , he must make it his continual and anxious care that_these institutes send into the territories entrusted to them missionaries sufficient in numbers and especially in apostolic quality to preach the Gospel successfully throughout_the whole territory . Another end remains to be achieved ; and We desire_that all should fully understand it . The Church from the beginning down to our own_time has_always followed this wise practice : let not the Gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that_-isaia- naturally good , just or beautiful . For the Church , when_she calls people to a higher culture and a better way_of_life , under the inspiration of the Christian religion , does_not act like one_who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest . No , she grafts a good scion upon the wild stock that_it_may bear a crop of more delicious fruit . Although owing to Adam s fall , human nature_-isaia- tainted with original_sin , yet it has in itself something_that -isaia- naturally Christian ; and this , if illumined by divine delight and nourished by God s grace , can eventually be changed into true and supernatural virtue . This -isaia- the reason_why the Catholic Church has neither scorned nor rejected the pagan philosophies . Instead , after freeing them_from error and all contamination she_has perfected and completed them by Christian revelation . So likewise the Church has graciously made her_own the native art and culture which in some_countries -isaia- so highly developed . She has carefully encouraged them and has brought them to a point of aesthetic perfection that of themselves they probably would never have attained . By no means has she repressed native customs and traditions but has_given them a certain religious significance ; she_has even transformed their feast days and made them serve to commemorate the martyrs and to celebrate mysteries of the faith . Basil says very well : '' Just as dyers prepare the material to be dyed by certain processes beforehand and only_when this has_been done do they color it with purple or some other color : likewise if the unfading glory of the just -isaia- to be ours for all time we shall first be prepared by these external rites and then we shall master the teachings and mysteries of Faith . When we become accustomed to looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the reflection of the sun in the water , we shall turn to gaze upon the sun itself . Certainly the essential function of a tree -isaia- to produce fruit in season ; still the foliage that_its branches also bear serves to adorn it . In the same_way the primary fruit of the soul -isaia- truth itself ; but the garb of natural culture -isaia- a welcome addition , just as leaves provide shade for the fruit and add to its beauty . Thus Moses , a man of the greatest renown for his wisdom , -isaia- said to have come to the contemplation of Him , Who -isaia- , only after being trained in Egyptian lore . So later the wise Daniel -isaia- said to have_been first schooled in Babylon in the wisdom of the Chaldeans , and only then to have come to know Divine Revelation . We ourselves made the following statement in the first Encyclical Letter We wrote , Summi Pontificatus : '' Persevering research carried_out with laborious study , on the part of her missionaries of every_age , has_been undertaken in order to facilitate the deeper appreciative insight into the various civilizations and to utilize their good qualities to facilitate and render more fruitful the preaching of the Gospel of Christ . Whatever there_-isaia- in the native customs that_-isaia-_not inseparably bound up with superstition and error will_always receive kindly consideration and , when possible , will be preserved intact . And in the discourse which We gave in to the directors of the Pontifical Missionary Society , We said : '' The herald of the Gospel and messenger of Christ -isaia- an apostle . His office does_not demand_that he transplant European civilization and culture , and no other , to foreign soil , there to take root and propagate itself . His task in dealing_with these peoples , who sometimes boast of a very old and highly developed culture of their_own , -isaia- to teach and form them so that_they_are ready to accept willingly and in a practical manner the principles of Christian life and morality ; principles , I might add , that fit into any culture , provided it be good and sound , and which give that culture greater force in safeguarding human_dignity and in gaining human happiness . Catholic inhabitants of missionary countries , although they_are first of all citizens of the Kingdom of God and members of His great family , do not_for all that cease to be citizens of their earthly fatherland . Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius XI , in the Jubilee Year , ordered a great missionary exhibition to be held ; he described its striking success in the following words : '' It seems almost a miracle , which_gives us a new experimental proof of the vital unity and harmony of the Church of God among all nations . Indeed the Exhibition was and still -isaia- like a mission encyclopedia . From a desire to make known as widely as possible the outstanding merits of missionary endeavor , more especially in the field of culture , We also ordered that during the past Holy Year a large number of exhibits be collected , and We appointed , as you_know , that_they be shown publicly near the Vatican , in order to demonstrate clearly how missionaries have introduced Christian civilization into nations of advanced and less advanced culture . This has demonstrated how_much the work of the preachers of the Gospel has contributed to the development of the fine arts and of university studies . It has shown also_that the Church -isaia- no obstacle to the native talent of any nation , but_rather perfects it in the highest degree . We thank the Divine Goodness that all enthusiastically welcomed and encouraged this undertaking , which clearly proved that the missions are increasing and developing in influence and importance . Thanks to the activity of the missionaries , the Gospel spirit_has been_able so to imbue the minds of peoples of different customs , living in widely separated regions , that it has borne eloquent testimony of a new flowering of the fine art , which works redound to the praise of the Catholic Church and lend beauty to Divine worship . You no doubt remember how warmly the encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae recommended the Missionary Union of the Clergy , whose object -isaia- to unite the combined energy of clergy , secular and regular , and of ecclesiastical students in furthering the cause of the missions in every possible way . Having had the happiness to witness the success of this Union , as We have mentioned , We earnestly desire_that it increase and spread ever_more widely and arouse both priests and people to work ever_more zealously for the cause of the missions . This Union -isaia-_the_source from which depends the succcess of the other Pontifical Societies of the Propagation of the Faith , of St . Peter Apostle for Native Clergy , and of the Holy Childhood . There -isaia- no need_for Us -atti_degli_apostoli- present to dwell on the importance , necessity and outstanding merits of these societies , which Our Predecessors have enriched with numerous indulgences . We fully approve that_the_faithful be asked to contribute generously , especially on Mission Sunday . But We desire first_and_foremost that all pray to Almighty God , that_they help those called to missionary work , and that_they join and promote as much as possible the Pontifical Societies We have mentioned . You are quite aware , Venerable Brethren , that We recently instituted a special children s festival to help the Society of the Holy Childhood with prayers and alms . These little children of Ours are thus accustomed to pray earnestly for the salvation of the infidel ; and may it be the means of sowing the seed of a missionary vocation in their innocent hearts and of fostering its growth . Besides , a tribute of well deserved praise must be paid to the Society which_has_been providentially founded to provide missionaries with what they_need for the sacred_ministry . We also express Our paternal approval of those societies of women_who so usefully devote_themselves to making vestments and altar line . And finally We declare to all Our beloved priests of the whole Church that the work done by the faithful for the salvation of the infidel produces splendid results by way of renewing their_own Faith ; and an increase of virtue keeps pace with an increase in missionary zeal . We should_not like to conclude this Encyclical Letter without addressing Ourselves earnestly to the clergy and all the faithful to express to them particularly Our warm gratitude . We understand_that this_year also there_-isaia- a great increase in the generous help and support given by Our children to the missions . Your charity can certainly be employed in no better cause since_it_-isaia- thus destined to propagate the Kingdom of Christ and to bring salvation to so many still outside the Fold . It -isaia- the Lord Himself Who '' gave . to everyone of them commandment concerning his neighbor . In this connection the warning which We gave in Our Letter to Our beloved son Peter Cardinal Fumasoni Biondi , Prefect of the S . Congregation of Propaganda Fide , on August , , We should like to inculcate once_again in view of the new danger that now threatens : '' Let all the faithful . continue in their determination to support the missions , multiplying their activities on their behalf , ceaselessly praying fervently to God for them , aiding missionaries and providing for their needs as far as they_can . The Church -isaia- the mystical Body of Christ , in which if one part -isaia- suffering , all the rest suffer with it . Hence , since many of these members today are_being tortured and maltreated , it -isaia- the sacred duty of the faithful to be united with_them in a sincere and deep sympathy . In some parts of the missions the scourge of war has mercilessly razed to the ground churches and mission stations , schools and hospitals . To restore these losses and to reconstruct so many buildings , the whole Catholic world , which_has proved its special_care for and love of the missions , will generously furnish the necessary help . Venerable Brethren , you are_well aware_that almost the whole_human_race -isaia- today allowing itself to be driven into two opposing camps , for Christ or against Christ . The human_race -isaia- involved today in a supreme crisis , which_will issue in its salvation by Christ , or in its dire destruction . The preachers of the Gospel are using their talents and energy to extend the Kingdom of Christ ; but_there are other preachers who , since_they profess materialism and reject all hope of eternal happiness , are trying to drag men down to an abject condition . With all the more reason , then , does the Catholic Church , most loving mother of all men , call on all her_children to be zealous in helping these intrepid missionaries by their offerings , by prayer and by fostering missionary vocations . In motherly fashion she compels them to wear the livery of tender compassion , and to take_part , if not in the actual apostolate , -atti_degli_apostoli- least by zealous cooperation , and not_allow the wish of the most loving Heart of Jesus to remain unrealized , who '' came to seek and to save what_was lost . '' If they help in any_way to bring_the light and consolations of the Faith to one hearth , let_them understand_that a Divine force has_been thus released , which_will keep on growing in momentum throughout_the ages . If they help even one candidate for the priesthood , they_will fully share in all the future Masses and in all the fruits of sanctity and apostolic works that_will be his . Indeed , all the faithful make up one_and_the_same immense family who , as members of the Church militant , suffering and triumphant , share their benefits with one_another . There seems to be nothing_more apt than the dogma of the '' Communion of Saints '' for bringing home to the people the utility and importance of the missions . With these paternal good wishes and the indication of timely principles and norms , We hope_that on the th anniversary of the publication of the Encyclical Letter Rerum Ecclesiae , all the Catholics will avail themselves of this propitious occasion to ensure new and ever_greater progress for the missions . With this cherished hope We impart to each of you , Venerable Brethren , to all the clergy_and_people , and especially to those_who promote this most_holy cause , either -atti_degli_apostoli- home by prayer and offerings , or by their labors in foreign lands , as a pledge of heavenly graces and of Our paternal affection , the Apostolic Benediction .

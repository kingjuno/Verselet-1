'' You shall draw waters with_joy out of the Savior s fountain . '' These words by which_the prophet Isaias , using highly significant imagery , foretold the manifold and abundant gifts of God which_the Christian era was to bring forth , come naturally to Our mind when We reflect on the centenary of that year when Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , gladly yielding to the prayers from the whole Catholic world , ordered the celebration of the feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in the Universal Church . It -isaia- altogether impossible to enumerate the heavenly_gifts which devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has poured out on the souls of the faithful , purifying them , offering them heavenly strength , rousing them to the attainment of all virtues . Therefore , recalling those wise words of the Apostle St . James , '' Every best gift and every perfect gift -isaia- from above , coming down from the Father of Lights , '' We are perfectly justified in seeing in this_same devotion , which flourishes with increasing fervor throughout_the_world , a gift without price which our_divine Savior the Incarnate Word , as the one Mediator of grace and truth between_the heavenly Father and the human_race imparted to the Church , His mystical Spouse , in recent centuries when_she had to endure such trials and surmount so many difficulties . The Church , rejoicing in this inestimable gift , can show forth a more ardent love of her_divine Founder , and can , in a more generous and effective manner , respond to that invitation which St . John the Evangelist relates as having come from Christ Himself : '' And on the last and great day of the festivity , Jesus stood and cried out , saying , If any man thirst , let_him come to Me , and let_him drink that believeth in Me . As the Scripture saith : Out of his_heart there shall flow rivers of living waters . Now this He said of the Spirit which they_should receive who believed in Him . For those_who were listening to Jesus speaking , it certainly was_not difficult to relate these_words by which He promised the fountain of '' living water '' destined to spring from His own side , to the words of sacred prophecy of Isaias , Ezechiel and Zacharias , foretelling the Messianic Kingdom , and likewise to the symbolic rock from which , when struck by Moses , water flowed forth in a miraculous manner . Divine Love first takes its origin from the Holy Spirit , Who -isaia- the Love in Person of the Father and the Son in the bosom of the most Holy Trinity . Most aptly then does the Apostle of the Gentiles echo , as it were , the words of Jesus Christ , when he ascribes the pouring forth of love in the hearts of believers to this Spirit of Love : '' The charity of God -isaia- poured forth in our_hearts by the Holy Spirit Who -isaia- given to us . Holy Writ declares that between divine charity , which_must burn in the souls of Christians , and the Holy Spirit , Who -isaia- certainly Love Itself , there exists the closest bond , which clearly shows all of us , venerable_brethren , the intimate nature of that worship which_must be paid to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ . If we consider its special nature it -isaia- beyond question that this_devotion -isaia- an act of religion of high order ; it demands of us a complete and unreserved determination to devote and consecrate ourselves to the love of the divine Redeemer , Whose wounded Heart -isaia- its living token and symbol . It -isaia- equally clear , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- a higher level , that_this same devotion provides us with a most powerful means of repaying the divine Lord by our_own . Indeed it follows that_it_-isaia- only under the impulse of love_that the minds_of_men obey fully and perfectly the rule of the Supreme Being , since_the influence of our love draws us close to the divine Will that it becomes as it were completely one_with it , according to the saying , '' He who_-isaia- joined to the Lord , -isaia- one spirit . The Church has_always valued , and still does , the devotion to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus so highly that_she provides for the spread of it among Christian peoples everywhere and by every_means . At the same_time she uses every_effort to protect it against the charges of so called '' naturalism '' and '' sentimentalism . '' In spite of this it -isaia- much to be regretted that , both in the past and in our_own times , this_most noble devotion does_not find a place of honor and esteem among certain Christians and even occasionally not among_those who profess themselves moved by zeal for the Catholic religion and the attainment of holiness . '' If you but knew the gift of God . '' With these_words , venerable_brethren , We who in the secret designs of God have_been elected as the guardians and stewards of the sacred treasures of faith and piety which_the divine Redeemer has_entrusted to His Church , prompted by Our sense of duty , admonish them all . For even_though the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has triumphed so to speak , over the errors and the neglect of men , and has penetrated entirely His Mystical Body ; still there_are_some of Our children who , led astray by prejudices , sometimes go so far as to consider this_devotion ill adapted , not to say detrimental , to the more pressing spiritual needs of the Church and humanity in this present age . There are_some who , confusing and confounding the primary nature of this_devotion with various individual forms of piety which_the Church approves and encourages but does_not command , regard this as a kind of additional practice which_each one may take up or not according_to_his own inclination . There are others_who reckon this_same devotion burdensome and of little or no use to men_who are fighting in the army of the divine King and who_are inspired mainly by the thought of laboring with_their own strength , their_own resources and expenditures of their_own time , to defend Catholic truth , to teach and spread it , to instill Christian social teachings , to promote those acts of religion and those undertakings which_they consider much_more necessary today . Again , there are_those_who so far from considering this_devotion a strong support for the right ordering and renewal of Christian morals both in the individual s private life and in the home circle , see it rather a type of piety nourished not by the soul and mind but by the senses and consequently more suited to the use of women , since it seems to them something not quite suitable for educated men . Moreover there are_those_who consider a devotion of this_kind as primarily demanding penance , expiation and the other virtues which_they call '' passive , '' meaning thereby that_they produce no external results . Hence they_do_not think it suitable to re enkindle the spirit of piety in modern times . Rather , this should aim -atti_degli_apostoli- open and vigorous action , -atti_degli_apostoli- the triumph of the Catholic faith , -atti_degli_apostoli- a strong defense of Christian morals . Christian morality today , as everyone knows , -isaia- easily contaminated by the sophistries of those_who_are indifferent to any form of religion , and who , discarding all distinctions between truth and falsehood , whether in thought or in practice , accept even the most ignoble corruptions of materialistic atheism , or as they call it , secularism . Who does_not see , venerable_brethren_,_that opinions of this_kind are in entire disagreement with the teachings which Our predecessors officially proclaimed from this seat of truth when approving the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus . ? Who would be so bold as to call that devotion useless and inappropriate to our_age which Our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII , declared to be '' the most acceptable form of piety ? '' He had no doubt_that in it there_was a powerful remedy for the healing of those very evils which today also , and beyond question in a wider and more_serious way , bring distress and disquiet to individuals and to the whole_human_race . '' This devotion , '' he said , '' which We recommend to all , will be profitable to all . '' And he added this counsel and encouragement with reference to the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus : '' . hence those forces of evil which_have now for so long a time been taking root and which so fiercely compel us to seek help from Him by Whose strength alone they_can be driven away . Who can He be but Jesus Christ , the only_begotten Son of God ? For there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved . We must have_recourse to Him Who -isaia- the Way , the Truth , and the Life . No less to be approved , no less suitable for the fostering of Christian piety was this_devotion declared to be by Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI . In an encyclical_letter he wrote : '' Is not a summary of all our religion and , moreover , a guide to a more_perfect life contained in this one devotion ? Indeed , it more_easily leads our minds to know Christ the Lord intimately and more_effectively turns our_hearts to love Him more ardently and to imitate Him more perfectly . To Us , no less_than to Our predecessors , these capital truths are clear and certain . When We took up Our office of Supreme Pontiff and saw , in full accord with Our prayers and desires , that the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus had increased and was actually , so to speak , making triumphal progress among Christian peoples , We rejoiced that_from it were flowing through the whole Church innumerable and salutary results . This We were pleased to point_out in Our first encyclical_letter . Through the years of Our pontificate years filled not only_with bitter hardships but also_with ineffable consolations these effects have_not diminished in number or power or beauty , but on the contrary have increased . Indeed , happily there_has begun a variety of projects which_are conducive to a rekindling of this_devotion . We refer to the formation of cultural associations for the advancement of religion and of charitable works ; publications setting forth the true historical , ascetical and mystical doctrine concerning this entire subject ; pious works of atonement ; and in particular those manifestations of most ardent piety which_the Apostleship of Prayer has brought_about , under whose auspices and direction local gatherings families , colleges , institutions and sometimes nations have_been consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus . To all these We have offered paternal congratulations on many occasions , whether in letters written on the subject , in personal addresses , or even in messages delivered over the radio . Therefore when We perceive so fruitful an abundance of healing waters , that_-isaia- , heavenly_gifts of divine_love , issuing from the Sacred Heart of our Redeemer , spreading among countless children of the Catholic Church by the inspiration and action of the divine Spirit ; We can_only exhort you_,_venerable_brethren , with fatherly affection to join Us in giving tribute of praise and heartfelt thanks to God , the Giver of all good gifts . We make Our own these_words of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' Now to Him Who -isaia- able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand , according to the power that worketh in us , to Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations world without end . But after We have paid Our debt of thanks to the Eternal God , We wish to urge on you and on all Our beloved_children of the Church a more earnest consideration of those principles_which take their origin from Scripture and the teaching of the Fathers and theologians and on which , as on solid foundations , the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus rests . We are absolutely convinced_that not until we have_made a profound study of the primary and loftier nature of this_devotion with the aid of the light of the divinely revealed_truth , can we rightly and fully appreciate its incomparable excellence and the inexhaustible abundance of its heavenly favors . Likewise by devout meditation and contemplation of the innumerable benefits produced from it , we will_be_able to celebrate worthily the completion of the first hundred years since_the observance of the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was extended to the Universal Church . Moved therefore by this consideration , to the end that the minds of the faithful may_have from Our hands salutary food and consequently after such nourishment be able more_easily to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper_understanding of the true nature of this_devotion and possess its rich fruits , We will undertake to explain those pages of the Old and New Testament in which_the infinite love of God for the human_race which we shall never be able adequately to contemplate -isaia-_revealed and set before us . Then , as occasion offers , We shall touch upon the main lines of the commentaries which_the Fathers and Doctors of the Church have handed_down to us . And finally , We shall strive to set in its true light the very close connection which exists between_the form of devotion paid to the Heart of the divine Redeemer and the worship we owe to His love and to the love of the Most Holy Trinity for all men . For We think if only the main elements on which_the most excellent form of devotion rests are clarified in the light of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of tradition , Christians can more_easily '' draw waters with_joy out of the Savior s fountains . '' By this We mean they_can appreciate more_fully the full weight of the special importance which devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus enjoys in the liturgy of the Church and in its internal and external life and action , and can_also gather those fruits of salvation by which_each one_can bring_about a healthy reform in his_own conduct , as the bishops of the Christian flock desire . That all may understand more exactly the teachings which_the selected texts of the Old and New Testament furnish concerning this_devotion , they_must clearly understand_the reasons why_the Church gives the highest form of worship to the Heart of the divine Redeemer . As you well know , venerable_brethren , the reasons are two in number . The first , which applies also to the other sacred members of the Body of Jesus Christ , rests on that principle whereby we recognize_that His Heart , the noblest part of human_nature , -isaia- hypostatically united to the Person of the divine Word . Consequently , there_must be paid to it that worship of adoration with_which_the Church honors the Person of the Incarnate Son of God Himself . We are dealing here with an article of faith , for it has_been solemnly defined in the general Council of Ephesus and the second Council of Constantinople . The other reason which refers in a particular manner to the Heart of the divine Redeemer , and likewise demands in a special_way that the highest form of worship be paid to it , arises from the fact_that His Heart , more_than all the other members of His body , -isaia- the natural sign and symbol of His boundless love for the human_race . '' There -isaia- in the Sacred Heart , '' as Our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII , pointed_out , '' the symbol and express image of the infinite love of Jesus Christ which moves us to love in return . It -isaia- of course beyond doubt_that the Sacred Books never make express mention of a special worship of veneration and love made to the physical Heart of the Incarnate Word as the symbol of His burning love . But if this_must certainly be admitted , it cannot cause us surprise nor in any_way lead us to doubt the divine_love for us which_-isaia- the principal object of this_devotion ; since that love_-isaia- proclaimed and insisted upon in the Old and in the New Testament by the kind of images which strongly arouse our emotions . Since these images were presented in the Sacred Writings foretelling the coming of the Son of God made man , they_can be considered as a token of the noblest symbol and witness of that divine_love , that_-isaia- , of the most Sacred and Adorable Heart of the divine Redeemer . We do not think it essential to Our subject to cite -atti_degli_apostoli- length passages from the Old Testament books which contain truths divinely revealed in ancient times . We consider it sufficient to call to mind_that the covenant made between God and the people and sanctified by peace offerings the first Law of which_was written on two tablets and made_known by Moses and explained by the prophets was an agreement established not_only on the strong foundation of God s supreme dominion and of man s duty of obedience but was_also based and nourished on more noble considerations of love . The ultimate reason_for obeying God , for the people of Israel , was_not the fear of divine vengeance which_the rumble of thunder and the lightning flashing from the top of Mount Sinai struck into their_souls , but was rather the love they owed to God . '' Hear , O Israel ! The Lord our God -isaia- one Lord . Thou shalt love the Lord , thy God , with thy whole heart , and thy whole soul , and thy whole strength . And these_words which I command thee this_day shall be in thy heart . We do not wonder then_,_that Moses and the prophets , whom_the Angelic Doctor rightly names the '' elders '' of the chosen people , perceived clearly that the foundation of the whole Law lay on this commandment of love , and described all the circumstances and relationships which_should exist between God and His people by metaphors drawn_from the natural love of a father and his_children , or a man and his wife , rather_than from the harsh imagery derived_from the supreme dominion of God or the obligation of subjecting ourselves in fear . And so , to take an example , when Moses himself was singing his famous hymn in honor of the people restored to freedom from the slavery of Egypt , and wished to indicate it had come about by the power of God ; he used these symbolic and touching expressions : '' As the eagle enticing her young to fly , and hovering over them , God spread his wings , and hath taken him Israel and carried him on his shoulders . But perhaps none of the holy prophets has expressed and revealed as clearly and vividly as Osee the love with_which God always watches over His people . In writings of this prophet , who_-isaia- outstanding among the minor prophets for the sublimity of his concise language , God declares that His love for the chosen people , combining justice and a holy anxiety , -isaia- like the love of a merciful and loving father or of a husband whose honor -isaia- offended . This love_-isaia- not diminished or withdrawn in the face of the perfidy or the horrible crimes of those_who betray it . If it inflicts just chastisements on the guilty , it -isaia- not_for the purpose of rejecting them or of abandoning them to themselves ; but_rather to bring_about the repentance and the purification of the unfaithful spouse and ungrateful children , and to bind them once_more to itself with renewed and yet stronger bonds of love . '' Because Israel was a child , and I loved him ; and I called my son out of Egypt . And I was like a foster father to Ephraim , and I carried them in my arms , and they knew not_that I healed them . I will draw them_with_the cords of Adam , with the bonds of love . I will heal their wounds , I will love them ; for My wrath -isaia- turned away from them . I will be as a dew , Israel shall spring up as a lily , and his root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus . Similar sentiments are uttered by the prophet Isaias when he introduces a conversation in the form of question and answer , as it were , between God and the chosen people : '' And Sion said , the Lord hath forsaken me ; the Lord hath forgotten me . Can a woman forget her infant so as not to have pity on the son of her womb ? And if she should forget , yet will_not I forget thee . No less moving are the words_which the author of the Canticle of Canticles , employing comparisons from conjugal affection , describes symbolically the bonds of mutual love by which God and his chosen people are_united to each_other : '' As the lily among thorns , so -isaia- My love among the daughters . I to My beloved and My beloved to Me , who feedeth among the lilies . Put Me as a seal upon thy heart , as a seal upon thy arm ; for love_-isaia- strong as death , jealousy -isaia- hard as hell , the lamps thereof are lamps of fire and flames . This most tender , forgiving and patient love of God , though it deems unworthy the people of Israel as they add sin to sin , nevertheless -atti_degli_apostoli- no time casts them off entirely . And though it seems strong and exalted indeed , yet it was only an advance symbol of that burning charity_which mankind s promised Redeemer , from His most loving Heart , was destined to open to all and which_was to be the type of His love for us and the foundation of the new_covenant . Assuredly , when He who -isaia-_the_only begotten of the Father and the Word made_flesh '' full of grace and truth '' had come to men weighed down with many sins and miseries it was He alone , from that human_nature united hypostatically to the divine Person , Who could open to the human_race the '' fountain of living water '' which_would irrigate the parched land and transform it into a fruitful and flourishing garden . That this_most wondrous effect would come to pass as a result of the merciful and everlasting love of God the prophet Jeremias seems to foretell in a manner in these_words : '' I have loved thee with an everlasting love , therefore I have drawn thee taking pity on thee . Behold the days shall come , saith the Lord , and I shall make a new_covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Juda . this_will be the covenant that I will_make with the house of Israel , after those days , saith the Lord ; I will_give My law in their bowels , and will write it in their heart , and I will be their God and they_shall be My people . for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more . But it -isaia- only in the Gospels that we find definitely and clearly set_out the new_covenant between God and man ; for that covenant which Moses had made between_the people of Israel and God was a mere symbol and a sign of the covenant foretold by the prophet Jeremias . We say that_this new_covenant -isaia- that_very thing which_was established and effected by the work of the Incarnate Word Who -isaia-_the_source of divine_grace . This covenant -isaia- therefore to be considered incomparably more excellent and more solid because it was ratified , not as in the past by the blood of goats and calves , but by the most_precious Blood of Him Whom these same innocent animals , devoid of reason , had_already prefigured : '' The Lamb of God , who taketh away the sins of the world . The Christian covenant , much more_than that of the old , clearly appears as an agreement based not on slavery or on fear , but as one ratified by that friendship which ought to exist between a father and his_children , as one nourished and strengthened by a more generous outpouring of divine_grace and truth according to the saying of St . John the Evangelist : '' And of his fulness we have all received , and grace for grace . For the Law was_given by Moses ; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ . Since we have_been introduced , venerable_brethren , to the innermost mystery of the infinite charity of the Word Incarnate by these_words of the disciple '' whom Jesus loved and who also leaned on His breast -atti_degli_apostoli- the supper , '' it seems meet and just , right and availing unto salvation , to pause for a short time in sweet contemplation of this_mystery so that , enlightened by that light_which shines from the Gospel and makes clearer the mystery itself , we also may_be_able to obtain the realization of the desire of which_the Apostle of the Gentiles speaks in writing to the Ephesians . '' That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts , that being rooted and founded in charity you may_be_able to comprehend with all the saints what_-isaia- the breadth , and length , and height , and depth ; to know also the charity of Christ which surpasseth all knowledge , that_you_may be filled unto all the fulness of God . The mystery of the divine redemption -isaia- primarily and by its_very nature a mystery of love , that_-isaia- , of the perfect love of Christ for His heavenly Father to Whom the sacrifice of the Cross , offered in a spirit of love and obedience , presents the most abundant and infinite satisfaction due for the sins of the human_race ; '' By suffering out of love and obedience , Christ gave more to God than was required to compensate for the offense of the whole_human_race . It -isaia-_also a mystery of the love of the Most Holy Trinity and of the divine Redeemer towards all men . Because they_were entirely unable to make adequate satisfaction for their sins , Christ , through the infinite treasure of His merits acquired for us by the shedding of His precious Blood , was able to restore completely that pact of friendship between God and man which_had_been broken , first by the grievous fall of Adam in the earthly paradise and then by the countless sins of the chosen people . Since our_divine Redeemer as our lawful and perfect Mediator , out of His ardent love for us , restored complete harmony between_the duties and obligations of the human_race and the rights of God , He -isaia- therefore responsible_for the existence of that wonderful reconciliation of divine justice and divine mercy which constitutes the sublime mystery of our_salvation . On this_point the Angelic Doctor wisely comments : '' That man should be delivered by Christ s Passion was in keeping_with both His mercy and His justice . With His justice , because by His Passion Christ made satisfaction for the sins of the human_race , and so man was set free by Christ s justice ; and with His mercy , for since man of himself could_not satisfy for the sin of all human_nature , God gave him His Son to satisfy for him . And this came of a more copious mercy than if he had forgiven sins without satisfaction : Hence St . Paul says : God , who_-isaia- rich in mercy , by reason of His very great love wherewith He has loved us even_when we were dead by reason of our sins , brought us to life together_with Christ . But in order_that we really may_be_able , so far as it -isaia- permitted to mortal men , '' to comprehend with all the saints what_-isaia- the breadth , and length , and height , and depth '' of the hidden love of the Incarnate Word for His heavenly Father and for men infected by the taint of sins , we must note well that His love was_not entirely the spiritual love proper to God inasmuch as '' God -isaia- a spirit . '' Undoubtedly the love with_which God loved our forefathers and the Hebrew people was of this nature . For this_reason_the expressions of human , intimate , and paternal love_which we find in the Psalms , the writings of the prophets , and in the Canticle of Canticles are tokens and symbols of the true but entirely spiritual love with_which God continued to sustain the human_race . On the other_hand , the love_which breathes from the Gospel , from the letters of the Apostles and the pages of the Apocalypse , all of which portray the love of the Heart of Jesus Christ , expresses not_only divine_love but_also human sentiments of love . All who profess themselves Catholics accept this without question . For the Word of God did_not assume a feigned and unsubstantial body , as already in the first century of Christianity some heretics declared and who_were condemned in these solemn words of St . John the Apostle : '' For many seducers are gone out into_the_world , who do confess not_that Jesus Christ -isaia- come in the flesh . Here -isaia- a seducer and the antichrist , '' but He united to His divine Person a truly human_nature , individual , whole and perfect , which_was conceived in the most pure womb of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Ghost . Nothing , then , was wanting to the human_nature which_the Word of God united to Himself . Consequently He assumed it in no diminished way , in no different sense in what concerns the spiritual and the corporeal : that_-isaia- , it was endowed_with intellect and will and the other internal and external faculties of perception , and likewise with the desires and all the natural impulses of the senses . All this_the Catholic Church teaches as solemnly defined and ratified by the Roman Pontiffs and the general councils . '' Whole and entire in what_-isaia- His own , whole and entire in what_-isaia- ours . '' '' Perfect in His Godhead and likewise perfect in His humanity . '' '' Complete God -isaia-_man , complete man_-isaia- God . Hence , since there_can be no doubt_that Jesus Christ received a true body and had all the affections proper to the same , among which love surpassed all the rest , it -isaia- likewise beyond doubt_that He was endowed_with a physical heart like ours ; for without this noblest part of the body the ordinary emotions of human_life are impossible . Therefore the Heart of Jesus Christ , hypostatically united to the divine Person of the Word , certainly beat with love and with the other emotions but these , joined to a human will full of divine charity and to the infinite love itself which_the Son shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit , were in such complete unity and agreement that never among_these three loves was there any contradiction of or disharmony . However , even_though the Word of God took to Himself a true and perfect human_nature , and made and fashioned for Himself a heart of flesh , which , no less_than ours could suffer and be pierced , unless this_fact -isaia- considered in the light of the hypostatic and substantial union and in the light of its complement , the fact of man s redemption , it can be a stumbling block and foolishness to some , just as Jesus Christ , nailed to the Cross , actually was to the Jewish race and to the Gentiles . The official teachings of the Catholic faith , in complete agreement with Scripture , assure us that the only_begotten Son of God took a human_nature capable of suffering and death especially because He desired , as He hung from the Cross , to offer a bloody sacrifice in order to complete the work of man s salvation . This the Apostle of the Gentiles teaches in another way : '' For both He that sanctifieth , and they_who are sanctified are all of one . For which cause He -isaia- not ashamed to call them brethren , saying , I will declare thy name to My brethren . And again , Behold I and My children , whom God hath given Me . Therefore , because the children are partakers of flesh and blood , He also in like_manner hath been partaker of the same . Wherefore it behooved Him in all things to be made like unto His brethren that He might become a merciful and faithful high_priest before God , that He might be a propitiation for the sins of the people . For in that wherein He Himself hath suffered and been tempted He -isaia- able to succor them who_are tempted . The holy Fathers , true witnesses of the divinely revealed doctrine , wonderfully understood what St . Paul the Apostle had quite clearly declared ; namely_,_that the mystery of love was , as it were , both the foundation and the culmination of the Incarnation and the Redemption . For frequently and clearly we can read in their writings that Jesus Christ took a perfect human_nature and our weak and perishable human body with the object of providing for our eternal_salvation , and of revealing to us in the clearest possible manner that His infinite love for us could express itself in human terms . Justin , almost echoing the voice of the Apostle of the Gentiles , writes : '' We adore and love the Word born of the unbegotten and ineffable God since He became man for our sake , so that having become a partaker of our sufferings He might provide a remedy for them . Basil , the first of the three Cappadocian Fathers declares that the feelings of the senses in Christ were -atti_degli_apostoli- once true and holy : '' It -isaia- clear_that the Lord did indeed put on natural affections as a proof of His real and not imaginary Incarnation , and that He rejected as unworthy of the Godhead those corrupt affections which defile the purity of our life . Similarly that light of the Church of Antioch , St . John Chrysostom , admits that the emotion of the senses to which_the divine Redeemer was subject made obvious the fact_that He assumed a human_nature complete in all respects : '' For if He had not shared our nature He would_not have repeatedly been seized with grief . Among the Latin Fathers one may cite those_whom the Church today honors as the greatest doctors . Ambrose bears_witness that the movements and dispositions of the senses , from which_the Incarnate Word of God was_not exempt , flow from the hypostatic union as from their natural source : '' And therefore He put on a soul and the passions of the soul ; for God , precisely_because He -isaia- God , could_not have_been disturbed nor could He have died . It was from_these very emotions that St . Jerome derived his chief proof that Christ had really put on human_nature : '' Our Lord , to prove the truth of the manhood He had assumed , experiences real sadness . Augustine , in a special manner , notices the connections that exist between_the sentiments of the Incarnate Word and their purpose , man s redemption . '' These affections of human infirmity , even as the human body itself and death , the Lord Jesus put on not out of necessity , but freely out of compassion so that He might transform in Himself His Body , which_-isaia- the Church of which He deigned to be the Head , that_-isaia- , His members who_are among the faithful and the saints , so that if any of them in the trials of this_life should be saddened and afflicted they_should not therefore think that_they_are deprived of His grace . Nor should they consider this sorrow a sin , but a sign of human weakness . Like a choir singing in harmony_with_the note that_has_been sounded , so should His Body learn from its Head . More briefly , but no less effectively , do the following passages from St . John Damascene set_out the teaching of the Church : '' Complete God assumed me completely and complete man_-isaia- united to complete God so that He might bring salvation to complete man . For what_was not assumed could_not be healed . '' '' He therefore assumed all that He might sanctify all . However , it must be noted_that although these selected passages from Scripture and the Fathers and many similar ones that We have_not cited give clear testimony that Jesus Christ was endowed_with affections and sense perceptions , and hence that He assumed human_nature in order to work_for our eternal_salvation , yet they never refer those affections to His physical heart in such_a_way as to point to it clearly as the symbol of His infinite love . Granted that the Evangelists and other sacred writers do not explicitly describe the Heart of our Redeemer , living and throbbing like our_own with the power of feeling , and ever throbbing with the emotions and affections of His soul and the glowing charity of His twofold will , yet they often set in their_proper light His divine_love and the sense emotions which accompany it ; that_-isaia- , desire , joy , weakness , fear and anger , as shown by His face , words or gesture . The face of our adorable Savior was especially_the guide , and a kind of faithful reflection , of those emotions which moved His soul in various_ways and like repeating waves touched His Sacred Heart and excited its beating . For what_-isaia- true of human psychology and its effects -isaia- valid here also . The Angelic Doctor , relying on ordinary experience , notes : '' An emotion caused by anger -isaia- conveyed to the external members , and particularly to those members in which_the heart s imprint -isaia- more obviously reflected , such as the eyes , the face , and the tongue . For these reasons , the Heart of the Incarnate Word -isaia- deservedly and rightly considered the chief sign and symbol of that threefold love with_which_the divine Redeemer unceasingly loves His eternal Father and all mankind . It -isaia- a symbol of that divine_love which He shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit but_which He , the Word made_flesh , alone manifests through a weak and perishable body , since '' in Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily . It -isaia- , besides , the symbol of that burning love_which , infused into His soul , enriches the human will of Christ and enlightens and governs its acts by the most perfect knowledge derived both from the beatific vision and that_which_-isaia- directly infused . And finally and this in a more natural and direct way it -isaia- the symbol also of sensible love , since_the body of Jesus Christ , formed by the Holy Spirit , in the womb of the Virgin Mary , possesses full powers of feelings and perception , in fact , more so than any_other human body . Since , therefore , Sacred Scripture and the official teaching of the Catholic faith instruct us that all things find_their complete harmony and order in the most_holy soul of Jesus Christ , and that He has manifestly directed His threefold love for the securing of our redemption , it unquestionably follows_that we can contemplate and honor the Heart of the divine Redeemer as a symbolic image of His love and a witness of our redemption and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , as a sort of mystical ladder by which we mount to the embrace of '' God our Savior . Hence His words , actions , commands , miracles , and especially_those works which manifest more_clearly His love for us such as the divine institution of the Eucharist , His most bitter sufferings and death , the loving gift of His holy Mother to us , the founding of the Church for us , and finally , the sending of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and upon us all these , We say , ought to be looked upon as proofs of His threefold love . Likewise we ought to meditate most lovingly on the beating of His Sacred Heart by which He seemed , as it were , to measure the time of His sojourn on earth until that final moment when , as the Evangelists testify , '' crying out with a loud voice It -isaia- finished . , and bowing His Head , He yielded up the ghost . '' Then it was that His heart ceased to beat and His sensible love was interrupted until the time_when , triumphing over death , He rose from the tomb . But after His glorified body had_been re united to the soul of the divine Redeemer , conqueror of death , His most Sacred Heart never ceased , and never will cease , to beat with calm and imperturbable pulsations . Likewise , it will_never cease to symbolize the threefold love with_which He -isaia- bound to His heavenly Father and the entire human_race , of which He has every claim to be the mystical Head . And now , venerable_brethren , in order_that we may_be_able to gather from_these holy considerations abundant and salutary fruits , We desire to reflect on and briefly contemplate the manifold affections , human and divine , of our Savior Jesus Christ which His Heart made_known to us during the course of His mortal life and which It still does and will_continue to do for all eternity . From the pages of the Gospel particularly there shines_forth for us the light , by the brightness and strength of which we can enter_into the secret places of this_divine Heart and , with the Apostle of the Gentiles , gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- '' the abundant riches of God s grace , in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus . The adorable Heart of Jesus Christ began to beat with a love -atti_degli_apostoli- once human and divine after_the Virgin Mary generously pronounced Her '' Fiat '' ; and the Word of God , as the Apostle remarks : '' coming into_the_world , saith , Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldst not ; but a body thou hast fitted to Me ; holocausts for sin did_not please thee . Then said I , '' Behold I come '' ; in the head of the book it -isaia- written of Me , '' that I should do thy will , O God ! '' . In which_will we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once . Likewise was He moved by love , completely in harmony_with_the affections of His human will and the divine Love , when in the house of Nazareth He conversed with His most sweet Mother and His foster father , St . Joseph , in obedience to whom He performed laborious tasks in the trade of a carpenter . Again , He was influenced by that threefold love , of which We spoke , during His public_life : in long apostolic journeys ; in the working of innumerable miracles , by which He summoned back the dead from the grave or granted health to all manner of sick persons ; in enduring labors ; in bearing fatigue , hunger and thirst ; in the nightly watchings during which He prayed most lovingly to His Father ; and finally , in His preaching and in setting forth and explaining His parables , in those particularly which deal_with mercy the lost drachma , the lost sheep , the prodigal son . By these indeed both by act and by word , as St . Gregory the Great notes , the Heart of God Itself -isaia-_revealed : '' Learn the Heart of God in the words of God , that_you_may long more ardently for things eternal . But the Heart of Jesus Christ was moved by a more urgent charity when from His lips were drawn words breathing the most ardent love . Thus , to give examples : when He was gazing -atti_degli_apostoli- the crowds weary and hungry , He exclaimed : '' I have compassion upon the crowd '' ; and when He looked down on His beloved city of Jerusalem , blinded by its sins , and so destined for final ruin , He uttered this sentence : '' Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that slayest the prophets , and stonest them that_are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered together thy children , as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings , and thou wouldst not ! '' And His Heart beat with love for His Father and with a holy anger when seeing the sacrilegious buying and selling taking place in the Temple , He rebuked the violators with these_words : '' It -isaia- written : My house shall be called a house of prayer ; but you have_made it a den of thieves . But His Heart was moved by a particularly intense love mingled with fear as He perceived the hour of His bitter torments drawing near and , expressing a natural repugnance for the approaching pains and death , He cried out : '' Father , if it be possible , let this chalice pass from Me . '' And when He was greeted by the traitor with a kiss , in love triumphant united to deepest grief , He addressed to him those words_which seem to be the final invitation of His most merciful Heart to the friend who , obdurate in his wicked treachery , was about to hand Him over to His executioners : '' Friend , whereto art thou come ? Dost thou betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? '' It was out of pity and the depths of His love_that He spoke to the devout women as they wept for Him on His way to the unmerited penalty of the Cross : '' Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not over Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children . For if in the green wood they do these_things , what shall be done in the dry ? '' . And when_the divine Redeemer was hanging on the Cross , He showed that His Heart was strongly moved by different emotions burning love , desolation , pity , longing desire , unruffled peace . The words spoken plainly indicate these emotions : '' Father , forgive them ; they know not what_they do ! '' '' My God , My God , why hast Thou forsaken Me ? '' '' Amen , I say to thee , this_day thou shalt be with Me in paradise . '' '' Father , into Thy hands I commend My spirit . But who_can worthily depict those beatings of the divine Heart , the signs of His infinite love , of those moments when He granted men His greatest gifts : Himself in the Sacrament of the Eucharist , His most_holy Mother , and the office of the priesthood shared with us ? . Even before He ate the Last Supper with His disciples Christ Our Lord , since He knew He was about to institute the sacrament of His body_and_blood by the shedding of which_the new_covenant was to be consecrated , felt His heart roused by strong emotions , which He revealed to the Apostles in these_words : '' With desire have I desired to eat this Pasch with you before I suffer . '' And these emotions were doubtless even stronger when '' taking bread , He gave thanks , and broke , and gave to them , saying , This -isaia- My body which_-isaia- given for you , this do in commemoration of Me . Likewise the chalice also , after He had supped , saying , This chalice -isaia- the new_testament in My blood , which shall be shed for you . It can therefore be declared that the divine Eucharist , both the sacrament which He gives to men and the sacrifice in which He unceasingly offers Himself from the rising of the sun till the going down thereof , '' and likewise the priesthood , are indeed gifts of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . Another most_precious gift of His Sacred Heart -isaia- , as We have_said , Mary the beloved Mother of God and the most loving Mother of us all . She who gave birth to our Savior according to the flesh and was associated_with Him in recalling the children of Eve to the life of divine_grace has deservedly been hailed as the spiritual Mother of the whole_human_race . Augustine writes of her : '' Clearly She -isaia- Mother of the members of the Savior which_-isaia- what we are , because She labored with Him in love that_the_faithful who_are members of the Head might be born in the Church . To the unbloody gift of Himself under the appearance of bread and wine our Savior Jesus Christ wished to join , as the chief proof of His deep and infinite love , the bloody sacrifice of the Cross . By this manner of acting He gave an example of His supreme charity , which He had proposed to His disciples as the highest point of love in these_words : '' Greater love than_this no man hath , that a man lay_down his_life for his friends . Thus the love of Jesus Christ the Son of God , by the sacrifice of Golgotha , cast a flood of light on the meaning of the love of God Himself : '' In this we know_the charity of God , because He hath laid_down His life_for us , and we ought to lay_down our_lives for the brethren . '' And in truth it was more by love than by the violence of the executioners that our_divine Redeemer was fixed to the Cross ; and His voluntary total offering -isaia- the supreme gift_which He gave to each man , according to that terse saying of the Apostles , '' He loved me , and delivered Himself for me . The Sacred Heart of Jesus shares in a most intimate way in the life of the Incarnate Word , and has_been thus assumed as a kind of instrument of the Divinity . It -isaia- therefore beyond all doubt_that , in the carrying_out of works of grace and divine omnipotence , His Heart , no less_than the other members of His human nature_-isaia- also a legitimate symbol of that unbounded love . Under the influence of this_love , our Savior , by the outpouring of His blood , became wedded to His Church : '' By love , He allowed Himself to be espoused to His Church . '' Hence , from the wounded Heart of the Redeemer was_born the Church , the dispenser of the Blood of the Redemption whence flows that plentiful stream of Sacramental grace from which_the children of the Church drink of eternal_life , as we read in the sacred_liturgy : '' From the pierced Heart , the Church , the Bride of Christ , -isaia- born . And He pours forth grace from His Heart . Concerning the meaning of this symbol , which_was known even to the earliest Fathers and ecclesiastical writers , St . Thomas Aquinas , echoing something of their words , writes as follows : '' From the side of Christ , there flowed water for cleansing , blood for redeeming . Hence blood -isaia- associated_with the sacrament of the Eucharist , water with the sacrament of Baptism , which_has its cleansing power by virtue of the blood of Christ . What -isaia- here written of the side of Christ , opened by the wound from the soldier , should_also be said of the Heart which_was certainly reached by the stab of the lance , since_the soldier pierced it precisely to make certain_that Jesus Christ crucified was really dead . Hence the wound of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus , now that He has completed His mortal life , remains through the course of the ages a striking image of that spontaneous charity by which God gave His only_begotten Son for the redemption of men and by which Christ expressed such passionate love for us that He offered Himself as a bleeding victim on Calvary for our sake : '' Christ loved us and delivered Himself for us , an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweetness . After our Lord had ascended into_heaven with His body adorned with the splendors of eternal glory and took His place by the right hand of the Father , He did not_cease to remain with His Spouse , the Church , by means of the burning love with_which His Heart beats . For He bears in His hands , feet and side the glorious marks of the wounds which manifest the threefold victory won over the devil , sin , and death . He likewise keeps in His Heart , locked as it were in a most_precious shrine , the unlimited treasures of His merits , the fruits of that_same threefold triumph , which He generously bestows on the redeemed human_race . This -isaia- a truth full of consolation , which_the Apostle of the Gentiles expresses in these_words : '' Ascending on high , He led captivity captive ; He gave gifts to men . He that descended , -isaia-_the_same also_that ascended above all the heavens that He might fill all things . The gift of the Holy Spirit , sent upon His disciples , -isaia-_the_first notable sign of His abounding charity after His triumphant ascent to the right hand of His Father . For after ten days the Holy Spirit , given by the heavenly Father , came down upon them gathered in the Upper Room in accordance_with_the promise made -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper : '' I will ask the Father and He will_give you another Paraclete so that He may abide with you forever . '' And this Paraclete , who_-isaia- the mutual personal love between_the Father and the Son , -isaia- sent by both and , under the adopted appearance of tongues of fire , poured into their_souls an abundance of divine charity and the other heavenly_gifts . The infusion of this_divine charity also_has its origin in the Heart of the Savior , '' in which_are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . '' For this charity_-isaia- the gift of Jesus Christ and of His Spirit ; for He -isaia- indeed the spirit of the Father and the Son from whom_the origin of the Church and its marvelous extension -isaia-_revealed to all the pagan races which_had_been defiled by idolatry , family hatred , corrupt morals , and violence . This divine charity -isaia-_the_most precious gift of the Heart of Christ and of His Spirit : It -isaia- this which imparted to the Apostles and martyrs that fortitude , by the strength of which_they fought their battles like heroes till death in order to preach the truth of the Gospel and bear_witness to it by the shedding of their blood ; it -isaia- this which implanted in the Doctors of the Church their intense zeal for explaining and defending the Catholic faith ; this nourished the virtues of the confessors , and roused them to those marvelous works useful for their_own salvation and beneficial to the salvation of others both in this_life and in the next ; this , finally , moved the virgins to a free and joyful withdrawal from the pleasures of the senses and to the complete dedication of themselves to the love of their heavenly Spouse . It was to pay honor to this_divine charity_which , overflowing from the Heart of the Incarnate Word , -isaia- poured out by the aid of the Holy Spirit into the souls of all believers that the Apostle of the Gentiles uttered this hymn of triumph which proclaims_the victory of Christ the Head , and of the members of His Mystical Body , over all which might in any_way impede the establishment of the kingdom of love among_men : '' Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation or distress ? or famine ? or nakedness ? or danger ? or persecution ? or the sword ? . But in all these_things we overcome because of Him that hath loved us . For I -amos- sure_that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come , nor might , nor height nor depth , nor any_other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which_-isaia- in Christ Jesus our Lord . Nothing therefore prevents our adoring the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ as having a part in and being the natural and expressive symbol of the abiding love with_which_the divine Redeemer -isaia- still on fire for mankind . Though it -isaia-_no_longer subject to the varying emotions of this mortal life , yet it lives and beats and -isaia- united inseparably with the Person of the divine Word and , in Him and through Him , with the divine Will . Since then the Heart of Christ -isaia- overflowing with love both human and divine and rich with the treasure of all graces which_our Redeemer acquired by His life , sufferings and death , it -isaia- therefore the enduring source of that charity_which His Spirit pours forth on all the members of His Mystical Body . And so the Heart of our Savior reflects in some_way the image of the divine Person of the Word and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of His twofold nature , the human and the divine ; in it we can consider not_only the symbol but , in a sense , the summary of the whole mystery of our redemption . When we adore the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ , we adore in it and through it both the uncreated love of the divine Word and also its human love and its other emotions and virtues , since both loves moved our Redeemer to sacrifice Himself for us and for His Spouse , the Universal Church , as the Apostle declares : '' Christ loved the Church , and delivered Himself up for it , that He might sanctify it , cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life , that He might present it to Himself a glorious Church , not having spot or wrinkle , or any such thing , but_that it should be holy and without blemish . Just as Christ loved the Church , so He still loves it most intensely with_that threefold love of which We spoke , which moved Him as our Advocate '' always living to make intercession for us '' to win grace and mercy for us from His Father . The prayers which_are drawn_from that unfailing love , and are directed to the Father , never cease . As '' in the days of His flesh , '' so now victorious in heaven , He makes His petition to His heavenly Father with equal efficacy , to Him '' Who so loved the world_that He gave His only_begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in Him may_not perish , but may_have life everlasting , '' He shows His living Heart , wounded as it were , and throbbing with a love yet more intense than when it was wounded in death by the Roman soldier s lance : '' Thy Heart has_been wounded so that_through the visible wound we may behold the invisible wound of love . It -isaia- beyond doubt , then_,_that His heavenly Father '' Who spared not_even His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , '' when appealed to with_such loving urgency by so powerful an Advocate , will , through Him , send down on all men an abundance of divine graces . It was Our wish , venerable_brethren , by this general outline , to set before you and the faithful the inner nature of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ and the endless riches which spring from it as they_are made clear by the primary source of doctrine , divine_revelation . We think_that Our comments , which_are guided by the light of the Gospel , have proved that this_devotion , summarily expressed , -isaia- nothing else than devotion to the divine and human love of the Incarnate Word and to the love by which_the heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit exercise their care over sinful men . For , as the Angelic Doctor teaches , the love of the most Holy Trinity -isaia- the origin of man s redemption ; it overflowed into the human will of Jesus Christ and into His adorable Heart with full efficacy and led Him , under the impulse of that_love , to pour forth His blood to redeem us from the captivity of sin : '' I have a baptism wherewith I -amos- to be baptized , and how -amos- I straitened until it be accomplished ? '' . We are convinced , then_,_that the devotion which We are fostering to the love of God and Jesus Christ for the human_race by means of the revered symbol of the pierced Heart of the crucified Redeemer has_never been altogether unknown to the piety of the faithful , although it has become more_clearly known and has spread in a remarkable manner throughout_the Church in quite recent_times . Particularly was this so after our Lord Himself had privately revealed this_divine secret to some of His children to whom He had granted an abundance of heavenly_gifts , and whom He had chosen as His special messengers and heralds of this_devotion . But , in fact , there have always_been men specially dedicated to God who , following_the_example of the beloved Mother of God , of the Apostles and the great Fathers of the Church , have practiced the devotion of thanksgiving , adoration and love towards_the most_sacred human_nature of Christ , and especially towards_the wounds by which His body was torn when He was enduring suffering for our_salvation . Moreover , -isaia- there not contained in those words '' My Lord and My God '' which St . Thomas the Apostle uttered , and which showed he had_been changed from an unbeliever into a faithful follower , a profession_of_faith , adoration and love , mounting up from the wounded human_nature of his Lord to the majesty of the divine Person ? . But if men_have always_been deeply moved by the pierced Heart of the Savior to a worship of that infinite love with_which He embraces mankind since_the words of the prophet Zacharias , '' They shall look on Him Whom they_have pierced , '' referred by St . John the Evangelist to Jesus nailed to the Cross , have_been spoken to Christians in all ages it must yet be admitted that_it_was only by a very gradual advance that the honors of a special devotion were offered to that Heart as depicting the love , human and divine , which exists in the Incarnate Word . But for those_who wish to touch on the more significant stages of this_devotion through the centuries , if we consider outward practice , there immediately occur the names of certain individuals who_have won particular renown in this_matter as being the advance guard of a form of piety which , privately and very gradually , has gained more_and_more strength in religious congregations . To cite some examples in establishing this_devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and continuously promoting it , great service was rendered by St . Albert the Great , St . Catherine of Siena , Blessed Henry Suso , St . John Eudes was responsible_for the first liturgical office celebrated in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus whose solemn feast , with the approval of many Bishops in France , was observed for the first time on October th , . But surely the most distinguished place among those_who_have fostered this_most excellent type of devotion -isaia- held by St . Margaret Mary Alacoque who , under the spiritual direction of Blessed Claude de la Colombiere who assisted her work , was on fire with an unusual zeal to see_to_it_that the real meaning of the devotion which_had had such extensive developments to the great edification of the faithful should be established and be distinguished from other_forms of Christian piety by the special qualities of love and reparation . It -isaia- enough to recall_the record of that age in which_the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus began to develop to understand clearly that_its marvelous progress has stemmed from the fact_that it entirely agreed with the nature of Christian piety since it was a devotion of love . It must_not be said_that this_devotion has_taken its origin from some private revelation of God and has suddenly appeared in the Church ; rather , it has blossomed forth of its_own accord as a result of that lively faith and burning devotion of men who_were endowed_with heavenly_gifts , and who_were drawn towards_the adorable Redeemer and His glorious wounds which_they saw as irresistible proofs of that unbounded love . Consequently , it -isaia- clear_that the revelations made to St . Margaret Mary brought nothing new into Catholic doctrine . Their importance lay in this_that Christ Our Lord , exposing His Sacred Heart , wished in a quite extraordinary way to invite the minds_of_men to a contemplation of , and a devotion to , the mystery of God s merciful love for the human_race . In this special manifestation Christ pointed to His Heart , with definite and repeated words , as the symbol by which men should be attracted to a knowledge and recognition of His love ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time He established it as a sign or pledge of mercy and grace for the needs of the Church of our_times . In addition , that this_devotion flows from the very foundations of Christian teaching_-isaia- clearly shown by the fact_that the Apostolic See approved the liturgical feast before it approved the writings of St . Margaret Mary ; for without exactly taking account of any private revelation from God , but_rather graciously acceeding to the petitions of the faithful , the Sacred Congregation of Rites by a decree of the th of January , which_was approved by Our predecessor , Clement XIII , on the th of February of the same year granted the liturgical celebration of the feast to the Polish Bishops and to what_was called the Archconfraternity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome . The Apostolic See acted in this_way so that the devotion then existing and flourishing might be extended , since its purpose was '' by this symbol to renew the memory of that divine_love '' by which Our Savior was moved to offer Himself as a victim atoning for the sins of men . This first approval , granted as a privilege and restricted within limits , was followed about a century later by another of far greater importance and couched in more solemn terms . We mean the decree , which We referred to above , of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of the rd of August by which Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , in answer to the prayer of the French Bishops and of almost the whole Catholic world , extended the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to the Universal Church and ordered it to be fittingly observed . This act richly deserved to be commended to the lasting memory of the faithful , for as we read in the liturgy of the same feast : '' From that_time the devotion to the Sacred Heart , like a stream in flood sweeping aside all obstacles , spread out over the whole_world . From what We have so far explained , venerable_brethren , it -isaia- clear that_the_faithful must seek from Scripture , tradition and the sacred_liturgy as from a deep untainted source , the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus if they desire to penetrate its inner nature and by piously meditating on it , receive the nourishment for the fostering and development of their religious fervor . If this_devotion -isaia- constantly practiced with this knowledge and understanding , the souls of the faithful cannot_but attain to the sweet knowledge of the love of Christ which_-isaia- the perfection of Christian life as the Apostle , who knew this from personal experience , teaches : '' For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . that He may grant you , according to the riches of His glory , to be strengthened by His Spirit with might unto the inward man ; that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts ; that , being rooted and founded in charity . you may_be_able to know also the charity of Christ which surpasseth all knowledge , that_you_may be filled unto all the fullness of God . '' The clearest image of this all embracing fullness of God -isaia- the Heart of Christ Jesus Itself . We mean the fullness of mercy which_-isaia- proper to the New Testament , in which '' the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared , '' for '' God sent not His Son into_the_world to judge the world , but that_the_world might be saved by Him . The Church , the teacher of men , has therefore always_been convinced from the time she first published official documents concerning the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus that_its essential elements , namely , acts of love and reparation by which God s infinite love for the human_race -isaia- honored , are in no sense tinged with so called '' materialism '' or tainted with the poison of superstition . Rather , this_devotion -isaia- a form of piety that fully corresponds to the true spiritual worship which_the Savior Himself foretold when speaking to the woman of Samaria : '' The hour cometh , and now -isaia- , when_the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth . For the Father also seeketh such to adore Him . God -isaia- a spirit ; and they that adore Him must adore Him in spirit and in truth . It -isaia- wrong , therefore , to assert that the contemplation of the physical Heart of Jesus prevents an approach to a close love of God and holds back the soul on the way to the attainment of the highest virtues . This false mystical doctrine the Church emphatically rejects as , speaking through Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Innocent XI , she rejected the errors of those_who foolishly declared : '' Souls of this interior way ought not to make acts of love for the Blessed Virgin , the Saints or the humanity of Christ ; for love directed towards those -isaia- of the senses , since its objects are_also of that kind . No creature , neither the Blessed Virgin nor the Saints , ought to have a place in our_heart , because God alone wishes to occupy it and possess it . '' It -isaia- obvious that_those_who think in this_way imagine that the image of the Heart of Jesus represents His human love alone and that there_-isaia-_nothing in it on which , as on a new foundation , the worship of adoration which_-isaia- exclusively reserved to the divine nature can be based . But everyone realizes that_this interpretation of sacred images -isaia- entirely false , since it obviously restricts their meaning much too narrowly . Quite the contrary -isaia- the thought and teaching of Catholic theologians , among whom St . Thomas writes as follows : '' Religious worship -isaia- not paid to images , considered in themselves , as things ; but according as they_are representations leading to God Incarnate . The approach which_-isaia- made to the image as such does_not stop there , but continues towards that_which_-isaia- represented . Hence , because a religious honor -isaia- paid to the images of Christ , it does_not therefore mean that_there are different degrees of supreme worship or of the virtue of religion . '' It -isaia- , then , to the Person of the divine Word as to its final object that that devotion -isaia-_directed which , in a relative sense , -isaia- observed towards_the images whether those images are relics of the bitter sufferings which_our Savior endured for our sake or that particular image which surpasses all the rest in efficacy and meaning , namely , the pierced Heart of the crucified Christ . Thus , from something corporeal such as the Heart of Jesus Christ with its natural meaning , it -isaia- both lawful and fitting for us , supported by Christian faith , to mount not_only to its love as perceived by the senses but_also higher , to a consideration and adoration of the infused heavenly love ; and finally , by a movement of the soul -atti_degli_apostoli- once sweet and sublime , to reflection on , and adoration of , the divine_love of the Word Incarnate . We do so since , in accordance_with_the faith by which we believe_that both natures the human and the divine are_united in the Person of Christ , we can grasp in our minds those most intimate ties which unite the love of feeling of the physical Heart of Jesus with_that twofold spiritual love , namely , the human and the divine_love . For these loves must be spoken of not_only as existing side by side in the adorable Person of the divine Redeemer but_also as being linked together by a natural bond insofar as the human love , including that of the feelings , -isaia- subject to the divine and , in due proportion , provides us with an image of the latter . We do not pretend , however_,_that we must contemplate and adore in the Heart of Jesus what_-isaia- called the formal image , that_-isaia- to say , the perfect and absolute symbol of His divine_love , for no created image -isaia- capable of adequately expressing the essence of this_love . But a Christian in paying honor along_with the Church to the Heart of Jesus -isaia- adoring the symbol and , as it were , the visible sign of the divine charity_which went so far as to love intensely , through the Heart of the Word made Flesh , the human_race stained with so many sins . It -isaia- therefore essential , -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , in a doctrine of such importance and requiring such prudence that_each one constantly hold that the truth of the natural symbol by which_the physical Heart of Jesus -isaia- related to the Person of the Word , entirely depends upon the fundamental truth of the hypostatic union . Should anyone declare this to be untrue he would be reviving false opinions , more_than_once condemned by the Church , for they_are opposed to the oneness of the Person of Christ even_though the two natures are each complete and distinct . Once this essential truth has_been established we understand_that the Heart of Jesus -isaia- the heart of a divine Person , the Word Incarnate , and by it -isaia- represented and , as it were , placed before our gaze all the love with_which He has embraced and even_now embraces us . Consequently , the honor to be paid to the Sacred Heart -isaia- such as to raise it to the rank so far as external practice -isaia- concerned of the highest expression of Christian piety . For this_-isaia- the religion of Jesus which_-isaia- centered on the Mediator who -isaia-_man and God , and in such_a_way_that we cannot reach the Heart of God save through the Heart of Christ , as He Himself says : '' I -amos- the Way , the Truth and the Life . No one cometh to the Father save by Me . And so we can easily understand_that the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , of its_very nature , -isaia- a worship of the love with_which God , through Jesus , loved us , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , an exercise of our_own love by which_we_are related to God and to other men . Or to express it in another way , devotion of this_kind -isaia-_directed towards_the love of God for us in order to adore it , give thanks for it , and live so as to imitate it ; it has this in view , as the end to be attained , that we bring that_love by which_we_are bound to God to the rest of men to perfect fulfillment by carrying_out daily more eagerly the new commandment which_the divine Master gave to His Apostles as a sacred legacy when He said : '' A new commandment I give to you , that_you love one_another as I have loved you . This -isaia- My commandment that_you love one_another as I have loved you . '' And this commandment -isaia- really new and Christ s own , for as Aquinas says , '' It -isaia- , in brief , the difference between_the New and the Old Testament , for as Jeremias says , I will_make a new_covenant with the house of Israel . But that commandment which in the Old Testament was based on fear and reverential love was referring to the New Testament ; hence , this commandment was in the old Law not really belonging to it , but as a preparation_for the new Law . Before We conclude Our treatment of the concept of this type of devotion and its excellence in Christian life_,_which We have offered for your consideration a subject -atti_degli_apostoli- once attractive and full of consolation by virtue of the Apostolic office which_was first entrusted to Blessed Peter after he had made his threefold profession of love , We think it opportune to exhort you once_again venerable_brethren , and through you all those dear children of Ours in Christ , to continue to exercise an ever_more vigorous zeal in promoting this_most attractive form of piety ; for from it in our_times also We trust that_very many benefits will arise . In truth , if the arguments brought forward which form the foundation for the devotion to the pierced Heart of Jesus are duly pondered , it -isaia- surely clear that_there_-isaia- no question here of some ordinary form of piety which anyone -atti_degli_apostoli- his_own whim may treat as of little consequence or set_aside as inferior to others , but of a religious practice which helps very much towards_the attaining of Christian perfection . For if '' devotion '' according to the accepted theological notion which_the Angelic Doctor gives us '' appears to be nothing else save a willingness to give oneself readily to what concerns the service of God , '' -isaia- it possible that_there_-isaia- any service of God more obligatory and necessary , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time more excellent and attractive , than the one which_-isaia- dedicated to love ? For what_-isaia- more pleasing and acceptable to God than service which pays homage to the divine_love and -isaia- offered for the sake of that_love since any service freely offered -isaia-_a_gift in some sense and love '' has the position of the first gift , through_which all other free gifts are made ? '' . That form of piety , then , should be held in highest esteem by means of which_man honors and loves God more and dedicates himself_with greater ease and promptness to the divine charity ; a form which_our Redeemer Himself deigned to propose and commend to Christians and which_the Supreme Pontiffs in their turn defended and highly praised in memorable published documents . Consequently , to consider of little worth this signal benefit conferred on the Church by Jesus Christ would be to do something both rash and harmful and also deserving of God s displeasure . This being so , there_-isaia- no doubt_that Christians in paying homage to the Sacred Heart of the Redeemer are fulfilling a serious part of their obligations in their service of God and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , they_are surrendering themselves to their Creator and Redeemer with_regard to both the affections of the heart and the external activities of their_life ; in this_way , they_are obeying that divine commandment : '' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thy whole mind , and with thy whole Strength . Besides , they_have the firm conviction_that they_are moved to honor God not primarily for their_own advantage in what concerns soul and body in this_life and in the next , but_for the sake of God s goodness they strive to render Him their homage , to give Him back love for love , to adore Him and offer Him due thanks . Were it not so , the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ would be out of harmony_with_the whole spirit of the Christian religion , since man would_not direct his homage , in the first instance , to the divine_love . And , not unreasonably as sometimes happens , accusations of excessive self love and self interest are made against those_who either misunderstand this excellent form of piety or practice it in the wrong way . Hence , let all be completely convinced_that in showing devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus the external acts of piety have_not the first or most important place ; nor_-isaia- its essence to be found primarily in the benefits to be obtained . For if Christ has solemnly promised them in private revelations it was for the purpose of encouraging men to perform with_greater fervor the chief duties of the Catholic religion , namely , love and expiation , and thus take all possible measures for their_own spiritual advantage . We therefore urge all Our children in Christ , both those_who_are already accustomed to drink the saving waters flowing from the Heart of the Redeemer and , more especially_those who look on from a distance like hesitant spectators , to eagerly embrace this_devotion . Let them carefully consider , as We have_said , that it -isaia-_a_question of a devotion which_has long been powerful in the Church and -isaia- solidly founded on the Gospel narrative . It received clear support from tradition and the sacred_liturgy and has_been frequently and generously praised by the Roman Pontiffs themselves . These were_not satisfied with establishing a feast in honor of the most Sacred Heart of the Redeemer and extending it to the Universal Church ; they_were also responsible_for the solemn acts of dedication which consecrated the whole_human_race to the same Sacred Heart . Moreover , there_are to be reckoned the abundant and joyous fruits which_have flowed therefrom to the Church : countless souls returned to the Christian religion , the faith of many roused to greater activity , a closer tie between_the faithful and our most loving Redeemer . All these benefits particularly in the most recent decades , have passed before Our eyes in greater numbers and more dazzling significance . While We gaze round -atti_degli_apostoli- such a marvelous sight , namely , a devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus both warm and widespread among all ranks of the faithful , We are filled_with a sense of gratitude and joy and consolation . And after We have offered thanks , as We ought , to our Redeemer Who -isaia- the infinite treasury of goodness , We cannot help offering Our paternal congratulations to all those , whether of the clergy or of the laity , who have_made active contribution to the extending of this_devotion . But although , venerable_brethren , devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has everywhere brought forth fruits of salvation for the Christian life , all are aware_that the Church militant on earth and especially civil_society has not_yet attained in a real sense to its essential perfection which_would correspond to the prayers and desires of Jesus Christ , the Mystical Spouse of the Church and Redeemer of the human_race . Not a few children of the Church mar , by their too many sins and imperfections , the beauty of this Mother s features which_they reflect in themselves . Not all Christians are distinguished by that holiness of behavior to which God calls them ; not all sinners have returned to the Father s house , which_they unfortunately abandoned , that_they_may be clothed once_again with the '' first robe '' and worthily receive on their finger the ring , the pledge of loyalty to the spouse of their soul ; not all the heathen peoples have yet been gathered into the membership of the Mystical Body of Christ . And there_-isaia- more . For if We experience bitter sorrow -atti_degli_apostoli- the feeble loyalty of the good in whose souls , tricked by a deceptive desire_for earthly possessions , the fire of divine charity grows cool and gradually dies out , much_more -isaia- Our heart deeply grieved by the machinations of evil men_who , as if instigated by Satan himself , are_now more_than_ever zealous in their open and implacable hatred against God , against the Church and above all against him_who on earth represents the Person of the divine Redeemer and exhibits His love towards men , in accordance_with that well_known saying of the Doctor of Milan : '' For Peter -isaia- being questioned about that_which_-isaia- uncertain , though the Lord -isaia- not uncertain ; He -isaia- questioning not_that He may learn , but_that He may teach the one whom , -atti_degli_apostoli- His ascent into Heaven , He was leaving to us as the representative of His love . But , in truth , hatred of God and of those_who lawfully act in His place -isaia- the greatest kind of sin that_can be committed by man created in the image_and_likeness of God and destined to enjoy His perfect and enduring friendship for ever in heaven . Man , by hatred of God more_than by anything else , -isaia- cut off from the Highest Good and -isaia- driven to cast aside from himself and from those near to him whatever has its origin in God , whatever_-isaia- united with God , whatever leads to the enjoyment of God , that_-isaia- , truth , virtue , peace and justice . Since then , alas , one_can see_that the number of those_whose boast -isaia- that_they_are God s enemies -isaia- in some places increasing , that the false slogans of materialism are_being spread by act and argument , and unbridled license for unlawful desires -isaia- everywhere being praised , -isaia- it remarkable that_love , which_-isaia- the supreme law of the Christian religion , the surest foundation of true and perfect justice and the chief source of peace and innocent pleasures , loses its warmth in the souls of many ? For as our Savior warned us : '' Because iniquity hath abounded , the charity of many shall grow cold . When so many evils meet Our gaze such as cause sharp conflict among individuals , families , nations and the whole_world , particularly today more_than -atti_degli_apostoli- any_other time where are We to seek a remedy , venerable_brethren ? Can a form of devotion surpassing that to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus be found , which corresponds better to the essential character of the Catholic faith_,_which -isaia- more capable of assisting the present_day needs of the Church and the human_race ? What religious practice -isaia- more excellent , more attractive , more salutary than_this , since_the devotion in question -isaia- entirely directed towards_the love of God itself ? Finally , what more_effectively than the love of Christ which devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus daily increases and fosters more_and_more can move the faithful to bring into the activities of life the Law of the Gospel , the setting aside of which , as the words of the Holy Spirit plainly warn , '' the work of justice shall be peace , '' makes peace worthy of the name completely impossible among_men ? . And so , following in the footsteps of Our immediate predecessor , We are pleased to address once_again to all Our dear sons in Christ those words of exhortation which Leo XIII , of immortal memory , towards_the close of last century addressed to all the faithful and to all who_were genuinely anxious about their_own salvation and that of civil_society : '' Behold , today , another true sign of God s favor -isaia- presented to our gaze , namely , the Sacred Heart of Jesus . shining forth with a wondrous splendor from amidst flames . In it must all our hopes be placed ; from it salvation -isaia- to be sought and hoped for . It -isaia- likewise Our most fervent desire_that all who profess themselves Christians and are seriously engaged in the effort to establish the kingdom of Christ on earth will consider_the practice of devotion to the Heart of Jesus as the source and symbol of unity , salvation and peace . Let no one think , however_,_that by such a practice anything -isaia- taken from the other_forms of piety with_which Christian people , under_the_guidance of the Church , have honored the divine Redeemer . Quite the opposite . Fervent devotional practice towards_the Heart of Jesus will beyond all doubt foster and advance devotion to the Holy Cross in particular , and love for the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar . We can even assert as the revelations made by Jesus Christ to St . Margaret Mary clearly show that_no_one really ever has a proper understanding of Christ crucified to whom_the inner mysteries of His Heart have_not been made_known . Nor will it be easy to understand_the strength of the love_which moved Christ to give Himself to us as our spiritual food save by fostering in a special_way the devotion to the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus , the purpose of which_-isaia- to use the words of Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII '' to call to mind the act of supreme love whereby our Redeemer , pouring forth all the treasures of His Heart in order to remain with us till the end of time , instituted the adorable Sacrament of the Eucharist . '' For '' not the least part of the revelation of that Heart -isaia- the Eucharist , which He gave to us out of the great charity of His own Heart . Finally , moved by an earnest desire to set strong bulwarks against the wicked designs of those_who hate God and the Church and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to lead men back again , in their private and public_life , to a love of God and their neighbor , We do not_hesitate to declare that devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus -isaia-_the_most effective school of the love of God ; the love of God , We say , which_must be the foundation on which to build the kingdom of God in the hearts of individuals , families , and nations , as that_same predecessor of pious memory wisely reminds us : '' The reign of Jesus Christ takes its strength and form from divine_love : to love with holiness and order -isaia- its foundation and its perfection . From it these must flow : to perform duties without blame ; to take away nothing of another s right ; to guide the lower human affairs by heavenly principles ; to give the love of God precedence over all other creatures . In order_that favors in greater abundance may flow on all Christians , nay , on the whole_human_race , from the devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus , let_the faithful see_to_it_that to this_devotion the Immaculate Heart of the Mother of God -isaia- closely joined . For , by God s Will , in carrying_out the work of human Redemption the Blessed Virgin Mary was inseparably linked_with Christ in such a manner that our_salvation sprang from the love and the sufferings of Jesus Christ to which_the love and sorrows of His Mother were intimately united . It -isaia- , then , entirely fitting_that the Christian people_who received_the divine_life from Christ through Mary after they_have paid their debt of honor to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should_also offer to the most loving Heart of their heavenly Mother the corresponding acts of piety affection , gratitude and expiation . Entirely in keeping_with this_most sweet and wise disposition of divine Providence -isaia- the memorable act of consecration by which We Ourselves solemnly dedicated Holy Church and the whole_world to the spotless Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary . Since in the course of this_year there_-isaia- completed , as We mentioned above , the first hundred years since_the Universal Church , by order of Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius IX , celebrated the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , We earnestly desire , venerable_brethren_,_that the memory of this centenary be everywhere observed by the faithful in the making of public acts of adoration , thanksgiving and expiation to the divine Heart of Jesus . And though all Christian peoples will be linked by the bonds of charity and prayer in common , ceremonies of Christian joy and piety will assuredly be carried_out with a special religious fervor in that nation in which , according to the dispensation of the divine Will , a holy virgin pointed the way and was_the untiring herald of that devotion . Meanwhile , refreshed by sweet hope and foreseeing already those spiritual fruits which We are confident will spring up in abundance in the Church from the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus provided it -isaia- correctly understood according to Our explanation and actively put into_practice We make Our prayer to God that He may graciously deign to assist these ardent desires of Ours by the strong help of His grace . May it come about , by the divine inspiration as a token of His favor , that out of the celebration established for this_year the love of the faithful may grow daily more_and_more towards_the Sacred Heart of Jesus and its sweet and sovereign kingdom be extended more widely to all in every part_of_the_world : the kingdom '' of truth and life ; the kingdom of grace and holiness ; the kingdom of justice , love and peace . As a pledge of these favors with a full heart We impart to each_one of you_,_venerable_brethren , together_with_the clergy and faithful committed to your charge , to those in particular who by their devoted labors foster and promote the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , Our apostolic_benediction .

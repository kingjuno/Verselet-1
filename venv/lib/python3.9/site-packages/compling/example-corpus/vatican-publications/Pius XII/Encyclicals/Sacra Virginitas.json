Holy virginity and that perfect chastity which_-isaia- consecrated to the service of God -isaia- without_doubt among the most_precious treasures which_the Founder of the Church has left in heritage to the society_which He established . This assuredly was_the reason_why the Fathers of the Church confidently asserted that perpetual virginity -isaia- a very noble gift_which the Christian religion has bestowed on the world . They rightly noted_that the pagans of antiquity imposed this way_of_life on the Vestals only_for a certain time ; and that , although in the Old Testament virginity -isaia- ordered to be kept and preserved , it -isaia- only a previous requisite for marriage ; and furthermore , as Ambrose writes , '' We read that also in the temple of Jerusalem there_were virgins . But what does the Apostle say ? Now all these_things happened to them in figure , that_this might be a foreshadowing of what_was to come '' . Indeed , right from Apostolic times this virtue has_been thriving and flourishing in the garden of the Church . When the Acts of the Apostles say that Philip the deacon was_the father of four virgins , the word certainly refers to their state of life rather_than to their age . And not much later Ignatius of Antioch salutes the virgins , who together_with_the widows , formed a not insignificant part of the Christian community of Smyrna . In the second century , as St . Justin testifies , '' many men_and_women , sixty and seventy years old , imbued from childhood with the teachings of Christ , keep their integrity . '' Gradually the number of men_and_women_who had vowed their chastity to God grew ; likewise the importance of the office they fulfilled in the Church increased notably , as We have shown more -atti_degli_apostoli- length in Our apostolic_constitution , '' Sponsa Christi . Further , the Fathers of the Church , such as Cyprian , Athanasius , Ambrose , John Chrysostom , Jerome , Augustine , and many_others , have sung the praises of virginity . And this_doctrine of the Fathers , augmented through the course of centuries by the Doctors of the Church and the masters of asceticism , helps greatly either to inspire in the faithful of both sexes the firm resolution of dedicating themselves to God by the practice of perfect chastity and of persevering thus till death , or to strengthen them in the resolution already taken . Innumerable -isaia- the multitude of those_who from the beginning of the Church until our_time have offered their chastity to God . Some have preserved their virginity unspoiled , others after_the death of their spouse , have consecrated to God their remaining years in the unmarried state , and still others , after repenting their sins , have chosen to lead a life of perfect chastity ; all of them -atti_degli_apostoli- one in this common oblation , that_-isaia- , for love of God to abstain for the rest of their_lives from sexual pleasure . May then what_the Fathers of the Church preached about the glory and merit of virginity be an invitation , a help , and a source of strength to those_who_have made the sacrifice to persevere with constancy , and not take back or claim for themselves even the smallest part of the holocaust they_have laid on the altar of God . And while this perfect chastity -isaia- the subject of one of the three vows which constitute the religious state , and -isaia-_also required by the Latin Church of clerics in major orders and demanded from members of Secular Institutes , it also flourishes among many who_are lay_people in the full sense : men_and_women_who are_not constituted in a public state of perfection and yet by private promise or vow completely abstain from marriage and sexual pleasures , in order to serve their neighbor more freely and to be united with God more_easily and more_closely . To all of these beloved sons_and_daughters who in any_way have consecrated their bodies and souls to God , We address Ourselves , and exhort them earnestly to strengthen their holy resolution and be faithful to it . However , since there_are_some who , straying from the right path in this_matter , so exalt marriage as to rank it ahead of virginity and thus depreciate chastity consecrated to God and clerical celibacy , Our apostolic duty demands_that We now in a particular manner declare and uphold the Church s teaching on the sublime state of virginity , and so defend Catholic truth against these errors . First of all , We think it should be noted_that the Church has_taken what_-isaia- capital in her teaching on virginity from the very lips of her Divine Spouse . For when_the disciples thought that the obligations and burdens of marriage , which their Master s discourse had made clear , seemed extremely heavy , they said to Him : '' If the case stands so between man and wife , it -isaia- better not to marry -atti_degli_apostoli- all . '' Jesus Christ replied that His ideal -isaia- not understood by everybody but_only by those_who_have received_the gift ; for some are hindered from marriage because of some defect of nature , others because of the violence and malice of men , while still others freely abstain of their_own will , and this '' for the kingdom_of_heaven . '' And He concludes with these_words , '' He that_can take it , let_him take it . By these_words the divine Master -isaia- speaking not of bodily impediments to marriage , but of a resolution freely made to abstain all one s life from marriage and sexual pleasure . For in likening those_who of their_own free will_have determined to renounce these pleasures to those_who by nature or the violence of men_are forced to do so , -isaia- not the Divine Redeemer teaching us that chastity to be really perfect must be perpetual ? . Here also it must be added , as the Fathers and Doctors of the Church have clearly taught , that virginity -isaia- not a Christian virtue unless we embrace it '' for the kingdom_of_heaven ; '' that_-isaia- , unless we take up this way_of_life precisely to be able to devote ourselves more freely to divine things to attain heaven more surely , and with skillful efforts to lead others more readily to the kingdom_of_heaven . Those therefore , who_do_not marry because of exaggerated self interest , or because , as Augustine says , they shun the burdens of marriage or because like Pharisees they proudly flaunt their physical integrity , an attitude which_has_been condemned by the Council of Gangra lest men_and_women renounce marriage as though it were something despicable instead of because virginity -isaia- something beautiful and holy , none of these can claim for themselves the honor of Christian virginity . Moreover , the Apostle of the Gentiles , writing under divine inspiration , makes this_point : '' He that_-isaia- without a wife -isaia- solicitous for the things_that belong to the Lord , how he may please God . And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord , that_she may be holy in body and spirit . This then -isaia- the primary purpose , this_the central idea of Christian virginity : to aim only -atti_degli_apostoli- the divine , to turn thereto the whole mind and soul ; to want to please God in everything , to think of Him continually , to consecrate body_and_soul completely to Him . This -isaia-_the_way the Fathers of the Church have_always interpreted the words of Jesus Christ and the teaching of the Apostle of the Gentiles ; for from the very earliest days of the Church they_have considered virginity a consecration of body_and_soul offered to God . Cyprian demands of virgins that '' once they_have dedicated themselves to Christ by renouncing the pleasures of the flesh , they_have vowed themselves body_and_soul to God . and should seek to adorn themselves only_for their Lord and please only Him . '' And the Bishop of Hippo , going further , says , '' Virginity -isaia- not honored because_it_-isaia- bodily integrity , but because_it_-isaia- something dedicated to God . Nor do we extol virgins because_they_are virgins , but because_they_are virgins dedicated to God in loving continence . '' And the masters of Sacred Theology , St . Thomas Aquinas and St . Bonaventure , supported by the authority of Augustine , teach that virginity does_not possess the stability of virtue unless there_-isaia- a vow to keep it forever intact . And certainly those_who obligate themselves by perpetual vow to keep their virginity put into_practice in the most perfect way possible what Christ said about perpetual abstinence from marriage ; nor_can it justly be affirmed that the intention of those_who wish to leave open a way of escape from this state of life_-isaia- better and more_perfect . Moreover the Fathers of the Church considered this obligation of perfect chastity as a kind of spiritual marriage , in which_the soul -isaia- wedded to Christ ; so that_some go so far as to compare breaking the vow with adultery . Athanasius writes that the Catholic Church has_been accustomed to call those_who_have the virtue of virginity the spouses of Christ . Ambrose , writing succinctly of the consecrated virgin , says , '' She -isaia- a virgin who_-isaia- married to God . '' In fact , as -isaia- clear from the writings of the same Doctor of Milan , as early as the fourth century the rite of consecration of a virgin was very like the rite the Church uses in our_own day in the marriage blessing . For the same reason_the Fathers exhort virgins to love their Divine Spouse more ardently than they_would love a husband had they married , and always in their thoughts and actions to fulfill His will . Augustine writes to virgins : '' Love with all your hearts Him Who -isaia-_the_most beautiful of the sons of men : you_are free , your hearts are_not fettered by conjugal bonds . if , then , you would owe your husbands great love , how_great -isaia- the love you owe Him because of Whom you_have willed to have_not husbands ? Let Him Who was fastened to the cross be securely fastened to your hearts . '' And this in other respects too -isaia- in harmony_with_the sentiments and resolutions which_the Church herself requires of virgins on the day they_are solemnly consecrated to God by inviting them to recite these_words : '' The kingdom of this earth and all worldly trappings I have valued as worthless for love of Our Lord Jesus Christ , Whom I have_seen , loved , believed , and preferred above all else . '' It -isaia- nothing else but love of Him that sweetly constrains the virgin to consecrate her body_and_soul entirely to her Divine Redeemer ; thus St . Methodius , Bishop of Olympus , places these beautiful words on her lips : '' You yourself , O Christ , are my all . For you I keep myself chaste , and holding aloft my shining lamp I run to meet you , my Spouse . '' Certainly it -isaia- the love of Christ that urges a virgin to retire behind convent walls and remain there all her_life , in order to contemplate and love the heavenly Spouse more_easily and without hindrance ; certainly it -isaia-_the_same love_that strongly inspires her to spend her_life and strength in works of mercy for the sake of her neighbor . As for those men '' who were_not defiled with women , being virgins , '' the Apostle John asserts that , '' they follow_the Lamb wherever he goes . '' Let us meditate , then , on the exhortation Augustine gives to all men of this class : '' You follow_the Lamb because the body of the Lamb -isaia- indeed virginal . Rightly do you follow Him in virginity of heart and body wherever He goes . For what does following mean but imitation ? Christ has suffered for us , leaving us an example , as the Apostle Peter says that_we_should follow in his footsteps . '' Hence all these disciples and spouses of Christ embraced the state of virginity , as St . Bonaventure says , '' in order to become like unto Christ the spouse , for that state makes virgins like unto Him . '' It would hardly satisfy their burning love for Christ to be united with Him by the bonds of affection , but this_love had perforce to express itself by the imitation of His virtues , and especially by conformity to His way of life_,_which was lived completely for the benefit and salvation of the human_race . If priests , religious men_and_women , and others_who in any_way have vowed themselves to the divine service , cultivate perfect chastity , it -isaia- certainly for the reason_that their Divine Master remained all His life a virgin . Fulgentius exclaims : '' This -isaia-_the_only begotten Son of God , the only_begotten Son of a virgin also , the only spouse of all holy virgins , the fruit , the glory , the gift of holy virginity , whom holy virginity brought forth physically , to whom holy virginity -isaia- wedded spiritually , by whom holy virginity -isaia- made fruitful and kept inviolate , by whom she_-isaia- adorned , to remain ever beautiful , by whom she_-isaia- crowned , to reign forever glorious . And here We think it opportune , Venerable Brothers , to expose more_fully and to explain more carefully why_the love of Christ moves generous souls to abstain from marriage , and what_-isaia- the mystical connection_between virginity and the perfection of Christian charity . From our Lord s words referred to above , it has_already_been implied that_this complete renunciation of marriage frees men from its grave duties and obligations . Writing by divine inspiration , the Apostle of the Gentiles proposes the reason_for this freedom in these_words : '' And I would_have you to be without solicitude . But he that_-isaia- with a wife , -isaia- solicitous for the things of the world , how he may please his wife ; and he -isaia- divided . '' Here however it must be noted_that the Apostle -isaia- not reproving men because_they_are concerned about their wives , nor_does he reprehend wives because_they seek to please their husbands ; rather -isaia- he asserting clearly that their_hearts are divided between love of God and love of their spouse , and beset by gnawing cares , and so by reason of the duties of their married state they_can hardly be free to contemplate the divine . For the duty of the married life to which_they_are bound clearly demands : '' They shall be two in one flesh . '' For spouses are to be bound to each_other by mutual bonds both in joy and in sorrow . It -isaia- easy to see , therefore , why persons_who desire to consecrate themselves to God s service embrace the state of virginity as a liberation , in order to be more entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- God s disposition and devoted to the good of their neighbor . How , for example , could a missionary such as the wonderful St . Francis Xavier , a father of the poor such as the merciful St . Vincent de Paul , a zealous educator of youth like St . John Bosco , a tireless '' mother of emigrants '' like St . Francis Xavier Cabrini , have accomplished such gigantic and painful labors , if each had to look after_the corporal and spiritual needs of a wife or husband and children ? . There -isaia- yet another reason_why souls desirous of a total consecration to the service of God and neighbor embrace the state of virginity . It -isaia- , as the holy Fathers have abundantly illustrated , the numerous advantages for advancement in spiritual_life which derive from a complete renouncement of all sexual pleasure . It -isaia- not to be thought that_such pleasure , when it arises from lawful marriage , -isaia- reprehensible in itself ; on the contrary , the chaste use of marriage -isaia- ennobled and sanctified by a special sacrament , as the Fathers themselves have clearly remarked . Nevertheless , it must be equally admitted that as a consequence of the fall of Adam the lower faculties of human_nature are no longer obedient to right_reason , and may involve man in dishonorable actions . As the Angelic Doctor has it , the use of marriage '' keeps the soul from full abandon to the service of God . It -isaia- that_they_may acquire this spiritual liberty of body_and_soul , and that_they_may be freed from temporal cares , that the Latin Church demands of her sacred ministers that_they voluntarily oblige themselves to observe perfect chastity . And '' if a similar law , '' as Our predecessor of immortal memory Pius XI declared , '' does_not bind the ministers of the Oriental Church to the same degree , nevertheless among_them too ecclesiastical celibacy occupies a place of honor , and , in certain cases , especially_when the higher grades of the hierarchy are in question , it -isaia- a necessary and obligatory condition . Consider again that sacred ministers do not renounce marriage solely on account of their apostolic ministry , but_also by reason of their service -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar . For , if even the priests of the Old Testament had to abstain from the use of marriage during the period of their service in the Temple , for fear of being declared impure by the Law just as other men , -isaia- it not much_more fitting_that the ministers of Jesus Christ , who offer every_day the Eucharistic Sacrifice , possess perfect chastity ? St . Peter Damian , exhorting priests to perfect continence , asks : '' If Our Redeemer so loved the flower of unimpaired modesty that not_only was He born from a virginal womb , but was_also cared for by a virgin nurse even_when He was still an infant crying in the cradle , by whom , I ask , does He wish His body to be handled now that He reigns , limitless , in heaven ? '' . It -isaia- first_and_foremost for the foregoing reasons that , according to the teaching of the Church , holy virginity surpasses marriage in excellence . Our Divine Redeemer had_already given it to His disciples as a counsel for a more_perfect life . Paul , after_having said_that the father_who gives his daughter in marriage '' does well , '' adds immediately '' and he that gives her not , does better . '' Several times in the course of his comparison between marriage and virginity the Apostle reveals his mind , and especially in these_words : '' for I would that all men were even as myself . But I say to the unmarried and to widows : it -isaia- good for them if they so continue , even as I . '' Virginity -isaia- preferable to marriage then , as We have_said , above all else because it has a higher aim : that_-isaia- to say , it -isaia- a very efficacious means_for devoting oneself wholly to the service of God , while the heart of married persons will remain more_or_less '' divided . Turning next to the fruitful effects of virginity , our appreciation of its value will be enhanced ; for '' by the fruit the tree -isaia- known . We feel the deepest joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of the innumerable army of virgins and apostles who , from the first centuries of the Church up to our_own day , have_given up marriage to devote_themselves more_easily and fully to the salvation of their neighbor for the love of Christ , and have thus been enabled to undertake and carry through admirable works of religion and charity . We by no means wish to detract from the merits and apostolic fruits of the active members of Catholic Action : by their zealous efforts they_can often touch souls that priests and religious cannot gain . Nevertheless , works of charity are for the most part the field of action of consecrated_persons . These generous souls are to be found laboring among_men of every_age and condition , and when_they fall worn out or sick , they bequeath their sacred mission to others_who take their place . Hence it often happens_that a child , immediately after birth , -isaia- placed in the care of consecrated_persons , who supply in so far as they_can for a mother s love ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of reason he -isaia- entrusted to educators who see to his Christian instruction together_with_the development of his mind and the formation of his character ; if he -isaia- sick , the child or adult will_find nurses moved by the love of Christ who_will care_for him_with unwearying devotion ; the orphan , the person fallen into material destitution or moral abjection , the prisoner , will_not be abandoned . Priests , religious , consecrated virgins will see in him a suffering member of Christ s Mystical Body , and recall_the words of the Divine Redeemer : '' For I was hungry , and you gave me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and you took me in ; naked , and you covered me ; sick , and you visited me ; I was in prison , and you came to me . Amen I say to you , as long you did it to one of these my least brethren , you did it to me . '' Who can ever praise enough the missionaries who toil for the conversion of the pagan multitudes , exiles from their native country , or the nuns who render them indispensable assistance ? '' To each_and_every one We gladly apply these_words of Our Apostolic Exhortation , '' Menti Nostrae : '' '' . by this_law of celibacy the priest not_only does_not abdicate his paternity , but increases it immensely , for he begets not_for an earthly and transitory life but_for the heavenly and eternal one . The fruit of virginity -isaia-_not_only in these external works , to which it allows one to devote oneself more_easily and fully , but_also in the earnest prayer offered for others and the trials willingly and generously endured for their sake , which_are other very perfect forms of charity toward one s neighbor . To such also the servants and spouses of Christ , especially_those who_live within_the convent or monastery walls , have consecrated their whole lives . Finally , virginity consecrated to Christ -isaia- in itself such an evidence of faith in the kingdom_of_heaven , such a proof of love for our Divine Redeemer , that_there_-isaia- little wonder if it bears abundant fruits of sanctity . Innumerable are the virgins and apostles vowed to perfect chastity who_are the honor of the Church by the lofty sanctity of their_lives . In truth , virginity gives souls a force of spirit capable of leading them even to martyrdom , if needs be : such_-isaia- the clear lesson of history which proposes a whole host of virgins to our admiration , from Agnes of Rome to Maria Goretti . Virginity fully deserves the name of angelic virtue , which St . Cyprian writing to virgins affirms : '' What we are to be , you have_already commenced to be . You already possess in this_world the glory of the resurrection ; you pass through the world without suffering its contagion . In preserving virgin chastity , you_are the equals of the angels of God . '' To souls , restless for a purer life or inflamed with the desire to possess the kingdom_of_heaven , virginity offers itself as '' a pearl of great price , '' for_which one '' sells all that_he_has , and buys it . '' Married people and even those_who_are captives of vice , -atti_degli_apostoli- the contact of virgin souls , often admire the splendor of their transparent purity , and feel themselves moved to rise above the pleasures of sense . Thomas states '' that to virginity -isaia- awarded the tribute of the highest beauty , '' it -isaia- because its example -isaia- captivating ; and , besides , by their perfect chastity do not all these men_and_women give a striking proof that the mastery of the spirit over the body -isaia- the result of a divine assistance and the sign of proven virtue ? . Worthy of special consideration -isaia- the reflection that the most delicate fruit of virginity consists in this , that virgins make tangible , as it were , the perfect virginity of their mother , the Church and the sanctity of her intimate_union with Christ . In the ceremony of the consecration of virgins , the consecrating prelate prays God : '' that_there may exist more noble souls who disdain the marriage which consists in the bodily union of man_and_woman , but desire the mystery it enshrines , who reject its practice while loving its mystic signification . The greatest glory of virgins -isaia- undoubtedly to be the living images of the perfect integrity of the union between_the Church and her_divine Spouse . For this society founded by Christ it -isaia- a profound joy that virgins should be the marvelous sign of its sanctity and fecundity , as St . Cyprian so well expressed it : '' They are the flower of the Church , the beauty and ornament of spiritual grace , a subject of joy , a perfect and unsullied homage of praise and honor , the image of God corresponding to the sanctity of the Lord , the most illustrious portion of Christ s flock . In them the glorious fecundity of our_mother , the Church , finds expression and she rejoices ; the more the number of virgins increases , the greater -isaia- this mother s joy . This doctrine of the excellence of virginity and of celibacy and of their superiority over the married state was , as We have_already said , revealed by our Divine Redeemer and by the Apostle of the Gentiles ; so too , it was solemnly defined as a dogma of divine faith by the holy council of Trent , and explained in the same_way by all the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church . Finally , We and Our Predecessors have often expounded it and earnestly advocated it whenever occasion offered . But recent attacks on this traditional doctrine of the Church , the danger they constitute , and the harm they do to the souls of the faithful lead Us , in fulfillment of the duties of Our charge , to take up the matter once_again in this Encyclical Letter , and to reprove these errors which_are so often propounded under a specious appearance of truth . First of all , it -isaia- against common sense , which_the Church always holds in esteem , to consider_the sexual instinct as the most important and the deepest of human tendencies , and to conclude from this_that man cannot restrain it for his whole_life without danger to his vital nervous system , and consequently without injuring the harmony of his personality . Thomas very rightly observes , the deepest natural instinct -isaia- the instinct of conversation ; the sexual instinct comes second . In addition , it -isaia- for the rational inclination , which_-isaia- the distinguishing privilege of our nature , to regulate these fundamental instincts and by dominating to ennoble them . It -isaia- , alas , true_that the sin of Adam has caused a deep disturbance in our corporal faculties and our passions , so that_they wish to gain control of the life of the senses and even of the spirit , obscuring our reason and weakening our will . But Christ s grace -isaia- given us , especially by the sacraments , to help us to keep our bodies in subjection and to live by the spirit . The virtue of chastity does_not_mean that_we_are insensible to the urge of concupiscence , but_that we subordinate it to reason and the law of grace , by striving wholeheartedly after what_-isaia- noblest in human and Christian life . In order to acquire this perfect mastery of the spirit over the senses , it -isaia-_not_enough to refrain from acts directly contrary to chastity , but_it_-isaia- necessary also generously to renounce anything that may offend this virtue nearly or remotely ; -atti_degli_apostoli- such a price will the soul be able to reign fully over the body and lead its spiritual_life in peace and liberty . Who then does_not see , in the light of Catholic principles , that perfect chastity and virginity , far from harming the normal unfolding of man or woman , on the contrary endow them_with_the highest moral nobility . We have recently with sorrow censured the opinion of those_who contend that marriage -isaia-_the_only means of assuring the natural development and perfection of the human personality . For there are_those_who maintain that the grace of the sacrament , conferred ex opere operato , renders the use of marriage so holy as to be a fitter instrument than virginity for uniting souls with God ; for marriage -isaia- a sacrament , but_not virginity . We denounce this_doctrine as a dangerous error . Certainly , the sacrament grants the married couple the grace to accomplish holily the duties of their married state , and it strengthens the bonds of mutual affection that unite them ; but the purpose of its institution was_not to make_the employment of marriage the means , most suitable in itself , for uniting the souls of the husband_and_wife with God by the bonds of charity . Or rather does_not the Apostle Paul admit that_they_have the right of abstaining for a time from the use of marriage , so that_they_may be more free for prayer , precisely_because such abstinence gives greater freedom to the soul which wishes to give itself over to spiritual thoughts and prayer to God ? . Finally , it may_not be asserted , as some do , that the '' mutual help , '' which_-isaia- sought in Christian Marriage , -isaia- a more_effective aid in striving for personal sanctity than the solitude of the heart , as they term it , of virgins and celibates . For although all those_who_have embraced a life of perfect chastity have deprived themselves of the expression of human love permitted in the married state , nonetheless it cannot thereby be affirmed that because of this privation they_have diminished and despoiled the human personality . For they receive from the Giver of heavenly_gifts something spiritual which far exceeds that '' mutual help '' which husband_and_wife confer on each_other . They consecrate themselves to Him Who -isaia- their source , and Who shares with_them His divine_life , and thus personality suffers no loss , but gains immensely . For who , more_than the virgin , can apply to himself that marvelous phrase of the Apostle Paul : '' I live , now not I ; but Christ liveth in me . For this_reason_the Church has most wisely held that the celibacy of her priests must be retained ; she knows it -isaia- and will be a source of spiritual graces by which_they will be ever more_closely united with God . We feel it opportune , moreover , to touch somewhat briefly here on the error of those_who , in order to turn boys and girls away from Seminaries and Religious Institutes , strive to impress upon their_minds that the Church today has a greater need of the help and of the profession of Christian virtue on the part of those_who , united in marriage , lead a life together_with others in the world , than of priest and consecrated virgins , who , because_of_their vow of chastity , are , as it were , withdrawn from human_society . No one_can fail to see , Venerable Brothers , how utterly false and harmful -isaia- such an opinion . Of course , it -isaia- not Our intention to deny that Catholic spouses , because of the example of their Christian life , can , wherever they live and whatever be their circumstances , produce rich and salutary fruits as a witness to their virtue . Yet whoever for this_reason argues that_it_-isaia- preferable to live in matrimony than to consecrate oneself completely to God , without_doubt perverts the right order . Indeed We earnestly wish , Venerable Brothers , that_those_who have_already contracted marriage , or desire to enter this state , be properly taught their serious obligations not_only to educate properly and carefully whatever children they_have or will_have , but_also to help others , within their capacity , by the testimony of their_faith and the example of their virtue . And yet , as Our duty demands , We cannot_but censure all those_who strive to turn young_people away from the Seminary or Religious Orders and Institutes , and from the taking of sacred vows , persuading them that_they_can , if joined in marriage , as fathers and mothers of families pursue a greater spiritual good by an open and public profession of their Christian life . Certainly their conduct would be more proper and correct , if , instead of trying to distract from a life of virginity those young men_and_women , who desire to give themselves to the service of God , too few alas today , they_were to exhort with all the zeal -atti_degli_apostoli- their command the vast numbers of those_who live in wedlock to promote apostolic works in the ranks of the laity . On this_point , Ambrose fittingly writes : '' To sow the seeds of perfect purity and to arouse a desire_for virginity has_always belonged to the function of the priesthood . We think it necessary , moreover , to warn that_it_-isaia- altogether false to assert that_those_who are vowed to perfect chastity are practically outside the community of men . Are not consecrated virgins , who dedicate their_lives to the service of the poor and the sick , without making any distinction as to race , social rank , or religion , are_not these virgins united intimately with_their miseries and sorrows , and affectionately drawn to them , as though_they were their mothers ? And does_not the priest likewise , moved by the example of his Divine Master , perform the function of a good_shepherd , who knows his flock and calls them by name ? Indeed it -isaia- from that perfect chastity which_they cultivate that priests and religious men_and_women find the motive for giving themselves to all , and love all men with the love of Christ . And they too , who_live the contemplative life , precisely_because they not_only offer to God prayer and supplication but immolate themselves for the salvation of others , accomplish much for the good of the Church ; indeed , when in circumstances like the present they dedicate themselves to works of charity and of the apostolate , according to the norms which We laid_down in the Apostolic Letter '' Sponsa Christi , '' they are_very much to be praised ; nor_can they be said to be separated_from contact_with men , since_they labor for their_spiritual progress in this twofold way . From the Church s teaching on the excellence of virginity , let Us now come , Venerable Brothers , to some points which_are of practical application . In the first_place , it must be clearly stated_that because virginity should be esteemed as something more_perfect than marriage , it does_not follow that_it_-isaia- necessary_for Christian perfection . Holiness of life can really be attained , even without a chastity that_-isaia- consecrated to God . Witness to this are the many holy men_and_women , who_are publicly honored by the Church , and who_were faithful spouses and stood out as an example of excellent fathers and mothers ; indeed it -isaia- not rare to find married people_who_are very earnest in their_efforts for Christian perfection . It should be pointed_out , also , that God does_not urge all Christians to virginity , as the Apostle Paul teaches us with these_words : '' Now concerning virgins , I have no commandment of the Lord ; but I give counsel . '' We are , therefore , merely invited by counsel to embrace perfect chastity , as something which_can lead those '' to whom it -isaia- given '' more safely and successfully to the evangelical perfection they seek , and to the conquest of the kingdom_of_heaven . Wherefore it -isaia- '' not imposed , but proposed , '' as St . Ambrose so aptly observed . Hence , perfect chastity demands , first , a free choice by Christians before they consecrate themselves to God and then , from God , supernatural help and grace . Our Divine Redeemer Himself has taught us this in the following words : '' All men take not his_word , but_they to whom it -isaia- given . He that_can take it , let_him take it . Jerome , intently pondering this sacred phrase of Jesus Christ , exhorts all '' that_each one study his_own powers , whether he can fulfill the precepts of virginal modesty . For of itself chastity -isaia- charming and attractive to all . But one s forces must be considered , that he who_can may take it . The Lord s word_-isaia- as it were an exhortation , stirring on His soldiers to the prize of purity . He that_can take it , let_him take it : let him_who can , fight , conquer and receive his reward . For virginity -isaia- a difficult virtue ; that_one be able to embrace it there_-isaia- needed not_only a strong and declared determination of completely and perpetually abstaining from those legitimate pleasures derived_from marriage ; but_also a constant vigilance and struggle to contain and dominate rebellious movements of body_and_soul , a flight from the importunings of this_world , a struggle to conquer the wiles of Satan . How true -isaia- that saying of Chrysostom : '' the root , and the flower , too , of virginity -isaia- a crucified life . '' For virginity , according to Ambrose , -isaia- as a sacrificial offering , and the virgin '' an oblation of modesty , a victim of chastity . Methodius , Bishop of Olympus , compares virgins to martyrs , and St . Gregory the Great teaches_that perfect chastity substitutes for martyrdom : '' Now , though the era of persecution -isaia- gone , yet our peace has its martyrdom , because though we bend not the neck to the sword , yet with a spiritual weapon we slay fleshly desires in our_hearts . '' Hence a chastity dedicated to God demands strong and noble souls , souls ready to do battle and conquer '' for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven . Prior , therefore , to entering upon this_most difficult path , all who by experience know they_are too weak in spirit should humbly heed this warning of Paul the Apostle : '' But if they_do_not contain themselves , let_them marry . For it -isaia- better to marry than to be burnt . '' For many , undoubtedly , the burden of perpetual continence -isaia- a heavier one than they_should be persuaded to shoulder . And so priests , who_are under grave obligation of helping by their advice young_people who declare they_are drawn by some movement of soul to aspire to the priesthood or enter religious_life , must urge them to ponder the matter carefully , lest they enter a way which they_cannot hope to follow sturdily and happily to its end . They should prudently examine the fitness of candidates , even obtaining , as often as -isaia- proper , the opinion of experts ; and then , if serious doubt remains , especially if it -isaia- based on past experience , they_should make_use of their authority to make candidates cease from seeking a state of perfect chastity , nor_should these latter ever be admitted to Holy Orders , or to religious profession . And yet , although chastity pledged to God -isaia- a difficult virtue , those_who after serious consideration generously answer Christ s invitation and do all in their_power to attain it , can perfectly and faithfully preserve it . For since_they have eagerly embraced the state of virginity or celibacy they_will certainly receive from God that gift of grace through whose help they will_be_able to carry_out_their promise . Wherefore , if there_are any '' who_do_not feel they_have the gift of chastity even_though they_have vowed it , '' let_them not declare they_cannot fulfill their obligations in this_matter . '' For , '' says the Council of Trent , quoting St . Augustine , '' God does_not command the impossible , but in commanding serves notice that_one do what he can , and pray for_what he cannot , and He helps us to accomplish it . '' This truth , so full of encouragement , We recall to those also whose will has_been weakened by upset nerves and whom some doctors , sometimes even Catholic doctors , are too quick to persuade that_they_should be freed from such an obligation , advancing the specious reason_that they_cannot preserve their chastity without suffering some harm to their mental balance . How much_more useful and opportune it -isaia- to help the infirm of this type to strengthen their will , and to advise them that not_even to them -isaia- chastity impossible , according to the word of the Apostle : '' God -isaia- faithful , who_will not suffer you to be tempted above that_which you are_able : but will_make also_with temptation issue , that_you_may be able to bear it . Here are the helps , commended to us by our Divine Redeemer , by which we may efficaciously protect our virtue : constant vigilance , whereby we diligently do all that_we_can ; moreover , constant prayer to God , asking for_what we cannot attain by ourselves , because of our weakness . '' Watch and pray , that_you enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed -isaia- willing , but the flesh -isaia- weak . '' A vigilance which guards every moment of our_lives and every type of circumstance -isaia- absolutely necessary_for us : '' For the flesh lusteth against the spirit : and the spirit against the flesh . '' But if anyone grants however little to the enticements of the flesh , he will see himself quickly pulled toward those '' works of the flesh '' which_the Apostle lists , the basest and ugliest vices of man . Hence we must watch particularly over the movements of our passions and of our senses , and so control them by voluntary discipline in our_lives and by bodily mortification that we render them obedient to right_reason and God s law : '' And they that_are Christ s have crucified their flesh , with its vices and concupiscences . '' The Apostle of the Gentiles says this about himself : '' But I chastise my body , and bring it into subjection : lest perhaps , when I have preached to others , I myself should become a castaway . '' All holy men_and_women have most carefully guarded the movements of their senses and their passions , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times have very harshly crushed them , in keeping_with_the teaching of the Divine Master : '' But I say to you , that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her , hath already committed adultery with_her in his_heart . And if thy right eye scandalize thee , pluck it out and cast it from thee . For it -isaia- expedient for thee that_one of thy members should perish , rather_than that thy whole_body be cast into hell . '' It -isaia- abundantly clear_that with this warning Our Savior demands of us above all that we never consent to any sin , even internally , and that we steadfastly remove far from us anything that_can even slightly tarnish the beautiful virtue of purity . In this_matter no diligence , no severity can be considered exaggerated . If ill health or other reasons do not_allow one heavier corporal austerities , yet they never free one from vigilance and internal self control . On this_point it should be noted , as indeed the Fathers and Doctors of the Church teach , that_we_can more_easily struggle against and repress the wiles of evil and the enticements of the passions if we do not struggle directly against them , but_rather flee from them as best we may . For the preserving of chastity , according to the teaching of Jerome , flight -isaia- more_effective than open warfare : '' Therefore I flee , lest I be overcome . '' Flight must be understood in this_sense , that not_only do we diligently avoid occasion of sin , but especially that in struggles of this_kind we lift our minds and hearts to God , intent above all on Him to Whom we have vowed our virginity . '' Look upon the beauty of your Lover , '' St . Flight and alert vigilance , by which we carefully avoid the occasions of sin , have always_been considered by holy men_and_women as the most effective method of combat in this_matter ; today however it does_not seem that everybody holds the same opinion . Some indeed claim that all Christians , and the clergy in particular , should_not be '' separated_from the world '' as in the past , but should be '' close to the world ; '' therefore they_should '' take the risk '' and put their chastity to the test in order to show whether or not they_have the strength to resist ; therefore , they_say , let young clerics see everything so that_they_may accustom themselves to gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- everything with equanimity , and thus render themselves immune to all temptations . For this_reason they readily grant young clerics the liberty to turn their_eyes in any direction without_the slightest concern_for modesty ; they_may attend motion pictures , even_those forbidden by ecclesiastical censorship ; they_may peruse even obscene periodicals ; they_may read novels which_are listed in the Index of forbidden books or prohibited by the Natural Law . All this they allow because today the multitudes are fed by this_kind of amusement and publication and because those_who_are minded to help_them should understand their_way of thinking and feeling . But it -isaia- easily seen that_this method of educating and training the clergy to acquire the sanctity proper to their calling -isaia- wrong and harmful . For '' he that loveth danger shall perish in it ; '' most appropriate in this connection -isaia- the admonition of Augustine : '' Do not say that_you have a chaste mind if your eyes are unchaste , because an unchaste eye betrays an unchaste heart . No doubt this pernicious method -isaia- based upon serious confusion of thought . Indeed Christ Our Lord asserted of His Apostles , '' I have sent them into_the_world ; '' yet previously He had said of them , '' They are_not of the world , as I also -amos- not of the world , '' and He had prayed to His Heavenly Father in these_words , '' I pray not_that thou shouldst take them out of the world , but_that thou shouldst keep them_from evil . '' Motivated by the same principles , and in order to protect priests from temptations to evil , to which all those are ordinarily subject who_are in intimate contact_with_the world , the Church has promulgated appropriate and wise laws , whose purpose -isaia- to safeguard sacerdotal sanctity from the cares and pleasures of the laity . All the more reason_why the young clergy , because_they_are to be trained in the spiritual_life , in sacerdotal and religious perfection , must be separated_from the tumult of the world before entering the lists of combat ; for long years they_must remain in a Seminary or Scholasticate where_they receive a sound and careful education which provides them_with a gradual approach to and a prudent knowledge of those problems which our_times have brought to the fore , in accordance_with_the norms which We established in the Apostolic Exhortation '' Menti Nostrae . '' What gardener would expose young plants , choice indeed but weak , to violent storms in order_that they_might give proof of the strength which_they_have not_yet acquired ? Seminarians and scholastics are surely to be considered like young and weak plants who must still be protected and gradually trained to resist and to fight . The educators of the young clergy would render a more valuable and useful service , if they_would inculcate in youthful minds the precepts of Christian modesty , which_-isaia- so important_for the preservation of perfect chastity and which_-isaia- truly called the prudence of chastity . For modesty foresees threatening danger , forbids us to expose ourselves to risks , demands the avoidance of those occasions which_the imprudent do not shun . It does_not like impure or loose talk , it shrinks from the slightest immodesty , it carefully avoids suspect familiarity with persons of the other sex , since it brings the soul to show due reverence to the body , as being a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit . He who possesses the treasure of Christian modesty abominates every sin of impurity and instantly flees whenever he -isaia- tempted by its seductions . Modesty will moreover suggest and provide suitable words for parents and educators by which_the youthful conscience will be formed in matters of chastity . '' Wherefore , '' as We said in a recent address , '' this modesty -isaia- not to be so understood as to be equivalent to a perpetual silence on this_subject , nor as allowing no place_for sober and cautious discussion about these_matters in imparting moral instruction . '' In modern times however there_are_some teachers and educators who too frequently think it their_duty to initiate innocent boys and girls into the secrets of human generation in such_a_way as to offend their sense of shame . But in this_matter just temperance and moderation must be used , as Christian modesty demands . This modesty -isaia- nourished by the fear of God , that filial fear which_-isaia- founded on the virtue of profound Christian humility , and which creates in us utter abhorrence for the slightest sin , as Our predecessor , St . Clement I , stated in these_words , '' he who_-isaia- chaste in flesh should_not be proud , for he should know_that he owes the gift of continence to another . '' How important Christian humility -isaia- for the protection of virginity , no one perhaps has taught more_clearly than Augustine . '' Because perpetual continence , and virginity above all , -isaia- a great good in the saints of God , extreme vigilance must be exercised lest it be corrupted by pride . The more_clearly I see the greatness of this_gift , the more truly do I fear lest it be plundered by thieving pride . No one therefore protects virginity , but God Himself Who bestowed it : and God -isaia- charity . The guardian therefore of virginity -isaia- charity ; the habitat of this guardian -isaia- humility . Moreover there_-isaia- another argument worthy of attentive consideration : to preserve chastity unstained neither vigilance nor modesty suffice . Those helps must_also be used which entirely surpass the powers of nature , namely prayer to God , the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist , a fervent devotion to the most_holy Mother of God . Never should it be forgotten that perfect chastity -isaia- a great gift of God . For this_reason Jerome wrote these succinct words , '' It -isaia- given to those , who_have asked for it , who_have desired it , who_have worked to receive it . For it will be given to everyone who asks , the seeker will_find , to the importunate it will be opened . '' Ambrose adds that the constant fidelity of virgins to their Divine Spouse depends upon prayer . With that fervent piety for_which he was noted St . Alphonsus Liguori taught that_there_-isaia- no help more necessary and certain for conquering temptations against the beautiful virtue of chastity than instant recourse to God in prayer . To prayer must be added frequent and fervent use of the Sacrament of Penance which , as a spiritual medicine , purifies and heals us ; likewise it -isaia- necessary to receive the Eucharist , which as Our predecessor_of_happy_memory Leo XIII asserted , -isaia- the best remedy against lust . The more pure and chaste -isaia- a soul , the more it hungers for_this bread , from which it derives strength to resist all temptations to sins of impurity , and by which_it_-isaia- more intimately united with the Divine Spouse ; '' He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood , abides in me and I in him . The eminent way to protect and nourish an unsullied and perfect chastity , as proven by experience time and again throughout_the course of centuries , -isaia- solid and fervent devotion to the Virgin Mother of God . In a certain way all other helps are contained in this_devotion ; there_-isaia- no doubt_that whoever -isaia- sincerely and earnestly animated by this_devotion -isaia- salutarily inspired to constant vigilance , to continual prayer , to receive the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist . Therefore in a paternal way We exhort all priests , religious men_and_women , to entrust themselves to the special protection of the holy Mother of God who_-isaia- the Virgin of virgins and the '' teacher of virginity , '' as Ambrose says , and the most powerful Mother of those in particular who_have vowed and consecrated themselves to the service of God . That virginity owes its origin to Mary -isaia- the testimony of Athanasius , and Augustine clearly teaches_that '' The dignity of virginity began with the Mother of the Lord . '' Pursuing the ideas of Athanasius , Ambrose holds up the life of the Virgin Mary as the model of virgins . '' Imitate her , my daughters . ! Let Mary s life be for you like the portrayal of virginity , for from her , as though from a mirror , -isaia- reflected the beauty of chastity and the ideal of virtue . See in her the pattern of your life , for in her , as though in a model , manifest teachings of goodness show what you_should correct , what you_should copy and what preserve . She -isaia- the image of virginity . For such was Mary that her_life alone suffices for the instruction of all . Therefore let holy Mary guide your way_of_life . '' '' Her grace was so great that it not_only preserved in her the grace of virginity , but bestowed the grace of chastity upon those on whom she gazed . '' How true -isaia- the saying of Ambrose , '' Oh the richness of the virginity of Mary ! Because of this richness it will be very useful for religious men_and_women and for priests of our_day to contemplate the virginity of Mary , in order that_they_may more faithfully and perfectly practice the chastity of their calling . But it -isaia-_not_enough , beloved sons_and_daughters , to meditate on the virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary : with absolute confidence fly to her and obey the counsel of St . Bernard , '' let us seek grace and seek it through Mary . '' In a special_way entrust to her during the Marian Year the care of your spiritual_life and perfection , imitating the example of Jerome who asserted , '' My virginity -isaia- dedicated in Mary and to Christ . In the midst of the grave difficulties with_which_the Church must contend today , the heart of the Supreme Pastor -isaia- greatly comforted , Venerable Brothers , when We see_that virginity , which_-isaia- flourishing throughout_the_world , -isaia- held in great honor and repute in the present as it was in past centuries , even_though , as We have_said , it -isaia- being attacked by errors which , We trust , will soon be dispelled and pass away . Nevertheless We do not deny that_this Our joy -isaia- overshadowed by a certain sorrow since We learn that in not_a_few countries the number of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious_life -isaia- constantly decreasing . We have_already given the principal reasons which account for this_fact and there_-isaia- no reason_why We should return to them now . Rather do We trust that_those educators of youth who_have succumbed to errors in this_matter , will repudiate them as soon as they_are detected , and will consequently seriously resolve both to correct them and to do what_they can to provide every help for the youth entrusted to their care who feel themselves called by divine_grace to aspire to the priesthood or to embrace the religious_life , in order that_they_may be able to reach so noble a goal . May God grant that new and larger ranks of priests , religious men_and_women , equal in number and virtue to the current necessities of the Church , may soon go forth to cultivate the vineyard of the Lord . Moreover , as the obligation of Our Apostolic Office demands , We urge fathers and mothers to willingly offer to the service of God those of their_children who are_called to it . But if this be a source of trouble , sorrow or regret , let_them seriously meditate upon the admonition which Ambrose gave to the mothers of Milan . '' The majority of the young women whom I knew wanted to be virgins were forbidden to leave by their mothers . If your daughters want to love a man , the laws allow them to choose whom they_will . But those_who_have a right to choose a man , have no right to choose God . Let parents consider what a great honor it -isaia- to see their son elevated to the priesthood , or their daughter consecrate her virginity to her Divine Spouse . In regard to consecrated virgins , the Bishop of Milan writes , '' You have heard , parents , that a virgin -isaia-_a_gift of God , the oblation of parents , the priesthood of chastity . The virgin -isaia- a mother s victim , by whose daily sacrifice divine anger -isaia- appeased . Before We come to the end of this Encyclical Letter , We wish , Venerable Brothers , to turn Our mind_and_heart in a special manner to those men_and_women , who , vowed to the service of God , are suffering bitter and terrible persecutions in not_a_few countries . Let them imitate the example of the consecrated virgins of the early Church who with courageous and indomitable hearts suffered martyrdom for the sake of their virginity . May all who_have vowed to serve Christ , bravely persevere '' even to death . '' May they realize_that their pains , sufferings and prayers are of great value in the sight of God for the restoration of His Kingdom in their countries and in the universal Church ; may_they be most certain_that those '' who follow_the Lamb whither He goeth , '' will sing forever a '' new canticle , '' which no one else can sing . Our paternal heart_-isaia- filled_with compassion for priests , religious men_and_women , who_are bravely professing their_faith even to the extent of martyrdom ; and not_only_for them , but_for all those_who in every part_of_the_world are totally dedicated and consecrated to the divine service , We implore God with suppliant prayer to sustain , strength and console them . We earnestly invite each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brothers , and your faithful to pray with Us and to implore for all these souls the consolations , gifts and graces which_they need from God . Let the Apostolic Blessing , which with loving heart We impart to you , Venerable Brothers , to all priests and consecrated virgins , to those especially '' who_suffer persecution for_justice s sake '' and to all your faithful , be a pledge of heavenly grace and a testimony of Our paternal benevolence .

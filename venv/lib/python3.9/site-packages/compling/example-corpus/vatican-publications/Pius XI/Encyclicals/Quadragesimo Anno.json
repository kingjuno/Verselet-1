Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Forty years have passed since Leo XIII s peerless Encyclical , On the Condition of Workers , first saw the light , and the whole Catholic world , filled_with grateful recollection , -isaia- undertaking to commemorate it with befitting solemnity . Other Encyclicals of Our Predecessor had in a way prepared the path for that outstanding document and proof of pastoral_care : namely , those on the family and the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony as the source of human_society , on the origin of civil authority and its_proper relations with the Church , on the chief duties of Christian citizens , against the tenets of Socialism against false teachings on human liberty , and others of the same nature fully expressing the mind of Leo XIII . Yet the Encyclical , On the Condition of Workers , compared with the rest had this special distinction that -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when it was most opportune and actually necessary to do so , it laid_down for all mankind the surest rules to solve aright that difficult problem of human relations called '' the social_question . For toward_the close of the nineteenth century , the new kind of economic_life that had arisen and the new developments of industry had gone to the point in most countries that human_society was clearly becoming divided more_and_more into two classes . One class , very small in number , was enjoying almost all the advantages which modern inventions so abundantly provided ; the other , embracing the huge multitude of working people , oppressed by wretched poverty , was vainly seeking escape from the straits wherein it stood . Quite agreeable , of course , was this state of things to those_who thought it in their abundant riches the result of inevitable economic laws and accordingly , as if it were for charity to veil the violation of justice which lawmakers not_only tolerated but_-atti_degli_apostoli- times sanctioned , wanted the whole care of supporting the poor committed to charity alone . The workers , on the other_hand , crushed by their hard lot , were barely enduring it and were refusing longer to bend their necks beneath so galling a yoke ; and some of them , carried away by the heat of evil counsel , were seeking the overturn of everything , while others , whom Christian training restrained from such evil designs , stood firm in the judgment that much in this had to be wholly and speedily changed . The same feeling those many Catholics , both priests and laymen , shared , whom a truly wonderful charity had long spurred on to relieve the unmerited poverty of the non owning workers , and who could in no way convince themselves that so enormous and unjust an in equality in the distribution of this_world s goods truly conforms to the designs of the all wise Creator . Those men were without question sincerely seeking an immediate remedy for_this lamentable disorganization of States and a secure safeguard against worse dangers . Yet such_-isaia- the weakness of even the best of human minds that , now rejected as dangerous innovators , now hindered in the good work by their_very associates advocating other courses of action , and , uncertain in the face of various opinions , they_were -atti_degli_apostoli- a loss which way to turn . In such a sharp conflict of mind , therefore , while the question -atti_degli_apostoli- issue was being argued this_way and that , nor always with calmness , all eyes as often before turned to the Chair of Peter , to that sacred depository of all truth whence words of salvation pour forth to all the world . And to the feet of Christ s Vicar on earth were flocking in unaccustomed numbers , men well versed in social questions , employers , and workers themselves , begging him_with one voice to point_out , finally , the safe road to them . The wise Pontiff long weighed all this in his mind before God ; he summoned the most experienced and learned to counsel ; he pondered the issues carefully and from every angle . At last , admonished '' by the consciousness of His Apostolic Office '' lest silence on his part might be regarded as failure in his duty he decided , in virtue of the Divine Teaching Office entrusted to him , to address not_only the whole Church of Christ but all mankind . Therefore on the fifteenth day of May , , that long awaited voice thundered forth ; neither daunted by the arduousness of the problem nor weakened by age but_with vigorous energy , it taught the whole human_family to strike out in the social_question upon new paths . You know , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , and understand full well the wonderful teaching which_has made the Encyclical , On the Condition of Workers , illustrious forever . The Supreme Pastor in this Letter , grieving that so large a portion of mankind should '' live undeservedly in miserable and wretched conditions , '' took it upon himself_with great courage to defend '' the cause of the workers whom_the present age had handed over , each alone and defenseless , to the inhumanity of employers and the unbridled greed of competitors . '' He sought no help from either Liberalism or Socialism , for the one had proved that_it_was utterly unable to solve the social problem aright , and the other , proposing a remedy far worse than the evil itself , would_have plunged human_society into great dangers . Since a problem was being treated '' for_which no satisfactory solution '' -isaia- found '' unless religion and the Church have been_called upon to aid , '' the Pope , clearly exercising his right and correctly holding that the guardianship of religion and the stewardship over those things_that_are closely bound up with it had_been entrusted especially to him and relying solely upon the unchangeable principles drawn_from the treasury of right_reason and Divine Revelation , confidently and as one having authority , declared and proclaimed '' the rights_and_duties within which_the rich and the proletariat those_who furnish material things and those_who furnish work ought to be restricted in relation to each_other , '' and what_the Church , heads of States and the people themselves directly concerned ought to do . The Apostolic voice did_not thunder forth in vain . On the contrary , not_only did the obedient children of the Church hearken to it with marveling admiration and hail it with the greatest applause , but many also who_were wandering far from the truth , from the unity of the faith , and nearly all who since then either in private study or in enacting legislation have concerned themselves_with the social_and_economic question . Feeling themselves vindicated and defended by the Supreme Authority on earth , Christian workers received this Encyclical with_special joy . So , too , did all those noble hearted men_who , long solicitous for the improvement of the condition of the workers , had up to that_time encountered almost nothing but indifference from many , and even rankling suspicion , if not open hostility , from some . Rightly , therefore , have all these groups constantly held the Apostolic Encyclical from that_time in such high honor that to signify their gratitude they_are wont , in various places and in various_ways , to commemorate it every year . However , in spite of such_great agreement , there_were some who were_not a little disturbed ; and so it happened that the teaching of Leo XIII , so noble and lofty and so utterly new to worldly ears , was held suspect by some , even among Catholics , and to certain ones it even gave offense . For it boldly attacked and overturned the idols of Liberalism , ignored long standing prejudices , and was in advance of its time beyond all expectation , so that the slow of heart disdained to study this_new social philosophy and the timid feared to scale so lofty a height . There were some also who stood , indeed , in awe -atti_degli_apostoli- its splendor , but regarded it as a kind of imaginary ideal of perfection more desirable then attainable . Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , as all everywhere and especially Catholic workers who_are pouring from all sides into this Holy City , are celebrating with_such enthusiasm the solemn commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the Encyclical On the Condition of Workers , We deem it fitting on this occasion to recall_the great benefits this Encyclical has brought to the Catholic Church and to all human_society ; to defend the illustrious Master s doctrine on the social_and_economic question against certain doubts and to develop it more_fully as to some points ; and lastly , summoning to court the contemporary economic regime and passing judgment on Socialism , to lay bare the root of the existing social confusion and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time point the only way to sound restoration : namely , the Christian reform of morals . All these_matters which we undertake to treat will fall under three main headings , and this entire Encyclical will be devoted to their development . To begin with the topic which_we_have proposed first to discuss , We cannot refrain , following the counsel of St . Ambrose who says_that '' no duty -isaia- more_important than_that of returning thanks , '' from offering our fullest gratitude to Almighty God for the immense benefits that_have come through Leo s Encyclical to the Church and to human_society . If indeed We should wish to review these benefits even cursorily , almost the whole history of the social_question during the last forty years would_have to be recalled to mind . These benefits can be reduced conveniently , however , to three main points , corresponding to the three kinds of help which Our Predecessor ardently desired for the accomplishment of his great work of restoration . In the first_place Leo himself clearly stated what ought to be expected from the Church : '' Manifestly it -isaia- the Church which draws from the Gospel the teachings through_which the struggle can be composed entirely , or , after its bitterness -isaia- removed , can certainly become more tempered . It -isaia- the Church , again , that strives not_only to instruct the mind , but to regulate by her precepts the life and morals of individuals , and that ameliorates the condition of the workers through_her numerous and beneficent institutions '' . The Church did_not let these rich fountains lie quiescent in her bosom , but_from them drew copiously for the common_good of the longed for peace . Leo himself and his Successors , showing paternal charity and pastoral constancy always , in defense especially of the poor and the weak , proclaimed and urged without ceasing again_and_again by voice and pen the teaching on the social_and_economic question which On the Condition of Workers presented , and adapted it fittingly to the needs of time and of circumstance . And many bishops have_done the same , who in their continual and able interpretation of this_same teaching have illustrated it with commentaries and in accordance_with_the mind and instructions of the Holy See provided for its application to the conditions and institutions of diverse regions . It -isaia- not surprising , therefore_,_that many scholars , both priests and laymen , led especially by the desire_that the unchanged and unchangeable teaching of the Church should meet new demands and needs more_effectively , have zealously undertaken to develop , with the Church as their guide and teacher , a social_and_economic science in accord with the conditions of our_time . And so , with Leo s Encyclical pointing the way and furnishing the light , a true Catholic social science has arisen , which_-isaia- daily fostered and enriched by the tireless efforts of those chosen men whom We have termed auxiliaries of the Church . They do not , indeed , allow their science to lie hidden behind learned walls . As the useful and well attended courses instituted in Catholic universities , colleges , and seminaries , the social congresses and '' weeks '' that_are held -atti_degli_apostoli- frequent intervals with most successful results , the study groups that_are promoted , and finally the timely and sound publications that_are disseminated everywhere and in every possible way , clearly show , these_men bring their science out into the full light and stress of life . Nor -isaia- the benefit that_has poured forth_from Leo s Encyclical confined within these bounds ; for the teaching which On the Condition of Workers contains has gradually and imperceptibly worked its way into the minds of those outside Catholic unity who_do_not recognize_the authority of the Church . Catholic principles on the social_question have as a result , passed little by little into the patrimony of all human_society , and We rejoice that the eternal truths_which Our Predecessor of glorious memory proclaimed so impressively have_been frequently invoked and defended not_only in non Catholic books and journals but in legislative halls also courts of justice . Furthermore , after_the terrible war , when_the statesmen of the leading nations were attempting to restore peace on the basis of a thorough reform of social conditions , did_not they , among the norms agreed upon to regulate in accordance_with justice and equity the labor of the workers , give sanction to many points that so remarkably coincide with Leo s principles and instructions as to seem consciously taken therefrom ? The Encyclical On the Condition of Workers , without question , has become a memorable document and rightly to it may be applied the words of Isaias : '' He shall set up a standard to the nations . Meanwhile , as Leo s teachings were being widely diffused in the minds_of_men , with learned investigations leading the way , they_have come to be put into_practice . In the first_place , zealous efforts have been_made , with active good_will , to lift up that class which on account of the modern expansion of industry had increased to enormous numbers but_not yet had obtained its rightful place or rank in human_society and was , for that_reason , all but neglected and despised the workers , We mean to whose improvement , to the great advantage of souls , the diocesan and regular clergy , though burdened with_other pastoral duties , have under the leadership of the Bishops devoted themselves . This constant work , undertaken to fill the workers souls with the Christian spirit , helped much also to make_them conscious of their true dignity and render them capable , by placing clearly before them the rights_and_duties of their class , of legitimately and happily advancing and even of becoming leaders of their fellows . From that_time on , fuller means of livelihood have_been more securely obtained ; for not_only did works of beneficence and charity begin to multiply -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of the Pontiff , but_there have_also been established everywhere new and continuously expanding organizations in which workers , draftsmen , farmers and employees of every_kind , with the counsel of the Church and frequently under the leadership of her priests , give and receive mutual help and support . With regard to civil authority , Leo XIII , boldly breaking through the confines imposed by Liberalism , fearlessly taught that government must_not be thought a mere guardian of law and of good order , but_rather must put forth every_effort so that '' through the entire scheme of laws and institutions . both public and individual well_being may develop spontaneously out of the very structure and administration of the State . '' Just freedom of action must , of course , be left both to individual citizens and to families , yet only on condition that the common_good be preserved and wrong to any individual be abolished . The function of the rulers of the State , moreover , -isaia- to watch over the community and its parts ; but in protecting private individuals in their_rights , chief consideration ought to be given to the weak and the poor . '' For the nation , as it were , of the rich -isaia- guarded by its_own defenses and -isaia- in less need of governmental protection , whereas the suffering multitude , without_the means to protect itself relies especially on the protection of the State . Wherefore , since wageworkers are numbered among the great mass of the needy , the State must include them under its special_care and foresight . We , of course , do not deny that_even before the Encyclical of Leo , some rulers of peoples have provided for certain of the more urgent needs of the workers and curbed more flagrant acts of injustice inflicted upon them . But after_the Apostolic voice had sounded from the Chair of Peter throughout_the_world , rulers of nations , more_fully alive -atti_degli_apostoli- last to their_duty , devoted their_minds and attention to the task of promoting a more comprehensive and fruitful social policy . And while the principles of Liberalism were tottering , which_had long prevented effective action by those governing the State , the Encyclical On the Condition of Workers in truth impelled peoples themselves to promote a social policy on truer grounds and with_greater intensity , and so strongly encouraged good Catholics to furnish valuable help to heads of States in this_field that_they often stood forth as illustrious champions of this_new policy even in legislatures . Sacred ministers of the Church , thoroughly imbued_with Leo s teaching , have , in fact , often proposed to the votes of the peoples representatives the very social legislation that_has_been enacted in recent_years and have resolutely demanded and promoted its enforcement . A new branch of law , wholly unknown to the earlier time , has arisen from this continuous and unwearied labor to protect vigorously the sacred rights of the workers that flow from their_dignity as men and as Christians . These laws undertake the protection of life , health , strength , family , homes , workshops , wages and labor hazards , in fine , everything which pertains to the condition of wage workers , with_special concern_for women and children . Even though these laws do not conform exactly everywhere and in all respects to Leo s recommendations , still it -isaia- undeniable that much in them savors of the Encyclical , On the Condition of Workers , to which great credit must_be_given for whatever improvement has_been achieved in the workers condition . Finally , the wise Pontiff showed that '' employers and workers themselves can accomplish much in this_matter , manifestly through those institutions by the help of which_the poor are opportunely assisted and the two classes of society are brought closer to each_other . '' First place among_these institutions , he declares , must be assigned to associations that embrace either workers alone or workers and employers together . He goes into considerable detail in explaining and commending these associations and expounds with a truly wonderful wisdom their nature , purpose , timeliness , rights , duties , and regulations . These teachings were issued indeed most opportunely . For -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time in many nations those -atti_degli_apostoli- the helm of State , plainly imbued_with Liberalism , were showing little favor to workers associations of this type ; nay , rather they openly opposed them , and while going out of their_way to recognize similar organizations of other classes and show favor to them , they_were with criminal injustice denying the natural right to form associations to those_who needed it most to defend themselves from ill treatment -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of the powerful . There were even some Catholics who looked askance -atti_degli_apostoli- the efforts of workers to form associations of this type as if they smacked of a socialistic or revolutionary spirit . The rules , therefore , which Leo XIII issued in virtue of his authority , deserve the greatest praise in that_they_have been_able to break down this hostility and dispel these suspicions ; but they_have even a higher claim to distinction in that_they encouraged Christian workers to found mutual associations according_to_their various occupations , taught them how to do so , and resolutely confirmed in the path of duty a goodly number of those_whom socialist organizations strongly attracted by claiming to be the sole defenders and champions of the lowly and oppressed . With respect to the founding of these societies , the Encyclical On the Condition of Workers most fittingly declared that '' workers associations ought to be so constituted and so governed as to furnish the most suitable and most convenient means to attain the object proposed , which consists in this , that the individual members of the association secure , so far as -isaia- possible , an increase in the goods of body , of soul , and of property , '' yet it -isaia- clear_that '' moral and religious perfection ought to be regarded as their principal goal , and that_their social organization as such ought above all to be directed completely by this goal . '' For '' when_the regulations of associations are founded upon religion , the way -isaia- easy toward establishing the mutual relations of the members , so that peaceful living together and prosperity will result . To the founding of these associations the clergy and many of the laity devoted themselves everywhere with truly praiseworthy zeal , eager to bring Leo s program to full realization . Thus associations of this_kind have molded truly Christian workers who , in combining harmoniously the diligent practice of their occupation with the salutary precepts of religion , protect effectively and resolutely their_own temporal interests and rights , keeping a due respect for_justice and a genuine desire to work together_with other classes of society for the Christian renewal of all social_life . These counsels and instructions of Leo XIII were put into_effect differently in different places according to varied local conditions . In some places one_and_the_same association undertook to attain all the ends laid_down by the Pontiff ; in others , because circumstances suggested or required it , a division of work developed and separate associations were formed . Of these , some devoted themselves to the defense of the rights and legitimate interests of their members in the labor market ; others took over the work of providing mutual economic aid ; finally still others gave all their attention to the fulfillment of religious and moral duties and other obligations of like nature . This second method has especially been adopted where either the laws of a country , or certain special economic institutions , or that deplorable dissension of minds and hearts so widespread in contemporary society and an urgent necessity of combating with united purpose and strength the massed ranks of revolutionarists , have prevented Catholics from founding purely Catholic labor unions . Under these conditions , Catholics seem almost forced to join secular labor unions . These unions , however , should_always profess justice and equity and give Catholic members full freedom to care_for their_own conscience and obey the laws of the Church . It -isaia- clearly_the office of bishops , when_they know that_these associations are on account of circumstances necessary and are_not dangerous to religion , to approve of Catholic workers joining them , keeping before their_eyes , however , the principles and precautions laid_down by Our Predecessor , Pius X of holy memory . Among these precautions the first and chief -isaia- this : Side by side with_these unions there should_always be associations zealously engaged in imbuing and forming their members in the teaching of religion and morality so that_they in turn may_be_able to permeate the unions with_that good spirit_which should direct them in all their activity . As a result , the religious associations will bear good fruit even beyond_the circle of their_own membership . To the Encyclical of Leo , therefore , must_be_given this credit , that_these associations of workers have so flourished everywhere that while , alas , still surpassed in numbers by socialist and communist organizations , they already embrace a vast multitude of workers and are_able , within_the confines of each nation as well as in wider assemblies , to maintain vigorously the rights and legitimate demands of Catholic workers and insist also on the salutary Christian principles of society . Leo s learned treatment and vigorous defense of the natural right to form associations began , furthermore , to find ready application to other associations also and not alone to those of the workers . Hence no small part of the credit must , it seems , be given to this_same Encyclical of Leo for the fact_that among farmers and others of the middle class most useful associations of this_kind are seen flourishing to a notable degree and increasing day_by_day , as well as other institutions of a similar nature in which spiritual development and economic benefit are happily combined . But if this cannot be said of organizations which Our same Predecessor intensely desired established among employers and managers of industry and We certainly regret that_they_are so few the condition -isaia- not wholly due to the will of men but to far graver difficulties that hinder associations of this_kind which We know well and estimate -atti_degli_apostoli- their full value . There -isaia- , however , strong hope that_these obstacles also will be removed soon , and even_now We greet with the deepest joy of Our soul , certain by no means insignificant attempts in this direction , the rich fruits of which promise a still richer harvest in the future . All these benefits of Leo s Encyclical , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , which We have outlined rather_than fully described , are so numerous and of such import as to show plainly that_this immortal document does_not exhibit a merely fanciful , even if beautiful , ideal of human_society . Rather did our Predecessor draw from the Gospel and , therefore , from an ever living and life_giving fountain , teachings capable of greatly mitigating , if not immediately terminating that deadly internal struggle which_-isaia- rending the family of mankind . The rich fruits which_the Church of Christ and the whole_human_race have , by God s favor , reaped therefrom unto salvation prove that_some of this good seed , so lavishly sown forty years_ago , fell on good ground . On the basis of the long period of experience , it cannot be rash to say that Leo s Encyclical has proved itself the Magna Charta upon which all Christian activity in the social field ought to be based , as on a foundation . And those_who would seem to hold in little esteem this Papal Encyclical and its commemoration either blaspheme what_they know not , or understand nothing of what_they are only superficially acquainted with , or if they do understand convict themselves formally of injustice and ingratitude . Yet since in the course of these same years , certain doubts have arisen concerning either the correct meaning of some parts of Leo s Encyclical or conclusions to be deduced therefrom , which doubts in turn have even among Catholics given rise to controversies that_are not_always peaceful ; and since , furthermore , new needs and changed conditions of our_age have_made necessary a more precise application of Leo s teaching or even certain additions thereto , We most gladly seize this fitting occasion , in accord with Our Apostolic Office through_which We are debtors to all , to answer , so far as in Us lies , these doubts and these demands of the present_day . Yet before proceeding to explain these_matters , that principle which Leo XIII so clearly established must be laid_down -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset here , namely_,_that there resides in Us the right and duty to pronounce with supreme_authority upon social_and_economic matters . Certainly the Church was_not given the commission to guide men to an only fleeting and perishable happiness but to that_which_-isaia- eternal . Indeed '' the Church holds that_it_-isaia- unlawful for_her to mix without cause in these temporal concerns '' ; however , she_can in no wise renounce the duty God entrusted to her to interpose her authority , not of course in matters of technique for_which she_-isaia- neither suitably equipped nor endowed by office , but in all things_that_are connected_with_the moral_law . For as to these , the deposit of truth_that God committed to Us and the grave duty of disseminating and interpreting the whole moral_law , and of urging it in season and out of season , bring under and subject to Our supreme jurisdiction not_only social_order but economic activities themselves . Even though economics and moral science employs each its_own principles in its_own sphere , it -isaia- , nevertheless , an error to say that the economic and moral orders are so distinct from and alien to each_other that the former depends in no way on the latter . Certainly the laws of economics , as they_are termed , being based on the very nature of material things and on the capacities of the human body and mind , determine the limits of what productive human effort cannot , and of what it can attain in the economic field and by what means . Yet it -isaia- reason itself that clearly shows , on the basis of the individual and social nature of things and of men , the purpose which God ordained for all economic_life . But it -isaia- only the moral_law which , just as it commands us to seek our supreme and last end in the whole scheme of our activity , so likewise commands us to seek directly in each kind of activity those purposes which we know_that nature , or rather God the Author of nature , established for that kind of action , and in orderly relationship to subordinate such immediate purposes to our supreme and last end . If we faithfully observe this_law , then it will follow that the particular purposes , both individual and social , that_are sought in the economic field will fall in their_proper place in the universal order of purposes , and We , in ascending through them , as it were by steps , shall attain the final end of all things , that_-isaia- God , to Himself and to us , the supreme and inexhaustible Good . But to come down to particular points , We shall begin with ownership or the right of property . Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , you know_that Our Predecessor of happy_memory strongly defended the right of property against the tenets of the Socialists of his time by showing that_its abolition would result , not to the advantage of the working class , but to their extreme harm . Yet since there_are_some who calumniate the Supreme Pontiff , and the Church herself , as if she had taken and were still taking the part of the rich against the non owning workers certainly no accusation -isaia- more unjust than_that and since Catholics are_-atti_degli_apostoli- variance with one_another concerning the true and exact mind of Leo , it has seemed best to vindicate this , that_-isaia- , the Catholic teaching on this_matter from calumnies and safeguard it from false interpretations . First , then , let it be considered as certain and established that neither Leo nor those theologians who_have taught under_the_guidance and authority of the Church have ever denied or questioned the twofold character of ownership , called usually individual or social according as it regards either separate persons or the common_good . For they have_always unanimously maintained that nature , rather the Creator Himself , has_given man the right of private ownership not_only that individuals may_be_able to provide_for themselves and their_families but also_that the goods which_the Creator destined for the entire family of mankind may through_this institution truly serve this_purpose . All this_can be achieved in no wise except through the maintenance of a certain and definite order . Accordingly , twin rocks of shipwreck must be carefully avoided . For , as one_-isaia- wrecked upon , or comes close to , what_-isaia- known as '' individualism '' by denying or minimizing the social and public character of the right of property , so by rejecting or minimizing the private and individual character of this_same right , one inevitably runs into '' collectivism '' or -atti_degli_apostoli- least closely approaches its tenets . Unless this_-isaia- kept in mind , one_-isaia- swept from his course upon the shoals of that moral , juridical , and social modernism which We denounced in the Encyclical issued -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our Pontificate . And , in particular , let those realize this who , in their desire_for innovation , do not scruple to reproach the Church with infamous calumnies , as if she had allowed to creep into the teachings of her theologians a pagan concept of ownership which_must be completely replaced by another that_they with amazing ignorance call '' Christian . In order to place definite limits on the controversies that_have arisen over ownership and its inherent duties there_must be first laid_down as foundation a principle established by Leo XIII : The right of property -isaia- distinct from its use . That justice called commutative commands sacred respect_for the division of possessions and forbids invasion of others rights through the exceeding of the limits of one_s_own property ; but the duty of owners to use their property only in a right way does_not come under this type of justice , but under other virtues , obligations of which '' cannot be enforced by legal action . '' Therefore , they_are in error who assert that ownership and its right use are limited by the same boundaries ; and it -isaia- much farther still from the truth to hold that a right to property -isaia- destroyed or lost by reason of abuse or non use . Those , therefore , are doing a work that_-isaia- truly salutary and worthy of all praise who , while preserving harmony among_themselves and the integrity of the traditional teaching of the Church , seek to define the inner nature of these duties and their limits whereby either the right of property itself or its use , that_-isaia- , the exercise of ownership , -isaia- circumscribed by the necessities of social living . On the other_hand , those_who seek to restrict the individual character of ownership to such a degree that in fact they destroy it are mistaken and in error . It follows from what We have termed the individual and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time social character of ownership , that_men must consider in this_matter not_only their_own advantage but_also the common_good . To define these duties in detail when necessity requires and the natural_law has not done so , -isaia- the function of those in charge of the State . Therefore , public_authority , under the guiding light always of the natural and divine_law , can determine more accurately upon consideration of the true requirements of the common_good , what_-isaia- permitted and what_-isaia- not permitted to owners in the use of their property . Moreover , Leo XIII wisely taught '' that God has left the limits of private possessions to be fixed by the industry of men and institutions of peoples . '' That history proves ownership , like other elements of social_life , to be not absolutely unchanging , We once declared as follows : '' What divers forms has property had , from that primitive form among rude and savage peoples , which_may be observed in some places even in our_time , to the form of possession in the patriarchal age ; and so further to the various_forms under tyranny We are using the word tyranny in its classical sense ; and then through the feudal and monarchial forms down to the various types which_are to be found in more recent_times . '' That the State -isaia- not permitted to discharge its duty arbitrarily -isaia- , however , clear . The natural right itself both of owning goods privately and of passing them on by inheritance ought always to remain intact and inviolate , since_this indeed -isaia- a right that the State cannot take away : '' For man_-isaia- older than the State , '' and also '' domestic living together -isaia- prior both in thought and in fact to uniting into a polity . '' Wherefore the wise Pontiff declared that_it_-isaia- grossly unjust for a State to exhaust private wealth through the weight of imposts and taxes . '' For since_the right of possessing goods privately has_been conferred not by man s law , but by nature , public_authority cannot abolish it , but can_only control its exercise and bring it into conformity_with_the common weal . '' Yet when_the State brings private ownership into harmony_with_the needs of the common_good , it does_not commit a hostile act against private owners but_rather does them a friendly service ; for it thereby effectively prevents the private possession of goods , which_the Author of nature in His most wise providence ordained for the support of human_life , from causing intolerable evils and thus rushing to its_own destruction ; it does_not destroy private possessions , but safeguards them ; and it does_not weaken private_property rights , but strengthens them . Furthermore , a person s superfluous income , that_-isaia- , income which he does_not need to sustain life fittingly and with dignity , -isaia- not left wholly to his_own free determination . Rather the Sacred Scriptures and the Fathers of the Church constantly declare in the most explicit language that the rich are_bound by a very grave precept to practice almsgiving , beneficence , and munificence . Expending larger incomes so that opportunity_for gainful work may be abundant , provided , however_,_that this work_-isaia- applied to producing really useful goods , ought to be considered , as We deduce from the principles of the Angelic Doctor , an outstanding exemplification of the virtue of munificence and one particularly suited to the needs of the times . That ownership -isaia- originally acquired both by occupancy of a thing not owned by any_one and by labor , or , as -isaia- said , by specification , the tradition of all ages as well as the teaching of Our Predecessor Leo clearly testifies . For , whatever some idly say to the contrary , no injury -isaia- done to any person when a thing -isaia- occupied that_-isaia- available to all but belongs to no one ; however , only that labor which a man performs in his_own name and by virtue of which a new form or increase has_been_given to a thing grants him title to these fruits . Far different -isaia- the nature of work that_-isaia- hired out to others and expended on the property of others . To this indeed especially applies what Leo XIII says -isaia- '' incontestible , '' namely_,_that '' the wealth of nations originates from no other source than from the labor of workers . '' For -isaia- it not plain that the enormous volume of goods that makes up human wealth -isaia- produced by and issues from the hands of the workers that either toil unaided or have_their efficiency marvelously increased by being equipped with tools or machines ? Every one knows , too , that no nation has_ever risen out of want and poverty to a better and nobler condition save by the enormous and combined toil of all the people , both those_who manage work and those_who carry_out directions . But it -isaia- no less evident_that , had not God the Creator of all things , in keeping_with His goodness , first generously bestowed natural riches and resources the wealth and forces of nature such supreme efforts would_have been idle and vain , indeed could never even have begun . For what else -isaia- work but to use or exercise the energies of mind and body on or through these very things ? And in the application of natural resources to human use the law of nature , or rather God s will promulgated by it , demands_that right order be observed . This order consists in this : that_each thing have its_proper owner . Hence it follows_that unless a man_-isaia- expending labor on his_own property , the labor of one person and the property of another must be associated , for neither can produce anything without_the other . Leo XIII certainly had this in mind when he wrote : '' Neither capital can do without labor , nor labor without capital . '' Wherefore it -isaia- wholly false to ascribe to property alone or to labor alone whatever has_been obtained through the combined effort of both , and it -isaia- wholly unjust for either , denying the efficacy of the other , to arrogate to itself whatever has_been produced . Property , that_-isaia- , '' capital , '' has undoubtedly long been_able to appropriate too much to itself . Whatever was produced , whatever returns accrued , capital claimed for itself , hardly leaving to the worker enough to restore and renew his strength . For the doctrine was preached that all accumulation of capital falls by an absolutely insuperable economic law to the rich , and that by the same law the workers are given over and bound to perpetual want , to the scantiest of livelihoods . It -isaia- true , indeed , that things have not_always and everywhere corresponded with this_sort of teaching of the so called Manchesterian Liberals ; yet it cannot be denied that economic social institutions have moved steadily in that direction . That these false ideas , these erroneous suppositions , have_been vigorously assailed , and not by those alone who through them were being deprived of their innate right to obtain better conditions , will surprise no one . And therefore , to the harassed workers there have come '' intellectuals , '' as they_are_called , setting up in opposition to a fictitious law the equally fictitious moral principle that all products and profits , save only enough to repair and renew capital , belong by very right to the workers . This error , much_more specious than_that of certain of the Socialists who hold that whatever serves to produce goods ought to be transferred to the State , or , as they_say '' socialized , '' -isaia- consequently all the more dangerous and the more apt to deceive the unwary . It -isaia- an alluring poison which many have eagerly drunk whom open Socialism had not been_able to deceive . Unquestionably , so as not to close against themselves the road to justice_and_peace through these false tenets , both parties ought to have_been forewarned by the wise words of Our Predecessor : '' However the earth may be apportioned among private owners , it does not_cease to serve the common interests of all . '' This same doctrine We ourselves also taught above in declaring that the division of goods which results from private ownership was established by nature itself in order_that created things may serve the needs of mankind in fixed and stable order . Lest one wander from the straight path of truth , this_-isaia- something_that must be continually kept in mind . But not every distribution among human_beings of property and wealth -isaia- of a character to attain either completely or to a satisfactory degree of perfection the end which God intends . Therefore , the riches that economic social developments constantly increase ought to be so distributed among individual persons and classes that the common advantage of all , which Leo XIII had praised , will be safeguarded ; in other_words , that the common_good of all society will be kept inviolate . By this_law of social_justice , one class -isaia- forbidden to exclude the other from sharing in the benefits . Hence the class of the wealthy violates this_law no less , when , as if free_from care on account of its wealth , it thinks it the right order of things for it to get everything and the worker nothing , than does the non owning working class when , angered deeply -atti_degli_apostoli- outraged justice and too ready to assert wrongly the one right it -isaia- conscious of , it demands for itself everything as if produced by its_own hands , and attacks and seeks to abolish , therefore , all property and returns or incomes , of whatever kind they_are or whatever the function they perform in human_society , that_have not_been obtained by labor , and for no other reason save that_they_are of such a nature . And in this connection We must_not pass over the unwarranted and unmerited appeal made by some to the Apostle when he said : '' If any man will_not work neither let_him eat . '' For the Apostle -isaia- passing judgment on those_who_are unwilling to work , although they_can and ought to , and he admonishes us that we ought diligently to use our_time and energies of body , and mind and not be a burden to others when we can provide_for ourselves . But the Apostle in no wise teaches_that labor -isaia- the sole title to a living or an income . To each , therefore , must_be_given his_own share of goods , and the distribution of created goods , which , as every discerning person knows , -isaia- laboring today under the gravest evils due to the huge disparity between_the few exceedingly rich and the unnumbered propertyless , must be effectively called back to and brought into conformity_with_the norms of the common_good , that_-isaia- , social_justice . The redemption of the non owning workers this_-isaia- the goal that Our Predecessor declared must necessarily be sought . And the point -isaia- the more emphatically to be asserted and more insistently repeated because the commands of the Pontiff , salutary as they_are , have_not infrequently been consigned to oblivion either because_they were deliberately suppressed by silence or thought impracticable although they both can and ought to be put into_effect . And these commands have_not lost their force and wisdom for our_time because that '' pauperism '' which Leo XIII beheld in all its horror -isaia- less widespread . Certainly the condition of the workers has_been improved and made more equitable especially in the more civilized and wealthy countries where_the workers can no longer be considered universally overwhelmed with misery and lacking the necessities of life . But since manufacturing and industry have so rapidly pervaded and occupied countless regions , not_only in the countries called new , but_also in the realms of the Far East that have_been civilized from antiquity , the number of the non owning working poor has increased enormously and their groans cry to God from the earth . Added to them -isaia- the huge army of rural wage workers , pushed to the lowest level of existence and deprived of all hope of ever acquiring '' some property in land , '' and , therefore , permanently bound to the status of non owning worker unless suitable and effective remedies are applied . Yet while it -isaia- true_that the status of non owning worker -isaia- to be carefully distinguished from pauperism , nevertheless the immense multitude of the non owning workers on the one_hand and the enormous riches of certain very wealthy men on the other establish an unanswerable argument that the riches which_are so abundantly produced in our_age of '' industrialism , '' as it -isaia- called , are_not rightly distributed and equitably made available to the various classes of the people . Therefore , with_all_our strength and effort we must strive that -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the future the abundant fruits of production will accrue equitably to those_who_are rich and will be distributed in ample sufficiency among the workers not that_these may_become remiss in work , for man_-isaia- born to labor as the bird to fly but that_they_may increase their property by thrift , that_they_may bear , by wise management of this increase in property , the burdens of family_life with_greater ease and security , and that , emerging from the insecure lot in life in whose uncertainties non owning workers are cast , they may_be_able not_only to endure the vicissitudes of earthly existence but have_also assurance that_when their_lives are ended they_will provide in some measure for those they leave after them . All these_things which Our Predecessor has not_only suggested but clearly and openly proclaimed , We emphasize with renewed insistence in our present Encyclical ; and unless utmost efforts are made without delay to put them into_effect , let no one persuade himself that public order , peace , and the tranquillity of human_society can be effectively defended against agitators of revolution . As We have_already indicated , following in the footsteps of Our Predecessor , it will be impossible to put these_principles into_practice unless the non owning workers through industry and thrift advance to the state of possessing some little property . But except from pay for work , from what source can a man_who has nothing else but work from which to obtain food and the necessaries of life set anything aside for_himself through practicing frugality ? Let us , therefore , explaining and developing wherever necessary Leo XIII s teachings and precepts , take up this_question of wages and salaries which he called one '' of very great_importance . First of all , those_who declare that a contract of hiring and being hired -isaia- unjust of its_own nature , and hence a partnership contract must_take its place , are certainly in error and gravely misrepresent Our Predecessor whose Encyclical not_only accepts working for wages or salaries but deals -atti_degli_apostoli- some length with it regulation in accordance_with_the rules of justice . We consider it more advisable , however , in the present condition of human_society that , so far as -isaia- possible , the work contract be somewhat modified by a partnership contract , as -isaia-_already being done in various_ways and with no small advantage to workers and owners . Workers and other employees thus become sharers in ownership or management or participate in some fashion in the profits received . The just amount of pay , however , must be calculated not on a single basis but on several , as Leo XIII already wisely declared in these_words : '' To establish a rule of pay in accord with justice , many factors must_be_taken into_account . By this statement he plainly condemned the shallowness of those_who think_that this_most difficult matter -isaia- easily solved by the application of a single rule or measure and one quite false . For they_are greatly in error who do not_hesitate to spread the principle that labor -isaia- worth and must be paid as much as its products are worth , and that consequently the one_who hires out his labor has the right to demand all that_-isaia- produced through_his labor . How far this_-isaia- from the truth_-isaia- evident from that We have_already explained in treating of property and labor . It -isaia- obvious that , as in the case of ownership , so in the case of work , especially work hired out to others , there_-isaia- a social aspect also to be considered in addition to the personal or individual aspect . For man s productive effort cannot yield its fruits unless a truly social and organic body exists , unless a social and juridical order watches over the exercise of work , unless the various occupations , being interdependent , cooperate with and mutually complete one_another , and , what_-isaia- still more_important , unless mind , material things , and work combine and form as it were a single whole . Therefore , where_the social and individual nature of work_-isaia- neglected , it will be impossible to evaluate work justly and pay it according to justice . Conclusions of the greatest importance follow from this twofold character which nature has impressed on human_work , and it -isaia- in accordance_with these that wages ought to be regulated and established . In the first_place , the worker must be paid a wage sufficient to support him and his family . That the rest of the family should_also contribute to the common support , according to the capacity of each , -isaia- certainly right , as can be observed especially in the families of farmers , but_also in the families of many craftsmen and small shopkeepers . But to abuse the years of childhood and the limited strength of women -isaia- grossly wrong . Mothers , concentrating on household duties , should work primarily in the home or in its immediate vicinity . It -isaia- an intolerable abuse , and to be abolished -atti_degli_apostoli- all cost , for mothers on account of the father s low wage to be forced to engage in gainful occupations outside the home to the neglect of their_proper cares and duties , especially_the training of children . Every effort must_therefore be made that fathers of families receive a wage large enough to meet ordinary family needs adequately . But if this cannot always be done under existing circumstances , social_justice demands_that changes be introduced as soon as possible whereby such a wage will be assured to every adult workingman . It will_not be out of place here to render merited praise to all , who with a wise and useful purpose , have tried and tested various_ways of adjusting the pay for work to family burdens in such_a_way_that , as these increase , the former may be raised and indeed , if the contingency arises , there_may be enough to meet extraordinary needs . In determining the amount of the wage , the condition of a business and of the one carrying it on must_also be taken into_account ; for it would be unjust to demand excessive wages which a business cannot stand without its ruin and consequent calamity to the workers . If , however , a business makes too little money , because of lack of energy or lack of initiative or because of indifference to technical and economic progress , that_must not be regarded a just reason_for reducing the compensation of the workers . But if the business in question -isaia- not making enough money to pay the workers an equitable wage because_it_-isaia- being crushed by unjust burdens or forced to sell its product -atti_degli_apostoli- less_than a just price , those_who_are thus_the cause of the injury are guilty of grave wrong , for they deprive workers of their just wage and force them under the pinch of necessity to accept a wage less_than fair . Let , then , both workers and employers strive with united strength and counsel to overcome the difficulties and obstacles and let a wise provision on the part of public_authority aid them in so salutary a work . If , however , matters come to an extreme crisis , it must be finally considered whether the business can continue or the workers are to be cared for in some other way . In such a situation , certainly most serious , a feeling of close relationship and a Christian concord of minds ought to prevail and function effectively among employers and workers . Lastly , the amount of the pay must be adjusted to the public economic good . We have shown above how_much it helps the common_good for workers and other employees , by setting aside some part of their income which remains after necessary expenditures , to attain gradually to the possession of a moderate amount of wealth . But another point , scarcely less important , and especially vital in our_times , must_not be overlooked : namely_,_that the opportunity to work be provided to those_who_are able and willing to work . This opportunity depends largely on the wage and salary rate , which_can help as long as it -isaia- kept within proper limits , but_which on the other_hand can be an obstacle if it exceeds these limits . For everyone knows that an excessive lowering of wages , or their increase beyond due measure , causes unemployment . This evil , indeed , especially as we see it prolonged and injuring so many during the years of Our Pontificate , has plunged workers into misery and temptations , ruined the prosperity of nations , and put in jeopardy the public order , peace , and tranquillity of the whole_world . Hence it -isaia- contrary to social_justice when , for the sake of personal gain and without regard_for the common_good , wages and salaries are excessively lowered or raised ; and this_same social_justice demands_that wages and salaries be so managed , through agreement of plans and wills , in so far as can be done , as to offer to the greatest possible number the opportunity of getting work and obtaining suitable means of livelihood . A right proportion among wages and salaries also contributes directly to the same result ; and with this_-isaia- closely connected a right proportion in the prices -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the goods are sold that_are produced by the various occupations , such as agriculture , manufacturing , and others . If all these relations are properly maintained , the various occupations will combine and coalesce into , as it were , a single body and like members of the body mutually aid and complete one_another . For then only will the social economy be rightly established and attain its purposes when all and each are supplied with all the goods that the wealth and resources of nature , technical achievement , and the social organization of economic_life can furnish . And these goods ought indeed to be enough both to meet_the demands of necessity and decent comfort and to advance people to that happier and fuller condition of life_which , when_it_-isaia- wisely cared for , -isaia-_not_only no hindrance to virtue but helps it greatly . What We have thus far stated regarding an equitable distribution of property and regarding just wages concerns individual persons and only indirectly touches social_order , to the restoration of which according to the principles of sound philosophy and to its perfection according to the sublime precepts of the law of the Gospel , Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , devoted all his thought and care . Still , in order_that what he so happily initiated may be solidly established , that_what remains to be done may be accomplished , and that even_more copious and richer benefits may accrue to the family of mankind , two things_are especially necessary : reform of institutions and correction of morals . When we speak of the reform of institutions , the State comes chiefly to mind , not as if universal well_being were to be expected from its activity , but because things have come to such a pass through the evil of what_we_have termed '' individualism '' that , following upon the overthrow and near extinction of that rich social_life which_was once highly developed through associations of various kinds , there remain virtually only individuals and the State . This -isaia- to the great harm of the State itself ; for , with a structure of social governance lost , and with the taking over of all the burdens which_the wrecked associations once bore . the State has_been overwhelmed and crushed by almost infinite tasks and duties . As history abundantly proves , it -isaia- true_that on account of changed conditions many things_which were done by small associations in former times cannot be done now save by large associations . Still , that_most weighty principle , which_cannot be set_aside or changed , remains fixed and unshaken in social philosophy : Just as it -isaia- gravely wrong to take from individuals what_they can accomplish by their_own initiative and industry and give it to the community , so also it -isaia- an injustice and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do . For every social activity ought of its_very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them . The supreme_authority of the State ought , therefore , to let subordinate groups handle matters and concerns of lesser importance , which_would otherwise dissipate its efforts greatly . Thereby the State will more freely , powerfully , and effectively do all those_things that belong to it alone because it alone_can do them : directing , watching , urging , restraining , as occasion requires and necessity demands . Therefore , those in power should be sure_that the more perfectly a graduated order -isaia- kept among the various associations , in observance of the principle of '' subsidiary function , '' the stronger social authority and effectiveness will be the happier and more prosperous the condition of the State . First and foremost , the State and every good citizen ought to look to and strive toward this_end : that the conflict between_the hostile classes be abolished and harmonious cooperation of the Industries and Professions be encouraged and promoted . The social policy of the State , therefore , must devote itself to the re establishment of the Industries and Professions . In actual fact , human_society now , for the reason that_it_-isaia- founded on classes with divergent aims and hence opposed to one_another and therefore inclined to enmity and strife , continues to be in a violent condition and -isaia- unstable and uncertain . Labor , as Our Predecessor explained well in his Encyclical , -isaia- not a mere commodity . On the contrary , the worker s human_dignity in it must be recognized . It therefore cannot be bought and sold like a commodity . Nevertheless , as the situation now stands , hiring and offering for hire in the so called labor market separate men into two divisions , as into battle lines , and the contest between these divisions turns the labor market itself almost into a battlefield where , face to face , the opposing lines struggle bitterly . Everyone understands that_this grave evil which_-isaia- plunging all human_society to destruction must be remedied as soon as possible . But complete cure will_not come until this opposition has_been abolished and well ordered members of the social body Industries and Professions are constituted in which men may have_their place , not according to the position each has in the labor market but according to the respective social functions which_each performs . For under nature s guidance it comes to pass that just as those_who_are joined together by nearness of habitation establish towns , so those_who follow_the same industry or profession whether in the economic or other field form guilds or associations , so that_many are wont to consider these self governing organizations , if not essential , -atti_degli_apostoli- least natural to civil_society . Thomas well explains , -isaia- unity arising from the harmonious arrangement of many objects , a true , genuine social_order demands_that the various members of a society be united together by some strong bond . This unifying force -isaia- present not_only in the producing of goods or the rendering of services in which_the employers and employees of an identical Industry or Profession collaborate jointly but_also in that common_good , to achieve which all Industries and Professions together ought , each to the best of its ability , to cooperate amicably . And this_unity will be the stronger and more_effective , the more faithfully individuals and the Industries and Professions themselves strive to do their_work and excel in it . It -isaia- easily deduced from what_has_been said_that the interests common to the whole Industry or Profession should hold first_place in these guilds . The most important among_these interests -isaia- to promote the cooperation in the highest degree of each industry and profession for the sake of the common_good of the country . Concerning matters , however , in which particular points , involving advantage or detriment to employers or workers , may require special_care and protection , the two parties , when these cases arise , can deliberate separately or as the situation requires reach a decision separately . The teaching of Leo XIII on the form of political government , namely_,_that men_are free to choose whatever form they please , provided_that proper regard -isaia- had for the requirements of justice and of the common_good , -isaia- equally applicable in due proportion , it -isaia- hardly necessary to say , to the guilds of the various industries and professions . Moreover , just as inhabitants of a town are wont to found associations with the widest diversity of purposes , which_each -isaia- quite free to join or not , so those engaged in the same industry or profession will combine with one_another into associations equally free for purposes connected in some manner with the pursuit of the calling itself . Since these free associations are clearly and lucidly explained by Our Predecessor of illustrious memory , We consider it enough to emphasize this one point : People are quite free not_only to found such associations , which_are a matter of private order and private right , but_also in respect to them '' freely to adopt the organization and the rules which_they judge most appropriate to achieve their purpose . '' The same freedom must be asserted for founding associations that go beyond_the boundaries of individual callings . And may these free organizations , now flourishing and rejoicing in their salutary fruits , set before themselves the task of preparing the way , in conformity_with_the mind of Christian social_teaching , for those larger and more_important guilds , Industries and Professions , which We mentioned before , and make every possible effort to bring them to realization . Attention must_be_given also to another matter that_-isaia- closely connected_with_the foregoing . Just as the unity of human_society cannot be founded on an opposition of classes , so also the right ordering of economic_life cannot be left to a free competition of forces . For from this source , as from a poisoned spring , have originated and spread all the errors of individualist economic teaching . Destroying through forgetfulness or ignorance the social and moral character of economic_life , it held that economic_life must be considered and treated as altogether free_from and independent of public_authority , because in the market , i . , in the free struggle of competitors , it would_have a principle of self direction which governs it much_more perfectly than would the intervention of any created intellect . But free competition , while justified and certainly useful provided it -isaia- kept within certain limits , clearly cannot direct economic_life a truth_which the outcome of the application in practice of the tenets of this evil individualistic spirit_has more_than sufficiently demonstrated . Therefore , it -isaia- most necessary_that economic_life be again subjected to and governed by a true and effective directing principle . This function -isaia- one_that the economic dictatorship which_has recently displaced free competition can still less perform , since_it_-isaia- a headstrong power and a violent energy that , to benefit people , needs to be strongly curbed and wisely ruled . But it cannot curb and rule itself . Loftier and nobler principles social_justice and social charity must , therefore , be sought whereby this dictatorship may be governed firmly and fully . Hence , the institutions themselves of peoples and , particularly those of all social_life , ought to be penetrated with this justice , and it -isaia- most necessary_that it be truly effective , that_-isaia- , establish a juridical and social_order which_will , as it were , give form and shape to all economic_life . Social charity , moreover , ought to be as the soul of this order , an order which public_authority ought to be ever ready effectively to protect and defend . It will_be_able to do this_the more_easily as it rids itself of those burdens which , as We have stated above , are_not properly its_own . Furthermore , since_the various nations largely depend on one_another in economic matters and need one_another s help , they_should strive with a united purpose and effort to promote by wisely conceived pacts and institutions a prosperous and happy international cooperation in economic_life . If the members of the body social are , as was said , reconstituted , and if the directing principle of economic social life_-isaia- restored , it will be possible to say in a certain_sense even of this body what_the Apostle says of the mystical_body of Christ : '' The whole_body being closely joined and knit together through every joint of the system according to the functioning in due measure of each single part derives its increase to the building up of itself in love . Recently , as all know , there_has been inaugurated a special system of syndicates and corporations of the various callings which in view of the theme of this Encyclical it would seem necessary to describe here briefly and comment upon appropriately . The civil authority itself constitutes the syndicate as a juridical personality in such a manner as to confer on it simultaneously a certain monopoly privilege , since only such a syndicate , when thus approved , can maintain the rights according to the type of syndicate of workers or employers , and since it alone_can arrange for the placement of labor and conclude so termed labor agreements . Anyone -isaia- free to join a syndicate or not , and only within these limits can this_kind of syndicate be called free ; for syndical dues and special assessments are exacted of absolutely all members of every specified calling or profession , whether_they are workers or employers ; likewise all are_bound by the labor agreements made by the legally recognized syndicate . Nevertheless , it has_been officially stated_that this legally recognized syndicate does_not prevent the existence , without legal status , however , of other associations made up of persons following the same calling . The associations , or corporations , are composed of delegates from the two syndicates that_-isaia- , of workers and employers respectively of the same industry or profession and , as true and proper organs and institutions of the State , they direct the syndicates and coordinate their activities in matters of common interest toward one_and_the_same end . Strikes and lock outs are forbidden ; if the parties cannot settle their dispute , public_authority intervenes . Anyone who_gives even slight attention to the matter will easily see what_are the obvious advantages in the system We have thus summarily described : The various classes work together peacefully , socialist organizations and their activities are repressed , and a special magistracy exercises a governing authority . Yet lest We neglect anything in a matter of such great_importance and that all points treated may be properly connected_with_the more general principles_which We mentioned above and with those_which We intend shortly to add , We are compelled to say that to Our certain knowledge there_are not wanting some who fear that the State , instead of confining itself as it ought to the furnishing of necessary and adequate assistance , -isaia- substituting itself for free activity ; that the new syndical and corporative order savors too much of an involved and political system of administration ; and that in spite of those more general advantages mentioned above , which_are of course fully admitted it rather serves particular political ends than leads to the reconstruction and promotion of a better social_order . To achieve this latter lofty aim , and in particular to promote the common_good truly and permanently , We hold it -isaia- first and above everything wholly necessary_that God bless it and , secondly , that all men_of_good will work with united effort toward that end . We are further convinced , as a necessary consequence , that_this end will be attained the more certainly the larger the number of those ready to contribute toward it their technical , occupational , and social knowledge and experience ; and also , what_-isaia- more_important , the greater the contribution made thereto of Catholic principles and their application , not indeed by Catholic Action which excludes strictly syndical or political activities from its scope but by those sons of Ours whom Catholic Action imbues with Catholic principles and trains for carrying on an apostolate under the leadership and teaching guidance of the Church of that Church which in this_field also_that We have described , as in every_other field where moral questions are involved and discussed , can_never forget or neglect through indifference its divinely imposed mandate to be vigilant and to teach . What We have taught about the reconstruction and perfection of social_order can surely in no wise be brought to realization without reform of morality , the very record of history clearly shows . For there_was a social_order once which , although indeed not perfect or in all respects ideal , nevertheless , met in a certain measure the requirements of right_reason , considering the conditions and needs of the time . If that order has long since perished , that surely did_not happen because the order could_not have accommodated itself to changed conditions and needs by development and by a certain expansion , but_rather because men , hardened by too much love of self , refused to open the order to the increasing masses as they should_have done , or because , deceived by allurements of a false freedom and other errors , they became impatient of every authority and sought to reject every_form of control . There remains to Us , after again calling to judgment the economic system now in force and its most bitter accuser , Socialism , and passing explicit and just sentence upon them , to search out more thoroughly the root of these many evils and to point_out that the first and most necessary remedy -isaia- a reform of morals . Important indeed have_the changes been which both the economic system and Socialism have undergone since Leo XIII s time . That , in the first_place , the whole aspect of economic_life -isaia- vastly altered , -isaia- plain to all . You know , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , that the Encyclical of Our Predecessor of happy_memory had in view chiefly that economic system , wherein , generally , some provide capital while others provide labor for a joint economic activity . And in a happy phrase he described it thus : '' Neither capital can do without labor , nor labor without capital . With all his energy Leo XIII sought to adjust this economic system according to the norms of right order ; hence , it -isaia- evident_that this system -isaia- not to be condemned in itself . And surely it -isaia- not of its_own nature vicious . But it does violate right order when capital hires workers , that_-isaia- , the non owning working class , with_a_view to and under such terms that it directs business and even the whole economic system according to its_own will and advantage , scorning the human_dignity of the workers , the social character of economic activity and social_justice itself , and the common_good . Even today this_-isaia-_not , it -isaia- true , the only economic system in force everywhere ; for there_-isaia- another system also , which still embraces a huge mass of humanity , significant in numbers and importance , as for example , agriculture wherein the greater portion of mankind honorably and honestly procures its livelihood . This group , too , -isaia- being crushed with hardships and with difficulties , to which Our Predecessor devotes attention in several places in his Encyclical and which We Ourselves have touched upon more_than_once in Our present Letter . But , with the diffusion of modern industry throughout_the whole_world , the '' capitalist '' economic regime has spread everywhere to such a degree , particularly since_the publication of Leo XIII s Encyclical , that it has invaded and pervaded the economic_and_social life of even_those outside its orbit and -isaia- unquestionably impressing on it its advantages , disadvantages and vices , and , in a sense , -isaia- giving it its_own shape and form . Accordingly , when directing Our special_attention to the changes which_the capitalist economic system has undergone since Leo s time , We have in mind the good not_only of those_who dwell in regions given over to '' capital '' and industry , but of all mankind . In the first_place , it -isaia- obvious that not_only -isaia- wealth concentrated in our_times but an immense power and despotic economic dictatorship -isaia- consolidated in the hands of a few , who often are_not owners but_only the trustees and managing directors of invested funds which_they administer according_to_their own arbitrary will and pleasure . This dictatorship -isaia- being most forcibly exercised by those_who , since_they hold the money and completely control it , control credit also and rule_the lending of money . Hence they regulate the flow , so to speak , of the life blood whereby_the entire economic system lives , and have so firmly in their grasp the soul , as it were , of economic_life that_no_one can breathe against their will . This concentration of power and might , the characteristic mark , as it were , of contemporary economic_life , -isaia- the fruit that the unlimited freedom of struggle among competitors has of its_own nature produced , and which lets only the strongest survive ; and this -isaia-_often the same as saying , those_who fight the most violently , those_who give least heed to their conscience . This accumulation of might and of power generates in turn three kinds of conflict . First , there_-isaia- the struggle for economic supremacy itself ; then there_-isaia- the bitter fight to gain supremacy over the State in order to use in economic struggles its resources and authority ; finally there_-isaia- conflict between States themselves , not only_because countries employ their_power and shape their policies to promote every economic advantage of their citizens , but also_because they seek to decide political controversies that arise among nations through the use of their economic supremacy and strength . The ultimate consequences of the individualist spirit in economic_life are those_which you yourselves , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , see and deplore : Free competition has destroyed itself ; economic dictatorship has supplanted the free market ; unbridled ambition for power has likewise succeeded greed for gain ; all economic_life has become tragically hard , inexorable , and cruel . To these_are to be added the grave evils that_have resulted from an intermingling and shameful confusion of the functions and duties of public_authority with_those of the economic sphere such as , one of the worst , the virtual degradation of the majesty of the State , which although it ought to sit on high like a queen and supreme arbitress , free_from all partiality and intent upon the one common_good and justice , -isaia- become a slave , surrendered and delivered to the passions and greed of men . And as to international relations , two different streams have issued from the one fountain head : On the one_hand , economic nationalism or even economic imperialism ; on the other , a no less deadly and accursed internationalism of finance or international imperialism whose country -isaia- where profit -isaia- . In the second part of this Encyclical where We have presented Our teaching , We have described the remedies for these great evils so explicitly that We consider it sufficient -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point to recall them briefly . Since the present system of economy -isaia- founded chiefly upon ownership and labor , the principles of right_reason , that_-isaia- , of Christian social philosophy , must be kept in mind regarding ownership and labor and their association together , and must be put into actual practice . First , so as to avoid the reefs of individualism and collectivism . the twofold character , that_-isaia- individual and social , both of capital or ownership and of work or labor must_be_given due and rightful weight . Relations of one to the other must be made to conform to the laws of strictest justice commutative justice , as it -isaia- called with the support , however , of Christian charity . Free competition , kept within definite and due limits , and still_more economic dictatorship , must be effectively brought under public_authority in these_matters which pertain to the latter s function . The public institutions themselves , of peoples , moreover , ought to make all human_society conform to the needs of the common_good ; that_-isaia- , to the norm of social_justice . If this_-isaia- done , that_most important division of social_life , namely , economic activity , cannot_fail likewise to return to right and sound order . Socialism , against which Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , had especially to inveigh , has since his time changed no less profoundly than the form of economic_life . For Socialism , which_could then be termed almost a single system and which maintained definite teachings reduced into one_body of doctrine , has since then split chiefly into two sections , often opposing each_other and even bitterly hostile , without either one however abandoning a position fundamentally contrary to Christian truth_that was characteristic of Socialism . One section of Socialism has undergone almost the same change that the capitalistic economic system , as We have explained above , has undergone . It has sunk into Communism . Communism teaches and seeks two objectives : Unrelenting class warfare and absolute extermination of private ownership . Not secretly or by hidden methods does it do this , but publicly , openly , and by employing every and all means , even the most violent . To achieve these objectives there_-isaia-_nothing which it does_not dare , nothing for_which it has respect or reverence ; and when it has come to power , it -isaia- incredible and portentlike in its cruelty and inhumanity . The horrible slaughter and destruction through_which it has laid waste vast regions of eastern Europe and Asia are the evidence ; how_much an enemy and how openly hostile it -isaia- to Holy Church and to God Himself -isaia- , alas , too well proved by facts and fully known to all . Although We , therefore , deem it superfluous to warn upright and faithful children of the Church regarding the impious and iniquitous character of Communism , yet We cannot without deep sorrow contemplate the heedlessness of those_who apparently make light of these impending dangers , and with sluggish inertia allow the widespread propagation of doctrine which seeks by violence and slaughter to destroy society altogether . All the more gravely to be condemned -isaia- the folly of those_who neglect to remove or change the conditions that inflame the minds of peoples , and pave the way_for the overthrow and destruction of society . The other section , which_has kept the name Socialism , -isaia- surely more moderate . It not_only professes the rejection of violence but modifies and tempers to some degree , if it does_not reject entirely , the class struggle and the abolition of private ownership . One might say that , terrified by its_own principles and by the conclusions drawn therefrom by Communism , Socialism inclines toward and in a certain measure approaches the truths_which Christian tradition has_always held sacred ; for it cannot be denied that_its demands -atti_degli_apostoli- times come very near those_that Christian reformers of society justly insist upon . For if the class struggle abstains from enmities and mutual hatred , it gradually changes into an honest discussion of differences founded on a desire for_justice , and if this_-isaia-_not that blessed social peace which we all seek , it can and ought to be the point of departure from which to move forward to the mutual cooperation of the Industries and Professions . So also the war declared on private ownership , more_and_more abated , -isaia- being so restricted that now , finally , not the possession itself of the means_of_production -isaia- attacked but_rather a kind of sovereignty over society_which ownership has , contrary to all right , seized and usurped . For such sovereignty belongs in reality not to owners but to the public_authority . If the foregoing happens , it can come even to the point that imperceptibly these ideas of the more moderate socialism will no longer differ from the desires and demands of those_who_are striving to remold human_society on the basis of Christian principles . For certain kinds of property , it -isaia- rightly contended , ought to be reserved to the State since_they carry with_them a dominating power so great that cannot without danger to the general welfare be entrusted to private individuals . Such just demands and desire have nothing in them now which_-isaia- inconsistent with Christian truth , and much less are they special to Socialism . Those who work solely toward such ends have , therefore , no reason to become socialists . Yet let no one think_that all the socialist groups or factions that_are not communist have , without exception , recovered their senses to this extent either in fact or in name . For the most part they_do_not reject the class struggle or the abolition of ownership , but_only in some degree modify them . Now if these false principles are modified and to some extent erased from the program , the question arises , or rather -isaia- raised without warrant by some , whether the principles of Christian truth cannot perhaps be also modified to some degree and be tempered so as to meet Socialism half way and , as it were , by a middle course , come to agreement with it . There are_some allured by the foolish hope_that socialists in this_way will be drawn to us . A vain hope ! Those who want to be apostles among socialists ought to profess Christian truth whole and entire , openly and sincerely , and not connive -atti_degli_apostoli- error in any_way . If they truly wish to be heralds of the Gospel , let_them above all strive to show to socialists that socialist claims , so far as they_are just , are far more strongly supported by the principles of Christian faith and much more_effectively promoted through the power of Christian charity . But what if Socialism has really been so tempered and modified as to the class struggle and private ownership that_there_-isaia- in it no longer anything to be censured on these points ? Has it thereby renounced its contradictory nature to the Christian religion ? This -isaia- the question that holds many minds in suspense . And numerous are the Catholics who , although they clearly understand_that Christian principles can_never be abandoned or diminished seem to turn their_eyes to the Holy See and earnestly beseech Us to decide whether this form of Socialism has so far recovered from false doctrines that it can be accepted without_the sacrifice of any Christian principle and in a certain_sense be baptized . That We , in keeping_with Our fatherly solicitude , may answer their petitions , We make_this pronouncement : Whether considered as a doctrine , or an historical fact , or a movement , Socialism , if it remains truly Socialism , even after it has yielded to truth and justice on the points which_we_have mentioned , cannot be reconciled with the teachings of the Catholic Church because its concept of society itself_-isaia- utterly foreign to Christian truth . For , according to Christian teaching , man , endowed_with a social nature , -isaia- placed on this earth so that by leading a life in society and under an authority ordained of God he may fully cultivate and develop all his faculties unto the praise and glory of his Creator ; and that by faithfully fulfilling the duties of his craft or other calling he may obtain for_himself temporal and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time eternal happiness . Socialism , on the other_hand , wholly ignoring and indifferent to this sublime end of both man and society , affirms that_human association has_been instituted for the sake of material advantage alone . Because of the fact_that goods are produced more efficiently by a suitable division of labor than by the scattered efforts of individuals , socialists infer that economic activity , only the material ends of which enter_into their thinking , ought of necessity to be carried on socially . Because of this necessity , they hold that_men are obliged , with_respect to the producing of goods , to surrender and subject themselves entirely to society . Indeed , possession of the greatest possible supply of things_that serve the advantages of this life_-isaia- considered of such great_importance that the higher goods of man , liberty not excepted , must_take a secondary place and even be sacrificed to the demands of the most efficient production of goods . This damage to human_dignity , undergone in the '' socialized '' process of production , will be easily offset , they_say , by the abundance of socially produced goods which_will pour out in profusion to individuals to be used freely -atti_degli_apostoli- their pleasure for comforts and cultural development . Society , therefore , as Socialism conceives it , can on the one_hand neither exist nor be thought of without an obviously excessive use of force ; on the other_hand , it fosters a liberty no less false , since there_-isaia- no place in it for true social authority , which rests not on temporal and material advantages but descends from God alone , the Creator and last end of all things . If Socialism , like all errors , contains some truth_which , moreover , the Supreme Pontiffs have_never denied , it -isaia- based nevertheless on a theory of human_society peculiar to itself and irreconcilable with true Christianity . Religious socialism , Christian socialism , are contradictory terms ; no one_can be -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a good Catholic and a true socialist . All these admonitions which_have_been renewed and confirmed by Our solemn authority must likewise be applied to a certain new kind of socialist activity , hitherto little known but now carried on among many socialist groups . It devotes itself above all to the training of the mind and character . Under the guise of affection it tries in particular to attract children of tender age and win them to itself , although it also embraces the whole population in its scope in order finally to produce true socialists who_would shape human_society to the tenets of Socialism . Since in Our Encyclical , The Christian Education of Youth , We have fully taught the principles that Christian education insists on and the ends it pursues , the contradiction between these_principles and ends and the activities and aims of this socialism that_-isaia- pervading morality and culture -isaia- so clear and evident_that no demonstration -isaia- required here . But they seem to ignore or underestimate the grave dangers that it carries with it who think it of no importance courageously and zealously to resist them according to the gravity of the situation . It belongs to Our Pastoral Office to warn these persons of the grave and imminent evil : let all remember_that Liberalism -isaia- the father of this Socialism that_-isaia- pervading morality and culture and that Bolshevism will be its heir . Accordingly , Venerable Brethren , you can well understand with what great sorrow We observe that not_a_few of Our sons , in certain regions especially , although We cannot be convinced_that they have_given up the true faith and right will , have deserted the camp of the Church and gone over to the ranks of Socialism , some to glory openly in the name of socialist and to profess socialist doctrines , others through thoughtlessness or even , almost against their wills to join associations which_are socialist by profession or in fact . In the anxiety of Our paternal solicitude , We give Ourselves to reflection and try to discover how it could happen that_they_should go so far astray and We seem to hear what many of them answer and plead in excuse : The Church and those proclaiming attachment to the Church favor the rich , neglect the workers and have no concern_for them ; therefore , to look after themselves they_had to join the ranks of socialism . It -isaia- certainly most lamentable , Venerable Brethren , that_there have_been , nay , that_even now there_are men_who , although professing to be Catholics , are almost completely unmindful of that sublime law of justice and charity that binds us not_only to render to everyone what_-isaia- his but to succor brothers in need as Christ the Lord Himself , and what_-isaia- worse out of greed for gain do not scruple to exploit the workers . Even more , there_are men_who abuse religion itself , and under its name try to hide their unjust exactions in order to protect themselves from the manifestly just demands of the workers . The conduct of such We shall never cease to censure gravely . For they_are the reason_why the Church could , even_though undeservedly , have_the appearance of and be charged with taking the part of the rich and with being quite unmoved by the necessities and hardships of those_who_have been deprived , as it were , of their natural inheritance . The whole history of the Church plainly demonstrates that_such appearances are unfounded and such charges unjust . The Encyclical itself , whose anniversary we are celebrating , -isaia- clearest proof that_it_-isaia- the height of injustice to hurl these calumnies and reproaches -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church and her teaching . Although pained by the injustice and downcast in fatherly sorrow , it -isaia- so far from Our thought to repulse or to disown children who_have_been miserably deceived and have strayed so far from the truth and salvation that We cannot_but invite them_with all possible solicitude to return to the maternal bosom of the Church . May they lend ready ears to Our voice , may_they return whence they_have left , to the home that_-isaia- truly their Father s , and may_they stand firm there where their_own place -isaia- , in the ranks of those_who , zealously following the admonitions which Leo promulgated and We have solemnly repeated , are striving to restore society according to the mind of the Church on the firmly established basis of social_justice and social charity . And let_them be convinced_that nowhere , even on earth , can they find full happiness save with Him who , being rich , became poor for our sakes that_through His poverty we might become rich , Who was poor and in labors from His youth , Who invited to Himself all that labor and are heavily burdened that He might refresh them fully in the love of His heart , and Who , lastly , without_any respect_for persons will require more of them to whom more has_been_given and '' will render to everyone according_to_his conduct . Yet , if we look into the matter more carefully and more thoroughly , we shall clearly perceive that , preceding this ardently desired social restoration , there_must be a renewal of the Christian spirit , from which so many immersed in economic_life have , far and wide , unhappily fallen away , lest all our efforts be wasted and our house be builded not on a rock but on shifting sand . And so , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Sons , having surveyed the present economic system , We have found it laboring under the gravest of evils . We have_also summoned Communism and Socialism again to judgment and have found all their forms , even the most modified , to wander far from the precepts of the Gospel . '' Wherefore , '' to use the words of Our Predecessor , '' if human society_-isaia- to be healed , only a return to Christian life and institutions will heal it . '' For this alone_can provide effective remedy for that excessive care_for passing things that_-isaia- the origin of all vices ; and this alone_can draw away men s eyes , fascinated by and wholly fixed on the changing things of the world , and raise them toward Heaven . Who would deny that_human society_-isaia- in most urgent_need of this cure now ? . Minds of all , it -isaia- true , are affected almost solely by temporal upheavals , disasters , and calamities . But if we examine things critically with Christian eyes , as we should , what_are all these compared with the loss of souls ? Yet it -isaia- not rash by any means to say that_the_whole scheme of social_and_economic life_-isaia- now such as to put in the way of vast numbers of mankind most serious obstacles which prevent them_from caring for the one_thing necessary ; namely , their eternal_salvation . We , made Shepherd and Protector by the Prince of Shepherds , Who Redeemed them by His Blood , of a truly innumerable flock , cannot hold back Our tears when contemplating this greatest of their dangers . Nay rather , fully mindful of Our pastoral_office and with paternal solicitude , We are continually meditating on how We can help_them ; and We have summoned to Our aid the untiring zeal of others_who are_concerned on grounds of justice or charity . For what will it profit men to become expert in more wisely using their wealth , even to gaining the whole_world , if thereby they suffer the loss of their_souls ? What will it profit to teach them sound principles of economic_life if in unbridled and sordid greed they let themselves be swept away by their passion for property , so that '' hearing the commandments of the Lord they do all things contrary . The root and font of this defection in economic_and_social life from the Christian law , and of the consequent apostasy of great numbers of workers from the Catholic faith , are the disordered passions of the soul , the sad result of original_sin which_has so destroyed the wonderful harmony of man s faculties that , easily led astray by his evil desires , he -isaia- strongly incited to prefer the passing goods of this_world to the lasting goods of Heaven . Hence arises that unquenchable thirst_for riches and temporal goods , which_has -atti_degli_apostoli- all times impelled men to break God s laws and trample upon the rights of their neighbors , but_which , on account of the present system of economic_life , -isaia- laying far more numerous snares for_human frailty . Since the instability of economic_life , and especially of its structure , exacts of those engaged in it most intense and unceasing effort , some have_become so hardened to the stings of conscience as to hold that_they_are allowed , in any manner whatsoever , to increase their profits and use means , fair or foul , to protect their hard won wealth against sudden changes of fortune . The easy gains that a market unrestricted by any law opens to everybody attracts large numbers to buying and selling goods , and they , their one aim being to make quick profits with the least expenditure of work , raise or lower prices by their uncontrolled business dealings so rapidly according_to_their own caprice and greed that_they nullify the wisest forecasts of producers . The laws passed to promote corporate business , while dividing and limiting the risk of business , have_given occasion to the most sordid license . For We observe that consciences are little affected by this reduced obligation of accountability ; that furthermore , by hiding under the shelter of a joint name , the worst of injustices and frauds are penetrated ; and that , too , directors of business companies , forgetful of their trust , betray the rights of those_whose savings they_have undertaken to administer . Lastly , We must_not omit to mention those crafty men_who , wholly unconcerned about any honest usefulness of their_work , do not scruple to stimulate the baser human desires and , when_they_are aroused , use them_for their_own profit . Strict and watchful moral restraint enforced vigorously by governmental authority could have banished these enormous evils and even forestalled them ; this restraint , however , has too_often been sadly lacking . For since_the seeds of a new form of economy were bursting forth just when_the principles of rationalism had_been implanted and rooted in many minds , there quickly developed a body of economic teaching far removed from the true moral_law , and , as a result , completely free rein was_given to human passions . Thus it came to pass that_many , much more_than_ever before , were solely concerned_with increasing their wealth by any means whatsoever , and that in seeking their_own selfish interests before everything else they_had no conscience about committing even the gravest of crimes against others . Those first entering upon this broad way_that leads to destruction easily found numerous imitators of their iniquity by the example of their manifest success , by their insolent display of wealth , by their ridiculing the conscience of others , who , as they said , were troubled by silly scruples , or lastly by crushing more conscientious competitors . With the rulers of economic_life abandoning the right road , it was easy for the rank and file of workers everywhere to rush headlong also into the same chasm ; and all the more so , because very many managements treated their workers like mere tools , with no concern -atti_degli_apostoli- all for their_souls , without indeed even the least thought of spiritual things . Truly the mind shudders -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of the grave dangers to which_the morals of workers particularly younger workers and the modesty of girls and women are exposed in modern factories ; when we recall how often the present economic scheme , and particularly the shameful housing conditions , create obstacles to the family bond and normal family_life ; when we remember how_many obstacles are put in the way of the proper observance of Sundays and Holy Days ; and when we reflect upon the universal weakening of that truly Christian sense through_which even rude and unlettered men were wont to value higher things , and upon its substitution by the single preoccupation of getting in any_way whatsoever one s daily bread . And thus bodily labor , which Divine Providence decreed to be performed , even after original_sin , for the good -atti_degli_apostoli- once of man s body_and_soul , -isaia- being everywhere changed into an instrument of perversion ; for dead matter comes forth_from the factory ennobled , while men there_are corrupted and degraded . No genuine cure can be furnished for_this lamentable ruin of souls , which , so long as it continues , will frustrate all efforts to regenerate society , unless men return openly and sincerely to the teaching of the Gospel , to the precepts of Him Who alone has the words of everlasting life , words_which will_never pass away , even if Heaven and earth will pass away . All experts in social problems are seeking eagerly a structure so fashioned in accordance_with_the norms of reason_that it can lead economic_life back to sound and right order . But this order , which We Ourselves ardently long for and with all Our efforts promote , will be wholly defective and incomplete unless all the activities of men harmoniously unite to imitate and attain , in so far as it lies within human strength , the marvelous unity of the Divine plan . We mean_that perfect order which_the Church with_great force and power preaches and which right human_reason itself demands , that all things be directed to God as the first and supreme end of all created activity , and that all created good under God be considered as mere instruments to be used only in so far as they conduce to the attainment of the supreme end . Nor -isaia- it to be thought that gainful occupations are thereby belittled or judged less consonant with human_dignity ; on the contrary , we are taught to recognize in them_with reverence the manifest will of the Divine Creator Who placed man upon the earth to work it and use it in a multitude of ways for his needs . Those who_are engaged in producing goods , therefore , are_not forbidden to increase their fortune in a just and lawful manner ; for it -isaia- only fair that he who renders service to the community and makes it richer should_also , through the increased wealth of the community , be made richer himself according_to_his position , provided_that all these_things be sought with due respect_for the laws of God and without impairing the rights of others and that_they be employed in accordance_with faith and right_reason . If these_principles are observed by everyone , everywhere , and always , not_only the production and acquisition of goods but_also the use of wealth , which now -isaia- seen to be so often contrary to right order , will be brought back soon within_the bounds of equity and just distribution . The sordid love of wealth , which_-isaia- the shame and great sin of our_age , will be opposed in actual fact by the gentle yet effective law of Christian moderation which commands man to seek first the Kingdom of God and His justice , with the assurance that , by virtue of God s kindness and unfailing promise , temporal goods also , in so far as he has need of them , shall be given him besides . But in effecting all this , the law of charity , '' which_-isaia- the bond of perfection , '' must_always take a leading role . How completely deceived , therefore , are_those rash reformers who concern themselves_with the enforcement of justice alone and this , commutative justice and in their pride reject the assistance of charity ! Admittedly , no vicarious charity can substitute for_justice which_-isaia- due as an obligation and -isaia- wrongfully denied . Yet even supposing that everyone should finally receive all that_-isaia- due him , the widest field for charity will_always remain open . For justice alone_can , if faithfully observed , remove the causes of social conflict but can_never bring_about union of minds and hearts . Indeed all the institutions for the establishment of peace and the promotion of mutual help among_men , however perfect these may seem , have_the principal foundation of their stability in the mutual bond of minds and hearts whereby_the members are_united with one_another . If this bond -isaia- lacking , the best of regulations come to naught , as we have learned by too frequent experience . And so , then only will true cooperation be possible_for a single common_good when_the constituent parts of society deeply feel themselves members of one great family and children of the same Heavenly Father ; nay , that_they_are one_body in Christ , '' but severally members one of another , '' so that '' if one member suffers anything , all the members suffer with it . '' For then the rich and others in positions of power will change their former indifference toward their poorer brothers into a solicitous and active love , listen with kindliness to their just demands , and freely forgive their possible mistakes and faults . And the workers , sincerely putting aside every feeling of hatred or envy which_the promoters of social conflict so cunningly exploit , will not_only accept without rancor the place in human_society assigned them by Divine Providence , but_rather will hold it in esteem , knowing well that everyone according_to_his function and duty -isaia- toiling usefully and honorably for the common_good and -isaia- following closely in the footsteps of Him Who , being in the form of God , willed to be a carpenter among_men and be known as the son of a carpenter . Therefore , out of this_new diffusion throughout_the_world of the spirit of the Gospel , which_-isaia- the spirit of Christian moderation and universal charity , We are confident there_will come that longed for and full restoration of human_society in Christ , and that '' Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ , '' to accomplish which , from the very_beginning of Our Pontificate , We firmly determined and resolved within Our heart to devote all Our care and all Our pastoral solicitude , and toward this_same highly important and most necessary end now , you also , Venerable Brethren , who with Vs rule_the Church of God under the mandate of the Holy Ghost , are earnestly toiling with wholly praiseworthy zeal in all parts_of_the_world , even in the regions of the holy missions to the infidels . Let well merited acclamations of praise be bestowed upon you and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time upon all those , both clergy and laity , who We rejoice to see , are daily participating and valiantly helping in this_same great work , Our beloved_sons engaged in Catholic Action , who with a singular zeal are undertaking with Us the solution of the social problems in so far as by virtue of her_divine institution this_-isaia- proper to and devolves upon the Church . All these We urge in the Lord , again_and_again , to spare no labors and let no difficulties conquer them , but_rather to become day_by_day more courageous and more valiant . Arduous indeed -isaia- the task which We propose to them , for We know well that on both sides , both among the upper and the lower classes of society , there_are_many obstacles and barriers to be overcome . Let them_not , however , lose heart ; to face bitter combats -isaia- a mark of Christians , and to endure grave labors to the end -isaia- a mark of them who , as good soldiers of Christ , follow Him closely . Relying therefore solely on the all powerful aid of Him '' Who wishes all men to be saved , '' let us strive with_all_our strength to help those unhappy souls who_have turned from God and , drawing them away from the temporal cares in which_they_are too deeply immersed , let us teach them to aspire with confidence to the things_that_are eternal . Sometimes this_will be achieved much more_easily than seems possible -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight to expect . For if wonderful spiritual forces lie hidden , like sparks beneath ashes , within_the secret recesses of even the most abandoned man certain proof that his_soul -isaia- naturally Christian how_much the more in the hearts of those many upon many who_have_been led into error rather through ignorance or environment . Moreover , the ranks of the workers themselves are_already giving happy and promising signs of a social reconstruction . To Our soul s great joy , We see in these ranks also the massed companies of young workers , who_are receiving the counsel of Divine Grace with willing ears and striving with marvelous zeal to gain their comrades for Christ . No less praise must be accorded to the leaders of workers organizations who , disregarding their_own personal advantage and concerned solely about the good of their fellow members , are striving prudently to harmonize the just demands of their members with the prosperity of their whole occupation and also to promote these demands , and who_do_not let themselves be deterred from so noble a service by any obstacle or suspicion . Also , as anyone may see , many_young men , who by reason of their talent or wealth will soon occupy high places among the leaders of society , are studying social problems with deeper interest , and they arouse the joyful hope that_they_will dedicate themselves wholly to the restoration of society . The present state of affairs , Venerable Brethren , clearly indicates the way_in_which We ought to proceed . For We are_now confronted , as more_than_once before in the history of the Church , with a world_that in large part has almost fallen back into paganism . That these whole classes of men may be brought back to Christ Whom they_have denied , we must recruit and train from among_them , themselves , auxiliary soldiers of the Church who know them well and their_minds and wishes , and can reach their_hearts with a tender brotherly_love . The first and immediate apostles to the workers ought to be workers ; the apostles to those_who follow industry and trade ought to be from among_them themselves . It -isaia- chiefly your duty , Venerable Brethren , and of your_clergy , to search diligently for these lay apostles both of workers and of employers , to select them_with prudence , and to train and instruct them properly . A difficult task , certainly , -isaia- thus imposed on priests , and to meet it , all who_are growing up as the hope of the Church , must be duly prepared by an intensive study of the social_question . Especially -isaia- it necessary_that those_whom you intend to assign in particular to this_work should demonstrate that_they_are men possessed of the keenest sense of justice , who_will resist with true manly courage the dishonest demands or the unjust acts of anyone , who_will excel in the prudence and judgment which avoids every extreme , and , above all , who_will be deeply permeated by the charity of Christ , which alone has the power to subdue firmly but gently the hearts and wills of men to the laws of justice and equity . Upon this road so often tried by happy experience , there_-isaia- no reason_why we should hesitate to go forward with all speed . These Our Beloved Sons who_are chosen for so great a work , We earnestly exhort in the Lord to give themselves wholly to the training of the men committed to their care , and in the discharge of this eminently priestly and apostolic duty to make proper use of the resources of Christian education by teaching youth , forming Christian organizations , and founding study groups guided by principles in harmony_with_the Faith . But above all , let_them hold in high esteem and assiduously employ for the good of their disciples that_most valuable means of both personal and social restoration which , as We taught in Our Encyclical , Mens Nostra , -isaia- to be found in the Spiritual Exercises . In that Letter We expressly mentioned and warmly recommended not_only the Spiritual Exercises for all the laity , but_also the highly beneficial Workers Retreats . For in that school of the spirit , not_only are the best of Christians developed but true apostles also are trained for_every condition of life and are enkindled with the fire of the heart of Christ . From this school they_will go forth as did the Apostles from the Upper Room of Jerusalem , strong in faith , endowed_with an invincible steadfastness in persecution , burning with zeal , interested solely in spreading everywhere the Kingdom of Christ . Certainly there_-isaia- the greatest need now of such valiant soldiers of Christ who_will work with all their strength to keep the human_family safe from the dire ruin into which it would be plunged were_the teachings of the Gospel to be flouted , and that order of things permitted to prevail which tramples underfoot no less the laws of nature than those of God . The Church of Christ , built upon an unshakable rock , has nothing to fear for herself , as she knows for a certainty_that the gates of hell shall never prevail against her . Rather , she knows full well , through the experience of many centuries , that she_-isaia- wont to come forth_from the most violent storms stronger than_ever and adorned with new triumphs . Yet her_maternal heart cannot_but be moved by the countless evils with_which so many thousands would be afflicted during storms of this_kind , and above all by the consequent enormous injury to spiritual_life which_would work eternal ruin to so many souls redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ . To ward off such_great evils from human_society nothing , therefore , -isaia- to be left untried ; to this_end may all our labors turn , to this all our energies , to this our fervent and unremitting prayers to God ! For with the assistance of Divine Grace the fate of the human_family rests in our hands . Venerable Brethren and Beloved Sons , let us not permit the children of this_world to appear wiser in their generation than we who by the Divine Goodness are the children of the light . We find them , indeed , selecting and training with the greatest shrewdness alert and resolute devotees who spread their errors ever wider day_by_day through all classes of men and in every part_of_the_world . And whenever they undertake to attack the Church of Christ more violently , We see them put aside their internal quarrels , assembling in fully harmony in a single battle line with a completely united effort , and work to achieve their common purpose . Surely there_-isaia- not one_that does_not know how_many and how_great are the works that the tireless zeal of Catholics -isaia- striving everywhere to carry_out , both_for social_and_economic welfare as well as in the fields of education and religion . But this admirable and unremitting activity not infrequently shows less effectiveness because of the dispersion of its energies in too many_different directions . Therefore , let all men_of_good will stand united , all who under the Shepherds of the Church wish to fight this good and peaceful battle of Christ ; and under the leadership and teaching guidance of the Church let all strive according to the talent , powers , and position of each to contribute something to the Christian reconstruction of human_society which Leo XIII inaugurated through_his immortal Encyclical , On the Condition of Workers , seeking not themselves and their_own interests , but those of Jesus Christ , not trying to press -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs their_own counsels , but ready to sacrifice them , however excellent , if the greater common_good should seem to require it , so that in all and above all Christ may reign , Christ may command to Whom be '' honor and glory and dominion forever and ever . That this may happily come to pass , to all of you , Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , who_are members of the vast Catholic family entrusted to Us , but_with the especial affection of Our heart to workers and to all others engaged in manual occupations , committed to us more urgently by Divine Providence , and to Christian employers and managements , with paternal love We impart the Apostolic Benediction .

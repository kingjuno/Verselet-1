By the inscrutable design of Divine Providence We were raised to this summit of the Catholic priesthood . From that moment Our thoughts were turned to all the innumerable children whom God entrusted to Us . Yet , in a special_way , We have felt an affectionate and earnest solicitude towards those_who_have the commission to be '' the salt of the earth and the light_of_the_world , '' for those_who_have been signaled out and adorned by the priestly character . In a still_more special_way Our thoughts have turned towards those dearly beloved young students who are_being educated in the shadow of the sanctuary and are preparing themselves for this_most noble charge , the priesthood . Even in the first months of Our Pontificate , before We had addressed Our solemn word to the whole Catholic world , We hastened to lay stress upon the principles and ideals which ought to guide and inspire the education of future priests . This we did by Our Apostolic Letter Officiorum omnium written on the first of August , , to Our beloved son , the Cardinal Prefect of the sacred Congregation for Seminaries and Universities . And whenever Our pastoral watchfulness prompts Us to consider more in particular the good estate and the needs of the Church , Our attention -isaia-_directed always , and before all things else , to priests and clergy . Nor -isaia- there lacking witness to this Our special interest in the priesthood . For We have erected many new seminaries ; and others We have , -atti_degli_apostoli- great expense , provided with new and befitting buildings , or endowed more liberally with revenues or staff , that_they_may the more worthily attain their high aim . Upon the occasion of Our Sacerdotal Jubilee , We allowed that event , so blessed in its memories , to be celebrated with some solemnity , and We even encouraged with fatherly gratification the marks of filial affection which came to Us from every_part of the globe . Our reason was that We regarded this celebration not_so_much as a homage to Our Person , as a dutiful tribute of honor to the dignity of the priestly character . Similarly , We decreed a reform of studies in ecclesiastical faculties , by the Apostolic Constitution Deus scientiarum Dominus , of the twenty fourth of May , . Our special purpose in this decree was to make even broader and higher the culture and learning of priests . This matter , indeed , -isaia- of so great and universal importance that We think fitting to devote to it a special Encyclical ; since_it_-isaia- Our desire that_the_faithful , who already possess the priceless gift of Faith , may appreciate the sublimity of the Catholic Priesthood and its providential mission in the world ; that_those , too , who_do_not yet possess the Faith , but_with uprightness and sincerity are in search of Truth , may share this appreciation with the faithful ; above all , that_those_who are themselves called may_have still deeper_understanding and esteem of their_vocation . This subject -isaia- particularly opportune -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment , for it -isaia- the end of the year which_has seen extended , beyond_the Eternal City to the whole Catholic world , the Jubilee of the Redemption . This Extraordinary Jubilee , -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes , came , like a sunset , to a splendid close . There , under the mantle of the Immaculate , for a fervent and uninterrupted Eucharistic Triduum , gathered together Catholic clergy of every tongue and rite . Our beloved and venerated priests , never more energetic in well doing than during_this special Holy Year , are the ministers of the Redemption of which_this year was_the Jubilee . Moreover , this_year , as We said in the Apostolic Constitution Quod nuper , commemorated , likewise , the nineteenth centenary of the institution of the priesthood . Our previous Encyclicals were directed to throwing the light of Catholic doctrine upon the gravest of the problems peculiar to modern life . Our present Encyclical finds a natural place among_these others , opportunely supplementing them . The priest_-isaia- , indeed , both by vocation and divine commission , the chief apostle and tireless furtherer of the Christian education of youth ; in the name of God , the priest blesses Christian marriage , and defends its sanctity and indissolubility against the attacks and evasions suggested by cupidity and sensuality ; the priest contributes more_effectively to the solution , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least the mitigation , of social conflicts , since he preaches Christian brotherhood , declares to all their mutual obligations of justice and charity , brings peace to hearts embittered by moral and economic hardship , and alike to rich and poor points_out the only true riches to which all men both can and should aspire . Finally , the priest -isaia-_the_most valorous leader in that crusade of expiation and penance to which We have invited all men_of_good will . For there_-isaia- need of reparation for the blasphemies , wickedness and crimes which dishonor humanity today , an age perhaps unparalleled in its need_for the mercy and pardon of God . The enemies of the Church themselves well know_the vital importance of the priesthood ; for against the priesthood in particular , as We have_already had to lament in the case of Our dear Mexico , they direct the point of their attacks . It -isaia- the priesthood they desire to be rid of ; that_they_may clear the way_for that destruction of the Church , which_has_been so often attempted yet never achieved . The human_race has_always felt the need of a priesthood : of men , that_-isaia- , who have_the official charge to be mediators between God and humanity , men_who should consecrate themselves entirely to this mediation , as to the very purpose of their_lives , men set_aside to offer to God public prayers and sacrifices in the name of human_society . For human_society as such_-isaia- bound to offer to God public and social worship . It -isaia- bound to acknowledge in Him its Supreme Lord and first beginning , and to strive toward Him as to its last end , to give Him thanks and offer Him propitiation . In fact , priests_are to be found among all peoples whose customs are known , except those compelled by violence to act against the most_sacred laws of human_nature . They may , indeed , be in the service of false divinities ; but wherever religion_-isaia- professed , wherever altars are built , there also -isaia- a priesthood surrounded by particular marks of honor and veneration . Yet in the splendor of Divine Revelation the priest_-isaia- seen invested with a dignity far greater still . This dignity was foreshadowed of old by the venerable and mysterious figure of Melchisedech , Priest and King , whom St . Paul recalls as prefiguring the Person and Priesthood of Christ Our Lord Himself . The priest , according to the magnificent definition given by St . Paul -isaia- indeed a man Ex hominibus assumptus , '' taken from amongst men , '' yet pro hominibus constituitur in his quae sunt ad Deum , '' ordained for men in the things_that appertain to God '' : his office -isaia- not for_human things , and things_that pass away , however lofty and valuable these may seem ; but_for things divine and enduring . These eternal things may , perhaps , through ignorance , be scorned and contemned , or even attacked with diabolical fury and malice , as sad experience has often proved , and proves even today ; but_they always continue to hold the first_place in the aspirations , individual and social , of humanity , because the human_heart feels irresistibly it -isaia- made for God and -isaia- restless till it rests in Him . The Old Law , inspired by God and promulgated by Moses , set up a priesthood , which_was , in this manner , of divine institution ; and determined for it every detail of its duty , residence and rite . It would seem that God , in His great care_for them , wished to impress upon the still primitive mind of the Jewish people one great central idea . This idea throughout_the history of the chosen people , was to shed its light over all events , laws , ranks and offices : the idea of sacrifice and priesthood . These were to become , through_faith in the future Messias , a source of hope , glory , power and spiritual liberation . The temple of Solomon , astonishing in richness and splendor , was still_more wonderful in its rites and ordinances . Erected to the one true God as a tabernacle of the divine Majesty upon earth , it was_also a sublime poem sung to that sacrifice and that priesthood , which , though type and symbol , was still so august , that the sacred figure of its High Priest moved the conqueror Alexander the Great , to bow in reverence ; and God Himself visited His wrath upon the impious king Balthasar because he made revel with the sacred vessels of the temple . Yet that ancient priesthood derived its greatest majesty and glory from being a foretype of the Christian priesthood ; the priesthood of the New and eternal Covenant sealed with the Blood of the Redeemer of the world , Jesus Christ , true God and true Man . The Apostle of the Gentiles thus perfectly sums up what may be said of the greatness , the dignity and the duty of the Christian priesthood : Sic nos existimet homo Ut ministros Christi et dispensatores mysteriorum Dei '' Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God . '' The priest_-isaia- the minister of Christ , an instrument , that_-isaia- to say , in the hands of the Divine Redeemer . He continues the work of the redemption in all its world embracing universality and divine efficacy , that work that wrought so marvelous a transformation in the world . Thus the priest , as -isaia- said with good_reason , -isaia- indeed '' another Christ '' ; for , in some_way , he -isaia- himself a continuation of Christ . '' As the Father hath sent Me , I also send you , '' -isaia- spoken to the priest , and hence_the priest , like Christ , continues to give '' glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men_of_good will . For , in the first_place , as the Council of Trent teaches , Jesus Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper instituted the sacrifice and the priesthood of the New Covenant : '' our Lord and God , although once and for all , by means of His death on the altar of the cross , He was to offer Himself to God the Father , that thereon He might accomplish eternal Redemption ; yet because death was_not to put an end to his priesthood , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , the same night in which He was betrayed in order to leave to His beloved spouse the Church , a sacrifice which_should be visible as the nature of man requires , which_should represent that bloody sacrifice , once and for all to be completed on the cross , which_should perpetuate His memory to the end of time , and which_should apply its saving power unto the remission of sins we daily commit , showing Himself made a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedech , offered to God the Father , under the appearance of bread and wine , His Body and Blood , giving them to the apostles whom He was then making priests of the New Covenant to be consumed under the signs of these same things , and commanded the Apostles and their successors in the priesthood to offer them , by the words Do this in commemoration of Me . And thenceforth , the Apostles , and their successors in the priesthood , began to lift to heaven that '' clean oblation '' foretold by Malachy , through_which the name of God -isaia- great among the gentiles . And now , that_same oblation in every part_of_the_world and -atti_degli_apostoli- every hour of the day and night , -isaia- offered and will_continue to be offered without interruption till the end of time : a true sacrificial act , not merely symbolical , which_has a real efficacy unto the reconciliation of sinners with the Divine Majesty . '' Appeased by this oblation , the Lord grants grace and the gift of repentance , and forgives iniquities and sins , however great . '' The reason of this_-isaia- given by the same Council in these_words : '' For there_-isaia-_one and the same Victim , there_-isaia- present_the same Christ who once offered Himself upon the Cross , who now offers Himself by the ministry of priests , only the manner of the offering being different . And thus_the ineffable greatness of the human priest stands forth in all its splendor ; for he has power over the very Body of Jesus Christ , and makes It present upon our altars . In the name of Christ Himself he offers It a victim infinitely pleasing to the Divine Majesty . '' Wondrous things_are these , '' justly exclaims St . John Chrysostom , '' so wonderful , they surpass wonder . Besides this_power over the real Body of Christ , the priest has_received other powers , august and sublime , over His Mystical Body of Christ , a doctrine so dear to St . Paul ; this beautiful doctrine that shows us the Person of the Word made Flesh in union with all His brethren . For from Him to them comes a supernatural influence , so that_they , with Him as Head , form a single Body of which_they_are the members . Now a priest_-isaia- the appointed '' dispenser of the mysteries of God , '' for the benefit of the members of the mystical Body of Christ ; since he -isaia- the ordinary minister of nearly all the Sacraments , those channels through_which the grace of the Savior flows for the good of humanity . The Christian , -atti_degli_apostoli- almost every important stage of his mortal career , finds -atti_degli_apostoli- his side the priest with power received_from God , in the act of communicating or increasing that grace which_-isaia- the supernatural life of his_soul . Scarcely -isaia- he born before the priest baptizing him , brings him by a new birth to a more noble and precious life , a supernatural life , and makes him a son of God and of the Church of Jesus Christ . To strengthen him to fight bravely in spiritual combats , a priest invested with_special dignity makes him a soldier of Christ by holy chrism . Then , as soon as he -isaia- able to recognize and value the Bread of Angels , the priest gives It to him , the living and life_giving Food come down from Heaven . If he fall , the priest raises him up again in the name of God , and reconciles him to God with the Sacrament of Penance . Again , if he -isaia- called by God to found a family and to collaborate with Him in the transmission of human_life throughout_the_world , thus increasing the number of the faithful on earth and , thereafter , the ranks of the elect in Heaven , the priest_-isaia- there to bless his espousals and unblemished love ; and when , finally , arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- the portals of eternity , the Christian feels the need of strength and courage before presenting himself -atti_degli_apostoli- the tribunal of the Divine Judge , the priest with the holy oils anoints the failing members of the sick or dying Christian , and reconsecrates and comforts him . Thus the priest accompanies the Christian throughout_the pilgrimage of this_life to the gates of Heaven . He accompanies the body to its resting place in the grave with rites and prayers of immortal hope . And even beyond_the threshold of eternity he follows the soul to aid it with Christian suffrages , if need there be of further purification and alleviation . Thus , from the cradle to the grave the priest_-isaia- ever beside the faithful , a guide , a solace , a minister of salvation and dispenser of grace and blessing . But among all these powers of the priest over the Mystical Body of Christ for the benefit of the faithful , there_-isaia-_one of which_the simple mention made above will_not content Us . This -isaia- that power which , as St . John Chrysostom says : '' God gave neither to Angels nor Archangels '' the power to remit sins . '' Whose sins you shall forgive they_are forgiven them : and whose sins you shall retain they_are retained '' ; a tremendous power , so peculiar to God that_even human pride could_not make_the mind conceive that it could be given to man . '' Who can forgive sins but God alone ? '' And , when we see it exercised by a mere man there_-isaia- reason to ask ourselves , not , indeed , with pharisaical scandal , but_with reverent surprise -atti_degli_apostoli- such a dignity : '' Who -isaia- this_that forgiveth sins also ? '' But it -isaia- so : the God Man who possessed the '' power on earth to forgive sins '' willed to hand it on to His priests ; to relieve , in His divine generosity and mercy , the need of moral purification which_-isaia- rooted in the human_heart . What a comfort to the guilty , when , stung with remorse and repenting of his sins , he hears the word of the priest who says to him in God s name : '' I absolve thee from thy sins ! '' These words fall , it -isaia- true , from the lips of one_who , in his turn , must needs beg the same absolution from another priest . This does_not debase the merciful gift ; but makes it , rather , appear greater ; since beyond_the weak creature -isaia- seen more_clearly the hand of God through whose power -isaia- wrought this wonder . As an illustrious layman has written , treating with rare competence of spiritual things : '' . when a priest , groaning in spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- his_own unworthiness and -atti_degli_apostoli- the loftiness of his office , places his consecrated hands upon our heads ; when , humiliated -atti_degli_apostoli- finding himself_the dispenser of the Blood of the Covenant ; each time amazed as he pronounces the words that give life ; when a sinner has absolved a sinner ; we , who rise from our knees before him , feel we have_done nothing debasing . We have_been -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of a man_who represented Jesus Christ , . we have_been there to receive the dignity of free men and of sons of God . These august powers are conferred upon the priest in a special Sacrament designed to this_end : they_are_not merely passing or temporary in the priest , but are stable and perpetual , united as they_are with the indelible character imprinted on his_soul whereby he becomes '' a priest forever '' ; whereby he becomes like unto Him in whose eternal priesthood he has been_made a sharer . Even the most lamentable downfall , which , through human frailty , -isaia- possible to a priest , can_never blot out from his_soul the priestly character . But along_with this character and these powers , the priest through the Sacrament of Orders receives new and special grace with_special helps . Thereby , if only he will loyally further , by his free and personal cooperation , the divinely powerful action of the grace itself , he will_be_able worthily to fulfill all the duties , however arduous , of his lofty calling . He will_not be overborne , but will_be_able to bear the tremendous responsibilities inherent to his priestly duty ; responsibilities which_have made fearful even the stoutest champions of the Christian priesthood , men like St . Gregory the Great , St . Charles and many_others . The Catholic priest_-isaia- minister of Christ and dispenser of the mysteries of God in another way , that_-isaia- , by his_words . The '' ministry of the word '' -isaia- a right which_-isaia- inalienable ; it -isaia- a duty which_cannot be disallowed ; for it -isaia- imposed by Jesus Christ Himself : '' Going , therefore , teach ye all nations . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you . '' The Church of Christ , depository and infallible guardian of divine_revelation , by means of her priests , pours out the treasures of heavenly truth ; she preaches Him who_-isaia- '' the true Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this_world '' ; she sows with divine bounty that seed which_-isaia- small and worthless to the profane eyes of the world , but which_-isaia- like the mustard seed of the Gospel . For it has within itself power to strike strong deep roots in souls which_are sincere and thirsting for the truth , and make_them like sturdy trees able to withstand the wildest storms . Amidst all the aberrations of human thought , infatuated by a false emancipation from every law and curb ; and amidst the awful corruptions of human malice , the Church rises up like a bright lighthouse warning by the clearness of its beam every deviation to right or left from the way of truth , and pointing out to one and all the right course that_they_should follow . Woe if ever this beacon should be We do not say extinguished , for that_-isaia- impossible owing to the unfailing promises on which_it_-isaia- founded but if it should be hindered from shedding far and wide its beneficent light ! We see already with Our own eyes whither the world has_been brought by its arrogant rejection of divine_revelation , and its pursuit of false philosophical and moral theories that bear the specious name of '' science . '' That it has not fallen still lower down the slope of error and vice -isaia- due to the guidance of the light of Christian truth_that always shines in the world . Now the Church exercises her '' ministry of the word '' through_her priests of every grade of the Hierarchy , in which_each has his wisely allotted place . These she sends everywhere as unwearied heralds of the good tidings which alone_can save and advance true civilization and culture , or help_them to rise again . The word of the priest enters the soul and brings light and power ; the voice of the priest rises calmly above the storms of passion , fearlessly to proclaim_the truth , and exhort to the good ; that truth_which elucidates and solves the gravest problems of human_life ; that good which no misfortune can take from us , which death but secures and renders immortal . Consider the truths themselves which_the priest if faithful to his_ministry , must frequently inculcate . Ponder them one by one and dwell upon their inner power ; for they_make plain the influence of the priest , and how strong and beneficent it can be for the moral education , social concord and peaceful development of peoples . He brings home to young and old the fleeting nature of the present life ; the perishableness of earthly goods ; the value of spiritual goods and of the immortal soul ; the severity of divine judgment ; the spotless holiness of the divine gaze that reads the hearts of all ; the justice of God , which '' will render to every man according_to_his works . '' These and similar lessons the priest teaches ; a teaching fitted indeed to moderate the feverish search_for pleasure , and the uncontrolled greed for worldly goods , that debase so much of modern life , and spur on the different classes of society to fight one_another like enemies , instead of helping one_another like friends . In this clash of selfish interest , and unleashed hate , and dark plans of revenge , nothing could be better or more powerful to help , than loudly to proclaim_the '' new commandment '' of Christ . That commandment enjoins a love_which extends to all , knows no barriers nor national boundaries , excludes no race , excepts not_even its_own enemies . The experience of twenty centuries fully and gloriously reveals the power for good of the word of the priest . Being the faithful echo and reecho of the '' word of God , '' which '' -isaia- living and effectual and more piercing than_any two edged sword , it too reaches '' unto the division of the soul and spirit '' ; it awakens heroism of every_kind , in every class and place , and inspires the self forgetting deeds of the most generous hearts . All the good that Christian civilization has brought into_the_world -isaia- due , -atti_degli_apostoli- least radically , to the word and works of the Catholic priesthood . Such a past might , to itself , serve as sufficient guarantee for the future ; but we have a still_more secure guarantee , '' a more firm prophetical word '' in the infallible promises of Christ . The work , too , of the Missions manifests most vividly the power of expansion given by divine_grace to the Church . This work_-isaia- advanced and carried on principally by priests . Pioneers of faith and love , -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of innumerable sacrifices , they extend and widen the Kingdom of God upon earth . Finally , the priest , in another way , follows the example of Christ . Of Him it -isaia- written that He '' passed the whole night in the prayer of God '' and '' ever lives to make intercession for us '' ; and like Him , the priest , -isaia- public and official intercessor of humanity before God ; he has the duty and commission of offering to God in the name of the Church , over and above sacrifice strictly so called , the '' sacrifice of praise , '' in public and official prayer ; for several times each_day with psalms , prayers and hymns taken in great part from the inspired books , he pays to God this dutiful tribute of adoration and thus performs his necessary office of interceding for_humanity . And never did humanity , in its afflictions , stand more in need of intercession and of the divine help which it brings . Who can tell how_many chastisements priestly prayer wards off from sinful mankind , how_many blessings it brings down and secures ? . If Our Lord made such magnificent and solemn promises even to private prayers , how much_more powerful must be that prayer which_-isaia- said ex officio in the name of the Church , the beloved Spouse of the Savior ? The Christian , though in prosperity so often forgetful of God , yet in the depth of his_heart keeps his confidence in prayer , feels that prayer_-isaia- all powerful , and as by a holy instinct , in every distress , in every peril whether private or public , has recourse with_special trust to the prayer of the priest . To it the unfortunate of every sort look for comfort ; to it they have_recourse , seeking divine aid in all the vicissitudes of this exile here on earth . Truly does the '' priest occupy a place midway between God and human_nature : from Him bringing to us absolving beneficence , offering our prayers to Him and appeasing the wrathful Lord . A last tribute to the priesthood -isaia- given by the enemies of the Church . For as We have_said on a previous page , they show that_they fully appreciate the dignity and importance of the Catholic priesthood , by directing against it their first and fiercest blows ; since_they know well how close -isaia- the tie that binds the Church to her priests . The most rabid enemies of the Catholic priesthood are today the very enemies of God ; a homage indeed to the priesthood , showing it the more worthy of honor and veneration . Most sublime , then , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- the dignity of the priesthood . Even the falling away of the few unworthy in the priesthood , however deplorable and distressing it may be , cannot dim the splendor of so lofty a dignity . Much less can the unworthiness of a few cause the worth and merit of so many to be overlooked ; and how_many have_been , and are , in the priesthood , preeminent in holiness , in learning , in works of zeal , nay , even in martyrdom . Nor must it be forgotten that personal unworthiness does_not hinder the efficacy of a priest s ministry . For the unworthiness of the minister does_not make void the Sacraments he administers ; since_the Sacraments derive their efficacy from the Blood of Christ , independently of the sanctity of the instrument , or , as scholastic language expresses it , the Sacraments work their effect ex opere operato . Nevertheless , it -isaia- quite true_that so holy an office demands holiness in him_who holds it . A priest should_have a loftiness of spirit , a purity of heart and a sanctity of life befitting the solemnity and holiness of the office he holds . For this , as We have_said , makes_the priest a mediator between God and man ; a mediator in the place , and by the command of Him who_-isaia- '' the one mediator of God and men , the man Jesus Christ . '' The priest must , therefore , approach as close as possible to the perfection of Him whose vicar he -isaia- , and render himself ever more_and_more pleasing to God , by the sanctity of his_life and of his deeds ; because more_than the scent of incense , or the beauty of churches and altars , God loves and accepts holiness . '' They who_are the intermediaries between God and His people , '' says St . Thomas , '' must bear a good conscience before God , and a good name among_men . '' On the contrary , whosoever handles and administers holy things , while blameworthy in his_life , profanes them and -isaia- guilty of sacrilege : '' They who_are_not holy ought not to handle holy things . For this_reason even in the Old Testament God commanded His priests and levites : '' Let them therefore be holy because I -amos- also holy : the Lord who sanctify them . '' In his canticle for the dedication of the temple , Solomon the Wise made this_same request to the Lord in favor of the sons of Aaron : '' Let Thy priests be clothed with justice : and let Thy saints rejoice . '' So , Venerable Brethren , may we not ask with St . Robert Bellarmine : '' If so great uprightness , holiness and lively devotion was required of priests_who offered sheep and oxen , and praised God for the moral blessings ; what , I ask , -isaia- required of those priests_who sacrifice the Divine Lamb and give thanks for eternal blessings ? '' '' A great dignity , '' exclaims St . Lawrence Justinian , '' but great too -isaia- the responsibility ; placed high in the eyes of men they must_also be lifted up to the peak of virtue before the eye of Him who seeth all ; otherwise their elevation will be not to their merit but to their damnation . And surely every reason We have urged in showing the dignity of the Catholic priesthood does but reinforce its obligation of singular holiness ; for as the Angelic Doctor teaches : '' To fulfill the duties of Holy Orders , common goodness does_not suffice ; but excelling goodness -isaia- required ; that_they who receive Orders and are thereby higher in rank than the people , may also be higher in holiness . '' The Eucharistic Sacrifice in which_the Immaculate Victim who taketh away the sins of the world_-isaia- immolated , requires in a special_way that the priest , by a holy and spotless life , should make himself as far as he can , less unworthy of God , to whom he daily offers that adorable Victim , the very Word of God incarnate for love of us . Agnoscite quod agitis , imitamini quod tractatis , '' realize what_you are doing , and imitate what_you handle , '' says the Church through the Bishop to the deacons as they_are about to be consecrated priests . The priest_-isaia- also the almoner of God s graces of which_the Sacraments are the channels ; how grave a reproach would it be , for one_who dispenses these most_precious graces were he himself without them , or were he even to esteem them lightly and guard them_with little care . Moreover , the priest must teach the truths of faith ; but the truths of religion are never so worthily and effectively taught as when taught by virtue ; because in the common saying : '' Deeds speak louder than words . '' The priest must preach the law of the Gospel ; but_for that preaching to be effective , the most obvious and , by the Grace of God , the most persuasive argument , -isaia- to see the actual practice of the law in him_who preaches it . Gregory the Great gives the reason : '' The voice which penetrates the hearts of the hearers , -isaia- the voice commended by the speaker s own_life ; because what his_word enjoins , his example helps to bring_about . '' This exactly -isaia- what Holy Scripture says of our Divine Savior : He '' began to do and to teach . '' And the crowds hailed Him , not_so_much because '' never did man speak like this man , '' but_rather because '' He hath done all things well . '' On the other_hand , they_who '' say and do not , '' practicing not what_they preach , become like the scribes and Pharisees . And Our Lord s rebuke to the other_hand , they_who '' say and do not , '' practicing not what_they preach , the word of God , was yet administered publicly , in the presence of the listening crowd : '' The Scribes and Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses . All things therefore whatsoever they_shall say to you observe and do : but according_to_their work do ye not . '' A preacher who_does_not try to ratify by his_life s example the truth he preaches , only pulls down with one_hand what he builds up with the other . On the contrary , God greatly blesses the labor of those heralds of the gospel who attend first to their_own holiness ; they see their apostolate flourishing and fruitful , and in the day of the harvest , '' coming they_shall come with joyfulness carrying in their sheaves . It would be a grave error fraught with many dangers should the priest , carried away by false zeal , neglect his_own sanctification , and become over immersed in the external works , however holy , of the priestly_ministry . Thereby , he would run a double risk . In the first_place he endangers his_own salvation , as the great Apostle of the Gentiles feared for_himself : '' But I chastise my body , and bring it into subjection : lest perhaps , when I have preached to others , I myself should become a castaway . '' In the second place he might lose , if not divine_grace , certainly that unction of the Holy Spirit which_gives such a marvelous force and efficacy to the external apostolate . Now to all Christians in general it has been_said : '' Be ye perfect as your Heavenly Father -isaia- perfect '' ; how much_more then should the priest consider these_words of the Divine Master as spoken to himself , called as he -isaia- by a special vocation to follow Christ more_closely . Hence the Church publicly urges on all her clerics this_most grave duty , placing it in the code of her laws : '' Clerics must lead a life , both interior and exterior , more holy than the laity , and be an example to them by excelling in virtue and good_works . '' And since_the priest_-isaia- an ambassador for Christ , he should so live as to be able with truth to make his_own the words of the Apostle : '' Be ye followers of me , as I also -amos- of Christ '' ; he ought to live as another Christ who by the splendor of His virtue enlightened and still enlightens the world . It -isaia- plain , then_,_that all Christian virtues should flourish in the soul of the priest . Yet there_are_some virtues which in a very particular manner attach themselves to the priest as most befitting and necessary to him . Of these the first -isaia- piety , or godliness , according to the exhortation of the Apostle to his beloved Timothy : Exerce . teipsum ad pietatem , '' exercise thyself unto godliness . '' Indeed the priest s relations with God are so intimate , so delicate and so frequent , that clearly they_should ever be graced by the sweet odor of piety ; if '' godliness -isaia- profitable to all things , '' it -isaia-_especially profitable to a right exercise of the priestly charge . Without piety the holiest practices , the most solemn rites of the sacred_ministry , will be performed mechanically and out of habit ; they_will be devoid of spirit , unction and life . But remark , Venerable Brethren , the piety of which We speak -isaia- not_that shallow and superficial piety which attracts but does_not nourish , -isaia- busy but does_not sanctify . We mean_that solid piety which_-isaia-_not dependent upon changing mood or feeling . It -isaia- based upon principles of sound doctrine ; it -isaia- ruled by staunch convictions ; and so it resists the assaults and the illusions of temptation . This piety should primarily be directed towards God our Father in Heaven ; yet it should be extended also to the Mother of God . The priest even_more than the faithful should_have devotion to Our Lady , for the relation of the priest to Christ -isaia- more_deeply and truly like that_which Mary bears to her Divine Son . It -isaia- impossible to treat of the piety of a Catholic priest without being drawn on to speak , too , of another most_precious treasure of the Catholic priesthood , that_-isaia- , of chastity ; for from piety springs the meaning and the beauty of chastity . Clerics of the Latin Church in higher Orders are_bound by a grave obligation of chastity ; so grave -isaia- the obligation in them of its perfect and total observance that a transgression involves the added guilt of sacrilege . Though this_law does_not bind , in all its amplitude , clerics of the Oriental Churches , yet among_them also , ecclesiastical celibacy -isaia- revered ; indeed in some cases , especially in the higher Orders of the Hierarchy , it -isaia- a necessary and obligatory requisite . A certain connection_between this virtue and the sacerdotal ministry can be seen even by the light of reason alone : since '' God -isaia- a Spirit , '' it -isaia- only fitting_that he who dedicates and consecrates himself to God s service should in some_way '' divest himself of the body . '' The ancient Romans perceived this fitness ; one of their laws which ran Ad divos adeunto caste , '' approach the gods chastely , '' -isaia- quoted by one of their greatest orators with the following comment : '' The law orders us to present ourselves to the gods in chastity of spirit , that_-isaia- , in which_are all things , or does this exclude chastity of the body , which_-isaia- to be understood , since_the spirit_-isaia- so far superior to the body ; for it should be remembered that bodily chastity cannot be preserved , unless spiritual chastity be maintained . '' In the Old Law , Moses in the name of God commanded Aaron and his sons to remain within_the Tabernacle , and so to keep continent , during the seven days in which_they were exercising their sacred functions . But the Christian priesthood , being much superior to that of the Old Law , demanded a still greater purity . The law of ecclesiastical celibacy , whose first written traces pre suppose a still earlier unwritten practice , dates back to a canon of the Council of Elvira , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the fourth century , when persecution still raged . This law only makes obligatory what might in any case almost be termed a moral exigency that springs from the Gospel and the Apostolic preaching . For the Divine Master showed such high esteem_for chastity , and exalted it as something beyond_the common power ; He Himself was_the Son of a Virgin Mother , Florem Matris Virginis , and was brought up in the virgin family of Joseph and Mary ; He showed special love for pure souls such as the two Johns the Baptist and the Evangelist . The great Apostle Paul , faithful interpreter of the New Law and of the mind of Christ , preached the inestimable value of virginity , in view of a more fervent service of God , and gave the reason when he said : '' He that_-isaia- without a wife -isaia- solicitous for the things_that belong to the Lord , how he may please God . '' All this had almost inevitable consequences : the priests of the New Law felt the heavenly attraction of this chosen virtue ; they sought to be of the number of those '' to whom it -isaia- given to take this word , '' and they spontaneously bound themselves to its observance . Soon it came about_that the practice , in the Latin Church , received_the sanction of ecclesiastical law . The Second Council of Carthage -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the fourth century declared : '' What the Apostles taught , and the early Church preserved , let us too , observe . In the Oriental Church , too , most illustrious Fathers bear_witness to the excellence of Catholic celibacy . In this_matter as in others there_was harmony between_the Latin and Oriental Churches where accurate discipline flourished . Epiphanius -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the fourth century tells us that celibacy applied even to the subdiaconate : '' The Church does_not on any account admit a man living in the wedded state and having children , even_though he have only_one wife , to the orders of deacon , priest , bishop or subdeacon ; but_only him whose wife be dead or who should abstain from the use of marriage ; this_-isaia- done in those places especially where_the ecclesiastical canons are accurately followed . '' The Deacon of Edessa and Doctor of the Universal Church , well called the Harp of the Holy Spirit , St . Ephraem , the Syrian , -isaia- particularly eloquent on this_matter . In one of his poems , addressed to his friend , the bishop Abraham , he says : '' Thou art true to thy name , Abraham , for thou also art the father of many : but because thou hast no wife as Abraham had Sara , behold thy flock -isaia- thy spouse . Bring up its children in thy truth ; may_they become to thee children of the spirit and sons of the promise that makes them heirs to Eden . O sweet fruit of chastity , in which_the priesthood finds_its delights . the horn of plenty flowed over and anointed thee , a hand rested on thee and chose thee out , the Church desired thee and held thee dear . '' And in another place : '' It -isaia-_not_enough for the priest and the name of the priesthood , it -isaia-_not_enough , I say , for him_who offers up the living body , to cleanse his_soul and tongue and hand and make spotless his whole_body ; but he must -atti_degli_apostoli- all times be absolutely and preeminently pure , because he -isaia- established as a mediator between God and the human_race . May He be praised who made His servants clean ! '' St . John Chrysostom affirms : '' The priest must be so pure that , if he were to be lifted up and placed in the heavens themselves , he might take a place in the midst of the Angels . In short the very height , or , to use St . Epiphanius phrase , '' the incredible honor and dignity '' of the Christian priesthood , which We have briefly described , shows how becoming -isaia- clerical celibacy and the law which enjoins it . Priests have a duty which , in a certain way , -isaia- higher than_that of the most pure spirits '' who stand before the Lord . '' Is it not right , then_,_that he live an all but angelic life ? A priest_-isaia- one_who should be totally dedicated to the things of the Lord . Is it not right , then_,_that he be entirely detached from the things of the world , and have his conversation in Heaven ? A priest s charge -isaia- to be solicitous for the eternal salvation_of_souls , continuing in their regard the work of the Redeemer . Is it not , then , fitting_that he keep himself free_from the cares of a family , which_would absorb a great part of his energies ? . And truly an ordination ceremony , frequent though it be in the Catholic Church , never fails to touch the hearts of those present : how admirable a sight , these young ordinands , who before receiving the subdiaconate , before , that_-isaia- , consecrating themselves utterly to the service and the worship of God , freely renounce the joys and the pleasures which might rightfully be theirs in another walk of life . We say '' freely , '' for though , after ordination , they_are no longer free to contract earthly marriage , nevertheless they advance to ordination itself unconstrained by any law or person , and of their_own spontaneous choice ! . Notwithstanding all this , We do not wish that_what We said in commendation of clerical celibacy should be interpreted as though it were Our mind in any_way to blame , or , as it were , disapprove the different discipline legitimately prevailing in the Oriental Church . What We have_said has_been meant solely to exalt in the Lord something We consider one of the purest glories of the Catholic priesthood ; something which seems to us to correspond better to the desires of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and to His purposes in regard to priestly souls . Not less_than by his chastity , the Catholic priest ought to be distinguished by his detachment . Surrounded by the corruptions of a world in which everything can be bought and sold , he must pass through them utterly free of selfishness . He must holily spurn all vile greed of earthly gains , since he -isaia- in search of souls , not of money , of the glory of God , not his_own . He -isaia- no mercenary working for a temporal recompense , nor yet an employee who , whilst attending conscientiously to duties of his office , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- looking to his career and personal promotion ; he -isaia- the '' good soldier of Christ '' who '' entangleth not himself_with secular business : that_he_may please Him to whom he hath engaged himself . The minister of God -isaia- a father of souls ; and he knows that_his toils and his cares cannot adequately be repaid with wealth and honors of earth . He -isaia- not indeed forbidden to receive fitting sustenance , according to the teaching of the Apostle : '' They that serve the altar may partake with the altar . so also the Lord ordained that_they who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel . '' But once '' called to the inheritance of the Lord , '' as his_very title '' cleric '' declares , a priest must expect no other recompense than_that promised by Christ to His Apostles : '' Your reward -isaia-_very great in Heaven . '' Woe to the priest who , forgetful of these divine promises should become '' greedy of filthy lucre . '' Woe if he join the herd of the worldly over whom_the Church like the Apostle grieves : '' All seek the things_that_are their_own : not the things_that_are Jesus Christ s . '' Such a priest , besides failing in his vocation , would earn the contempt even of his_own people . They would perceive in him the deplorable contradiction between his conduct and the doctrine so clearly expounded by Christ , which_the priest_-isaia- bound to teach : '' Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth : where_the rust and moth consume and where thieves break through and steal . But lay up to yourselves treasures in Heaven . '' Judas , an Apostle of Christ , '' one of the twelve , '' as the Evangelists sadly observe , was led down to the abyss of iniquity precisely through the spirit of greed for earthly things . Remembering him , it -isaia- easy to grasp how this same_spirit could have brought such harm upon the Church throughout_the centuries : greed , called by the Holy Spirit the '' root of all evil , '' can incite to any crime ; and a priest who_-isaia- poisoned by this vice , even_though he stop short of crime , will nevertheless , consciously or unconsciously , make common cause with the enemies of God and of the Church , and cooperate in their evil designs . On the other_hand , by sincere disinterestedness the priest can hope to win the hearts of all . For detachment from earthly goods , if inspired by lively faith , -isaia- always accompanied by tender compassion towards_the unfortunate of every_kind . Thus the priest becomes a veritable father of the poor . Mindful of the touching words of his Savior , '' As long as you did it to one of these My least brethren , you did it to Me , '' he sees in them , and , with particular affection , venerates and loves Jesus Christ Himself . Thus the Catholic priest_-isaia- freed from the bonds of a family and of self interest , the chief bonds which_could bind him too closely to earth . Thus freed , his_heart will more readily take flame from that heavenly fire that burns in the Heart of Jesus ; that fire that seeks only to inflame apostolic hearts and through them '' cast fire on all the earth . '' This -isaia- the fire of zeal . Like the zeal of Jesus described in Holy Scripture , the zeal of the priest for the glory of God and the salvation_of_souls sought to consume him . It should make him forget himself and all earthly things . It should powerfully urge him to dedicate himself utterly to his sublime work , and to search out means ever more_effective for an apostolate ever wider and ever better . The Good Shepherd said : '' And other sheep I have that_are not of this fold ; them also I must bring ; '' and again , '' See the countries for they_are white already to the harvest . '' How can a priest meditate upon these_words and not feel his_heart enkindled with yearning to lead souls to the Heart of the Good Shepherd ? How can he fail to offer himself to the Lord of the harvest for unremitting toil ? Our Lord saw the multitudes '' Iying like sheep that_have no shepherd . '' Such multitudes are to be seen today not_only in the far distant lands of the missions , but_also , alas ! in countries which_have_been Christian for centuries . How can a priest see such multitudes and not feel deeply within himself an echo of that divine pity which so often moved the Heart of the Son of God ? a priest , we say , who_-isaia- conscious of possessing the words of life and of having in his hands the God given means of regeneration and salvation ? . But thanks be to God , it -isaia- just this flame of apostolic zeal which_-isaia- one of the brightest jewels in the crown of the Catholic priesthood . Our heart fills with fatherly consolation -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of Our Brothers and Our beloved Sons , Bishops and Priests , who like chosen troops ever prompt to the call of their chief hasten to all outposts of this vast field . There they engage in the peaceful but bitter warfare of truth against error , of light against darkness , of the Kingdom of God against the kingdom of Satan . But , by its_very nature as an active and courageous company , the Catholic priesthood must_have the spirit of discipline , or , to use a more_deeply Christian word , obedience . It -isaia- obedience which binds together all ranks into the harmony of the Church s Hierarchy . The Bishop , in his admonition to the ordinands , says : '' With certain wonderful variety Holy Church -isaia- clothed , made comely and -isaia- ruled ; since in her some are consecrated Pontiffs , and other priests of lesser degree , and from many members of differing dignity there_-isaia- formed one Body of Christ . '' This obedience priests promised to the Bishop after Ordination , the holy oil still fresh on their hands . On the day of his consecration the Bishop , in his turn , swore obedience to the supreme visible Head of the Church , the successor of St . Peter , the Vicar of Jesus Christ . Let then obedience bind ever closer together these various members of the Hierarchy , one_with another , and all with the Head ; and thus make_the Church Militant a foe truly terrible to the enemies of God , ut castrorum aciem ordinatam , '' as an army set in array . '' Let obedience temper excessive zeal on the one_hand , and put the spur to weakness and slackness on the other . Let it assign to each his place and station . These each should accept without resistance ; for otherwise the magnificent work of the Church in the world would be sadly hindered . Let each_one see in the arrangement of his hierarchical Superiors the arrangements of the only true Head , whom all obey : Jesus Christ , Our Lord , who became for us '' obedient unto death , even to the death of the cross . The divine High Priest wished us to have abundant witness to His own most perfect obedience to the Eternal Father ; for this_reason both the Prophecies and the Gospels often testify to the entire submission of the Son of God to the will of the Father . '' When He cometh into_the_world He saith ; sacrifice and oblation Thou wouldst not : but a body Thou has fitted to Me . Then said I : Behold I come . In the head of the book it -isaia- written of Me that I should do Thy will , O God . '' '' My meat -isaia- to do the will of Him that sent Me . '' On His very cross He consecrated obedience . He did_not wish to commit His soul into the hands of His Father before having declared that all was fulfilled in Him that the Sacred Scriptures had foretold ; He had accomplished the entire charge entrusted to Him by the Father , even to the last deeply mysterious '' I thirst , '' which He pronounced '' that the Scripture might be fulfilled . '' By these_words He wished to show that zeal even the most ardent ought always to be completely subjected to the will of the Father ; that_our zeal should_always be controlled by obedience to those_who for us , have_the place of the Father , and convey to us His will , in other_words our lawful Superiors in the Hierarchy . But the portrait of the Catholic priest which we intend to exhibit to the world would be unfinished were We to omit another most important feature , learning . This the Church requires of him ; for the Catholic priest_-isaia- set up as a '' Master in Israel '' ; he has received_from Jesus Christ the office and commission of teaching truth : '' Teach . '' He must teach the truth_that heals and saves ; and because of this_teaching , like the Apostle of the Gentiles , he has a duty towards '' the learned and the unlearned . '' But how_can he teach unless he himself possess knowledge ? '' The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge , and they_shall seek the law -atti_degli_apostoli- his mouth , '' said the Holy Spirit in the Prophecy of Malachy . Who could ever utter a word in praise of sacerdotal learning more weighty than that_which divine Wisdom itself once spoke by the mouth of Osee : '' Because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will reject thee that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to Me . '' The priest should_have full grasp of the Catholic teaching on faith_and_morals ; he should know_how to present it to others ; and he should be able to give the reasons for the dogmas , laws and observances of the Church of which he -isaia- minister . Profane sciences have indeed made much progress ; but in religious questions there_-isaia- much ignorance still darkening the mind of our contemporaries . This ignorance the priest must dispel . Never was more pointed than today the warning of Tertullian , '' Hoc unum gestit interdum veritas , -neemia- ignorata damnetur , '' '' This alone truth sometime craves , that it be not condemned unheard . '' It -isaia- the priest s task to clear away from men s minds the mass of prejudices and misunderstandings which hostile adversaries have piled up ; the modern mind -isaia- eager for the truth , and the priest should be able to point it out with serene frankness ; there_are souls still hesitating , distressed by doubts , and the priest should inspire courage and trust , and guide them_with calm security to the safe port of faith , faith accepted by both head and heart ; error makes its onslaughts , arrogant and persistent , and the priest should know_how to meet them_with a defense vigorous and active , yet solid and unruffled . Therefore , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- necessary_that the priest , even among the absorbing tasks of his charge , and ever with_a_view to it , should continue his theological studies with unremitting zeal . The knowledge acquired -atti_degli_apostoli- the seminary -isaia- indeed a sufficient foundation with_which to begin ; but it must be grasped more thoroughly , and perfected by an ever_increasing knowledge and understanding of the sacred sciences . Herein -isaia-_the_source of effective preaching and of influence over the souls of others . Yet even_more -isaia- required . The dignity of the office he holds and the maintenance of a becoming respect and esteem among the people , which helps so much in his pastoral_work , demand more_than purely ecclesiastical learning . The priest must be graced by no less knowledge and culture than -isaia- usual among well bred and well educated people of his day . This -isaia- to say that he must be healthily modern , as -isaia- the Church , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- home in all times and all places , and adapts itself to all ; which blesses and furthers all healthy initiative and has no fear of the progress , even the most daring progress , of science ; if only it be true science . Indeed , in all ages the Catholic clergy has distinguished itself in every field of human knowledge ; in fact , in certain centuries it so took the lead in the field of learning that the word '' cleric '' became synonymous with '' learned . '' The Church preserved and saved the treasures of ancient culture , which without her and her monasteries would_have been almost entirely lost ; and her most illustrious Doctors show that all human knowledge can_help to throw light upon and to defend the Catholic faith . An illustrious example of this We Ourselves have recently called to the world s attention . For We crowned with the halo of sanctity and the glorious title of Doctor of the Church that great teacher of the incomparable Aquinas : Albert of Cologne , whom his contemporaries had_already honored with the titles of Great and of Universal Doctor . Today it could hardly be hoped that the clergy could hold a similar primacy in every branch of knowledge ; the range of human science has become so vast that no man can comprehend it all , much less become distinguished in each of its numberless branches . Nevertheless wise encouragement and help should be given to those members of the clergy , who , by taste and special gifts , feel a call to devote_themselves to study and research , in this or that branch of science , in this or that art ; they_do_not thereby deny their clerical profession ; for all this , undertaken within just limits and under_the_guidance of the Church , redounds to the good estate of the Church and to the glory of her_divine Head , Jesus Christ . And among the rest of the clergy , none should remain content with a standard of learning and culture which sufficed , perhaps , in other times ; they_must try to attain or , rather , they_must actually attain a higher standard of general education and of learning . It must be broader and more complete ; and it must correspond to the generally higher level and wider scope of modern education as compared with the past . Sometimes , it -isaia- true , and even in modern times , Our Lord makes_the world , as it were , His plaything ; for He has_been pleased to elect to the priestly state men almost devoid of that learning of which We have_been speaking ; and through them He has worked wonders . But He did this_that all might learn , if there be a choice , to prize holiness more_than learning ; not to place more trust in human than in divine means . He did this because the world has need , from time to time , to hear repeated that wholesome , practical lesson : '' The foolish things of the world hath God chosen to confound the wise . that no flesh should glory in His sight . In the natural order , divine miracles suspend for a moment the effect of physical laws , but do not revoke them . So , too , the case of these Saints , real living miracles in whom high sanctity made up for all the rest , does_not make_the lesson We have_been teaching any the less true or any the less necessary . It -isaia- clear , then_,_that virtue and learning are required , that_there_-isaia- need of example and of edification , need_for the priest to spread on all sides , and to all who draw near him '' the good odor of Christ . '' This need -isaia- today more keenly felt , and has become more evident and urgent . This -isaia- because of Catholic Action , that movement so consoling , which_has within it the power to spur on to the very highest ideals of perfection . Through Catholic Action the relations of the laity with priests_are becoming more frequent and more intimate . And in this collaboration , the laity quite naturally look upon the priest not merely as a guide , but as a model also of Christian life and of apostolic virtue . The state of the priesthood -isaia- thus most sublime , and the gifts it calls for very lofty . Hence , Venerable Brethren , the inescapable necessity of giving candidates_for the sanctuary a training correspondingly superior . Conscious of this necessity , the Church down the ages has shown for nothing a more tender solicitude and motherly care than for the training of her priests . She -isaia- not unaware that , as the religious and moral conditions of peoples depend in great measure upon their priests , so too , the future of the priest depends on the training he has_received . The words of the Holy Spirit apply no less truly to him than to others : '' A young_man according_to_his way , even_when he -isaia- old , he will_not depart from it . '' Hence , the Church , moved by the Holy Spirit , has willed that everywhere seminaries should be erected , where candidates_for_the_priesthood may be trained and educated with singular care . The seminary -isaia- and should be the apple of your eye , Venerable Brethren , who share_with Us the heavy weight of the government of the Church ; it -isaia- , and should be , the chief object of your solicitude . Careful above all should be the choice of superiors and professors ; and , in a most special manner , of the spiritual father , who_has so delicate and so important a part in the nurture of the priestly spirit . Give the best of your_clergy to your seminaries ; do not fear to take them_from other positions . These positions may seem of greater moment , but in reality their importance -isaia- not to be compared with_that of the seminaries , which_-isaia- capital and indispensable . Seek also from elsewhere , wherever you can_find them , men really fitted for_this noble task . Let them be such as teach priestly virtues , rather by example than by words , men_who are capable of imparting , together_with learning , a solid , manly and apostolic spirit . Make piety , purity , discipline and study flourish in the seminary . With prudent foresight , arm and fortify the immature minds of students both against the temptations of the present , and against the far more_serious perils of the future . For they_will be exposed to all the temptations of the world , in the midst of which_they must live , '' that_they save all . Now it -isaia- of great_importance , as We have_said , that priests should_have a learning adequate to the requirements of the age . For the attainment of this , in addition to a solid classical education , there_-isaia- required both instruction and training in scholastic philosophy '' according to the method , and the mind and the principles of St . Thomas Aquinas '' ad Angelicl Doctoris rationem , doctrinam et principia . This Our Illustrious Predecessor , Leo XIII , has called the philosophia perennis . It -isaia- essential to the future priest . It will_help him to a thorough understanding of dogma . It will effectively forearm him against modern errors of whatever sort . It will sharpen his mind to distinguish truth from falsehood . It will form him to habits of intellectual clearness , so necessary in any studies or problems of the future . It will_give him a great superiority over others , whose mere erudition , perhaps , -isaia- wider but who lack philosophical training . There are_some regions , where_the dioceses are small , or students unhappily few , or where there_-isaia- a shortage of means and suitable men . Hence it -isaia- impossible for_every diocese to have its_own seminary , equipped according to all the regulations of Canon Law and other prescriptions of the Church . Where this happens , it -isaia- most proper that the Bishops of the district should help one_another in brotherly charity , should concentrate and unite their forces in a common seminary , fully worthy of its high purpose . The great advantages of such concentration amply repay the sacrifices entailed in obtaining it . It -isaia- indeed a sacrifice , grievous to the fatherly heart of a Bishop , to see his clerics , even_for a time , taken away from their shepherd , who wishes himself to give his future co workers his_own apostolic spirit ; and to see them taken away from the diocese which_-isaia- to be the field of their_ministry . But these sacrifices will all be repaid with interest when these clerics return as priests . They will be better formed , and more richly endowed_with spiritual wealth , which_they will spend with_greater generosity and with_greater profit to their diocese . Therefore , We have_never let pass an opportunity to favor , and encourage and foster such efforts . Often , in fact , We have suggested and recommended them . On Our part , also , wherever We thought it necessary , We have Ourselves , as -isaia- well_known , erected or improved or enlarged several such regional seminaries , not_without heavy expense and trouble ; and We will_continue in the future , by the help of God , to apply Ourselves with all zeal to this_work ; for We hold it to be the most conducive to the good of the Church . This achievement in the erection and management of Seminaries for the education of future priests deserves all praise . But it would be of little avail , were there any lack of care in the selecting and approving of candidates . In this selection and approval , all who_are in charge of the clergy should_have some part : superiors , spiritual directors and confessors , each in the manner and within_the limits proper to his office . They must indeed foster and strengthen vocations with sedulous care ; but_with no less zeal they_must discourage unsuitable candidates , and in good time send them away from a path not meant for them . Such are all youths who show a lack of necessary fitness , and who_are , therefore , unlikely to persevere in the priestly_ministry both worthily and becomingly . In these_matters hesitation and delay -isaia- a serious mistake and may do serious harm . It -isaia- far better to dismiss an unfit student in the early stages ; but if , for_any reason , such dismissal has_been delayed , the mistake should be corrected as soon as it -isaia- known . There should be no human consideration or false mercy . Such false mercy would be a real cruelty , not_only towards_the Church , to whom would be given an unfitted or unworthy minister , but_also towards_the youth himself ; for , thus embarked upon a false course , he would find himself exposed to the risk of becoming a stumbling block to himself and to others with peril of eternal ruin . The Head of the seminary lovingly follows the youths entrusted to his care and studies the inclinations of each . His watchful and experienced eye will perceive , without difficulty , whether one or other have , or have_not , a true priestly vocation . This , as you well know , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- not established so much by some inner feeling or devout attraction , which_may sometimes be absent or hardly perceptible ; but_rather by a right intention in the aspirant together_with a combination of physical , intellectual and moral qualities which_make him fitted for_such a state of life . He must look to the priesthood solely from the noble motive of consecrating himself to the service of God and the salvation_of_souls ; he must likewise have , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least strive earnestly to acquire , solid piety , perfect purity of life and sufficient knowledge such as We have explained on a previous page . Thus he shows that_he_-isaia- called by God to the priestly state . Whoever , on the other_hand , urged on , perhaps , by ill advised parents , looks to this state as a means to temporal and earthly gains which he imagines and desires in the priesthood , as happened more often in the past ; whoever -isaia- intractable , unruly or undisciplined , has small taste for piety , -isaia- not industrious , and shows little zeal for souls ; whoever has a special tendency to sensuality , and after long trial has not proved he can conquer it ; whoever has no aptitude for study and who_will be unable to follow_the prescribed courses with due satisfaction ; all such cases show that_they_are not intended for the priesthood . By letting them go on almost to the threshold of the sanctuary , superiors only make it ever_more difficult for them to draw back ; and , perhaps , even cause them to accept ordination through human respect , without vocation and without_the priestly spirit . Let Superiors of seminaries , together_with_the spiritual directors and confessors , reflect how weighty a responsibility they assume before God , before the Church , and before the youths themselves , if they_do_not take all means -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal to avoid a false step . We declare too , that confessors and spiritual directors could also be responsible_for such a grave error ; and not indeed because_they can take any outward action , since that_-isaia- severely forbidden them by their most delicate office itself , and often also by the inviolable sacramental seal ; but because_they can have a great influence on the souls of the individual students , and with paternal firmness they_should guide each according_to_his spiritual needs . Should the superiors , for whatever reason , not take steps or show themselves weak , then especially should confessors and spiritual directors admonish the unsuited and unworthy , without_any regard to human consideration , of their obligation to retire while yet there_-isaia- time ; in this they_should keep to the most secure opinion , which in this case -isaia-_the_one most in favor of the penitent , for it saves him from a step which_could be for him eternally fatal . If somethimes they_should not see so clearly that an obligation -isaia- to be imposed , let_them , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , use all the authority which springs from their office and the paternal affection they_have for their_spiritual sons , and so induce those_who_have not the necessary fitness to retire of their_own free will . Let confessors remember the words of St . Alphonsus Liguori on a similar matter : '' In general . in such cases the more severity the confessor uses with_his penitents , the more will he help_them towards their salvation ; and on the contrary , the more cruel will he be the more he -isaia- benign . Thomas of Villanova called such over kind confessors : Impie pios '' wickedly kind '' ; '' such charity_-isaia- contrary to charity . The chief responsibility , however , rests with the Bishop , who according to the severe law of the Church '' should_not confer holy_orders on anyone , unless from positive signs he -isaia- morally certain of canonical fitness ; otherwise he not_only sins grievously , but_also places himself in danger of sharing in the sins of others . '' This canon -isaia- a clear echo of the warning of the Apostle to Timothy : '' Impose not hands lightly on any man , neither be partaker of other men s sins . '' '' To impose hands lightly , '' Our Predecessor St . Leo the Great expounds , '' -isaia- to confer the sacerdotal dignity on persons not sufficiently approved : before maturity in age , before merit of obedience , before a time of testing , before trail of knowledge ; and to be a partaker of other men s sins -isaia- for the ordainer to become as unworthy as the unworthy man whom he ordains '' ; for as St . John Chrysostom says , '' You who_have conferred the dignity upon him must_take the responsibility of both his past and his future sins . These are severe words , Venerable Brethren , yet still_more dreadful -isaia- the responsibility which_they declare , a responsibility which justified the great Bishop of Milan , St . Charles Borromeo in saying : '' In this_matter , my slightest neglect can involve me in very great sin . '' Listen to the warning of Chrysostom whom We have just quoted : '' Impose not hands after_the first trial nor after_the second , nor yet the third ; but_only after frequent and careful observation and searching examination '' ; a warning which applies in an especial way to the question of the uprightness of life in candidates to the priesthood : '' It -isaia-_not_enough , '' says the holy Bishop and Doctor St . Alphonsus de Liguori , '' that the Bishop know nothing evil of the ordinand , but he must_have positive evidence of his uprightness . '' Hence , do not fear to seem harsh if , in virtue of your rights and fulfilling your duty , you require such positive proofs of worthiness before ordination ; or if you defer an ordination in case of doubt ; because , as St . Gregory the Great eloquently teaches : place the weight of the building upon them -atti_degli_apostoli- once . Delay many days , until they_are dried and made fit for the purpose ; because if this precaution be omitted , very soon they_will break under the weight '' ; or , to use the short but clear expression of the Angelic Doctor : '' Holiness must come before holy_orders . hence_the burden of orders should be placed only on walls seasoned with sanctity , freed of the damp of sins . In short , let all canonic prescriptions be carefully obeyed , and let everyone put into_practice the wise rules on this_subject , which We caused to be promulgated a few years_ago by the Sacred Congregation of the Sacraments . Thus will the Church be saved much grief , and the faithful much scandal . We have_also had similar regulations sent to Religious ; and while We urge upon all concerned their faithful observance , We now recall them to the attention of all heads of religious institutes , who_have youths destined for the priesthood . They should consider as addressed also to them what We have recommended above concerning the formation of the clergy ; since_it_-isaia- they_who present their students for ordination , and the Bishop usually relies upon their judgment . Bishops and religious superiors should_not be deterred from this needful severity by fear of diminishing the number of priests for the diocese or institute . The Angelic Doctor St . Thomas long ago proposed this difficulty , and answers it with_his usual lucidity and wisdom : '' God never abandons His Church ; and so the number of priests will be always sufficient for the needs of the faithful , provided the worthy are advanced and the unworthy sent away . '' The same Doctor and Saint , basing himself upon the severe words quoted by the fourth Ecumenical Council of the Lateran , observes to Our purpose : '' Should it ever become impossible to maintain the present number , it -isaia- better to have a few good priests than a multitude of bad ones . '' It was in this sense_that We Ourselves , on the solemn occasion of the international pilgrimage of seminarists during the year of Our priestly jubilee , addressing an imposing group of Italian Archbishops and Bishops , reaffirmed that_one well trained priest_-isaia- worth more_than many trained badly or scarcely -atti_degli_apostoli- all . For such would be not merely unreliable but a likely source of sorrow to the Church . What a terrifying account , Venerable Brethren , We shall_have to give to the Prince of Shepherds , to the Supreme Bishop of souls , if we have handed over these souls to incompetent guides and incapable leaders . Yet although it remains unquestionably true_that mere numbers should_not be the chief concern of those engaged in the education of the clergy , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , all should do their utmost to increase the ranks of strong and zealous workers in the vineyard of the Lord ; the more so , as the moral needs of society are growing greater instead of less . Of all the means to this noble end , the easiest and the most effective -isaia- prayer . This -isaia- , moreover , a means within_the power of everyone . It should be assiduously used by all , as it was enjoined by Jesus Christ Himself : '' The harvest , indeed , -isaia- great but the laborers are few . Pray ye , therefore , the Lord of the harvest , that He send forth laborers into His harvest . '' What prayer could be more acceptable to the Sacred Heart of our Savior ? What prayer_-isaia- more likely to be answered as promptly and bounteously as this , which meets so nearly the burning desire of that Divine Heart ? '' '' Ask therefore , and it will be given unto you '' ; ask for good and holy priests and Our Lord will_not refuse to send them to His Church , as ever He has done throughout_the centuries . It has_been , in fact , precisely in times which seemed least propitious , that the number of priestly vocations increased . This -isaia- clear from Catholic hagiography of the nineteenth century a century rich in splendid names on the rolls both of secular and regular clergy . One has only to think of those three splendid saints whom We Ourselves had the consolation of canonizing St . John Mary Vianney , St . Joseph Benedict Cottolengo and St . John Bosco , men of truly lofty holiness , each in his special_way . Now God Himself liberally sows in the generous hearts of many_young men this precious seed of vocation ; but human means of cultivating this seed must_not be neglected . There are innumerable ways and countless holy means suggested by the Holy Spirit ; and all such salutary works which strive to preserve , promote and help priestly vocations , We praise and bless with all Our heart . '' No matter how we seek , '' says the lovable Saint of charity , Vincent de Paul , '' we shall always discover ourselves unable to contribute to anything more great than to the making of good priests . '' In truth nothing_-isaia- more acceptable to God , of more honor to the church , and more profitable to souls than the precious gift of a holy priest . If he who offers even a cup of water to one of the least of the disciples of Christ '' shall_not lose his reward , '' what reward will he receive who places , so to speak , into the pure hands of a young priest the sacred chalice , in which_-isaia- contained the Blood of Redemption ; who helps him to lift it up to heaven , a pledge of peace and of blessing for mankind ? . And here Our thoughts turn gladly to that Catholic Action , so much desired and promoted and defended by Us . For by Catholic Action the laity share in the hierarchical apostolate of the Church , and hence it cannot neglect this vital problem of priestly vocations . Comfort has filled Our heart to see the associates of Catholic Action everywhere distinguishing themselves in all fields of Christian activity , but especially in this . Certainly the richest reward of such activity -isaia- that really wonderful number of priestly and religious vocations which continue to flourish in their organizations for the young . This shows_that these organizations are both a fruitful ground of virtue , and also a well guarded and well cultivated nursery , where_the most beautiful and delicate flowers may develop without danger . May all members of Catholic Action feel the honor which thus falls on their association . Let them be persuaded that , in no better way than by this_work for an increase in the ranks of the secular and regular clergy , can the Catholic laity really participate in the high dignity of the '' kingly priesthood '' which_the Prince of the Apostles attributes to the whole_body of the redeemed . But the first and most natural place_where the flowers of the sanctuary should almost spontaneously grow and bloom , remains always the truly and deeply Christian family . Most of the saintly bishops and priests whose '' praise the Church declares , '' owe the beginning of their_vocation and their holiness to example and teaching of a father strong in faith and manly virtues , of a pure and devoted mother , and of a family in which_the love of God and neighbor , joined with simplicity of life , has reigned supreme . To this ordinary rule of divine Providence exceptions are rare and only serve to prove the rule . In an ideal home the parents , like Tobias and Sara , beg of God a numerous posterity '' in which Thy name may be blessed forever , '' and receive it as a gift from heaven and a precious trust ; they strive to instill into their_children from their early years a holy fear of God , and true Christian piety ; they foster a tender devotion to Jesus , the Blessed Sacrament and the Immaculate Virgin ; they teach respect and veneration for holy places and persons . In such a home the children see in their_parents a model of an upright , industrious and pious life ; they see their_parents holily loving each_other in Our Lord , see them approach the Holy Sacraments frequently and not_only obey the laws of the Church concerning abstinence and fasting , but_also observe the spirit of voluntary Christian mortification ; they see them pray -atti_degli_apostoli- home , gathering around them all the family , that common prayer may rise more acceptably to heaven ; they find them compassionate towards_the distress of others and see them divide with the poor the much or the little they possess . In such a home it -isaia- scarcely possible that , while all seek to copy their_parents , example , none of the sons should listen to and accept the invitation of the Divine Master : '' Come ye after Me , and I will_make you to be fishers of men . '' Blessed are_those Christian parents who are_able to accept without fear the vocations of their sons , and see in them a signal honor for their family and a mark of the special love and providence of Our Lord . Still more blessed , if , as was often the case in ages of greater faith , they_make such divine visitations the object of their earnest prayer . Yet it must be confessed with sadness that_only too_often parents seem to be unable to resign themselves to the priestly or religious vocations of their_children . Such parents have no scruple in opposing the divine call with objections of all kinds ; they even have_recourse to means which_can imperil not_only the vocation to a more_perfect state , but_also the very conscience and the eternal_salvation of those souls they ought to hold so dear . This happens all too_often in the case even of parents who glory in being sincerely Christian and Catholic , especially in the higher and more cultured classes . This -isaia- a deplorable abuse , like that unfortunately prevalent in centuries past , of forcing children into the ecclesiastical career without_the fitness of a vocation . It hardly does honor to those higher classes of society , which_are on the whole so scantily represented in the ranks of the clergy . The lack of vocations in families of the middle and upper classes may be partly explained by the dissipations of modern life , the seductions , which especially in the larger cities , prematurely awaken the passions of youth ; the schools in many places which scarcely conduce to the development of vocations . Nevertheless , it must be admitted that_such a scarcity reveals a deplorable falling off of faith in the families themselves . Did they indeed look -atti_degli_apostoli- things in the light_of_faith , what greater dignity could Christian parents desire_for their sons , what ministry more noble , than that_which , as We have_said , -isaia- worthy of the veneration of men and angels ? A long and sad experience has shown that a vocation betrayed the word_-isaia- not to be thought too strong -isaia- a source of tears not_only_for the sons but_also_for the ill advised parents ; and God grant that_such tears be not so long delayed as to become eternal tears . And now , finally , to you , dear Children . Priests of the Most High , both secular and regular , the world over , We address Our words . You are '' Our glory and joy , '' you , who with_such generosity bear the '' burden of the day and the heats , '' you , who so powerfully help Us and Our Brethren of the Episcopate in fulfilling the duty of feeding the flock of Christ . To you We send Our Paternal thanks and Our warmest encouragement . We know and fully appreciate your admirable zeal ; and to it , in the needs of the present , We make_this heartfelt appeal . These needs are becoming daily graver . All the more must your redeeming work grow and intensify ; for '' you_are the salt of the earth , and the light_of_the_world . If , however , your work_-isaia- to be blessed by God and produce abundant fruit , it must be rooted in holiness of life . Sanctity , as We said above , -isaia- the chief and most important endowment of the Catholic priest . Without it other gifts will_not go far ; with it , even supposing other gifts be meager , the priest can work marvels . We have_the example of St . Joseph of Cupertino , and in times nearer to our_own of that humble Cure d Ars , St . John Mary Vianney , of whom We have_already spoken ; whom We have willed to set up before all parish priests as their model and heavenly Patron . Therefore with the Apostle of the Gentiles , We say to you : '' Behold your vocation '' ; and beholding it , you cannot_fail to value ever_more highly the grace given to you in ordination and to strive to '' walk worthily of the vocation in which_you are_called . In this striving you will be most wonderfully helped by a practice commended by Our Predecessor of holy memory Pius X . This commendation -isaia- contained in that '' Exhortation to the Catholic Clergy , '' which he wrote with_such unction and affection . This We warmly recommend you to read . In it , among all the means to preserve and increase the grace of the priesthood , he placed first the use of the Spiritual Exercises . This means We Ourselves have_also frequently recommended ; and particularly in Our Encyclical Letter Mens Nostra , We have paternally and solemnly urged it upon all Our sons , but more especially upon Our Priests . As the year of Our priestly Jubilee drew to a close , We could find no better and more salutary reminder of that happy anniversary , than to give to Our sons an invitation , through the above mentioned letter , to draw more copiously from the waters of life springing up into life everlasting , this inexhaustible fountain providentially opened by God to His Church . Again now , to you , Our Dear Brethren , who_are all the closer to us because you work more directly with Us to establish the kingdom of Christ upon earth , We believe We cannot give better proof of Our Fatherly affection than by exhorting you most fervently to make_use of this_means of sanctification , to the best of your abilities . Take for your guide those principles and norms laid_down by Us in the above mentioned Encyclical . It -isaia-_not_enough to withdraw to the sacred seclusion of the Spiritual Exercises only -atti_degli_apostoli- the intervals and in the exact measure prescribed by ecclesiastical law but you_should enter_into retreat more often and for longer periods , as far_as_possible to you , and you_should consecrate , in addition , a day of each month to more fervent prayer and greater recollection , according to the practice of priests of great zeal . In such retreats and recollection even one_who may_have entered in sortem Domini , not by the straight way of a true vocation , but_for earthly or less noble motives , will_be_able to '' stir up the grace of God . '' For he , too , -isaia-_now indissolubly bound to God and the Church , and so nothing remains for him but to follow_the advice of St . Bernard : '' If sanctity of life did_not precede , let it -atti_degli_apostoli- least follow . for the future make good your ways and ambitions and make holy your ministry . '' The grace of God , and specifically that grace proper to the sacrament of Holy Orders , will not_fail to lend aid , if he sincerely wishes to correct whatever was originally amiss in his purpose or conduct . However it may_have come about_that he undertook the obligations of the priesthood , the abiding grace of this_divine sacrament will_not be wanting in power to enable him to fulfill them . Each and all of you , then , from the recollection and prayer of a retreat will come out fortified against the snares of the world , quickened by lively zeal for the salvation_of_souls , and enkindled with the love of God , as befits priests in times like the present . For together_with so much corruption and diabolical malice , there_-isaia- everywhere felt a powerful religious and spiritual awakening , a breath of the Holy Spirit , sent forth over the world to sanctify it , and to renew with its creative force the face of the earth . Filled with the Holy Ghost you will communicate this_love of God like a holy fire to all who approach you , becoming in a true sense bearers of Christ in a disordered society , which_can hope_for salvation from Jesus Christ alone , since He , and He alone , -isaia- ever '' the true Savior of the world . Before concluding , we turn Our thoughts and Our words , with very_special tenderness to you_who are_still in your studies for the priesthood ; and urge you from the depth of Our heart to prepare yourselves with all seriousness for the great task to which God calls you . You are the hope of the Church and of the people , who look for so much , or rather everything , to you . For to you they look for that living and life_giving knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ , in which_-isaia- eternal_life . In piety , purity , humility , obedience , discipline and study strive then to make yourselves priests after_the Heart of God . We assure you that in the task of fitting yourselves for the priesthood by solid virtue and learning , no care , no diligence , no energy can be too great ; because upon it so largely depend all your future apostolic labors . See to it that on the day of your ordination to the priesthood , the Church find you in fact such as she wishes you to be , that_-isaia- '' replenished with heavenly wisdom , irreproachable in life and established in the ways of grace , '' so that '' the sweet odor of your life may be a delight to the Church of Christ , that both by word and good example you_may build the house , that_-isaia- , the family of God . Only thus can you continue the glorious traditions of the Catholic priesthood and hasten that_most auspicious hour when it will be given to all humanity to enjoy_the fruits of the peace of Christ in the kingdom of Christ . And before concluding Our letter , to you , Venerable Brethren in the Episcopate , and through you to all Our beloved_sons of both clergy , We are happy to add a solemn proof of Our gratitude for the holy cooperation by which , under your guidance and example , this Holy Year of Redemption has been_made so fruitful to souls . We wish to perpetuate the memory and the glory of that Priesthood , of which Ours and yours , Venerable Brethren , and that of all priests of Christ , -isaia- but a participation and continuation . We have thought it opportune , after consulting the Sacred Congregation of Rites , to prepare a special votive Mass , for Thursdays , according to liturgical rules : De summo et aeterno Iesu Christi Sacerdotio , to honor '' Jesus Christ , Supreme and Eternal Priest . '' It -isaia- Our pleasure and consolation to publish this Mass together_with this , Our Encyclical Letter . There only remains for Us , Venerable Brethren , to impart to all the Apostolic and paternal Benediction , which all expect and desire from their common Father . May it be a blessing of thanksgiving for all the benefits poured out by Divine Providence in these extraordinary Holy Years of the Redemption ; may it be a blessing of good augury for the new year which_-isaia- about to begin . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , the twentieth day of December , , in the fifty sixth anniversary of Our priesthood , the fourteenth of Our Pontificate .

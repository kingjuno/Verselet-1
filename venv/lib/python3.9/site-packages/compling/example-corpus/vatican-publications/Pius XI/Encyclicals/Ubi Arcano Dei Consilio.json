From the very hour when in the inscrutable designs of God , We though unworthy , were elevated to this Chair of Truth and Love , We earnestly desired to address a heartfelt message to you , Venerable Brothers , and to all Our beloved_children who_are under your immediate direction and care . This Our desire found its inspiration in the solemn benediction Urbi et Orbi which We gave to an immense multitude from the balcony of the Vatican Basilica following Our election to the Supreme Pontificate . This blessing of Ours was received with every manifestation of joy and gratitude by you , by people from every part_of_the_world , and by the Sacred College of Cardinals . This fact was for Us a most comforting assurance , added to that other which_comes_from Our trust in the divine assistance , in preparing Us to take up the tremendous office which quite unexpectedly We have been_called upon to assume . We , therefore , write to you now , '' our mouth -isaia- open to you '' II Cor . vi , as the birthday of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the New Year approach , and wish this_letter to be not_only a message of glad greetings but a Christmas gift as well from a father to his loving children . Many reasons prevented Us up to this_time from fulfilling Our wish to write . In the first_place , there_was what one might call a contest of filial devotion by reason of which_there came to us in letters without number the good wishes of Our brothers and children from every quarter of the globe , messages which bespoke a welcome to the newly elected Successor of St . Peter and offered him the well wishes born of a devoted homage . Following close upon these messages We were called_upon to experience personally and for the first time what St . Paul has called '' my daily instance , the solicitude for all the churches . xi , To Our everyday duties there_were added many extraordinary ones , as for example , those most important affairs already well advanced towards a solution before Our election and which We had to rush to completion , which_had to do with the Holy Places , which affected the welfare of Christianity itself , or the status of dioceses numbered among the most important of the Catholic world . Then there_were to be considered international meetings and treaties which deeply influenced the future of whole peoples and of nations . Faithful to the ministry of peace and reconciliation which_has_been confided to Our care by God , We strove to make known far and wide the law of justice , tempered always by charity , and to obtain merited consideration for those values and interests which , because_they_are spiritual , are none the less grave and important . As a matter of fact , they_are much more_serious and important than_any merely material thing whatsoever . We were occupied , too , with the almost unbelievable sufferings of those peoples , living in districts far remote from Us , who had_been stricken with famine and every_kind of calamity . We hastened to send them all the help which Our own straitened circumstances permitted , and did not_fail to call_upon the whole_world to assist Us in this_task . Finally , there did_not escape Us those uprisings accompanied by acts of violence which_had broken out in the very midst of Our own beloved people , here where We were born , here where_the hand of Divine Providence has set down the Chair of St . For a time these troubles seemed to threaten the very future of Our country , nor could We rest until We had done everything within Our power to quiet such serious disorders . There were , on the other_hand , certain extraordinary events which filled Our soul with_joy . Such were , for example , the Twenty Sixth International Eucharistic Congress and the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the establishment of the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith . These celebrations brought to Us such inexpressible consolation and such_great spiritual joy that We never imagined such a thing possible -atti_degli_apostoli- the very outset of Our Pontificate . We also saw -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time practically all the members of the hundreds of bishops_who had come to Rome from every part_of_the_world . Under normal circumstances it would have_taken several years to interview a like number of bishops . We gave audience also to many thousands of the faithful and blessed with Our fatherly blessing large and dignified representations of that immense family '' from every tribe , tongue , people , and nation '' as we read in the Book of the Apocalypse , v , which God has confided to Us . Together with_them We were privileged to assist -atti_degli_apostoli- spectacles which_were little short of divine , for We witnessed Our Blessed Redeemer reassume His rightful place as King of all men , of all states , and of all nations when , though hidden behind the veils of the Eucharistic species , He was carried in a magnificent and truly royal triumph of faith through the streets of Our own city , Rome , accompanied by an immense concourse of people representing every nation on earth . We beheld , too , the Holy Spirit , as it were , descend into the hearts of both priests and faithful as He did on the first Pentecost Sunday , to rekindle in them the spirit of prayer and of the apostolate . We were overjoyed to behold the fervent faith of the inhabitants of Rome proclaimed once_again to the world , to the great glory of God and to the edification of souls . The Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God and Our own dear Mother , who_had most lovingly looked down on us -atti_degli_apostoli- the Sanctuaries of Czestochowa and of Ostrabrama as well as -atti_degli_apostoli- the miraculous grotto of Lourdes and from the lofty spires of Our own city of Milan , to say nothing of that most_holy Sanctuary of the Rho , deigned to accept the homage of Our love on the occasion when We gave back to the Venerable Basilica of Loreto , which_had_been restored after_the serious damage caused to it by fire , her beautiful statue which_had_been not_only done over -atti_degli_apostoli- Our behest but had_been blessed and crowned as well by Our own hands . That occasion was without question a veritable triumph for Mary . During the passage of her statue from Rome to Loreto , the faithful of each town rivaled one_another in acclaiming her by a spontaneous and continuous outburst of profoundly religious sentiment , which showed forth a most tender affection for Our Blessed Lady , as well as a devoted attachment to the Vicar of Jesus Christ . These different events , some sad and some joyful , the history of which We wish to record for the edification of posterity , spoke most eloquently to Us , making more_and_more clear to Our mind those objectives which seem to claim the foremost place in Our Apostolic Ministry and of which it behooves Us to speak now in as solemn a manner as possible in this , Our very first message to you . One thing -isaia- certain today . Since the close of the Great War individuals , the different classes of society , the nations of the earth have_not as yet found true peace . They do not enjoy , therefore_,_that active and fruitful tranquillity which_-isaia- the aspiration and the need of mankind . This -isaia- a sad truth_which forces itself upon us from every side . For anyone_who , as We do , desires profoundly to study and successfully to apply the means necessary to overcome such evils , it -isaia- all important_that he recognize both the fact and the gravity of this state of affairs and attempt beforehand to discover its causes . This duty -isaia- imposed upon Us in commanding fashion by the very consciousness which We have of Our Apostolic Office . We cannot_but resolve to fulfill that_which_-isaia- so clearly Our duty . This We shall do now by this Our first encyclical , and afterward with all solicitude in the course of Our sacred_ministry . Since the selfsame sad conditions continue to exist in the world today which_were the object of constant and almost heartbreaking preoccupation on the part of Our respected Predecessor , Benedict XV , during the whole period of his pontificate , naturally We have come to make his thoughts and his solutions of these problems Our own . May they become , too , the thoughts and ideals of everyone , as they_are Our thoughts , and if this should happen we would certainly see , with the help of God and the co operation of all men_of_good will , the most wonderful effects come to pass by a true and lasting reconciliation of men one_with another . The inspired words of the Prophets seem to have_been written expressly for our_own times : '' We looked for peace and no good came : for a time of healing , and behold fear , '' Jer . viii , '' for the time of healing , and behold trouble . xiv , '' We looked for light , and behold darkness . we have looked for judgment , and there_-isaia- none : for salvation , and it -isaia- far from us . The belligerents of yesterday have laid_down their arms but on the heels of this act we encounter new horrors and new threats of war in the Near East . The conditions in many sections of these devastated regions have_been greatly aggravated by famine , epidemics , and the laying waste of the land , all of which_have not failed to take their toll of victims without number , especially among the aged , women and innocent children . In what_has_been so justly called the immense theater of the World War , the old rivalries between nations have_not ceased to exert their influence , rivalries -atti_degli_apostoli- times hidden under the manipulations of politics or concealed beneath the fluctuations of finance , but openly appearing in the press , in reviews and magazines of every type , and even penetrating into institutions devoted to the cultivation of the arts and sciences , spots where otherwise the atmosphere of quiet and peace would reign supreme . Public life_-isaia- so enveloped , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the present hour , by the dense fog of mutual hatreds and grievances that_it_-isaia- almost impossible for the common people so much as freely to breathe therein . If the defeated nations continue to suffer most terribly , no less serious are the evils which afflict their conquerors . Small nations complain that_they_are being oppressed and exploited by great nations . The great powers , on their side , contend that_they_are being judged wrongly and circumvented by the smaller . All nations , great and small , suffer acutely from the sad effects of the late War . Neither can those nations which_were neutral contend that_they_have escaped altogether the tremendous sufferings of the War or failed to experience its evil results almost equally with the actual belligerents . These evil results grow in volume from day to day because of the utter impossibility of finding anything like a safe remedy to cure the ills of society , and this in spite of all the efforts of politicians and statesmen whose work has come to naught if it has not unfortunately tended to aggravate the very evils they tried to overcome . Conditions have_become increasingly worse because the fears of the people_are being constantly played upon by the ever present menace of new wars , likely to be more frightful and destructive than_any which_have preceded them . Whence it -isaia- that the nations of today live in a state of armed peace which_-isaia- scarcely better_than war itself , a condition which tends to exhaust national finances , to waste the flower of youth , to muddy and poison the very fountainheads of life , physical , intellectual , religious , and moral . A much more_serious and lamentable evil than these threats of external aggression -isaia- the internal discord which menaces the welfare not_only of nations but of human_society itself . In the first_place , we must_take cognizance of the war between_the classes , a chronic and mortal disease of present_day society , which like a cancer -isaia- eating away the vital forces of the social fabric , labor , industry , the arts , commerce , agriculture everything in fact which contributes to public_and_private welfare and to national prosperity . This conflict seems to resist every solution and grows worse because those_who_are never satisfied with the amount of their wealth contend with_those_who hold on most tenaciously to the riches which_they_have already acquired , while to both classes there_-isaia- common the desire to rule_the other and to assume control of the other s possessions . From this class war there result frequent interruptions of work , the causes for_which most often can be laid to mutual provocations . There result , too , revolutions , riots , and forcible repression of one side or other by the government , all of which_cannot but end in general discontent and in grave damage to the common welfare . To these evils we must add the contests between political parties , many of which struggles do not originate in a real difference of opinion concerning the public good or in a laudable and disinterested search_for what would best promote the common welfare , but in the desire_for power and for the protection of some private interest which inevitably result in injury to the citizens as a whole . From this course there often arise robberies of what belongs rightly to the people , and even conspiracies against and attacks on the supreme_authority of the state , as well as on its representatives . These political struggles also beget threats of popular action and , -atti_degli_apostoli- times , eventuate in open rebellion and other disorders which_are all the more deplorable and harmful since_they come from a public to whom it has_been_given , in our modern democratic states , to participate in very large measure in public_life and in the affairs of government . Now , these different_forms of government are_not of themselves contrary to the principles of the Catholic Faith , which_can easily be reconciled with any reasonable and just system of government . Such governments , however , are the most exposed to the danger of being overthrown by one faction or another . It -isaia- most sad to see_how this revolutionary spirit_has penetrated into that sanctuary of peace and love , the family , the original nucleus of human_society . In the family these evil seeds of dissension , which_were sown long ago , have recently been spread about more_and_more by the fact of the absence of fathers and sons from the family fireside during the War and by the greatly increased freedom in matters of morality which followed on it as one of its effects . Frequently we behold sons alienated from their fathers , brothers quarreling with brothers , masters with servants , servants with masters . Too often likewise have we seen both the sanctity of the marriage tie and the duties to God and to humankind , which_this tie imposes upon men , forgotten . Just as the smallest part of the body feels the effect of an illness which_-isaia- ravaging the whole_body or one of its vital organs , so the evils now besetting society and the family afflict even individuals . In particular , We cannot_but lament the morbid restlessness which_has spread among people of every_age and condition in life , the general spirit of insubordination and the refusal to live up to one s obligations which_has become so widespread as almost to appear the customary mode of living . We lament , too , the destruction of purity among women and young girls as -isaia- evidenced by the increasing immodesty of their dress and conversation and by their participation in shameful dances , which sins are made the more heinous by the vaunting in the faces of people less fortunate than themselves their luxurious mode of life . Finally , We cannot_but grieve over the great increase in the number of what might be called social misfits who almost inevitably end by joining the ranks of those malcontents who continually agitate against all order , be it public or private . It -isaia- surprising , then , that_we_should no longer possess that security of life in which we can place our trust and that_there remains only the most terrible uncertainty , and from hour to hour added fears for the future ? Instead of regular daily work there_-isaia- idleness and unemployment . That blessed tranquillity which_-isaia- the effect of an orderly existence and in which_the essence of peace_-isaia- to be found no longer exists , and , in its place , the restless spirit of revolt reigns . As a consequence industry suffers , commerce -isaia- crippled , the cultivation of literature and the arts becomes more_and_more difficult , and what_-isaia- worse than all , Christian civilization itself_-isaia- irreparably damaged thereby . In the face of our much praised progress , we behold with sorrow society lapsing back slowly but surely into a state of barbarism . We wish to record , in addition to the evils already mentioned , other evils which beset society and which occupy a place of prime importance but whose very existence escapes the ordinary observer , the sensual man he who , as the Apostle says , does_not perceive '' the things_that_are of the Spirit of God '' I Cor . ii , , yet which_cannot but be judged the greatest and most destructive scourges of the social_order of today . We refer specifically to those evils which transcend the material or natural sphere and lie within_the supernatural and religious order properly so called ; in other_words , those evils which affect the spiritual_life of souls . These evils are all the more to be deplored since_they injure souls whose value -isaia- infinitely greater_than that of any merely material object . Over and above the laxity in the performance of Christian duties which_-isaia- so widespread , We cannot_but sorrow with you , Venerable Brothers , over the fact_that very many churches , which during the War had_been turned to profane uses , have_not yet been restored to their original purpose as temples of prayer and of divine_worship ; moreover , that_many seminaries whose existence -isaia- vital for the preparation and formation of worthy leaders and teachers of the religious_life have_not yet been reopened ; that the ranks of the clergy in almost every country have_been decimated , either because so many priests have died on the battlefield in the exercise of their sacred_ministry or have_been lost to the Church because_they proved faithless to their holy vocation , due to the unfavorable conditions under which_they were compelled to live for so long ; and , finally , that in many places even the preaching of the Word of God , so necessary and so fruitful for '' the edifying of the body of Christ '' Ephesians iv , has_been silenced . The evil results of the Great War , as they affect the spiritual_life , have_been felt all over the world , even in out of the way and lonely sections of far off continents . Missionaries have_been forced to abandon the field of their apostolic labors , and many have_been unable to return to their_work , thus causing interruptions to and even abandonment of those glorious conquests of the Faith which_have done so much to raise the level of civilization , moral , material , and religious . It -isaia- quite true that_there have_been some worthwhile compensations for these great spiritual misfortunes . Among these compensations -isaia- one_which stands out in bold relief and gives the lie to many ancient calumnies , namely_,_that a pure love of country and a generous devotion to duty burn brightly in the souls of those consecrated to God , and that through_their sacred_ministry the consolations of religion were brought to thousands dying on the fields of battle wet with human blood . Thus , many , in spite of their prejudices , were led to honor again the priesthood and the Church by reason of the wonderful examples of sacrifice of self , with which_they had become acquainted . For these happy results we are indebted solely to the infinite goodness and wisdom of God , Who draws good from evil . Our letter so far has_been devoted to a recital of the evils which afflict present_day society . We must now search out , with all possible care , the causes of these disorders , some of which_have already_been referred to . At this_point , Venerable Brothers , there seems to come to Us the voice of the Divine Consoler and Physician Who , speaking of these human infirmities says : '' All these evil things come from within . Peace indeed was signed in solemn conclave between_the belligerents of the late War . This peace , however , was only written into treaties . It was_not received into the hearts of men , who still cherish the desire to fight one_another and to continue to menace in a most serious manner the quiet and stability of civil_society . Unfortunately the law of violence held sway so long that it has weakened and almost obliterated all traces of those natural feelings of love and mercy which_the law of Christian charity has done so much to encourage . Nor has this illusory peace , written only on paper , served as yet to reawaken similar noble sentiments in the souls of men . On the contrary , there_has been born a spirit of violence and of hatred which , because it has_been indulged in for so long , has become almost second nature in many men . There has followed the blind rule of the inferior parts of the soul over the superior , that rule of the lower elements '' fighting against the law of the mind , '' which St . Paul grieved over . Men today do not act as Christians , as brothers , but as strangers , and even enemies . The sense of man s personal_dignity and of the value of human_life has_been lost in the brutal domination begotten of might and mere superiority in numbers . Many are intent on exploiting their neighbors solely for the purpose of enjoying more_fully and on a larger scale the goods of this_world . But they err grievously who_have turned to the acquisition of material and temporal possessions and are forgetful of eternal and spiritual things , to the possession of which Jesus , Our Redeemer , by means of the Church , His living interpreter , calls mankind . It -isaia- in the very nature of material objects that an inordinate desire_for them becomes_the root of every evil , of every discord , and in particular , of a lowering of the moral sense . On the one_hand , things_which are naturally base and vile can_never give rise to noble aspirations in the human_heart which_was created by and for God alone and -isaia- restless until it finds repose in Him . On the other_hand , material goods and in this they differ greatly from those of the spirit_which the more of them we possess the more remain to be acquired the more they_are divided among_men the less each_one has and , by consequence , what one man_has another cannot possibly possess unless it be forcibly taken away from the first . Such being the case , worldly possessions can_never satisfy all in equal manner nor give rise to a spirit of universal contentment , but must become perforce a source of division among_men and of vexation of spirit , as even the Wise Man Solomon experienced : '' Vanity of vanities , and vexation of spirit . The same effects which result from_these evils among individuals may likewise be expected among nations . '' From whence are wars and contentions among_you ? '' asks the Apostle St . '' Are they not hence from your concupiscences , which war in your members ? '' James iv , , . The inordinate desire_for pleasure , concupiscence of the flesh , sows the fatal seeds of division not_only among families but likewise among states ; the inordinate desire_for possessions , concupiscence of the eyes , inevitably turns into class warfare and into social egotism ; the inordinate desire to rule or to domineer over others , pride of life , soon becomes mere party or factional rivalries , manifesting itself in constant displays of conflicting ambitions and ending in open rebellion , in the crime of lese majeste , and even in national parricide . These unsuppressed desires , this inordinate love of the things of the world , are precisely_the source of all international misunderstandings and rivalries , despite the fact_that oftentimes men dare to maintain that acts prompted by such motives are excusable and even justifiable because , forsooth , they_were performed for reasons of state or of the public good , or out of love for country . Patriotism the stimulus of so many virtues and of so many noble acts of heroism when kept within_the bounds of the law of Christ becomes merely an occasion , an added incentive to grave injustice when true love of country -isaia- debased to the condition of an extreme nationalism , when we forget_that all men_are our_brothers and members of the same great human_family , that other nations have an equal right with us both to life and to prosperity , that_it_-isaia- never lawful nor even wise , to dissociate morality from the affairs of practical life , that , in the last analysis , it -isaia- '' justice which exalteth a nation : but sin maketh nations miserable . Perhaps the advantages to one s family , city , or nation obtained in some such way as this may well appear to be a wonderful and great victory this thought has_been already expressed by St . Augustine , but in the end it turns out to be a very shallow thing , something rather to inspire us with the most fearful apprehensions of approaching ruin . '' It -isaia- a happiness which appears beautiful but_-isaia- brittle as glass . We must ever be on guard lest with horror we see it broken into a thousand pieces -atti_degli_apostoli- the first touch . Augustine de Civitate Dei , Book iv , Chap . There -isaia- over and above the absence of peace and the evils attendant on this absence , another deeper and more profound cause for present_day conditions . This cause was even beginning to show its head before the War and the terrible calamities consequent on that cataclysm should_have proven a remedy for them if mankind had only taken the trouble to understand_the real meaning of those terrible events . In the Holy Scriptures we read : '' They that_have forsaken the Lord , shall be consumed . '' Isaias i , No less well_known are the words of the Divine Teacher , Jesus Christ , Who said : '' Without me you can do nothing '' John xv , and again , '' He that gathereth not_with me , scattereth . These words of the Holy Bible have_been fulfilled and are_now -atti_degli_apostoli- this_very moment being fulfilled before our very eyes . Because men_have forsaken God and Jesus Christ , they_have sunk to the depths of evil . They waste their energies and consume their time and efforts in vain sterile attempts to find a remedy for these ills , but without even being successful in saving what little remains from the existing ruin . It was a quite general desire_that both our laws and our governments should exist without recognizing God or Jesus Christ , on the theory that all authority comes_from men , not from God . Because of such an assumption , these theorists fell very short of being able to bestow upon law not_only those sanctions which it must possess but also_that secure basis for the supreme criterion of justice which even a pagan philosopher like Cicero saw clearly could_not be derived except from the divine_law . Authority itself lost its hold upon mankind , for it had lost that sound and unquestionable justification for its right to command on the one_hand and to be obeyed on the other . Society , quite logically and inevitably , was shaken to its_very depths and even threatened with destruction , since there_was left to it no longer a stable foundation , everything having_been reduced to a series of conflicts , to the domination of the majority , or to the supremacy of special interests . Again , legislation was passed which did_not recognize_that either God or Jesus Christ had any rights over marriage an erroneous view which debased matrimony to the level of a mere civil contract , despite the fact_that Jesus Himself had called it a '' great sacrament '' Ephesians v , and had made it the holy and sanctifying symbol of that indissoluble union which binds Him to His Church . The high ideals and pure sentiments with_which_the Church has_always surrounded the idea of the family , the germ of all social_life , these were lowered , were unappreciated , or became confused in the minds of many . As a consequence , the correct ideals of family government , and with_them those of family peace , were destroyed ; the stability and unity of the family itself were menaced and undermined , and , worst of all , the very sanctuary of the home was more_and_more frequently profaned by acts of sinful lust and soul destroying egotism all of which_could not but result in poisoning and drying up the very sources of domestic and social_life . Added to all this , God and Jesus Christ , as well as His doctrines , were banished from the school . As a sad but inevitable consequence , the school became not_only secular and non religious but openly atheistical and anti religious . In such circumstances it was easy to persuade poor ignorant children that neither God nor religion are of any importance as far as their_daily lives are_concerned . God s name , moreover , was scarcely ever mentioned in such schools unless it were perchance to blaspheme Him or to ridicule His Church . Thus , the school forcibly deprived of the right to teach anything about God or His law could_not but fail in its efforts to really educate , that_-isaia- , to lead children to the practice of virtue , for the school lacked the fundamental principles_which underlie the possession of a knowledge of God and the means necessary to strengthen the will in its efforts toward good and in its avoidance of sin . Gone , too , was all possibility of ever laying a solid groundwork for peace , order , and prosperity , either in the family or in social relations . Thus the principles based on the spiritualistic philosophy of Christianity having_been obscured or destroyed in the minds of many , a triumphant materialism served to prepare mankind for the propaganda of anarchy and of social hatred which_was let loose on such a great scale . Is it to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- then that , with the widespread refusal to accept the principles of true Christian wisdom , the seeds of discord sown everywhere should find a kindly soil in which to grow and should come to fruit in that_most tremendous struggle , the Great War , which unfortunately did_not serve to lessen but increased , by its acts of violence and of bloodshed , the international and social animosities which already existed ? . Up to this We have analyzed briefly the causes of the ills which afflict present_day society , the recital of which however , Venerable Brothers , should_not cause us to lose hope of finding their appropriate remedy , since_the evils themselves seem to suggest a way out of these difficulties . First , and most important of all , for mankind -isaia- the need of spiritual peace . We do not need a peace that_will consist merely in acts of external or formal courtesy , but a peace which_will penetrate the souls of men and which_will unite , heal , and reopen their_hearts to that mutual affection which_-isaia- born of brotherly_love . The peace of Christ -isaia-_the_only peace answering this description : '' let_the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts . '' Colossians iii , Nor -isaia- there any_other peace possible than that_which Christ gave to His disciples John xiv , for since He -isaia- God , He '' beholdeth the heart '' I Kings xvi , and in our_hearts His kingdom -isaia- set up . Again , Jesus Christ -isaia- perfectly justified when He calls this peace of soul His own for He was_the first Who said to men , '' all you_are brethren . xxiii , He gave likewise to us , sealing it with His own_life s blood , the law of brotherly_love , of mutual forbearance '' This -isaia- my commandment , that_you love one_another , as I have loved you . '' John xv , '' Bear ye one_another s burdens ; and so you shall fulfill the law of Christ . From this it follows , as an immediate consequence , that the peace of Christ can_only be a peace of justice according to the words of the prophet '' the work of justice shall be peace '' Isaias xxxii , for he -isaia- God '' who judgest justice . '' Psalms ix , But peace does_not consist merely in a hard inflexible justice . It must be made acceptable and easy by being compounded almost equally of charity and a sincere desire_for reconciliation . Such peace was acquired for us and the whole_world by Jesus Christ , a peace which_the Apostle in a most expressive manner incarnates in the very person of Christ Himself when he addresses Him , '' He -isaia-_our peace , '' for it was He Who satisfied completely divine justice by his_death on the cross , destroying thus in His own flesh all enmities toward others and making peace and reconciliation with God possible_for mankind . Ephesians ii , Therefore , the Apostle beholds in the work of Redemption , which_-isaia- a work of justice -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time , a divine work of reconciliation and of love . '' God indeed was in Christ , reconciling the world to himself . '' II Corinthians v , '' God so loved the world , as to give his only_begotten Son . Thomas Aquinas , the Angel of the Schools , also discovered in this_fact the very formula and essence of our belief , for he writes that a true and lasting peace_-isaia- more a matter of love than of justice . The reason_for his statement -isaia- that_it_-isaia- the function of justice merely to do away with obstacles to peace , as for example , the injury done or the damage caused . Peace itself , however , -isaia- an act and results only from love . Of this peace of Christ , which dwells in our_hearts and -isaia- , in effect , the love of God , We can repeat what_the Apostle has said of the kingdom of God which also rules by love '' the kingdom of Christ -isaia- not meat and drink . '' Romans xiv , In other_words , the peace of Christ -isaia- not nourished on the things of earth , but on those of heaven . Nor could it well be otherwise , since_it_-isaia- Jesus Christ Who has revealed to the world_the existence of spiritual values and has obtained for them their due appreciation . He has said , '' For what doth it profit a man , if he gain the whole_world , and suffer the loss of his_own soul ? '' Matt . xvi , He also taught us a divine lesson of courage and constancy when He said , '' Fear ye not them that kill the body , and are_not able to kill the soul : but_rather fear him_that can destroy both soul and body in hell . This does_not_mean that the peace of Christ , which -isaia-_the_only true peace , exacts of us that we give up all worldly possessions . On the contrary , every earthly good -isaia- promised in so many words by Christ to those_who seek His peace : '' Seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his justice , and all these_things shall be added unto you . This peace of Christ , however , surpasses all human understanding '' the peace of God which surpasseth all understanding '' Philippians iv , , and for this_very reason dominates our sinful passions and renders such evils as division , strife , and discord , which result solely from the unrestrained desire_for earthly possessions , impossible . If the desire_for worldly possessions were kept within bounds and the place of honor in our affections given to the things of the spirit , which place undoubtedly they deserve , the peace of Christ would follow immediately , to which_would be joined in a natural and happy union , as it were , a higher regard_for the value and dignity of human_life . Human personality , too , would be raised to a higher level , for_man has_been ennobled by the Blood of Christ and made kin to God Himself by means of holiness and the bond of brotherly_love which unites us closely with Christ , by prayer and by the reception of the Sacraments , means infallibly certain to produce this elevation to and participation in the life of God , by the desire to attain everlasting possession of the glory and happiness of heaven which_-isaia- held out to all by God as our goal and final reward . We have_already seen and come to the conclusion that the principal cause of the confusion , restlessness , and dangers which_are so prominent a characteristic of false peace_-isaia- the weakening of the binding force of law and lack of respect_for authority , effects which logically follow upon denial of the truth_that authority comes_from God , the Creator and Universal Law giver . The only remedy for_such state of affairs -isaia- the peace of Christ since_the peace of Christ -isaia- the peace of God , which_could not_exist if it did_not enjoin respect_for law , order , and the rights of authority . In the Holy Scriptures We read : '' My children , keep discipline in peace . '' Ecclesiasticus xli , '' Much peace have they that_love the law , O Lord . '' Psalms cxviii , '' He that feareth the commandment , shall dwell in peace . '' Proverbs xiii , Jesus Christ very expressly states : '' Render to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s . xxii , He even recognized that Pilate possessed authority from on High John xiv , as he acknowledged that the scribes and Pharisees who though unworthy sat in the chair of Moses Matt . xxiii , were not_without a like authority . In Joseph and Mary , Jesus respected the natural authority of parents and was subject to them_for the greater part of His life . Luke ii , He also taught , by the voice of His Apostle , the same important doctrine : '' Let every soul be subject to higher powers : for there_-isaia- no power but_from God . If we stop to reflect for a moment that_these ideals and doctrines of Jesus Christ , for example , his teachings on the necessity and value of the spiritual_life , on the dignity and sanctity of human_life , on the duty of obedience , on the divine basis of human government , on the sacramental character of matrimony and by consequence the sanctity of family_life if we stop to reflect , let Us repeat , that_these ideals and doctrines of Christ which_are in fact but a portion of the treasury of truth_which He left to mankind were confided by Him to His Church and to her alone for safekeeping , and that He has promised that His aid will_never fail her -atti_degli_apostoli- any time for she_-isaia- the infallible teacher of His doctrines in every century and before all nations , there_-isaia- no one_who cannot clearly see what a singularly important role the Catholic Church -isaia- able to play , and -isaia- even called_upon to assume , in providing a remedy for the ills which afflict the world today and in leading mankind toward a universal peace . Because the Church -isaia- by divine institution the sole depository and interpreter of the ideals and teachings of Christ , she alone possesses in any complete and true sense the power effectively to combat that materialistic philosophy which has_already done and , still threatens , such tremendous harm to the home and to the state . The Church alone_can introduce into society and maintain therein the prestige of a true , sound spiritualism , the spiritualism of Christianity which both from the point_of_view of truth and of its practical value -isaia- quite superior to any exclusively philosophical theory . The Church -isaia- the teacher and an example of world good_will , for she_-isaia- able to inculcate and develop in mankind the '' true spirit of brotherly_love '' St . Augustine , De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae , i , and by raising the public estimation of the value and dignity of the individual s soul help thereby to lift us even unto God . Finally , the Church -isaia- able to set both public_and_private life on the road to righteousness by demanding that everything and all men become obedient to God '' Who beholdeth the heart , '' to His commands , to His laws , to His sanctions . If the teachings of the Church could only penetrate in some such manner as We have described the inner recesses of the consciences of mankind , be they rulers or be they subjects , all eventually would be so apprised of their_personal and civic duties and their mutual responsibilities that in a short time '' Christ would be all , and in all . Since the Church -isaia- the safe and sure guide to conscience , for to her safe keeping alone there_has been confided the doctrines and the promise of the assistance of Christ , she_-isaia- able not_only to bring_about -atti_degli_apostoli- the present hour a peace that_-isaia- truly the peace of Christ , but can , better_than any_other agency which We know of , contribute greatly to the securing of the same peace for the future , to the making impossible of war in the future . For the Church teaches she alone has_been_given by God the mandate and the right to teach with authority that not_only our acts as individuals but_also as groups and as nations must conform to the eternal law of God . In fact , it -isaia- much_more important_that the acts of a nation follow God s law , since on the nation rests a much greater responsibility_for the consequences of its acts than on the individual . When , therefore , governments and nations follow in all their activities , whether_they be national or international , the dictates of conscience grounded in the teachings , precepts , and example of Jesus Christ , and which_are binding on each and every_individual , then only can we have faith in one_another s word and trust in the peaceful solution of the difficulties and controversies which_may grow out of differences in point_of_view or from clash of interests . An attempt in this direction has_already and -isaia-_now being made ; its results , however , are almost negligible and , especially so , as far as they can_be_said to affect those major questions which divide seriously and serve to arouse nations one against the other . No merely human institution of today can be as successful in devising a set of international laws which_will be in harmony_with world conditions as the Middle Ages were in the possession of that true League of Nations , Christianity . It cannot be denied that in the Middle Ages this_law was often violated ; still it always existed as an ideal , according to which one might judge the acts of nations , and a beacon light calling those_who had lost their_way back to the safe road . There exists an institution able to safeguard the sanctity of the law of nations . This institution -isaia- a part of every nation ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- above all nations . She enjoys , too , the highest authority , the fullness of the teaching power of the Apostles . Such an institution -isaia- the Church of Christ . She alone_-isaia- adapted to do this_great work , for she -isaia-_not_only divinely commissioned to lead mankind , but moreover , because of her very make up and the constitution which_she possesses , by reason of her age old traditions and her great prestige , which_has not_been lessened but has_been greatly increased since_the close of the War , cannot_but succeed in such a venture where others assuredly will fail . It -isaia- apparent from_these considerations that true peace , the peace of Christ , -isaia- impossible unless we are willing and ready to accept the fundamental principles of Christianity , unless we are willing to observe the teachings and obey the law of Christ , both in public_and_private life . If this were done , then society being placed -atti_degli_apostoli- last on a sound foundation , the Church would be able , in the exercise of its divinely given ministry and by means of the teaching_authority which results therefrom , to protect all the rights of God over men and nations . It -isaia- possible to sum up all We have_said in one word , '' the Kingdom of Christ . '' For Jesus Christ reigns over the minds of individuals by His teachings , in their_hearts by His love , in each_one s life by the living according to His law and the imitating of His example . Jesus reigns over the family when it , modeled after_the holy ideals of the sacrament of matrimony instituted by Christ , maintains unspotted its true character of sanctuary . In such a sanctuary of love , parental authority_-isaia- fashioned after_the authority of God , the Father , from Whom , as a matter of fact , it originates and after which even it -isaia- named . Ephesians iii , The obedience of the children imitates that of the Divine Child of Nazareth , and the whole family life_-isaia- inspired by the sacred ideals of the Holy Family . Finally , Jesus Christ reigns over society when men recognize and reverence the sovereignty of Christ , when_they accept the divine origin and control over all social forces , a recognition which_-isaia- the basis of the right to command for those in authority and of the duty to obey for those_who_are subjects , a duty which_cannot but ennoble all who_live up to its demands . Christ reigns where_the position in society_which He Himself has assigned to His Church -isaia- recognized , for He bestowed on the Church the status and the constitution of a society_which , by reason of the perfect ends which_it_-isaia- called_upon to attain , must be held to be supreme in its_own sphere ; He also made her the depository and interpreter of His divine teachings , and , by consequence , the teacher and guide of every_other society whatsoever , not of course in the sense_that she should abstract in the least from their authority , each in its_own sphere supreme , but_that she should really perfect their authority , just as divine_grace perfects human_nature , and should give to them the assistance necessary_for men to attain their true final end , eternal happiness , and by that_very fact make_them the more deserving and certain promoters of their happiness here below . It -isaia- , therefore , a fact which_cannot be questioned that the true peace of Christ can_only exist in the Kingdom of Christ '' the peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ . '' It -isaia- no less unquestionable that , in doing all we can to bring_about the re establishment of Christ s kingdom , we will be working most effectively toward a lasting world peace . Pius X in taking as his motto '' To restore all things in Christ '' was inspired from on High to lay the foundations of that '' work of peace '' which became the program and principal task of Benedict XV . These two programs of Our Predecessors We desire to unite in one the re establishment of the Kingdom of Christ by peace in Christ '' the peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ . '' With might and main We shall ever strive to bring_about this peace , putting Our trust in God , Who when He called Us to the Chair of Peter , promised that the divine assistance would never fail Us . We ask that all assist and co operate with Us in this Our mission . Particularly We ask you to aid us , Venerable Brothers , you , His sheep , whom Our leader and Lord , Jesus Christ , has called to feed and to watch over as the most_precious portion of His flock , which comprises all mankind . For , it -isaia- you whom_the '' Holy Ghost hath placed to rule_the Church of God '' Acts xx , , you to whom above all , and principally , God '' hath given the ministry of reconciliation , and who for Christ therefore are ambassadors . v , , You participate in His teaching power and are '' the dispensers of the mysteries of God . iv , You have been_called by Him '' the salt of the earth , '' '' the light_of_the_world '' Matt . v , , , fathers and teachers of Christian peoples , '' a pattern of the flock from the heart '' I Peter v , , and '' you shall be called great in the kingdom_of_heaven . v , In fine , you_are the links of gold , as it were , by which '' the whole_body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church , -isaia- held compacted and fitly joined together '' Ephesians iv , , , built as it -isaia- on the solid rock of Peter . Of your praiseworthy industry , We have_had a quite recent proof on the occasion of the International Eucharistic Congress held in Rome and of the celebration of the Centenary of the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith , when several hundred bishops from all sections of the globe were reunited with Us before the tomb of the Holy Apostles . That brotherly reunion , so solemn , because of the great number and high dignity of the bishops_who were present , carried our_thoughts to the possibility of another similar meeting of the whole episcopate here in the center of Catholic unity , and of the many effective results which might follow such a meeting toward_the re establishment of the social_order after_the terrible disorders through_which we have just passed . The very proximity of the Holy Year fills Us with the solemn hope_that this Our desire may be fully realized . We scarcely dare to include , in so many words , in the program of Our Pontificate the reassembling of the Ecumenical Council which Pius IX , the Pontiff of Our youth , had called but had failed to see through except to the completion of a part , albeit most important , of its work . We as the leader of the chosen people must wait and pray_for an unmistakable sign from the God of mercy and of love of His holy will in this_regard . In the meantime , though We are quite conscious that_it_-isaia- not necessary_for Us to exhort you to greater and more zealous efforts but_rather to bestow on you the praise which_you so richly deserve , yet the very consciousness of Our Apostolic Office , of the fact_that We are the Common Father of all , constrains Us to beseech you to exhibit -atti_degli_apostoli- all times a very_special and tender love toward that large family of spiritual children which_-isaia- , in a very_special way , committed to your immediate supervision . From the reports received_from you by Us and by public fame , which_-isaia- amply confirmed in the press and in many_other ways , We know only too well what thanks we should , in union with you , render to the Good God for the great work_which , as the occasion permitted , He has done through you and through your predecessors , both_for your_clergy and for your faithful people , a work_which has come to maturity in our_own times and which We see being multiplied on all sides in a most fruitful manner . In particular , We refer to the numberless and diverse activities initiated for the education and development , as well as for the sanctification of both the clergy and laity , the organizations of clergy and laity formed to aid the missions in their manifold activities , both physical and moral , of the natural and the supernatural order , by the spreading far and wide of the Kingdom of Christ . We refer to the various organizations of young_people which_have helped to develop such ardent and true love for the Holy Eucharist and such tender devotion for the Blessed Virgin , virtues which_have made certain their_faith , their purity , and their union one_with another : to the solemn celebrations in honor of the Blessed Sacrament , -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Divine Prince of Peace -isaia- honored by truly royal triumphal processions , for about the Sacred Host , center of peace and love , gather multitudes from every country and the representatives of all peoples and nations , joined together in a union most wonderful by one_and_the_same faith , in adoration , in prayer , and in the enjoyment of all heavenly graces . The fruits of such piety are manifest , the widespread diffusion and great activity of the apostolate which , by prayer , word of mouth , by the religious press , by personal example , by works of charity seeks in every way possible to lead souls to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and to restore to the same Sacred Heart His sovereign rule over the family and over society . We refer also to the holy battle waged on so many fronts to vindicate for the family and the Church the natural and divinely given rights which_they possess over education and the school . Finally , We include among_these fruits of piety that whole group of movements , organizations , and works so dear to Our fatherly heart which passes under the name of '' Catholic Action , '' and in which We have_been so intensely interested . All these organizations and movements ought not_only to continue in existence , but ought to be developed more_and_more , always of course as the conditions of time_and_place seem to demand . There can be no question of the fact that_these conditions are_-atti_degli_apostoli- times very difficult and exact of both pastors and the faithful a great and increasing amount of sacrifice and labor . But since such work_-isaia- vitally necessary , it -isaia- without question an essential part of our Christian life and of the sacred_ministry and -isaia- therefore indissolubly bound up with the restoration of the Kingdom of Christ and the re establishment of that true peace which_can be found only in His Kingdom '' the peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ . Tell , therefore , your_clergy , Venerable Brothers , whom We know have labored so devotedly in these different fields of activity for the Church of Christ , and whose work We have_seen -atti_degli_apostoli- close range and have even participated in and which We appreciate so highly , tell them that_when they co operate with you , they are_united with Christ and guided by Him through you ; that -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_also co operate with Us , and that We bless them_with Our fatherly blessing . It -isaia- scarcely necessary to add , Venerable Brothers , how_much We depend on the regular clergy to aid in the successful execution of the different parts of Our program . You know as well as We what a magnificent contribution they have_made to the interior life of the Church and to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ . They are actuated not_only by the precepts but by the counsels of Christ . Both in the holy silence of the cloister and in pious works outside convent walls they exhibit the high ideals of Christian perfection by their works of true piety , by their keeping uppermost in the minds of Christian people the pure ideals of Christ , by the example which_they give due to their self sacrificing renunciation of all worldly comforts and material goods , by their acquisition of spiritual treasures . Because of the consecration of their whole being to the common_good , they undertake truly miraculous activities which succor every ill spiritual and bodily , and help all in finding a sure remedy or assistance from the evils which we must encounter . As the history of the Church bears_witness , members of the religious_orders under the inspiration of God s love , have often gone to such lengths in their_work of preaching the Gospel that_they_have given up their_lives for the salvation_of_souls , thus by their death spreading the unity of the faith and the doctrine of Christian brotherhood and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time extending farther and farther the boundaries of the Kingdom of Christ . Tell your faithful children of the laity that_when , united with_their pastors and their bishops , they participate in the works of the apostolate , both individual and social , the end purpose of which_-isaia- to make Jesus Christ better known and better loved , then they_are more_than_ever '' a chosen generation , a kingly priesthood , a holy nation , a purchased people , '' of whom St . Peter spoke in such laudatory terms . I Peter ii , Then , too , they_are more_than_ever united with Us and with Christ , and become great factors in bringing_about world peace because_they work_for the restoration and spread of the Kingdom of Christ . Only in this Kingdom of Christ can we find that true human equality by which all men_are ennobled and made great by the selfsame nobility and greatness , for each -isaia- ennobled by the precious blood of Christ . As for those_who_are in authority , they_are , according to the example of our Lord Jesus Christ , but ministers of the good , servants of the servants of God , particularly of the sick and of those in need . However , these very social changes , which_have created and increased the need of cooperation between_the clergy and laity to which We have just referred , have themselves brought along in their wake new and most serious problems and dangers . As an after effect of the upheaval caused by the Great War and of its political and social consequences , false ideas and unhealthy sentiments have , like a contagious disease , so taken possession of the popular mind_that We have grave fears that_even some among the best of our laity and of the clergy , seduced by the false appearance of truth_which some of these doctrines possess , have_not been altogether immune from error . Many believe in or claim that_they believe in and hold fast to Catholic doctrine on such questions as social authority , the right of owning private_property , on the relations_between capital and labor , on the rights of the laboring man , on the relations_between Church and State , religion and country , on the relations_between the different social classes , on international relations , on the rights of the Holy See and the prerogatives of the Roman Pontiff and the Episcopate , on the social rights of Jesus Christ , Who -isaia- the Creator , Redeemer , and Lord not_only of individuals but of nations . In spite of these protestations , they speak , write , and , what_-isaia- more , act as if it were_not necessary any longer to follow , or that_they did_not remain still in full force , the teachings and solemn pronouncements which_may be found in so many documents of the Holy See , and particularly in those written by Leo XIII , Pius X , and Benedict XV . There -isaia- a species of moral , legal , and social modernism which We condemn , no less decidedly than We condemn theological modernism . It -isaia- necessary ever to keep in mind these teachings and pronouncements which We have_made ; it -isaia- no less necessary to reawaken that spirit of faith , of supernatural love , and of Christian discipline which alone_can bring to these_principles correct understanding , and can lead to their observance . This -isaia- particularly important in the case of youth , and especially_those who aspire to the priesthood , so that in the almost universal confusion in which we live they -atti_degli_apostoli- least , as the Apostle writes , will_not be '' tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men , by cunning craftiness , by which_they lie in wait to deceive . From this Apostolic Center of the Church of Christ , We turn Our eyes toward those_who , unfortunately in great numbers , are either ignorant of Christ and His Redemption or do not follow in their entirety His teachings , or who_are separated_from the unity of His Church and thus are without His Fold , although they too have been_called by Christ to membership in His Church . The Vicar of the Good Shepherd , seeing so many of his sheep gone astray , cannot_but recall and make his_own the simple but expressive words of Christ , words_which are permeated through and through by the longings born of divine desire : '' And other sheep I have , that_are not of this fold : them also I must bring . '' John x , He cannot_but rejoice in the wonderful prophecy which filled even the Sacred Heart of Jesus with_joy . '' And they_shall hear my voice , and there shall be one fold and one shepherd . '' May God , and We join with you and with all the faithful in this_prayer , shortly bring to fulfillment His prophecy by transforming this consoling vision of the future into a present reality . One of the outstanding manifestations of this religious unity , and a happy augury for the future , -isaia- that altogether unexpected , but well_known fact of which_you have knowledge , Venerable Brothers , a fact not pleasing to some perhaps , but certainly very consoling both to us and to you , namely_,_that recently the representatives and rulers of practically every nation , motivated by a common and instinctive desire_for union and peace , have turned to this Apostolic See in order to bind themselves closer to Us or to renew in some cases the bonds of amity and friendship which_had joined us together previously . We rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- this_fact , not merely because it increases the prestige of Holy Church , but because_it_-isaia- becoming increasingly evident on all sides , and especially from actual experience , what great possibilities for peace and happiness , even here below , such a union with Us possesses for human_society . Although the Church -isaia- committed by God , first of all , to the attainment of spiritual and imperishable purposes , because of the very intimate and necessary connection of things one_with another , such a mission serves likewise to advance the temporal prosperity of nations and individuals , even_more so than if she were instituted primarily to promote such ends . The Church does_not desire , neither ought she to desire , to mix up without a just cause in the direction of purely civil affairs . On the other_hand , she cannot permit or tolerate that the state use the pretext of certain laws of unjust regulations to do injury to the rights of an order superior to that of the state , to interfere with the constitution given the Church by Christ , or to violate the rights of God Himself over civil_society . We make Our very own , Venerable Brothers , the words_which Benedict XV , of happy_memory , used in the last allocution which he pronounced -atti_degli_apostoli- the Consistory of November twenty first of last year , when he spoke of the treaties asked for or proposed to Us by various states : '' We cannot possibly permit that anything harmful to the dignity or liberty of the Church creep into these treaties , for it -isaia- all important_that the safety and freedom of the Church be guarded -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , and especially in our_own days , and this in the lasting interests of human_society itself . It -isaia- scarcely necessary to say here how painful it -isaia- to Us to note that_from this galaxy of friendly powers which surround Us one_-isaia- missing , Italy , Our own dear native land , the country where_the hand of God , who guides the course of history , has set down the Chair of His Vicar on earth , in this city of Rome which , from being the capital of the wonderful Roman Empire , was_made by Him the capital of the whole_world , because He made it the seat of a sovereignty which , since it extends beyond_the confines of nations and states , embraces within itself all the peoples of the whole_world . The very origin and divine nature of this sovereignty demands , the inviolable rights of conscience of millions of the faithful of the whole_world demand_that this sacred sovereignty must_not be , neither must it ever appear to be , subject to any human authority or law whatsoever , even_though that law be one_which proclaims certain guaranties for the liberty of the Roman Pontiff . The true guaranties of liberty , in no way injurious , but on the contrary of incalculable benefit to Italy , which Divine Providence , the ruler and arbiter of mankind , has conferred upon the sovereignty of the Vicar of Christ here below , these guaranties which for centuries have fitted in so marvelously with the divine designs in order to protect the liberty of the Roman Pontiff , neither Divine Providence itself has manifested nor human ingenuity has as yet discovered any substitute which_would compensate for the loss of these rights ; these guaranties We declare have_been and are_still being violated . Whence it -isaia- that_there has_been created a certain abnormal condition of affairs which_has grievously troubled and , up to the present hour , continues to trouble the consciences of the Catholics of Italy and of the entire world . We , therefore , who are_now the heirs and depositories of the ideals and sacred duties of Our Venerated Predecessors , and like them alone invested with competent authority in such a weighty matter and responsible to no one but God for Our decisions , We protest , as they_have protested before Us , against such a condition of affairs in defense of the rights and of the dignity of the Apostolic See , not because We are moved by any vain earthly ambition of which We should be ashamed , but out of a sense of Our duty to the dictates of conscience itself , mindful always of the fact_that We too must one_day die and of the awful account which We must render to the Divine Judge of the ministry which He has confided to Our care . At all events , Italy has not nor will she have in the future anything to fear from the Holy See . The Pope , no matter who he shall be , will_always repeat the words : '' I think thoughts of peace not of affliction '' Jeremias xxix , , thoughts of a true peace which_-isaia- founded on justice and which permit him truthfully to say : '' Justice and Peace have kissed . '' Psalms lxxxiv , It -isaia- God s task to bring_about this happy hour and to make it known to all ; men of wisdom and of good_will surely will_not permit it to strike in vain . When it does arrive , it will turn out to be a solemn hour , one big with consequences not_only_for the restoration of the Kingdom of Christ , but_for the pacification of Italy and the world as well . We pray most fervently , and ask others likewise to pray for_this much desired pacification of society , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment when after twenty centuries the day and hour approach when all over the world men will celebrate the humble and meek coming among us of the Sweet Prince of Peace , -atti_degli_apostoli- whose birth the heavenly hosts sang : '' Glory be to God in the highest ; and on , earth peace to men_of_good will . As an augury of this peace for mankind , may the Apostolic Blessing , which We invoke upon you and your flock , on your_clergy , your_people , on their_families and homes bring happiness to the living , peace and eternal rest to the dead . From the depths of Our heart as a sign of Our fatherly love , We impart to you , to your_clergy , and to your_people , the Apostolic Blessing .

Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Representative on earth of that divine Master who while embracing in the immensity of His love all mankind , even unworthy sinners , showed nevertheless a special tenderness and affection for children , and expressed Himself in those singularly touching words : '' Suffer the little children to come unto Me , '' We also on every occasion have endeavored to show the predilection wholly paternal which We bear towards them , particularly by our assiduous care and timely instructions with reference to the Christian education of youth . And so , in the spirit of the Divine Master , We have directed a helpful word , now of admonition , now of exhortation , now of direction , to youths and to their educators , to fathers and mothers , on various points of Christian education , with_that solicitude which becomes_the common Father of all the Faithful , with an insistence in season and out of season , demanded by our pastoral_office and inculcated by the Apostle : '' Be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , entreat , rebuke in all patience and doctrine . '' Such insistence -isaia- called_for in these our_times , when , alas , there_-isaia- so great and deplorable an absence of clear and sound principles , even regarding problems the most fundamental . Now this_same general condition of the times , this ceaseless agitation in various_ways of the problem of educational rights and systems in different countries , the desire expressed to Us with filial confidence by not_a_few of yourselves , Venerable Brethren , and by members of your flocks , as well as Our deep affection towards youth above referred to , move Us to turn more directly to this_subject , if not to treat it in all its well nigh inexhaustible range of theory and practice , -atti_degli_apostoli- least to summarize its main principles , throw full light on its important conclusions , and point_out its practical applications . Let this be the record of Our Sacerdotal Jubilee which , with altogether special affection , We wish to dedicate to our_beloved youth , and to commend to all those_whose office and duty -isaia- the work of education . Indeed never has there been so much discussion about education as nowadays ; never have exponents of new pedagogical theories been so numerous , or so many methods and means devised , proposed and debated , not merely to facilitate education , but to create a new system infallibly efficacious , and capable of preparing the present generations for that earthly happiness which_they so ardently desire . The reason -isaia- that_men , created by God to His image_and_likeness and destined for Him Who -isaia- infinite perfection realize today more_than_ever amid the most exuberant material progress , the insufficiency of earthly goods to produce true happiness either for the individual or for the nations . And hence they feel more keenly in themselves the impulse towards a perfection that_-isaia- higher , which impulse -isaia- implanted in their rational nature by the Creator Himself . This perfection they seek to acquire by means of education . But many of them_with , it would seem , too great insistence on the etymological meaning of the word , pretend to draw education out of human_nature itself and evolve it by its_own unaided powers . Such easily fall_into error , because , instead of fixing their gaze on God , first principle and last end of the whole universe , they fall back upon themselves , becoming attached exclusively to passing things of earth ; and thus their restlessness will_never cease till they direct their attention and their_efforts to God , the goal of all perfection , according to the profound saying of Saint Augustine : '' Thou didst create us , O Lord , for Thyself , and our heart_-isaia- restless till it rest in Thee . It -isaia- therefore as important to make no mistake in education , as it -isaia- to make no mistake in the pursuit of the last end , with_which_the whole work of education -isaia- intimately and necessarily connected . In fact , since education consists essentially in preparing man for_what he must be and for_what he must do here below , in order to attain the sublime end for_which he was created , it -isaia- clear_that there_can be no true education which_-isaia-_not wholly directed to man s last end , and that in the present order of Providence , since God has revealed Himself to us in the Person of His Only Begotten Son , who alone_-isaia- '' the way , the truth and the life , '' there_can be no ideally perfect education which_-isaia-_not Christian education . From this we see the supreme importance of Christian education , not merely for each_individual , but_for families and for the whole of human_society , whose perfection comes_from_the perfection of the elements that compose it . From these same principles , the excellence , we may well call it the unsurpassed excellence , of the work of Christian education becomes manifest and clear ; for after all it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- securing the Supreme Good , that_-isaia- , God , for the souls of those_who_are being educated , and the maximum of well_being possible here below for human_society . And this it does as efficaciously as man_-isaia- capable of doing it , namely by cooperating with God in the perfecting of individuals and of society , in as much as education makes upon the soul the first , the most powerful and lasting impression for life according to the well_known saying of the Wise Man , '' A young_man according_to_his way , even_when he -isaia- old , he will_not depart from it . '' With good_reason therefore did St . John Chrysostom say , '' What greater work_-isaia- there than training the mind and forming the habits of the young ? '' . But nothing discloses to us the supernatural beauty and excellence of the work of Christian education better_than the sublime expression of love of our Blessed Lord , identifying Himself with children , '' Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name , receiveth me . Now in order_that no mistake be made in this_work of utmost importance , and in order to conduct it in the best manner possible with the help of God s grace , it -isaia- necessary to have a clear and definite idea of Christian education in its essential aspects , viz . , who_has the mission to educate , who_are the subjects to be educated , what_are the necessary accompanying circumstances , what_-isaia- the end and object proper to Christian education according to God s established order in the economy of His Divine Providence . Education -isaia- essentially a social and not a mere individual activity . Now there_are three necessary societies , distinct from one_another and yet harmoniously combined by God , into which man_-isaia- born : two , namely the family and civil_society , belong to the natural order ; the third , the Church , to the supernatural order . In the first_place comes the family , instituted directly by God for its peculiar purpose , the generation and formation of offspring ; for this_reason it has priority of nature and therefore of rights over civil_society . Nevertheless , the family_-isaia- an imperfect society , since it has not in itself all the means_for its_own complete development ; whereas civil society_-isaia- a perfect society , having in itself all the means_for its peculiar end , which_-isaia- the temporal well_being of the community ; and so , in this respect , that_-isaia- , in view of the common_good , it has pre eminence over the family , which finds_its own suitable temporal perfection precisely in civil_society . The third society , into which man_-isaia- born when through Baptism he reaches the divine_life of grace , -isaia- the Church ; a society of the supernatural order and of universal extent ; a perfect society , because it has in itself all the means required_for its_own end , which_-isaia- the eternal_salvation of mankind ; hence_it_-isaia- supreme in its_own domain . Consequently , education which_-isaia- concerned_with man as a whole , individually and socially , in the order of nature and in the order of grace , necessarily belongs to all these three societies , in due proportion , corresponding , according to the disposition of Divine Providence , to the co ordination of their respecting ends . And first of all education belongs preeminently to the Church , by reason of a double title in the supernatural order , conferred exclusively upon her by God Himself ; absolutely superior therefore to any_other title in the natural order . The first title -isaia- founded upon the express mission and supreme_authority to teach , given her by her_divine Founder : '' All power -isaia- given to me in heaven and in earth . Going therefore teach ye all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you , and behold I -amos- with you all days , even to the consummation of the world . '' Upon this magisterial office Christ conferred infallibility , together_with_the command to teach His doctrine . Hence the Church '' was set by her_divine Author as the pillar and ground of truth , in order to teach the divine Faith to men , and keep whole and inviolate the deposit confided to her ; to direct and fashion men , in all their actions individually and socially , to purity of morals and integrity of life , in accordance_with revealed doctrine . The second title -isaia- the supernatural motherhood , in virtue of which_the Church , spotless spouse of Christ , generates , nurtures and educates souls in the divine_life of grace , with_her Sacraments and her doctrine . With good_reason then does St . Augustine maintain : '' He has not God for father_who refuses to have_the Church as mother . Hence it -isaia- that in this proper object of her_mission , that_-isaia- , '' in faith_and_morals , God Himself has made the Church sharer in the divine magisterium and , by a special privilege , granted her immunity from error ; hence she_-isaia- the mistress of men , supreme and absolutely sure , and she_has inherent in herself an inviolable right to freedom in teaching . By necessary consequence the Church -isaia- independent of any sort of earthly power as well in the origin as in the exercise of her_mission as educator , not merely in regard to her proper end and object , but_also in regard to the means necessary and suitable to attain that end . Hence with_regard to every_other kind of human learning and instruction , which_-isaia- the common patrimony of individuals and society , the Church has an independent right to make_use of it , and above all to decide what may help or harm Christian education . And this_must be so , because the Church as a perfect society has an independent right to the means conducive to its end , and because every_form of instruction , no less_than every_human action , has a necessary connection_with man s last end , and therefore cannot be withdrawn from the dictates of the divine_law , of which_the Church -isaia- guardian , interpreter and infallible mistress . This truth_-isaia- clearly set_forth by Pius X of saintly memory : Whatever a Christian does even in the order of things of earth , he may_not overlook the supernatural ; indeed he must , according to the teaching of Christian wisdom , direct all things towards_the supreme good as to his last end ; all his actions , besides , in so far as good or evil in the order of morality , that_-isaia- , in keeping or not_with natural and divine_law , fall under the judgment and jurisdiction of the Church . It -isaia- worthy of note how a layman , an excellent writer and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a profound and conscientious thinker , has been_able to understand well and express exactly this fundamental Catholic doctrine : The Church does_not say that morality belongs purely , in the sense of exclusively , to her ; but_that it belongs wholly to her . She has_never maintained that outside her fold and apart_from her teaching , man cannot arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- any moral truth ; she_has on the contrary more_than_once condemned this opinion because it has appeared under more forms than one . She does however say , has said , and will ever say , that because of her institution by Jesus Christ , because of the Holy Ghost sent her in His name by the Father , she alone possesses what she_has had immediately from God and can_never lose , the whole of moral truth , omnem veritatem , in which all individual moral truths are included , as well those_which man may learn by the help of reason , as those_which form part of revelation or which_may be deduced from it . Therefore with full right the Church promotes letters , science , art in so far as necessary or helpful to Christian education , in addition to her work_for the salvation_of_souls : founding and maintaining schools and institutions adapted to every branch of learning and degree of culture . Nor may even physical culture , as it -isaia- called , be considered outside the range of her_maternal supervision , for the reason_that it also -isaia- a means which_may help or harm Christian education . And this_work of the Church in every branch of culture -isaia- of immense benefit to families and nations which without Christ are lost , as St . Hilary points_out correctly : '' What can be more fraught with danger for the world than the rejection of Christ ? '' Nor does it interfere in the least with the regulations of the State , because the Church in her motherly prudence -isaia- not unwilling that her schools and institutions for the education of the laity be in keeping_with_the legitimate dispositions of civil authority ; she_-isaia- in every way ready to cooperate with this authority and to make provision for a mutual understanding , should difficulties arise . Again it -isaia- the inalienable right as well as the indispensable duty of the Church , to watch over the entire education of her_children , in all institutions , public or private , not merely in regard to the religious instruction there given , but in regard to every_other branch of learning and every regulation in so far as religion and morality are_concerned . Nor should the exercise of this right be considered undue interference , but_rather maternal care on the part of the Church in protecting her_children from the grave danger of all kinds of doctrinal and moral evil . Moreover this watchfulness of the Church not merely can create no real inconvenience , but must on the contrary confer valuable assistance in the right ordering and well_being of families and of civil_society ; for it keeps far away from youth the moral poison which -atti_degli_apostoli- that inexperienced and changeable age more_easily penetrates the mind and more rapidly spreads its baneful effects . For it -isaia- true , as Leo XIII has wisely pointed_out , that without proper religious and moral instruction '' every_form of intellectual culture will be injurious ; for young_people not accustomed to respect God , will be unable to bear the restraint of a virtuous life , and never having learned to deny themselves anything . they_will easily be incited to disturb the public order . The extent of the Church s mission in the field of education -isaia- such as to embrace every nation , without exception , according to the command of Christ : '' Teach ye all nations ; '' and there_-isaia- no power on earth that may lawfully oppose her or stand in her way . In the first_place , it extends over all the Faithful , of whom she_has anxious care as a tender mother . For these she_has throughout_the centuries created and conducted an immense number of schools and institutions in every branch of learning . As We said on a recent occasion : Right back in the far off middle ages when there_were so many some have even said too many monasteries , convents , churches , collegiate churches , cathedral chapters , etc . , there_was attached to each a home of study , of teaching , of Christian education . To these we must add all the universities , spread over every country and always by the initiative an under the protection of the Holy See and the Church . That grand spectacle , which today we see better , as it -isaia- nearer to us and more imposing because of the conditions of the age , was_the spectacle of all times ; and they_who study and compare historical events remain astounded -atti_degli_apostoli- what_the Church has been_able to do in this_matter , and marvel -atti_degli_apostoli- the manner in which_she had succeeded in fulfilling her God given mission to educate generations of men to a Christian life , producing everywhere a magnificent harvest of fruitful results . But if we wonder that the Church in all times has been_able to gather about her and educate hundreds , thousands , millions of students , no less wonderful -isaia- it to bear in mind what she_has done not_only in the field of education , but in that also of true and genuine erudition . For , if so many treasures of culture , civilization and literature have escaped destruction , this_-isaia- due to the action by which_the Church , even in times long past and uncivilized , has shed so bright a light in the domain of letters , of philosophy , of art and in a special manner of architecture . All this_the Church has been_able to do because her_mission to educate extends equally to those outside the Fold , seeing that all men are_called to enter_the kingdom of God and reach eternal_salvation . Just as today when her missions scatter schools by the thousand in districts and countries not_yet Christian , from the banks of the Ganges to the Yellow river and the great islands and archipelagos of the Pacific ocean , from the Dark Continent to the Land of Fire and to frozen Alaska , so in every_age the Church by her missionaries has educated to Christian life and to civilization the various peoples which now constitute the Christian nations of the civilized world . Hence it -isaia- evident_that both by right and in fact the mission to educate belongs preeminently to the Church , and that_no_one free_from prejudice can have a reasonable motive for opposing or impeding the Church in this her work , of which_the world today enjoys the precious advantages . This -isaia- the more true because the rights of the family and of the State , even the rights of individuals regarding a just liberty in the pursuit of science , of methods of science and all sorts of profane culture , not_only are_not opposed to this pre eminence of the Church , but are in complete harmony_with it . The fundamental reason_for this harmony -isaia- that the supernatural order , to which_the Church owes her rights , not_only does_not in the least destroy the natural order , to which pertain the other rights mentioned , but elevates the natural and perfects it , each affording mutual aid to the other , and completing it in a manner proportioned to its respective nature and dignity . The reason -isaia- because both come from God , who cannot contradict Himself : '' The works of God are perfect and all His ways are judgments . This becomes clearer when we consider more_closely and in detail the mission of education proper to the family and to the State . In the first_place the Church s mission of education -isaia- in wonderful agreement with_that of the family , for both proceed from God , and in a remarkably similar manner . God directly communicates to the family , in the natural order , fecundity , which_-isaia- the principle of life , and hence also the principle of education to life , together_with authority , the principle of order . The Angelic Doctor with_his wonted clearness of thought and precision of style , says : '' The father according to the flesh has in a particular_way a share in that principle which in a manner universal -isaia- found in God . The father -isaia- the principle of generation , of education and discipline and of everything_that bears upon the perfecting of human_life . The family therefore holds directly from the Creator the mission and hence_the right to educate the offspring , a right inalienable because inseparably joined to the strict obligation , a right anterior to any right whatever of civil_society and of the State , and therefore inviolable on the part of any power on earth . That this right -isaia- inviolable St . Thomas proves as follows : The child -isaia- naturally something of the father . so by natural right the child , before reaching the use of reason , -isaia- under the father s care . Hence it would be contrary to natural justice if the child , before the use of reason , were removed from the care of its parents , or if any disposition were made concerning him against the will of the parents . And as this_duty on the part of the parents continues up to the time_when the child -isaia- in a position to provide_for itself , this_same inviolable parental right of education also endures . '' Nature intends not merely the generation of the offspring , but_also its development and advance to the perfection of man considered as man , that_-isaia- , to the state of virtue '' says the same St . The wisdom of the Church in this_matter -isaia- expressed with precision and clearness in the Codex of Canon Law , can . : '' Parents are under a grave obligation to see to the religious and moral education of their_children , as well as to their physical and civic training , as far as they_can , and moreover to provide_for their temporal well_being . On this_point the common sense of mankind -isaia- in such complete accord , that they_would be in open contradiction with it who dared maintain that the children belong to the State before they belong to the family , and that the State has an absolute right over their education . Untenable -isaia- the reason they adduce , namely that man_-isaia- born a citizen and hence belongs primarily to the State , not bearing in mind_that before being a citizen man must exist ; and existence does_not come from the State , but_from the parents , as Leo XIII wisely declared : '' The children are something of the father , and as it were an extension of the person of the father ; and , to be perfectly accurate , they enter_into and become part of civil_society , not directly by themselves , but through the family in which_they were born . '' '' And therefore , '' says the same Leo XIII , '' the father s power -isaia- of such a nature that it cannot be destroyed or absorbed by the State ; for it has the same origin as human life_itself . '' It does_not however follow from this_that the parents right to educate their_children -isaia- absolute and despotic ; for it -isaia- necessarily subordinated to the last end and to natural and divine_law , as Leo XIII declares in another memorable encyclical , where He thus sums up the rights_and_duties of parents : '' By nature parents have a right to the training of their_children , but_with this added duty that the education and instruction of the child be in accord with the end for_which by God s blessing it was begotten . Therefore it -isaia-_the_duty of parents to make every_effort to prevent any invasion of their_rights in this_matter , and to make absolutely sure_that the education of their_children remain under their_own control in keeping_with their Christian duty , and above all to refuse to send them to those schools in which there_-isaia- danger of imbibing the deadly poison of impiety . It must be borne in mind also_that the obligation of the family to bring up children , includes not_only religious and moral education , but physical and civic education as well , principally in so far as it touches upon religion and moralit . This incontestable right of the family has -atti_degli_apostoli- various times been recognized by nations anxious to respect the natural_law in their civil enactments . Thus , to give one recent example , the Supreme Court of the United States of America , in a decision on an important controversy , declared that_it_-isaia- not in the competence of the State to fix any uniform standard of education by forcing children to receive instruction exclusively in public schools , and it bases its decision on the natural_law : the child -isaia- not the mere creature of the State ; those_who nurture him and direct his destiny have_the right coupled with the high duty , to educate him and prepare him for the fulfillment of his obligations . History bears_witness how , particularly in modern times , the State has violated and does violate rights conferred by God on the family . At the same_time it shows magnificently how the Church has_ever protected and defended these rights , a fact proved by the special confidence which parents have in Catholic schools . As We pointed_out recently in Our letter to the Cardinal Secretary of State : The family has instinctively understood this to be so , and from the earliest days of Christianity down to our_own times , fathers and mothers , even_those of little or no faith , have_been sending or bringing their_children in millions to places of education under the direction of the Church . It -isaia- paternal instinct , given by God , that thus turns with confidence to the Church , certain of finding in her the protection of family rights , thereby illustrating that harmony_with which God has ordered all things . The Church -isaia- indeed conscious of her_divine mission to all mankind , and of the obligation which all men_have to practice the one true religion ; and therefore she never tires of defending her right , and of reminding parents of their_duty , to have all Catholic born children baptized and brought up as Christians . On the other_hand so jealous -isaia- she of the family s inviolable natural right to educate the children , that_she never consents , save under peculiar circumstances and with_special cautions , to baptize the children of infidels , or provide_for their education against the will of the parents , till such time as the children can choose for themselves and freely embrace the Faith . We have therefore two facts of supreme importance . As We said in Our discourse cited above : The Church placing -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of families her office of mistress and educator , and the families eager to profit by the offer , and entrusting their_children to the Church in hundreds and thousands . These two facts recall and proclaim a striking truth of the greatest significance in the moral and social_order . They declare that the mission of education regards before all , above all , primarily the Church and the family , and this by natural and divine_law , and that therefore it cannot be slighted , cannot be evaded , cannot be supplanted . From such priority of rights on the part of the Church and of the family in the field of education , most important advantages , as we have_seen , accrue to the whole of society . Moreover in accordance_with_the divinely established order of things , no damage can follow from it to the true and just rights of the State in regard to the education of its citizens . These rights have_been conferred upon civil_society by the Author of nature Himself , not by title of fatherhood , as in the case of the Church and of the family , but in virtue of the authority which it possesses to promote the common temporal welfare , which_-isaia- precisely_the purpose of its existence . Consequently education cannot pertain to civil_society in the same way_in_which it pertains to the Church and to the family , but in a different way corresponding to its_own particular end and object . Now this_end and object , the common welfare in the temporal order , consists in that peace and security in which families and individual citizens have_the free exercise of their_rights , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time enjoy_the greatest spiritual and temporal prosperity possible in this_life , by the mutual union and co ordination of the work of all . The function therefore of the civil authority residing in the State -isaia- twofold , to protect and to foster , but by no means to absorb the family and the individual , or to substitute itself for them . Accordingly in the matter of education , it -isaia- the right , or to speak more correctly , it -isaia-_the_duty of the State to protect in its legislation , the prior rights , already described , of the family as regards the Christian education of its offspring , and consequently also to respect the supernatural rights of the Church in this_same realm of Christian education . It also belongs to the State to protect the rights of the child itself when_the parents are_found wanting either physically or morally in this respect , whether by default , incapacity or misconduct , since , as has_been shown , their right to educate -isaia- not an absolute and despotic one , but dependent on the natural and divine_law , and therefore subject alike to the authority and jurisdiction of the Church , and to the vigilance and administrative care of the State in view of the common_good . Besides , the family_-isaia- not a perfect society , that_-isaia- , it has not in itself all the means necessary_for its_full development . In such cases , exceptional no doubt , the State does_not put itself in the place of the family , but merely supplies deficiencies , and provides suitable means , always in conformity_with_the natural rights of the child and the supernatural rights of the Church . In general then it -isaia- the right and duty of the State to protect , according to the rules of right_reason and faith , the moral and religious education of youth , by removing public impediments that stand in the way . In the first_place it pertains to the State , in view of the common_good , to promote in various_ways the education and instruction of youth . It should begin by encouraging and assisting , of its_own accord , the initiative and activity of the Church and the family , whose successes in this_field have_been clearly demonstrated by history and experience . It should moreover supplement their_work whenever this falls short of what_-isaia- necessary , even by means of its_own schools and institutions . For the State more_than any_other society_-isaia- provided with the means put -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal for the needs of all , and it -isaia- only right that it use these means to the advantage of those_who_have contributed them . Over and above this , the State can exact and take measures to secure that all its citizens have_the necessary knowledge of their civic and political duties , and a certain degree of physical , intellectual and moral culture , which , considering the conditions of our_times , -isaia- really necessary_for the common_good . However it -isaia- clear_that in all these ways of promoting education and instruction , both public_and_private , the State should respect the inherent rights of the Church and of the family concerning Christian education , and moreover have regard_for distributive justice . Accordingly , unjust and unlawful -isaia- any monopoly , educational or scholastic , which , physically or morally , forces families to make_use of government schools , contrary to the dictates of their Christian conscience , or contrary even to their legitimate preferences . This does_not prevent the State from making due provision for the right administration of public affairs and for the protection of its peace , within or without_the realm . These are things_which directly concern the public good and call_for special aptitudes and special preparation . The State may therefore reserve to itself the establishment and direction of schools intended to prepare for certain civic duties and especially_for military service , provided it be careful not to injure the rights of the Church or of the family in what pertains to them . It -isaia- well to repeat this warning here ; for in these_days there_-isaia- spreading a spirit of nationalism which_-isaia- false and exaggerated , as well as dangerous to true peace and prosperity . Under its influence various excesses are committed in giving a military turn to the so called physical training of boys sometimes even of girls , contrary to the very instincts of human_nature ; or again in usurping unreasonably on Sunday , the time which_should be devoted to religious duties and to family_life -atti_degli_apostoli- home . It -isaia- not our intention however to condemn what_-isaia-_good in the spirit of discipline and legitimate bravery promoted by these methods ; We condemn only what_-isaia- excessive , as for example violence , which_must not be confounded with courage nor with the noble sentiment of military valor in defense of country and public order ; or again exaltation of athleticism which even in classic pagan times marked the decline and downfall of genuine physical training . In general also it belongs to civil_society and the State to provide what may be called civic education , not_only_for its youth , but_for all ages and classes . This consists in the practice of presenting publicly to groups of individuals information having an intellectual , imaginative and emotional appeal , calculated to draw their wills to what_-isaia- upright and honest , and to urge its practice by a sort of moral compulsion , positively by disseminating such knowledge , and negatively by suppressing what_-isaia- opposed to it . This civic education , so wide and varied in itself as to include almost every activity of the State intended for the public good , ought also to be regulated by the norms of rectitude , and therefore cannot conflict with the doctrines of the Church , which_-isaia- the divinely appointed teacher of these norms . All that_we_have said so far regarding the activity of the State in educational matters , rests on the solid and immovable foundation of the Catholic doctrine of The Christian Constitution of States set_forth in such masterly fashion by Our Predecessor Leo XIII , notably in the Encyclicals Immortale Dei and Sapientiae Christianae . He writes as follows : God has divided the government of the human_race between two authorities , ecclesiastical and civil , establishing one over things divine , the other over things human . Both are supreme , each in its_own domain ; each has its_own fixed boundaries which limit its activities . These boundaries are determined by the peculiar nature and the proximate end of each , and describe as it were a sphere within which , with exclusive right , each may develop its influence . As however the same subjects are under the two authorities , it may happen that the same matter , though from a different point_of_view , may come under the competence and jurisdiction of each of them . If follows_that divine Providence , whence both authorities have_their origin , must_have traced with due order the proper line of action for each . The powers that_are , are ordained of God . Now the education of youth -isaia- precisely one of those matters that belong both to the Church and to the State , '' though in different_ways , '' as explained above . Therefore , continues Leo XIII , between_the two powers there_must reign a well ordered harmony . Not without reason may this mutual agreement be compared to the union of body_and_soul in man . Its nature and extent can_only be determined by considering , as we have_said , the nature of each of the two powers , and in particular the excellence and nobility of the respective ends . To one_-isaia- committed directly and specifically the charge of what_-isaia- helpful in worldly matters ; while the other -isaia- to concern itself with the things_that pertain to heaven and eternity . Everything therefore in human affairs that_-isaia- in any_way sacred , or has reference to the salvation_of_souls and the worship of God , whether by its_nature or by its end , -isaia- subject to the jurisdiction and discipline of the Church . Whatever else -isaia- comprised in the civil and political order , rightly comes under the authority of the State ; for Christ commanded us to give to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s , and to God the things_that_are God s . Whoever refuses to admit these_principles , and hence to apply them to education , must necessarily deny that Christ has founded His Church for the eternal_salvation of mankind , and maintain instead that civil_society and the State are_not subject to God and to His law , natural and divine . Such a doctrine -isaia- manifestly impious , contrary to right_reason , and , especially in this_matter of education , extremely harmful to the proper training of youth , and disastrous as well for civil_society as for the well_being of all mankind . On the other_hand from the application of these_principles , there inevitably result immense advantages for the right formation of citizens . This -isaia- abundantly proved by the history of every_age . Tertullian in his Apologeticus could throw down a challenge to the enemies of the Church in the early days of Christianity , just as St . Augustine did in his ; and we today can repeat with_him : Let those_who declare the teaching of Christ to be opposed to the welfare of the State , furnish us with an army of soldiers such as Christ says soldiers ought to be ; let_them give us subjects , husbands , wives , parents , children , masters , servants , kings , judges , taxpayers and tax gatherers who_live up to the teachings of Christ ; and then let_them dare assert that Christian doctrine -isaia- harmful to the State . Rather let_them not_hesitate one moment to acclaim that doctrine , rightly observed , the greatest safeguard of the State . While treating of education , it -isaia- not out of place to show here how an ecclesiastical writer , who flourished in more recent_times , during the Renaissance , the holy and learned Cardinal Silvio Antoniano , to whom_the cause of Christian education -isaia- greatly indebted , has set_forth most clearly this well established point of Catholic doctrine . He had_been a disciple of that wonderful educator of youth , St . Philip Neri ; he was teacher and Latin secretary to St . Charles Borromeo , and it was -atti_degli_apostoli- the latter s suggestion and under his inspiration that he wrote his splendid treatise on The Christian Education of Youth . In it he argues as follows : The more_closely the temporal power of a nation aligns itself with the spiritual , and the more it fosters and promotes the latter , by so much the more it contributes to the conservation of the commonwealth . For it -isaia- the aim of the ecclesiastical authority by the use of spiritual means , to form good Christians in accordance_with its_own particular end and object ; and in doing this it helps -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to form good citizens , and prepares them to meet their obligations as members of a civil_society . This follows of necessity because in the City of God , the Holy Roman Catholic Church , a good citizen and an upright man are absolutely one_and_the_same thing . How grave therefore -isaia- the error of those_who separate things so closely united , and who think that_they_can produce good citizens by ways and methods other_than those_which make for the formation of good Christians . For , let human prudence say what it likes and reason as it pleases , it -isaia- impossible to produce true temporal peace and tranquillity by things repugnant or opposed to the peace and happiness of eternity . What -isaia- true of the State , -isaia- true also of science , scientific methods and scientific_research ; they_have nothing to fear from the full and perfect mandate which_the Church holds in the field of education . Our Catholic institutions , whatever their grade in the educational and scientific world , have no need of apology . The esteem they enjoy , the praise they receive , the learned works which_they promote and produce in such abundance , and above all , the men , fully and splendidly equipped , whom_they provide_for the magistracy , for the professions , for the teaching career , in fact for_every walk of life , more_than sufficiently testify in their favour . These facts moreover present a most striking confirmation of the Catholic doctrine defined by the Vatican Council : Not only -isaia- it impossible for faith and reason to be -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with each_other , they_are on the contrary of mutual help . For while right_reason establishes the foundations of Faith , and , by the help of its light , develops a knowledge of the things of God , Faith on the other_hand frees and preserves reason from error and enriches it with varied knowledge . The Church therefore , far from hindering the pursuit of the arts and sciences , fosters and promotes them in many_ways . For she_-isaia- neither ignorant nor unappreciative of the many advantages which flow from them to mankind . On the contrary she admits that just as they come from God , Lord of all knowledge , so too if rightly used , with the help of His grace they lead to God . Nor does she prevent the sciences , each in its_own sphere , from making use of principles and methods of their_own . Only while acknowledging the freedom due to them , she takes every precaution to prevent them_from falling into error by opposition to divine doctrine , or from overstepping their_proper limits , and thus invading and disturbing the domain of Faith . This norm of a just freedom in things scientific , serves also as an inviolable norm of a just freedom in things didactic , or for rightly understood liberty in teaching ; it should be observed therefore in whatever instruction -isaia- imparted to others . Its obligation -isaia- all the more binding in justice when there_-isaia- question of instructing youth . For in this_work the teacher , whether public or private , has no absolute right of his_own , but_only such as has_been communicated to him by others . Besides every Christian child or youth has a strict right to instruction in harmony_with_the teaching of the Church , the pillar and ground of truth . And whoever disturbs the pupil s Faith in any_way , does him grave wrong , inasmuch as he abuses the trust which children place in their teachers , and takes unfair advantage of their inexperience and of their natural craving for unrestrained liberty , -atti_degli_apostoli- once illusory and false . In fact it must_never be forgotten that the subject of Christian education -isaia-_man whole and entire , soul united to body in unity of nature , with all his faculties natural and supernatural , such as right_reason and revelation show him to be ; man , therefore , fallen from his original estate , but redeemed by Christ and restored to the supernatural condition of adopted son of God , though without_the preternatural privileges of bodily immortality or perfect control of appetite . There remain therefore , in human_nature the effects of original_sin , the chief of which_are weakness of will and disorderly inclinations . '' Folly -isaia- bound up in the heart of a child and the rod of correction shall drive it away . '' Disorderly inclinations then must be corrected , good tendencies encouraged and regulated from tender childhood , and above all the mind must be enlightened and the will strengthened by supernatural truth and by the means of grace , without which_it_-isaia- impossible to control evil impulses , impossible to attain to the full and complete perfection of education intended by the Church , which Christ has endowed so richly with divine doctrine and with the Sacraments , the efficacious means of grace . Hence every_form of pedagogic naturalism which in any_way excludes or weakens supernatural Christian formation in the teaching of youth , -isaia- false . Every method of education founded , wholly or in part , on the denial or forgetfulness of original_sin and of grace , and relying on the sole powers of human_nature , -isaia- unsound . Such , generally speaking , are_those modern systems bearing various names which appeal to a pretended self government and unrestrained freedom on the part of the child , and which diminish or even suppress the teacher s authority and action , attributing to the child an exclusive primacy of initiative , and an activity independent of any higher law , natural or divine , in the work of his education . If any of these terms are used , less properly , to denote the necessity of a gradually more active cooperation on the part of the pupil in his_own education ; if the intention -isaia- to banish from education despotism and violence , which , by the way , just punishment -isaia- not , this_would be correct , but in no way new . It would mean only what_has_been taught and reduced to practice by the Church in traditional Christian education , in imitation of the method employed by God Himself towards His creatures , of whom He demands active cooperation according to the nature of each ; for His Wisdom '' reacheth from end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly . But alas ! it -isaia- clear from the obvious meaning of the words and from experience , that what_-isaia- intended by not_a_few , -isaia- the withdrawal of education from every sort of dependence on the divine_law . So today we see , strange sight indeed , educators and philosophers who spend their_lives in searching for a universal moral code of education , as if there existed no decalogue , no gospel law , no law even of nature stamped by God on the heart of man , promulgated by right_reason , and codified in positive revelation by God Himself in the ten commandments . These innovators are wont to refer contemptuously to Christian education as '' heteronomous , '' '' passive '' , '' obsolete , '' because founded upon the authority of God and His holy law . Such men_are miserably deluded in their claim to emancipate , as they_say , the child , while in reality they_are making him the slave of his_own blind pride and of his disorderly affections , which , as a logical consequence of this false system , come to be justified as legitimate demands of a so called autonomous nature . But what_-isaia- worse -isaia- the claim , not_only vain but false , irreverent and dangerous , to submit to research , experiment and conclusions of a purely natural and profane order , those matters of education which belong to the supernatural order ; as for example questions of priestly or religious vocation , and in general the secret workings of grace_which indeed elevate the natural powers , but are infinitely superior to them , and may nowise be subjected to physical laws , for '' the Spirit breatheth where He will . Another very grave danger -isaia- that naturalism which nowadays invades the field of education in that_most delicate matter of purity of morals . Far too common -isaia- the error of those_who with dangerous assurance and under an ugly term propagate a so called sex education , falsely imagining they_can forearm youths against the dangers of sensuality by means purely natural , such as a foolhardy initiation and precautionary instruction for all indiscriminately , even in public ; and , worse still , by exposing them -atti_degli_apostoli- an early age to the occasions , in order to accustom them , so it -isaia- argued , and as it were to harden them against such dangers . Such persons grievously err in refusing to recognize_the inborn weakness of human_nature , and the law of which_the Apostle speaks , fighting against the law of the mind ; and also in ignoring the experience of facts , from which_it_-isaia- clear_that , particularly in young_people , evil practices are the effect not_so_much of ignorance of intellect as of weakness of a will exposed to dangerous occasions , and unsupported by the means of grace . In this extremely delicate matter , if , all things considered , some private instruction -isaia- found necessary and opportune , from those_who hold from God the commission to teach and who have_the grace of state , every precaution must_be_taken . Such precautions are well_known in traditional Christian education , and are adequately described by Antoniano cited above , when he says : Such -isaia-_our misery and inclination to sin , that often in the very things considered to be remedies against sin , we find occasions for and inducements to sin itself . Hence it -isaia- of the highest importance that a good father , while discussing with_his son a matter so delicate , should be well on his guard and not descend to details , nor refer to the various_ways in which_this infernal hydra destroys with its poison so large a portion of the world ; otherwise it may happen that instead of extinguishing this fire , he unwittingly stirs or kindles it in the simple and tender heart of the child . Speaking generally , during the period of childhood it suffices to employ those remedies which produce the double effect of opening the door to the virtue of purity and closing the door upon vice . False also and harmful to Christian education -isaia- the so called method of '' coeducation . '' This too , by many of its supporters , -isaia- founded upon naturalism and the denial of original_sin ; but by all , upon a deplorable confusion of ideas that mistakes a leveling promiscuity and equality , for the legitimate association of the sexes . The Creator has ordained and disposed perfect union of the sexes only in matrimony , and , with varying degrees of contact , in the family and in society . Besides there_-isaia- not in nature itself , which fashions the two quite different in organism , in temperament , in abilities , anything to suggest that_there can be or ought to be promiscuity , and much less equality , in the training of the two sexes . These , in keeping_with_the wonderful designs of the Creator , are destined to complement each_other in the family and in society , precisely_because of their differences , which therefore ought to be maintained and encouraged during their years of formation , with the necessary distinction and corresponding separation , according to age and circumstances . These principles , with due regard to time_and_place , must , in accordance_with Christian prudence , be applied to all schools , particularly in the most delicate and decisive period of formation , that , namely , of adolescence ; and in gymnastic exercises and deportment , special_care must be had of Christian modesty in young women and girls , which_-isaia- so gravely impaired by any_kind of exhibition in public . Recalling the terrible words of the Divine Master : '' Woe to the world because of scandals ! '' We most earnestly appeal to your solicitude and your watchfulness , Venerable Brethren , against these pernicious errors , which , to the immense harm of youth , are spreading far and wide among Christian peoples . In order to obtain perfect education , it -isaia- of the utmost importance to see_that all those conditions which surround the child during the period of his formation , in other_words that the combination of circumstances which we call environment , correspond exactly to the end proposed . The first natural and necessary element in this environment , as regards education , -isaia- the family , and this precisely_because so ordained by the Creator Himself . Accordingly that education , as a rule , will be more_effective and lasting which_-isaia- received in a well ordered and well disciplined Christian family ; and more efficacious in proportion to the clear and constant good example set , first by the parents , and then by the other members of the household . It -isaia- not our intention to treat formally the question of domestic education , nor even to touch upon its principal points . The subject -isaia- too vast . Besides there_are not lacking special treatises on this topic by authors , both ancient and modern , well_known for their solid Catholic doctrine . One which seems deserving of special mention -isaia- the golden treatise already referred to , of Antoniano , On the Christian Education of Youth , which St . Charles Borromeo ordered to be read in public to parents assembled in their churches . Nevertheless , Venerable Brethren and beloved_children , We wish to call your attention in a special manner to the present_day lamentable decline in family education . The offices and professions of a transitory and earthly life_,_which are certainly of far less importance , are prepared_for by long and careful study ; whereas for the fundamental duty and obligation of educating their_children , many parents have little or no preparation , immersed as they_are in temporal cares . The declining influence of domestic environment -isaia- further weakened by another tendency , prevalent almost everywhere today , which , under one pretext or another , for economic reasons , or for reasons of industry , trade or politics , causes children to be more_and_more frequently sent away from home even in their tenderest years . And there_-isaia- a country where_the children are actually being torn from the bosom of the family , to be formed or , to speak more accurately , to be deformed and depraved in godless schools and associations , to irreligion and hatred , according to the theories of advanced socialism ; and thus -isaia- renewed in a real and more terrible manner the slaughter of the Innocents . For the love of Our Savior . Jesus Christ , therefore , we implore pastors of souls , by every_means in their_power , by instructions and catechisms , by word of mouth and written articles widely distributed , to warn Christian parents of their grave obligations . And this should be done not in a merely theoretical and general way , but_with practical and specific application to the various responsibilities of parents touching the religious , moral and civil training of their_children , and with indication of the methods best adapted to make_their training effective , supposing always the influence of their_own exemplary lives . The Apostle of the Gentiles did not_hesitate to descend to such details of practical instruction in his epistles , especially in the Epistle to the Ephesians , where among other_things he gives this advice : '' And you , fathers , provoke not your children to anger . '' This fault -isaia- the result not_so_much of excessive severity , as of impatience and of ignorance of means best calculated to effect a desired correction ; it -isaia-_also due to the all too common relaxation of parental discipline which fails to check the growth of evil passions in the hearts of the younger generation . Parents therefore , and all who take their place in the work of education , should be careful to make right use of the authority given them by God , whose vicars in a true sense they_are . This authority_-isaia- not given for their_own advantage , but_for the proper up bringing of their_children in a holy and filial '' fear of God , the beginning of wisdom , '' on which foundation alone all respect_for authority can rest securely ; and without_which , order , tranquillity and prosperity , whether in the family or in society , will be impossible . To meet_the weakness of man s fallen nature , God in His Goodness has provided the abundant helps of His grace and the countless means with_which He has endowed the Church , the great family of Christ . The Church therefore -isaia- the educational environment most intimately and harmoniously associated_with the Christian family . This educational environment of the Church embraces the Sacraments , divinely efficacious means of grace , the sacred ritual , so wonderfully instructive , and the material fabric of her churches , whose liturgy and art have an immense educational value ; but it also includes the great number and variety of schools , associations and institutions of all kinds , established for the training of youth in Christian piety , together_with literature and the sciences , not omitting recreation and physical culture . And in this inexhaustible fecundity of educational works , how marvelous , how incomparable -isaia- the Church s maternal providence ! So admirable too -isaia- the harmony which_she maintains with the Christian family , that the Church and the family may be said to constitute together one_and_the_same temple of Christian education . Since however the younger generations must be trained in the arts and sciences for the advantage and prosperity of civil_society , and since_the family of itself_-isaia- unequal to this_task , it was necessary to create that social institution , the school . But let it be borne in mind_that this institution owes its existence to the initiative of the family and of the Church , long before it was undertaken by the State . Hence considered in its historical origin , the school -isaia- by its_very nature an institution subsidiary and complementary to the family and to the Church . It follows logically and necessarily that it must_not be in opposition to , but in positive accord with_those other two elements , and form with_them a perfect moral union , constituting one sanctuary of education , as it were , with the family and the Church . Otherwise it -isaia- doomed to fail of its purpose , and to become instead an agent of destruction . This principle we find recognized by a layman , famous for his pedagogical writings , though these because_of_their liberalism cannot be unreservedly praised . '' The school , '' he writes , '' if not a temple , -isaia- a den . '' And again : '' When literary , social , domestic and religious education do not go hand in hand , man_-isaia- unhappy and helpless . From this it follows_that the so called '' neutral '' or '' lay '' school , from which religion_-isaia- excluded , -isaia- contrary to the fundamental principles of education . Such a school moreover cannot exist in practice ; it -isaia- bound to become irreligious . There -isaia- no need to repeat what Our Predecessors have declared on this_point , especially Pius IX and Leo XIII , -atti_degli_apostoli- times when laicism was beginning in a special manner to infest the public school . We renew and confirm their declarations , as well as the Sacred Canons in which_the frequenting of non Catholic schools , whether neutral or mixed , those namely which_are open to Catholics and non Catholics alike , -isaia- forbidden for Catholic children , and can be -atti_degli_apostoli- most tolerated , on the approval of the Ordinary alone , under determined circumstances of place and time , and with_special precautions . Neither can Catholics admit that other type of mixed school , least of all the so called '' \u00e9cole unique , '' obligatory on all , in which_the students are provided with separate religious instruction , but receive other lessons in common with non Catholic pupils from non Catholic teachers . For the mere fact_that a school gives some religious instruction often extremely stinted , does_not bring it into accord with the rights of the Church and of the Christian family , or make it a fit place_for Catholic students . To be this , it -isaia- necessary_that all the teaching and the whole organization of the school , and its teachers , syllabus and text books in every branch , be regulated by the Christian spirit , under the direction and maternal supervision of the Church ; so that Religion may be in very truth the foundation and crown of the youth s entire training ; and this in every grade of school , not_only the elementary , but the intermediate and the higher institutions of learning as well . To use the words of Leo XIII : It -isaia- necessary not_only that religious instruction be given to the young -atti_degli_apostoli- certain fixed times , but also_that every_other subject taught , be permeated with Christian piety . If this_-isaia- wanting , if this sacred atmosphere does_not pervade and warm the hearts of masters and scholars alike , little good can be expected from any_kind of learning , and considerable harm will often be the consequence . And let no one say that in a nation where_there are different religious beliefs , it -isaia- impossible to provide_for public instruction otherwise than by neutral or mixed schools . In such a case it becomes_the duty of the State , indeed it -isaia- the easier and more reasonable method of procedure , to leave free scope to the initiative of the Church and the family , while giving them such assistance as justice demands . That this_can be done to the full satisfaction of families , and to the advantage of education and of public peace and tranquillity , -isaia- clear from the actual experience of some_countries comprising different religious denominations . There the school legislation respects the rights of the family , and Catholics are free to follow their_own system of teaching in schools that_are entirely Catholic . Nor -isaia- distributive justice lost sight of , as -isaia- evidenced by the financial aid granted by the State to the several schools demanded by the families . In other countries of mixed creeds , things_are otherwise , and a heavy burden weighs upon Catholics , who under_the_guidance of their Bishops and with the indefatigable cooperation of the clergy , secular and regular , support Catholic schools for their_children entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- their_own expense ; to this they feel obliged in conscience , and with a generosity and constancy worthy of all praise , they_are firmly determined to make adequate provision for what_they openly profess as their motto : '' Catholic education in Catholic schools for all the Catholic youth . '' If such education -isaia- not aided from public funds , as distributive justice requires , certainly it may_not be opposed by any civil authority ready to recognize_the rights of the family , and the irreducible claims of legitimate liberty . Where this fundamental liberty -isaia- thwarted or interfered with , Catholics will_never feel , whatever may have_been the sacrifices already made , that_they_have done enough , for the support and defense of their schools and for the securing of laws that_will do them justice . For whatever Catholics do in promoting and defending the Catholic school for their_children , -isaia- a genuinely religious work and therefore an important task of '' Catholic Action . '' For this_reason_the associations which in various countries are so zealously engaged in this_work of prime necessity , are especially dear to Our paternal heart and are deserving of every commendation . Let it be loudly proclaimed and well understood and recognized by all , that Catholics , no matter what their nationality , in agitating for Catholic schools for their_children , are_not mixing in party politics , but are engaged in a religious enterprise demanded by conscience . They do not intend to separate their_children either from the body of the nation or its spirit , but to educate them in a perfect manner , most conducive to the prosperity of the nation . Indeed a good Catholic , precisely_because of his Catholic principles , makes_the better citizen , attached to his country , and loyally submissive to constituted civil authority in every legitimate form of government . In such a school , in harmony_with_the Church and the Christian family , the various branches of secular learning will_not enter_into conflict with religious instruction to the manifest detriment of education . And if , when occasion arises , it be deemed necessary to have_the students read authors propounding false doctrine , for the purpose of refuting it , this_will be done after due preparation and with_such an antidote of sound doctrine , that it will not_only do no harm , but will an aid to the Christian formation of youth . In such a school moreover , the study of the vernacular and of classical literature will do no damage to moral virtue . There the Christian teacher will imitate the bee , which_takes the choicest part of the flower and leaves the rest , as St . Basil teaches in his discourse to youths on the study of the classics . Nor will this necessary caution , suggested also by the pagan Quintilian , in any_way hinder the Christian teacher from gathering and turning to profit , whatever there_-isaia- of real worth in the systems and methods of our modern times , mindful of the Apostle s advice : '' Prove all things : hold fast that_which_-isaia- good . '' Hence in accepting the new , he will_not hastily abandon the old , which_the experience of centuries has found expedient and profitable . This -isaia- particularly true in the teaching of Latin , which in our days -isaia- falling more_and_more into disuse , because of the unreasonable rejection of methods so successfully used by that sane humanism , whose highest development was reached in the schools of the Church . These noble traditions of the past require that the youth committed to Catholic schools be fully instructed in the letters and sciences in accordance_with_the exigencies of the times . They also demand_that the doctrine imparted be deep and solid , especially in sound philosophy , avoiding the muddled superficiality of those '' who perhaps would_have found the necessary , had they not gone in search of the superfluous . '' In this connection Christian teachers should keep in mind what Leo XIII says in a pithy sentence : Greater stress must be laid on the employment of apt and solid methods of teaching , and , what_-isaia- still more_important , on bringing into full conformity_with_the Catholic faith , what_-isaia- taught in literature , in the sciences , and above all in philosophy , on which depends in great part the right orientation of the other branches of knowledge . Perfect schools are the result not_so_much of good methods as of good teachers , teachers who_are thoroughly prepared and well grounded in the matter they_have to teach ; who possess the intellectual and moral qualifications required by their important office ; who cherish a pure and holy love for the youths confided to them , because_they love Jesus Christ and His Church , of which these_are the children of predilection ; and who_have therefore sincerely -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the true good of family and country . Indeed it fills Our soul with consolation and gratitude towards_the divine Goodness to see , side by side with religious men_and_women engaged in teaching , such a large number of excellent lay teachers , who , for their greater spiritual advancement , are_often grouped in special sodalities and associations , which_are worthy of praise and encouragement as most excellent and powerful auxiliaries of '' Catholic Action . '' All these labor unselfishly with zeal and perseverance in what St . Gregory Nazianzen calls '' the art of arts and the science of sciences , '' the direction and formation of youth . Of them also it may be said in the words of the divine Master : '' The harvest indeed -isaia- great , but the laborers few . '' Let us then pray the Lord of the harvest to send more such workers into the field of Christian education ; and let their formation be one of the principal concerns of the pastors of souls and of the superiors of Religious Orders . It -isaia- no less necessary to direct and watch the education of the adolescent , '' soft as wax to be moulded into vice , '' in whatever other environment he may happen to be , removing occasions of evil and providing occasions for good in his recreations and social intercourse ; for '' evil communications corrupt good manners . More than_ever nowadays an extended and careful vigilance -isaia- necessary , inasmuch as the dangers of moral and religious shipwreck are greater for inexperienced youth . Especially -isaia- this true of impious and immoral books , often diabolically circulated -atti_degli_apostoli- low prices ; of the cinema , which multiplies every_kind of exhibition ; and now also of the radio , which facilitates every_kind of communications . These most powerful means of publicity , which_can be of great utility for instruction and education when directed by sound principles , are only too_often used as an incentive to evil passions and greed for gain . Augustine deplored the passion for the shows of the circus which possessed even some Christians of his time , and he dramatically narrates the infatuation for them , fortunately only temporary , of his disciple and friend Alipius . How often today must parents and educators bewail the corruption of youth brought_about by the modern theater and the vile book ! . Worthy of all praise and encouragement therefore are_those educational associations which_have for their object to point_out to parents and educators , by means of suitable books and periodicals , the dangers to morals and religion that are_often cunningly disguised in books and theatrical representations . In their spirit of zeal for the souls of the young , they endeavor -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to circulate good literature and to promote plays that_are really instructive , going so far as to put up -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of great sacrifices , theaters and cinemas , in which virtue will_have nothing to suffer and much to gain . This necessary vigilance does_not demand_that young_people be removed from the society in which_they must live and save their_souls ; but_that today more_than_ever they_should be forewarned and forearmed as Christians against the seductions and the errors of the world , which , as Holy Writ admonishes us , -isaia- all '' concupiscence of the flesh , concupiscence of the eyes and pride of life . '' Let them be what Tertullian wrote of the first Christians , and what Christians of all times ought to be , '' sharers in the possession of the world , not of its error . This saying of Tertullian brings us to the topic which we propose to treat in the last place , and which_-isaia- of the greatest importance , that_-isaia- , the true nature of Christian education , as deduced from its_proper end . Its consideration reveals with noonday clearness the pre eminent educational mission of the Church . The proper and immediate end of Christian education -isaia- to cooperate with divine_grace in forming the true and perfect Christian , that_-isaia- , to form Christ Himself in those regenerated by Baptism , according to the emphatic expression of the Apostle : '' My little children , of whom I -amos- in labor again , until Christ be formed in you . '' For the true Christian must live a supernatural life in Christ : '' Christ who_-isaia- your life , '' and display it in all his actions : '' That the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh . For precisely this_reason , Christian education takes in the whole aggregate of human_life , physical and spiritual , intellectual and moral , individual , domestic and social , not with_a_view of reducing it in any_way , but in order to elevate , regulate and perfect it , in accordance_with_the example and teaching of Christ . Hence the true Christian , product of Christian education , -isaia- the supernatural man_who thinks , judges and acts constantly and consistently in accordance_with right_reason illumined by the supernatural light of the example and teaching of Christ ; in other_words , to use the current term , the true and finished man of character . For , it -isaia- not every_kind of consistency and firmness of conduct based on subjective principles that makes true character , but_only constancy in following the eternal principles of justice , as -isaia- admitted even by the pagan poet when he praises as one_and_the_same '' the man who_-isaia- just and firm of purpose . '' And on the other_hand , there cannot be full justice except in giving to God what_-isaia- due to God , as the true Christian does . The scope and aim of Christian education as here described , appears to the worldly as an abstraction , or rather as something_that cannot be attained without_the suppression or dwarfing of the natural faculties , and without a renunciation of the activities of the present life , and hence inimical to social_life and temporal prosperity , and contrary to all progress in letters , arts and sciences , and all the other elements of civilization . To a like objection raised by the ignorance and the prejudice of even cultured pagans of a former day , and repeated with_greater frequency and insistence in modern times , Tertullian has replied as follows : We are_not strangers to life . We are fully aware of the gratitude we owe to God , our Lord and Creator . We reject none of the fruits of His handiwork ; we only abstain from their immoderate or unlawful use . We are living in the world with you ; we do not shun your forum , your markets , your baths , your shops , your factories , your stables , your places of business and traffic . We take shop with you and we serve in your armies ; we are farmers and merchants with you ; we interchange skilled labor and display our works in public for your service . How we can seem unprofitable to you with whom we live and of whom we are , I know not . The true Christian does_not renounce the activities of this_life , he does_not stunt his natural faculties ; but he develops and perfects them , by coordinating them_with_the supernatural . He thus ennobles what_-isaia- merely natural in life and secures for it new strength in the material and temporal order , no less then in the spiritual and eternal . This fact -isaia- proved by the whole history of Christianity and its institutions , which_-isaia- nothing else but the history of true civilization and progress up to the present_day . It stands out conspicuously in the lives of the numerous Saints , whom_the Church , and she alone , produces , in whom -isaia- perfectly realized the purpose of Christian education , and who_have in every way ennobled and benefited human_society . Indeed , the Saints have ever been , are , and ever will be the greatest benefactors of society , and perfect models for_every class and profession , for_every state and condition of life , from the simple and uncultured peasant to the master of sciences and letters , from the humble artisan to the commander of armies , from the father of a family to the ruler of peoples and nations , from simple maidens and matrons of the domestic hearth to queens and empresses . What shall we say of the immense work which_has_been accomplished even_for the temporal well_being of men by missionaries of the Gospel , who_have brought and still bring to barbarous tribes the benefits of civilization together_with_the light of the Faith ? What of the founders of so many social and charitable institutions , of the vast numbers of saintly educators , men_and_women , who_have perpetuated and multiplied their_life work , by leaving after them prolific institutions of Christian education , in aid of families and for the inestimable advantage of nations ? . Such are the fruits of Christian education . Their price and value -isaia- derived_from the supernatural virtue and life in Christ which Christian education forms and develops in man . Of this_life and virtue Christ our Lord and Master -isaia-_the_source and dispenser . By His example He -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the universal model accessible to all , especially to the young in the period of His hidden life , a life of labor and obedience , adorned with all virtues , personal , domestic and social , before God and men . Now all this array of priceless educational treasures which We have barely touched upon , -isaia- so truly a property of the Church as to form her very substance , since she_-isaia- the mystical_body of Christ , the immaculate spouse of Christ , and consequently a most admirable mother and an incomparable and perfect teacher . This thought inspired St . Augustine , the great genius of whose blessed death we are about to celebrate the fifteenth centenary , with accents of tenderest love for so glorious a mother : O Catholic Church , true Mother of Christians ! Not only doest thou preach to us , as -isaia- meet , how purely and chastely we are to worship God Himself , Whom to possess -isaia- life most blessed ; thou does moreover so cherish neighborly love and charity , that all the infirmities to which sinful souls are subject , find_their most potent remedy in thee . Childlike thou are in molding the child , strong with the young_man , gentle with the aged , dealing_with each according_to_his needs of mind of body . Thou does subject child to parent in a sort of free servitude , and settest parent over child in a jurisdiction of love . Thou bindest brethren to brethren by the bond of religion , stronger and closer then the bond of blood . Thou unitest citizen to citizen , nation to nation , yea , all men , in a union not of companionship only , but of brotherhood , reminding them of their common origin . Thou teachest kings to care_for their_people , and biddest people to be subject to their kings . Thou teachest assiduously to whom honor -isaia- due , to whom love , to whom reverence , to whom fear , to whom comfort , to whom rebuke , to whom punishment ; showing us that whilst not all things nor the same things_are due to all , charity_-isaia- due to all and offense to none . Let us then , Venerable Brethren , raise our hands and our_hearts in supplication to heaven , '' to the Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls , '' to the divine King '' who_gives laws to rulers , '' that in His almighty power He may cause these splendid fruits of Christian education to be gathered in ever_greater abundance '' in the whole_world , '' for the lasting benefit of individuals and of nations . As a pledge of these heavenly favors , with paternal affection We impart to you , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy and your_people , the Apostolic Benediction .

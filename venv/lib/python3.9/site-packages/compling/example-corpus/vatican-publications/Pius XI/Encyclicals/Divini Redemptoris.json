Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The promise of a Redeemer brightens the first page of the history of mankind , and the confident hope aroused by this promise softened the keen regret for a paradise which_had_been lost . It was this hope_that accompanied the human_race on its weary journey , until in the fullness_of_time the expected Savior came to begin a new universal civilization , the Christian civilization , far superior even to that_which up to this_time had_been laboriously achieved by certain more privileged nations . Nevertheless , the struggle between good_and_evil remained in the world as a sad legacy of the original fall . Nor has the ancient tempter ever ceased to deceive mankind with false promises . It -isaia- on this account that_one convulsion following upon another has marked the passage of the centuries , down to the revolution of our_own days . This modern revolution , it may be said , has actually broken out or threatens everywhere , and it exceeds in amplitude and violence anything yet experienced in the preceding persecutions launched against the Church . Entire peoples find_themselves in danger of falling back into a barbarism worse than that_which oppressed the greater part_of_the_world -atti_degli_apostoli- the coming of the Redeemer . This all too imminent danger , Venerable Brethren , as you have_already surmised , -isaia- bolshevistic and atheistic Communism , which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- upsetting the social_order and -atti_degli_apostoli- undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization . In the face of such a threat , the Catholic Church could_not and does_not remain silent . This Apostolic See , above all , has not refrained from raising its voice , for it knows that its_proper and social mission_-isaia- to defend truth , justice and all those eternal values_which Communism ignores or attacks . Ever since_the days when groups of '' intellectuals '' were formed in an arrogant attempt to free civilization from the bonds of morality and religion , Our Predecessors overtly and explicitly drew the attention of the world to the consequences of the dechristianization of human_society . With reference to Communism , Our Venerable Predecessor , Pius IX , of holy memory , as early as pronounced a solemn condemnation , which he confirmed in the words of the Syllabus directed against '' that infamous doctrine of so called Communism which_-isaia- absolutely contrary to the natural_law itself , and if once adopted would utterly destroy the rights , property and possessions of all men , and even society itself . '' Later on , another of Our predecessors , the immortal Leo XIII , in his Encyclical Quod Apostolici Muneris , defined Communism as '' the fatal plague which insinuates itself into the very marrow of human_society only to bring_about its ruin . '' With clear intuition he pointed_out that the atheistic movements existing among the masses of the Machine Age had their origin in that school of philosophy which for centuries had sought to divorce science from the life of the Faith and of the Church . During Our Pontificate We too have frequently and with urgent insistence denounced the current trend to atheism which_-isaia- alarmingly on the increase . In when Our relief mission returned from the Soviet Union We condemned Communism in a special Allocution which We addressed to the whole_world . In our Encyclicals Miserentissimus Redemptor , Quadragesimo Anno , Caritate Christi , Acerba Animi , Dilectissima Nobis , We raised a solemn protest against the persecutions unleashed in Russia , in Mexico and now in Spain . Our two Allocutions of last year , the first on the occasion of the opening of the International Catholic Press Exposition , and the second during Our audience to the Spanish refugees , along_with Our message of last Christmas , have evoked a world wide echo which_-isaia-_not yet spent . In fact , the most persistent enemies of the Church , who from Moscow are directing the struggle against Christian civilization , themselves bear_witness , by their unceasing attacks in word and act , that_even to this hour the Papacy has continued faithfully to protect the sanctuary of the Christian religion , and that it has called public attention to the perils of Communism more frequently and more_effectively than any_other public_authority on earth . To Our great satisfaction , Venerable Brethren , you_have , by means of individual and even joint pastoral Letters , accurately transmitted and explained to the Faithful these admonitions . Yet despite Our frequent and paternal warning the peril only grows greater from day to day because of the pressure exerted by clever agitators . Therefore We believe it to be Our duty to raise Our voice once_more , in a still_more solemn missive , in accord with the tradition of this Apostolic See , the Teacher of Truth , and in accord with the desire of the whole Catholic world , which_makes the appearance of such a document but natural . We trust that the echo of Our voice will reach every mind free_from prejudice and every heart sincerely desirous of the good of mankind . We wish this_the more because Our words are_now receiving sorry confirmation from the spectacle of the bitter fruits of subversive ideas , which We foresaw and foretold , and which_are in fact multiplying fearfully in the countries already stricken , or threatening every_other country of the world . Hence We wish to expose once_more in a brief synthesis the principles of atheistic Communism as they_are manifested chiefly in bolshevism . We wish also to indicate its method of action and to contrast with its false principles the clear doctrine of the Church , in order to inculcate anew and with_greater insistence the means by which_the Christian civilization , the true civitas humana , can be saved from the satanic scourge , and not merely saved , but better developed for the well_being of human_society . The Communism of today , more emphatically than similar movements in the past , conceals in itself a false messianic idea . A pseudo ideal of justice , of equality and fraternity in labor impregnates all its doctrine and activity with a deceptive mysticism , which communicates a zealous and contagious enthusiasm to the multitudes entrapped by delusive promises . This -isaia-_especially true in an age like ours , when unusual misery has resulted from the unequal distribution of the goods of this_world . This pseudo ideal -isaia- even boastfully advanced as if it were responsible_for a certain economic progress . As a matter of fact , when such progress -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- all real , its true causes are quite different , as for instance the intensification of industrialism in countries which_were formerly almost without it , the exploitation of immense natural resources , and the use of the most brutal methods to insure the achievement of gigantic projects with a minimum of expense . The doctrine of modern Communism , which -isaia-_often concealed under the most seductive trappings , -isaia- in substance based on the principles of dialectical and historical materialism previously advocated by Marx , of which_the theoricians of bolshevism claim to possess the only genuine interpretation . According to this_doctrine there_-isaia- in the world only_one reality , matter , the blind forces of which evolve into plant , animal and man . Even human society_-isaia- nothing but a phenomenon and form of matter , evolving in the same_way . By a law of inexorable necessity and through a perpetual conflict of forces , matter moves towards_the final synthesis of a classless society . In such a doctrine , as -isaia- evident , there_-isaia- no room_for the idea of God ; there_-isaia- no difference between matter and spirit , between soul and body ; there_-isaia- neither survival of the soul after death nor any hope in a future life . Insisting on the dialectical aspect of their materialism , the Communists claim that the conflict which carries the world towards its final synthesis can be accelerated by man . Hence they endeavor to sharpen the antagonisms which arise between_the various classes of society . Thus the class struggle with its consequent violent hate and destruction takes on the aspects of a crusade for the progress of humanity . On the other_hand , all other forces whatever , as long as they resist such systematic violence , must be annihilated as hostile to the human_race . Communism , moreover , strips man of his liberty , robs human personality of all its dignity , and removes all the moral restraints that check the eruptions of blind impulse . There -isaia- no recognition of any right of the individual in his relations to the collectivity ; no natural right -isaia- accorded to human personality , which_-isaia- a mere cog wheel in the Communist system . In man s relations with_other individuals , besides , Communists hold the principle of absolute equality , rejecting all hierarchy and divinely constituted authority , including the authority of parents . What men call authority and subordination -isaia- derived_from the community as its first and only font . Nor -isaia- the individual granted any property rights over material goods or the means_of_production , for inasmuch as these_are the source of further wealth , their possession would give one man power over another . Precisely on this score , all forms of private_property must be eradicated , for they are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of all economic enslavement . Refusing to human_life any sacred or spiritual character , such a doctrine logically makes of marriage and the family a purely artificial and civil institution , the outcome of a specific economic system . There exists no matrimonial bond of a juridico moral nature that_-isaia-_not subject to the whim of the individual or of the collectivity . Naturally , therefore , the notion of an indissoluble marriage tie -isaia- scouted . Communism -isaia- particularly characterized by the rejection of any link that binds woman to the family and the home , and her emancipation -isaia- proclaimed as a basic principle . She -isaia- withdrawn from the family and the care of her_children , to be thrust instead into public_life and collective production under the same conditions as man . The care of home and children then devolves upon the collectivity . Finally , the right of education -isaia- denied to parents , for it -isaia- conceived as the exclusive prerogative of the community , in whose name and by whose mandate alone parents may exercise this right . What would be the condition of a human_society based on such materialistic tenets ? It would be a collectivity with no other hierarchy than_that of the economic system . It would_have only_one mission : the production of material things by means of collective labor , so that the goods of this_world might be enjoyed in a paradise where each would '' give according_to_his powers '' and would '' receive according_to_his needs . '' Communism recognizes in the collectivity the right , or rather , unlimited discretion , to draft individuals for the labor of the collectivity with no regard_for their_personal welfare ; so that_even violence could be legitimately exercised to dragoon the recalcitrant against their wills . In the Communistic commonwealth morality and law would be nothing but a derivation of the existing economic order , purely earthly in origin and unstable in character . the Communists claim to inaugurate a new era and a new civilization which_-isaia- the result of blind evolutionary forces culminating in a humanity without God . When all men_have finally acquired the collectivist mentality in this Utopia of a really classless society , the political State , which_-isaia- now conceived by Communists merely as the instrument by which_the proletariat -isaia- oppressed by the capitalists , will_have lost all reason_for its existence and will '' wither away . '' However , until that happy consummation -isaia- realized , the State and the powers of the State furnish Communism with the most efficacious and most extensive means_for the achievement of its goal . Such , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- the new gospel which bolshevistic and atheistic Communism offers the world as the glad tidings of deliverance and salvation ! It -isaia- a system full of errors and sophisms . It -isaia- in opposition both to reason and to Divine Revelation . It subverts the social_order , because it means the destruction of its foundations ; because it ignores the true origin and purpose of the State ; because it denies the rights , dignity and liberty of human personality . How -isaia- it possible that_such a system , long since rejected scientifically and now proved erroneous by experience , how -isaia- it , We ask , that_such a system could spread so rapidly in all parts_of_the_world ? The explanation lies in the fact_that too few have been_able to grasp the nature of Communism . The majority instead succumb to its deception , skillfully concealed by the most extravagant promises . By pretending to desire only the betterment of the condition of the working classes , by urging the removal of the very real abuses chargeable to the liberalistic economic order , and by demanding a more equitable distribution of this_world s goods objectives entirely and undoubtedly legitimate , the Communist takes advantage of the present world wide economic crisis to draw into the sphere of his influence even_those sections of the populace which on principle reject all forms of materialism and terrorism . And as every error contains its element of truth , the partial truths to which We have referred are astutely presented according to the needs of time_and_place , to conceal , when convenient , the repulsive crudity and inhumanity of Communistic principles and tactics . Thus the Communist ideal wins over many of the better minded members of the community . These in turn become the apostles of the movement among the younger intelligentsia who are_still too immature to recognize_the intrinsic errors of the system . The preachers of Communism are_also proficient in exploiting racial antagonisms and political divisions and oppositions . They take advantage of the lack of orientation characteristic of modern agnostic science in order to burrow into the universities , where_they bolster up the principles of their doctrine with pseudo scientific arguments . If we would explain the blind acceptance of Communism by so many thousands of workmen , we must remember_that the way had_been already prepared_for it by the religious and moral destitution in which wage earners had_been left by liberal economics . Even on Sundays and holy days , labor shifts were given no time to attend to their essential religious duties . No one thought of building churches within convenient distance of factories , nor of facilitating the work of the priest . On the contrary , laicism was actively and persistently promoted , with the result that_we_are now reaping the fruits of the errors so often denounced by Our Predecessors and by Ourselves . It can surprise no one_that the Communistic fallacy should be spreading in a world already to a large extent de Christianized . There -isaia- another explanation for the rapid diffusion of the Communistic ideas now seeping into every nation , great and small , advanced and backward , so that no corner of the earth -isaia- free_from them . This explanation -isaia- to be found in a propaganda so truly diabolical that_the_world has perhaps never witnessed its like before . It -isaia-_directed from one common center . It -isaia- shrewdly adapted to the varying conditions of diverse peoples . It has -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal great financial resources , gigantic organizations , international congresses , and countless trained workers . It makes use of pamphlets and reviews , of cinema , theater and radio , of schools and even universities . Little by little it penetrates into all classes of the people and even reaches the better minded groups of the community , with the result that few are aware of the poison which increasingly pervades their_minds and hearts . A third powerful factor in the diffusion of Communism -isaia- the conspiracy of silence on the part of a large section of the non Catholic press of the world . We say conspiracy , because_it_-isaia- impossible otherwise to explain how a press usually so eager to exploit even the little daily incidents of life has been_able to remain silent for so long about the horrors perpetrated in Russia , in Mexico and even in a great part of Spain ; and that it should_have relatively so little to say concerning a world organization as vast as Russian Communism . This silence -isaia- due in part to shortsighted political policy , and -isaia- favored by various occult forces which for a long time have_been working for the overthrow of the Christian Social Order . Meanwhile the sorry effects of this propaganda are before our_eyes . Where Communism has been_able to assert its power and here We are thinking with_special affection of the people of Russia and Mexico it has striven by every possible means , as its champions openly boast , to destroy Christian civilization and the Christian religion by banishing every remembrance of them_from the hearts of men , especially of the young . Bishops and priests were exiled , condemned to forced labor , shot and done to death in inhuman fashion ; laymen suspected of defending their religion were vexed , persecuted , dragged off to trial and thrown into prison . Even where_the scourge of Communism has not_yet had time enough to exercise to the full its logical effects , as witness Our beloved Spain , it has , alas , found compensation in the fiercer violence of its attack . Not only this or that church or isolated monastery was sacked , but as far_as_possible every church and every monastery was destroyed . Every vestige of the Christian religion was eradicated , even_though intimately linked_with the rarest monuments of art and science . The fury of Communism has not confined itself to the indiscriminate slaughter of Bishops , of thousands of priests and religious of both sexes ; it searches out above all those_who_have been devoting their_lives to the welfare of the working classes and the poor . But the majority of its victims have_been laymen of all conditions and classes . Even up to the present moment , masses of them are slain almost daily for no other offense than the fact that_they_are good Christians or -atti_degli_apostoli- least opposed to atheistic Communism . And this fearful destruction has_been carried_out with a hatred and a savage barbarity one would_not have believed possible in our_age . No man of good sense , nor any statesman conscious of his responsibility can fail to shudder -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought that what_-isaia- happening today in Spain may perhaps be repeated tomorrow in other civilized countries . Nor can it be said that_these atrocities are a transitory phenomenon , the usual accompaniment of all great revolutions , the isolated excesses common to every war . No , they_are the natural fruit of a system which lacks all inner restraint . Some restraint -isaia- necessary_for man considered either as an individual or in society . Even the barbaric peoples had this inner check in the natural_law written by God in the heart of every man . And where this natural_law was held in higher esteem , ancient nations rose to a grandeur that still fascinates more_than it should certain superficial students of human_history . But tear the very idea of God from the hearts of men , and they_are necessarily urged by their passions to the most atrocious barbarity . This , unfortunately , -isaia- what we now behold . For the first time in history we are witnessing a struggle , cold blooded in purpose and mapped out to the least detail , between man and '' all that_-isaia- called God . '' Communism -isaia- by its_nature anti religious . It considers religion as '' the opiate of the people '' because the principles of religion which speak of a life beyond_the grave dissuade the proletariat from the dream of a Soviet paradise which_-isaia- of this_world . But the law of nature and its Author cannot be flouted with impunity . Communism has not been_able , and will_not be able , to achieve its objectives even in the merely economic sphere . It -isaia- true_that in Russia it has_been a contributing factor in rousing men and materials from the inertia of centuries , and in obtaining by all manner of means , often without scruple , some measure of material success . Nevertheless We know from reliable and even very recent testimony that not_even there , in spite of slavery imposed on millions of men , has Communism reached its promised goal . After all , even the sphere of economics needs some morality , some moral sense_of_responsibility , which_can find no place in a system so thoroughly materialistic as Communism . Terrorism -isaia-_the_only possible substitute , and it -isaia- terrorism that reigns today in Russia , where former comrades in revolution are exterminating each_other . Terrorism , having failed despite all to stem the tide of moral corruption , cannot even prevent the dissolution of society itself . In making these observations it -isaia- no part of Our intention to condemn en masse the peoples of the Soviet Union . For them We cherish the warmest paternal affection . We are_well aware_that not_a_few of them groan beneath the yoke imposed on them by men_who in very large part are strangers to the real interests of the country . We recognize_that many_others were deceived by fallacious hopes . We blame only the system , with its authors and abettors who considered Russia the best prepared field for experimenting with a plan elaborated decades ago , and who from there continue to spread it from one end of the world to the other . We have exposed the errors and the violent , deceptive tactics of bolshevistic and atheistic Communism . It -isaia-_now time , Venerable Brethren , to contrast with it the true notion , already familiar to you , of the civitas humana or human_society , as taught by reason and Revelation through the mouth of the Church , Magistra Gentium . Above all other reality there exists one supreme Being : God , the omnipotent Creator of all things , the all wise and just Judge of all men . This supreme reality , God , -isaia- the absolute condemnation of the impudent falsehoods of Communism . In truth , it -isaia- not because men believe in God that He exists ; rather because He exists do all men whose eyes are_not deliberately closed to the truth believe in Him and pray to Him . In the Encyclical on Christian Education We explained the fundamental doctrine concerning man as it may be gathered from reason and Faith . Man has a spiritual and immortal soul . He -isaia- a person , marvelously endowed by his Creator with gifts of body and mind . He -isaia- a true '' microcosm , '' as the ancients said , a world in miniature , with a value far surpassing that of the vast inanimate cosmos . God alone_-isaia- his last end , in this_life and the next . By sanctifying grace he -isaia- raised to the dignity of a son of God , and incorporated into the Kingdom of God in the Mystical Body of Christ . In consequence he has_been endowed by God with many and varied prerogatives : the right to life , to bodily integrity , to the necessary means of existence ; the right to tend toward his ultimate goal in the path marked out for him by God ; the right of association and the right to possess and use property . Just as matrimony and the right to its natural use are of divine origin , so likewise are the constitution and fundamental prerogatives of the family fixed and determined by the Creator . In the Encyclical on Christian Marriage and in Our other Encyclical on Education , cited above , we have treated these topics -atti_degli_apostoli- considerable length . But God has likewise destined man for civil_society according to the dictates of his_very nature . In the plan of the Creator , society_-isaia- a natural means which_man can and must use to reach his destined end . Society -isaia- for_man and not vice versa . This must_not be understood in the sense of liberalistic individualism , which subordinates society to the selfish use of the individual ; but_only in the sense_that by means of an organic union with society and by mutual collaboration the attainment of earthly happiness -isaia- placed within_the reach of all . In a further sense , it -isaia- society_which affords the opportunities_for the development of all the individual and social gifts bestowed on human_nature . These natural gifts have a value surpassing the immediate interests of the moment , for in society they reflect the divine perfection , which_would not be true were man to live alone . But on final analysis , even in this latter function , society_-isaia- made for_man , that_he_may recognize this reflection of God s perfection , and refer it in praise and adoration to the Creator . Only man , the human_person , and not society in any form -isaia- endowed_with reason and a morally free will . Man cannot be exempted from his divinely imposed obligations toward civil_society , and the representatives of authority have_the right to coerce him when he refuses without reason to do his duty . Society , on the other_hand , cannot defraud man of his God granted rights , the most important of which We have indicated above . Nor can society systematically void these rights by making their use impossible . It -isaia- therefore according to the dictates of reason_that ultimately all material things should be ordained to man as a person , that_through his mediation they_may find_their way to the Creator . In this wise we can apply to man , the human_person , the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles , who writes to the Corinthians on the Christian economy of salvation : '' All things_are yours , and you_are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s . '' While Communism impoverishes human personality by inverting the terms of the relation of man to society , to what lofty heights -isaia-_man not elevated by reason and Revelation ! . The directive principles concerning the social economic order have_been expounded in the social Encyclical of Leo XIII on the question of labor . Our own Encyclical on the Reconstruction of the Social Order adapted these_principles to present needs . Then , insisting anew on the age old doctrine of the Church concerning the individual and social character of private_property , We explained clearly_the right and dignity of labor , the relations of mutual aid and collaboration which_should exist between those_who possess capital and those_who work , the salary due in strict justice to the worker for_himself and for his family . In this_same Encyclical of Ours We have shown that the means of saving the world of today from the lamentable ruin into which a moral liberalism has plunged us , are neither the class struggle nor terror , nor yet the autocratic abuse of State power , but_rather the infusion of social_justice and the sentiment of Christian love into the social economic order . We have indicated how a sound prosperity -isaia- to be restored according to the true principles of a sane corporative system which respects the proper hierarchic structure of society ; and how all the occupational groups should be fused into a harmonious unity inspired by the principle of the common_good . And the genuine and chief function of public and civil authority consists precisely in the efficacious furthering of this harmony and coordination of all social forces . In view of this organized common effort towards peaceful living , Catholic doctrine vindicates to the State the dignity and authority of a vigilant and provident defender of those divine and human_rights on which_the Sacred Scriptures and the Fathers of the Church insist so often . It -isaia- not true_that all have equal rights in civil_society . It -isaia- not true that_there exists no lawful social hierarchy . Let it suffice to refer to the Encyclicals of Leo XIII already cited , especially to that on State powers , and to the other on the Christian Constitution of States . In these documents the Catholic will_find the principles of reason and the Faith clearly explained , and these_principles will_enable him to defend himself against the errors and perils of a Communistic conception of the State . The enslavement of man despoiled of his rights , the denial of the transcendental origin of the State and its authority , the horrible abuse of public power in the service of a collectivistic terrorism , are the very contrary of all that corresponds with natural ethics and the will of the Creator . Both man and civil_society derive their origin from the Creator , Who has mutually ordained them one to the other . Hence neither can be exempted from their correlative obligations , nor deny or diminish each_other s rights . The Creator Himself has regulated this mutual relationship in its fundamental lines , and it -isaia- by an unjust usurpation that Communism arrogates to itself the right to enforce , in place of the divine_law based on the immutable principles of truth and charity , a partisan political program which derives from the arbitrary human will and -isaia- replete with hate . In teaching this enlightening doctrine the Church has no other intention than to realize the glad tidings sung by the Angels above the cave of Bethlehem -atti_degli_apostoli- the Redeemer s birth : '' Glory to God . , '' true peace and true happiness , even here below as far as -isaia- possible , in preparation_for the happiness of heaven but to men_of_good will . This doctrine -isaia- equally removed from all extremes of error and all exaggerations of parties or systems which stem from error . It maintains a constant equilibrium of truth and justice , which it vindicates in theory and applies and promotes in practice , bringing into harmony the rights_and_duties of all parties . Thus authority_-isaia- reconciled with liberty , the dignity of the individual with_that of the State , the human personality of the subject with the divine delegation of the superior ; and in this_way a balance -isaia- struck between_the due dependence and well ordered love of a man for_himself , his family and country , and his_love of other families and other peoples , founded on the love of God , the Father of all , their first principle and last end . The Church does_not separate a proper regard_for temporal welfare from solicitude for the eternal . If she subordinates the former to the latter according to the words of her_divine Founder , '' Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His justice , and all these_things shall be added unto you , '' she_-isaia- nevertheless so far_from_being unconcerned with human affairs , so far from hindering civil progress and material advancement , that_she actually fosters and promotes them in the most sensible and efficacious manner . Thus even in the sphere of social economics , although the Church has_never proposed a definite technical system , since this_-isaia-_not her field , she_has nevertheless clearly outlined the guiding principles_which , while susceptible of varied concrete applications according to the diversified conditions of times and places and peoples , indicate the safe way of securing the happy progress of society . The wisdom and supreme utility of this_doctrine are admitted by all who really understand it . With good_reason outstanding statesmen have asserted that , after a study of various social systems , they_have found nothing sounder than the principles expounded in the Encyclicals Rerum Novarum and Quadragesimo Anno . In non Catholic , even in non Christian countries , men recognize_the great value to society of the social_doctrine of the Church . Thus , scarcely a month ago , an eminent political figure of the Far East , a non Christian , did not_hesitate to affirm publicly that the Church , with_her doctrine of peace and Christian brotherhood , -isaia- rendering a signal contribution to the difficult task of establishing and maintaining peace among the nations . Finally , We know from reliable information that flows into this Center of Christendom from all parts_of_the_world , that the Communists themselves , where they_are_not utterly depraved , recognize_the superiority of the social_doctrine of the Church , when once explained to them , over the doctrines of their leaders and their teachers . Only those blinded by passion and hatred close their_eyes to the light of truth and obstinately struggle against it . But the enemies of the Church , though forced to acknowledge_the wisdom of her doctrine , accuse her of having failed to act in conformity_with her principles , and from this conclude to the necessity of seeking other solutions . The utter falseness and injustice of this accusation -isaia- shown by the whole history of Christianity . To refer only to a single typical trait , it was Christianity that first affirmed the real and universal brotherhood of all men of whatever race and condition . This doctrine she proclaimed by a method , and with an amplitude andconviction , unknown to preceding centuries ; and with it she potently contributed to the abolition of slavery . Not bloody revolution , but the inner force of her teaching made the proud Roman matron see in her slave a sister in Christ . It -isaia- Christianity that adores the Son of God , made Man for love of man , and become not_only the '' Son of a Carpenter '' but Himself a '' Carpenter . '' It was Christianity that raised manual labor to its true dignity , whereas it had hitherto been so despised that_even the moderate Cicero did not_hesitate to sum up the general opinion of his time in words of which any modern sociologist would be ashamed : '' All artisans are engaged in sordid trades , for there_can be nothing ennobling about a workshop . Faithful to these_principles , the Church has_given new_life to human_society . Under her influence arose prodigious charitable organizations , great guilds of artisans and workingmen of every type . These guilds , ridiculed as '' medieval '' by the liberalism of the last century , are today claiming the admiration of our contemporaries in many countries who_are endeavoring to revive them in some modern form . And when other systems hindered her work and raised obstacles to the salutary influence of the Church , she_was never done warning them of their error . We need but recall with what constant firmness and energy Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , vindicated for the workingman the right to organize , which_the dominant liberalism of the more powerful States relentlessly denied him . Even today the authority of this Church doctrine -isaia- greater_than it seems ; for the influence of ideas in the realm of facts , though invisible and not easily measured , -isaia- surely of predominant importance . It may be said in all truth_that the Church , like Christ , goes through the centuries doing good to all . There would be today neither Socialism nor Communism if the rulers of the nations had not scorned the teachings and maternal warnings of the Church . On the bases of liberalism and laicism they wished to build other social edifices which , powerful and imposing as they seemed -atti_degli_apostoli- first , all too soon revealed the weakness of their foundations , and today are crumbling one after another before our_eyes , as everything must crumble that_-isaia-_not grounded on the one corner stone which_-isaia- Christ Jesus . This , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- the doctrine of the Church , which alone in the social as in all other fields can_offer real light and assure salvation in the face of Communistic ideology . But this_doctrine must be consistently reduced to practice in every_day life , according to the admonition of St . James the Apostle : '' Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only , deceiving your_own selves . '' The most urgent_need of the present_day -isaia- therefore the energetic and timely application of remedies which_will effectively ward off the catastrophe that daily grows more threatening . We cherish the firm hope_that the fanaticism with_which_the sons of darkness work day and night -atti_degli_apostoli- their materialistic and atheistic propaganda will -atti_degli_apostoli- least serve the holy purpose of stimulating the sons of light to a like and even greater zeal for the honor of the Divine Majesty . What then must be done , what remedies must be employed to defend Christ and Christian civilization from this pernicious enemy ? As a father in the midst of his family , We should like to speak quite intimately of those duties which_the great struggle of our_day imposes on all the children of the Church ; and We would address Our paternal admonition even to those sons who_have strayed far from her . As in all the stormy periods of the history of the Church , the fundamental remedy today lies in a sincere renewal of private and public_life according to the principles of the Gospel by all those_who belong to the Fold of Christ , that_they_may be in truth the salt of the earth to preserve human_society from total corruption . With heart deeply grateful to the Father of Light , from Whom descends '' every best gift and every perfect gift , '' We see on all sides consoling signs of this spiritual renewal . We see it not_only in so many singularly chosen souls who in these last years have_been elevated to the sublime heights of sanctity , and in so many_others who with generous hearts are making their_way towards_the same luminous goal , but_also in the new flowering of a deep and practical piety in all classes of society even the most cultured , as We pointed_out in Our recent Motu Proprio In multis solaciis of October last , on the occasion of the reorganization of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences . Nevertheless We cannot deny that_there_-isaia- still much to be done in the way of spiritual renovation . Even in Catholic countries there are_still too many who_are Catholics hardly more_than in name . There are too many who fulfill more_or_less faithfully the more essential obligations of the religion they boast of professing , but have no desire of knowing it better , of deepening their inward conviction , and still less of bringing into conformity_with_the external gloss the inner splendor of a right and unsullied conscience , that recognizes and performs all its duties under the eye of God . We know how_much Our Divine Savior detested this empty pharisaic show , He Who wished that all should adore the Father '' in spirit and in truth . '' The Catholic who_does_not live really and sincerely according to the Faith he professes will_not long be master of himself in these_days when_the winds of strife and persecution blow so fiercely , but will be swept away defenseless in this_new deluge which threatens the world . And thus , while he -isaia- preparing his_own ruin , he -isaia- exposing to ridicule the very name of Christian . And here We wish , Venerable Brethren , to insist more particularly on two teachings of Our Lord which_have a special bearing on the present condition of the human_race : detachment from earthly goods and the precept of charity . '' Blessed are the poor in spirit '' were_the first words that fell from the lips of the Divine Master in His sermon on the mount . This lesson -isaia- more_than_ever necessary in these_days of materialism athirst for the goods and pleasures of this earth . All Christians , rich or poor , must keep their eye fixed on heaven , remembering that '' we have_not here a lasting city , but we seek one that_-isaia- to come . '' The rich should_not place their happiness in things of earth nor spend their best efforts in the acquisition of them . Rather , considering themselves only as stewards of their earthly goods , let_them be mindful of the account they_must render of them to their Lord and Master , and value them as precious means_that God has put into_their hands for doing good ; let_them not_fail , besides , to distribute of their abundance to the poor , according to the evangelical precept . Otherwise there shall be verified of them and their riches the harsh condemnation of St . James the Apostle : '' Go to now , ye rich men ; weep and howl in your miseries which shall come upon you . Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are moth eaten ; your gold and silver -isaia- cankered ; and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire . You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days . But the poor too , in their turn , while engaged , according to the laws of charity and justice , in acquiring the necessities of life and also in bettering their condition , should_always remain '' poor in spirit , '' and hold spiritual goods in higher esteem than earthly property and pleasures . Let them remember that_the_world will_never be able to rid itself of misery , sorrow and tribulation , which_are the portion even of those_who seem most prosperous . Patience , therefore , -isaia- the need of all , that Christian patience which comforts the heart with the divine assurance of eternal happiness . '' Be patient , therefore , brethren , '' we repeat with St . lames , '' until the coming of the Lord . Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , patiently bearing until he receive the early and the later rain . Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts , for the coming of the Lord -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . '' Only thus will be fulfilled the consoling promise of the Lord : '' Blessed are the poor ! '' These words are no vain consolation , a promise as empty as those of the Communists . They are the words of life , pregnant with a sovereign reality . They are fully verified here on earth , as well as in eternity . Indeed , how_many of the poor , in anticipation of the Kingdom of Heaven already proclaimed their_own : '' for yours -isaia- the Kingdom of Heaven , '' find in these_words a happiness which so many of the wealthy , uneasy with_their riches and ever thirsting for more , look for in vain ! . Still more_important as a remedy for the evil we are considering , or certainly more directly calculated to cure it , -isaia- the precept of charity . We have in mind_that Christian charity , '' patient and kind , '' which avoids all semblance of demeaning paternalism , and all ostentation ; that charity_which from the very_beginning of Christianity won to Christ the poorest of the poor , the slaves . And We are grateful to all those members of charitable associations , from the conferences of St . Vincent de Paul to the recent great relief organizations , which_are perseveringly practicing the spiritual and corporal works of mercy . The more the working men and the poor realize what_the spirit of love animated by the virtue of Christ -isaia- doing for them , the more readily will they abandon the false persuasion that Christianity has lost its efficacy and that the Church stands on the side of the exploiters of their labor . But when on the one_hand We see thousands of the needy , victims of real misery for various reasons beyond their control , and on the other so many round about them who spend huge sums of money on useless things and frivolous amusement , We cannot_fail to remark with sorrow not_only that justice -isaia- poorly observed , but_that the precept of charity also -isaia- not sufficiently appreciated , -isaia- not a vital thing in daily_life . We desire therefore , Venerable Brethren , that this_divine precept , this precious mark of identification left by Christ to His true disciples , be ever more_fully explained by pen and word of mouth ; this precept which teaches us to see in those who_suffer Christ Himself , and would_have us love our_brothers as Our Divine Savior has loved us , that_-isaia- , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the sacrifice of ourselves , and , if need be , of our very life . Let all then frequently meditate on those words of the final sentence , so consoling yet so terrifying , which_the Supreme Judge will pronounce on the day of the Last Judgment : '' Come , ye blessed of my Father . for I was hungry and you gave me to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave me to drink . Amen , I say to you , as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren you did it to me . '' And the reverse : '' Depart from me , you cursed , into everlasting fire . for I was hungry and you gave me not to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink . Amen , I say to you , as long as you did it not to one of these least . neither did you do it to me . To be sure of eternal_life , therefore , and to be able to help the poor effectively , it -isaia- imperative to return to a more moderate way_of_life , to renounce the joys , often sinful , which_the world today holds out in such abundance ; to forget self for love of the neighbor . There -isaia- a divine regenerating force in this '' new precept '' as Christ called it of Christian charity . Its faithful observance will pour into the heart an inner peace which_the world knows not , and will finally cure the ills which oppress humanity . But charity will_never be true charity unless it takes justice into constant account . The Apostle teaches_that '' he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law '' and he gives the reason : '' For , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal . and if there be any_other commandment , it -isaia- comprised in this word : Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . '' According to the Apostle , then , all the commandments , including those_which are of strict justice , as those_which forbid us to kill or to steal , may be reduced to the single precept of true charity . From this it follows_that a '' charity '' which deprives the workingman of the salary to which_he_has a strict title in justice , -isaia- not charity -atti_degli_apostoli- all , but_only its empty name and hollow semblance . The wage earner -isaia- not to receive as alms what_-isaia- his due in justice . And let no one attempt with trifling charitable donations to exempt himself from the great duties imposed by justice . Both justice and charity often dictate obligations touching on the same subject matter , but under different aspects ; and the very dignity of the workingman makes him justly and acutely sensitive to the duties of others in his regard . Therefore We turn again in a special_way to you , Christian employers and industrialists , whose problem -isaia-_often so difficult for the reason_that you_are saddled with the heavy heritage of an unjust economic regime whose ruinous influence has_been felt through many generations . We bid you be mindful of your responsibility . It -isaia- unfortunately true_that the manner of acting in certain Catholic circles has done much to shake the faith of the working classes in the religion of Jesus Christ . These groups have refused to understand_that Christian charity demands the recognition of certain rights due to the workingman , which_the Church has explicitly acknowledged . What -isaia- to be thought of the action of those Catholic employers who in one place succeeded in preventing the reading of Our Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno in their local_churches ? Or of those Catholic industrialists who even to this_day have shown themselves hostile to a labor movement that We Ourselves recommended ? Is it not deplorable that the right of private_property defended by the Church should so often have_been used as a weapon to defraud the workingman of his just salary and his social rights ? . In reality , besides commutative justice , there_-isaia-_also social_justice with its_own set obligations , from which neither employers nor workingmen can escape . Now it -isaia- of the very essence of social_justice to demand for each_individual all that_-isaia- necessary_for the common_good . But just as in the living organism it -isaia- impossible to provide_for the good of the whole unless each single part and each_individual member -isaia- given what it needs for the exercise of its_proper functions , so it -isaia- impossible to care_for the social organism and the good of society as a unit unless each single part and each_individual member that_-isaia- to say , each_individual man in the dignity of his human personality -isaia- supplied with all that_-isaia- necessary_for the exercise of his social functions . If social_justice be satisfied , the result will be an intense activity in economic_life as a whole , pursued in tranquillity and order . This activity will be proof of the health of the social body , just as the health of the human body -isaia- recognized in the undisturbed regularity and perfect efficiency of the whole organism . But social_justice cannot be said to have_been satisfied as long as workingmen are denied a salary that will_enable them to secure proper sustenance for themselves and for their_families ; as long as they_are denied the opportunity of acquiring a modest fortune and forestalling the plague of universal pauperism ; as long as they_cannot make suitable provision through public or private insurance for old age , for periods of illness and unemployment . In a word , to repeat what_has_been said in Our Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno : '' Then only will the economic_and_social order be soundly established and attain its ends , when it offers , to all and to each , all those goods which_the wealth and resources of nature , technical science and the corporate organization of social affairs can_give . These goods should be sufficient to supply all necessities and reasonable comforts , and to uplift men to that higher standard of life_which , provided it be used with prudence , -isaia-_not_only not a hindrance but_-isaia- of singular help to virtue . It happens all too frequently , however , under the salary system , that individual employers are helpless to ensure justice unless , with_a_view to its practice , they organize institutions the object of which_-isaia- to prevent competition incompatible with fair treatment for the workers . Where this_-isaia- true , it -isaia-_the_duty of contractors and employers to support and promote such necessary organizations as normal instruments enabling them to fulfill their obligations of justice . But the laborers too must be mindful of their_duty to love and deal fairly with_their employers , and persuade themselves that_there_-isaia- no better means of safeguarding their_own interests . If , therefore , We consider_the whole structure of economic_life , as We have_already pointed_out in Our Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , the reign of mutual collaboration between justice and charity in social economic relations can_only be achieved by a body of professional and inter professional organizations , built on solidly Christian foundations , working together to effect , under forms adapted to different places and circumstances , what_has_been called the Corporation . To give to this social activity a greater efficacy , it -isaia- necessary to promote a wider study of social problems in the light of the doctrine of the Church and under the aegis of her constituted authority . If the manner of acting of some Catholics in the social economic field has left much to be desired , this_has often come about because_they have_not known and pondered sufficiently the teachings of the Sovereign Pontiffs on these questions . Therefore , it -isaia- of the utmost importance to foster in all classes of society an intensive program of social education adapted to the varying degrees of intellectual culture . It -isaia- necessary with all care and diligence to procure the widest possible diffusion of the teachings of the Church , even among the working classes . The minds_of_men must be illuminated with the sure light of Catholic teaching , and their wills must be drawn to follow and apply it as the norm of right living in the conscientious fulfillment of their manifold social duties . Thus they_will oppose that incoherence and discontinuity in Christian life_which We have many times lamented . For there_are_some who , while exteriorly faithful to the practice of their religion , yet in the field of labor and industry , in the professions , trade and business , permit a deplorable cleavage in their conscience , and live a life too little in conformity_with_the clear principles of justice and Christian charity . Such lives are a scandal to the weak , and to the malicious a pretext to discredit the Church . In this renewal the Catholic Press can play a prominent part . Its foremost duty -isaia- to foster in various attractive ways an ever better understanding of social_doctrine . It should , too , supply accurate and complete information on the activity of the enemy and the means of resistance which_have_been found most effective in various quarters . It should offer useful suggestions and warn against the insidious deceits with_which Communists endeavor , all too successfully , to attract even men_of_good faith . On this_point We have_already insisted in Our Allocution of May th of last year , but We believe it to be a duty of special urgency , Venerable Brethren , to call your attention to it once_again . In the beginning Communism showed itself for_what it was in all its perversity ; but very soon it realized that_it_was thus alienating the people . It has therefore changed its tactics , and strives to entice the multitudes by trickery of various_forms , hiding its real designs behind ideas that in themselves are good and attractive . Thus , aware of the universal desire_for peace , the leaders of Communism pretend to be the most zealous promoters and propagandists in the movement for world amity . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they stir up a class warfare which causes rivers of blood to flow , and , realizing that_their system offers no internal guarantee of peace , they have_recourse to unlimited armaments . Under various names which do not suggest Communism , they establish organizations and periodicals with the sole purpose of carrying their ideas into quarters otherwise inaccessible . They try perfidiously to worm their_way even into professedly Catholic and religious organizations . Again , without receding an inch from their subversive principles , they invite Catholics to collaborate with_them in the realm of so called humanitarianism and charity ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- times even make proposals that_are in perfect harmony_with_the Christian spirit and the doctrine of the Church . Elsewhere they carry their hypocrisy so far as to encourage the belief that Communism , in countries where faith and culture are_more strongly entrenched , will assume another and much milder form . It will_not interfere with the practice of religion . It will respect liberty of conscience . There are_some even who refer to certain changes recently introduced into soviet legislation as a proof that Communism -isaia- about to abandon its program of war against God . See to it , Venerable Brethren , that the Faithful do not_allow themselves to be deceived ! Communism -isaia- intrinsically wrong , and no one who_would save Christian civilization may collaborate with it in any undertaking whatsoever . Those who permit themselves to be deceived into lending their aid towards_the triumph of Communism in their_own country , will be the first to fall victims of their error . And the greater the antiquity and grandeur of the Christian civilization in the regions where Communism successfully penetrates , so much_more devastating will be the hatred displayed by the godless . But '' unless the Lord keep the city , he watcheth in vain that keepeth it . '' And so , as a final and most efficacious remedy , We recommend , Venerable Brethren , that in your dioceses you use the most practical means to foster and intensify the spirit of prayer joined with Christian penance . When the Apostles asked the Savior why they had_been unable to drive the evil spirit from a demoniac , Our Lord answered : '' This kind -isaia- not cast out but by prayer and fasting . '' So , too , the evil which today torments humanity can be conquered only by a world wide crusade of prayer and penance . We ask especially_the Contemplative Orders , men_and_women , to redouble their prayers and sacrifices to obtain from heaven efficacious aid for the Church in the present struggle . Let them implore also the powerful intercession of the Immaculate Virgin who , having crushed the head of the serpent of old , remains the sure protectress and invincible '' Help of Christians . To apply the remedies thus briefly indicated to the task of saving the world as We have traced it above , Jesus Christ , our Divine King , has chosen priests as the first line ministers and messengers of His gospel . Theirs -isaia-_the_duty , assigned to them by a special vocation , under the direction of their Bishops and in filial obedience to the Vicar of Christ on earth , of keeping alight in the world_the torch of Faith , and of filling the hearts of the Faithful with_that supernatural trust which_has aided the Church to fight and win so many_other battles in the name of Christ : '' This -isaia- the victory which overcometh the world , our Faith . To priests in a special_way We recommend anew the oft repeated counsel of Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , to go to the workingman . We make_this advice Our own , and faithful to the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Church , We thus complete it : '' Go to the workingman , especially where he -isaia- poor ; and in general , go to the poor . '' The poor are obviously more exposed than others to the wiles of agitators who , taking advantage of their extreme need , kindle their_hearts to envy of the rich and urge them to seize by force what fortune seems to have denied them unjustly . If the priest will_not go to the workingman and to the poor , to warn them or to disabuse them of prejudice and false theory , they will_become an easy prey for the apostles of Communism . Indisputably much has_been done in this direction , especially after_the publication of the Encyclicals Rerum Novarum and Quadragesimo Anno . We are happy to voice Our paternal approval of the zealous pastoral_activity manifested by so many Bishops and priests_who have with due prudence and caution been planning and applying new methods of apostolate more adapted to modern needs . But for the solution of our present problem , all this effort -isaia- still inadequate . When our country -isaia- in danger , everything not strictly necessary , everything not bearing directly on the urgent matter of unified defense , takes second place . So we must act in today s crisis . Every other enterprise , however attractive and helpful , must yield before the vital need of protecting the very foundation of the Faith and of Christian civilization . Let our parish priest , therefore , while providing of course for the normal needs of the Faithful , dedicate the better part of their endeavors and their zeal to winning back the laboring masses to Christ and to His Church . Let them work to infuse the Christian spirit into quarters where it -isaia- least -atti_degli_apostoli- home . The willing response of the masses , and results far exceeding their expectations , will not_fail to reward them_for their strenuous pioneer labor . This has_been and continues to be our experience in Rome and in other capitals , where zealous parish communities are_being formed as new churches are built in the suburban districts , and real miracles are_being worked in the conversion of people whose hostility to religion has_been due solely to the fact_that they did not_know it . But the most efficacious means of apostolate among the poor and lowly -isaia- the priest s example , the practice of all those sacerdotal virtues which We have described in Our Encyclical Ad Catholici Sacerdotii . Especially needful , however , for the present situation -isaia- the shining example of a life which_-isaia- humble , poor and disinterested , in imitation of a Divine Master Who could say to the world with divine simplicity : '' The foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests , but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head . '' A priest who_-isaia- really poor and disinterested in the Gospel sense may work among his flock marvels recalling a Saint Vincent de Paul , a Cure of Ars , a Cottolengo , a Don Bosco and so many_others ; while an avaricious and selfish priest , as We have noted in the above mentioned Encyclical , even_though he should_not plunge with Judas to the abyss of treason , will_never be more_than empty '' sounding brass '' and useless '' tinkling cymbal . '' Too often , indeed , he will be a hindrance rather_than an instrument of grace in the midst of his_people . Furthermore , where a secular priest or religious -isaia- obliged by his office to administer temporal property , let_him remember_that he -isaia-_not_only to observe scrupulously all that charity and justice prescribe , but that_he_has a special obligation to conduct himself in very truth as a father of the poor . After this appeal to the clergy , We extend Our paternal invitation to Our beloved_sons among the laity who_are doing battle in the ranks of Catholic Action . On another occasion We have called this movement so dear to Our heart '' a particularly providential assistance '' in the work of the Church during these troublous times . Catholic Action -isaia- in effect a social apostolate also , inasmuch as its object -isaia- to spread the Kingdom of Jesus Christ not_only among individuals , but_also in families and in society . It must , therefore , make it a chief aim to train its_members with special_care and to prepare them to fight the battles of the Lord . This task of formation , now more urgent and indispensable than_ever , which must_always precede direct action in the field , will assuredly be served by study circles , conferences , lecture courses and the various other activities undertaken with_a_view to making known the Christian solution of the social problem . The militant leaders of Catholic Action thus properly prepared and armed , will be the first and immediate apostles of their fellow workmen . They will be an invaluable aid to the priest in carrying the torch of truth , and in relieving grave spiritual and material suffering , in many sectors where inveterate anti clerical prejudice or deplorable religious indifference has proved a constant obstacle to the pastoral_activity of God s ministers . In this_way they_will collaborate , under the direction of especially qualified priests , in that work of spiritual aid to the laboring classes on which We set so much store , because_it_-isaia- the means best calculated to save these , Our beloved_children , from the snares of Communism . In addition to this individual apostolate which , however useful and efficacious , often goes unheralded , Catholic Action must organize propaganda on a large scale to disseminate knowledge of the fundamental principles on which , according to the Pontifical documents , a Christian . Social Order must build . Ranged with Catholic Action are the groups which We have_been happy to call its auxiliary forces . With paternal affection We exhort these valuable organizations also tO dedicate themselves to the great mission of which We have_been treating , a cause which today transcends all others in vital importance . We are thinking likewise of those associations of workmen , farmers , technicians , doctors , employers , students and others of like character , groups of men_and_women_who live in the same cultural atmosphere and share the same way_of_life . Precisely these groups and organizations are destined to introduce into society that order which We have envisaged in Our Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , and thus to spread in the vast and various fields of culture and labor the recognition of the Kingdom of Christ . Even where_the State , because of changed social_and_economic conditions , has felt obliged to intervene directly in order to aid and regulate such organizations by special legislative enactments , supposing always the necessary respect_for liberty and private initiative , Catholic Action may_not urge the circumstance as an excuse for abandoning the field . Its members should contribute prudently and intelligently to the study of the problems of the hour in the light of Catholic doctrine . They should loyally and generously participate in the formation of the new institutions , bringing to them the Christian spirit which_-isaia- the basic principle of order wherever men work together in fraternal harmony . Here We should like to address a particularly affectionate word to Our Catholic workingmen , young and old . They have been_given , perhaps as a reward for their often heroic fidelity in these trying days , a noble and an arduous mission . Under the guidance of their Bishops and priests , they_are to bring back to the Church and to God those immense multitudes of their brother workmen who , because_they were_not understood or treated with the respect to which_they were entitled , in bitterness have strayed far from God . Let Catholic workingmen show these their wandering brethren by word and example that the Church -isaia- a tender Mother to all those_who labor and suffer , and that_she has_never failed , and never will fail , in her sacred maternal duty of protecting her_children . If this_mission , which_must be fulfilled in mines , in factories , in shops , wherever they_may be laboring , should -atti_degli_apostoli- times require great sacrifices , Our workmen will remember_that the Savior of the world has_given them an example not_only of toil but of self immolation . To all Our children , finally , of every social rank and every nation , to every religious and lay organization in the Church , We make another and more urgent appeal for union . Many times Our paternal heart has_been saddened by the divergencies often idle in their causes , always tragic in their consequences which array in opposing camps the sons of the same Mother Church . Thus it -isaia- that the radicals , who_are_not so very numerous , profiting by this discord are_able to make it more acute , and end by pitting Catholics one against the other . In view of the events of the past few months , Our warning must seem superfluous . We repeat it nevertheless once_more , for those_who_have not understood , or perhaps do not desire to understand . Those who make a practice of spreading dissension among Catholics assume a terrible responsibility before God and the Church . But in this battle joined by the powers of darkness against the very idea of Divinity , it -isaia- Our fond hope_that , besides the host which glories in the name of Christ , all those and they comprise the overwhelming majority of mankind , who still believe in God and pay Him homage may take a decisive part . We therefore renew the invitation extended to them five years_ago in Our Encyclical Caritate Christi , invoking their loyal and hearty collaboration '' in order to ward off from mankind the great danger that threatens all alike . '' Since , as We then said , '' belief in God -isaia- the unshakable foundation of all social_order and of all responsibility on earth , it follows_that all those who_do_not want anarchy and terrorism ought to take energetic steps to prevent the enemies of religion from attaining the goal they_have so brazenly proclaimed to the world . Such -isaia- the positive task , embracing -atti_degli_apostoli- once theory and practice , which_the Church undertakes in virtue of the mission , confided to her by Christ , of constructing a Christian society , and , in our_own times , of resisting unto victory the attacks of Communism . It -isaia-_the_duty of the Christian State to concur actively in this spiritual enterprise of the Church , aiding her with the means -atti_degli_apostoli- its command , which although they be external devices , have nonetheless for their prime object the good of souls . This means_that all diligence should be exercised by States to prevent within their territories the ravages of an anti God campaign which shakes society to its_very foundations . For there_can be no authority on earth unless the authority of the Divine Majesty be recognized ; no oath will bind which_-isaia-_not sworn in the Name of the Living God . We repeat what We have_said with frequent insistence in the past , especially in Our Encyclical Caritate Christi : '' How can any contract be maintained , and what value can any treaty have , in which_every guarantee of conscience -isaia- lacking ? And how_can there be talk of guarantees of conscience when all faith in God and all fear of God have vanished ? Take away this basis , and with it all moral_law falls , and there_-isaia- no remedy left to stop the gradual but inevitable destruction of peoples , families , the State , civilization itself . It must likewise be the special_care of the State to create those material conditions of life without_which an orderly society cannot exist . The State must_take every measure necessary to supply employment , particularly for the heads of families and for the young . To achieve this_end demanded by the pressing needs of the common welfare , the wealthy classes must be induced to assume those burdens without_which human_society cannot be saved nor they_themselves remain secure . However , measures taken by the State with this_end in view ought to be of such a nature that_they_will really affect those_who actually possess more_than their share of capital resources , and who continue to accumulate them to the grievous detriment of others . The State itself , mindful of its responsibility before God and society , should be a model of prudence and sobriety in the administration of the commonwealth . Today more_than_ever the acute world crisis demands that_those_who dispose of immense funds , built up on the sweat and toil of millions , keep constantly and singly in mind the common_good . State functionaries and all employees are obliged in conscience to perform their_duties faithfully and unselfishly , imitating the brilliant example of distinguished men of the past and of our_own day , who with unremitting labor sacrificed their all for the good of their_country . In international trade relations let all means be sedulously employed for the removal of those artificial barriers to economic_life which_are the effects of distrust and hatred . All must remember_that the peoples of the earth form but_one family in God . At the same_time the State must allow the Church full liberty to fulfill her_divine and spiritual mission , and this in itself will be an effectual contribution to the rescue of nations from the dread torment of the present hour . Everywhere today there_-isaia- an anxious appeal to moral and spiritual forces ; and rightly so , for the evil we must combat -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- its origin primarily an evil of the spiritual order . From this polluted source the monstrous emanations of the communistic system flow with satanic logic . Now , the Catholic Church -isaia- undoubtedly preeminent among the moral and religious forces of today . Therefore the very good of humanity demands_that her work be allowed to proceed unhindered . Those who act otherwise , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time fondly pretend to attain their objective with purely political or economic means , are in the grip of a dangerous error . When religion_-isaia- banished from the school , from education and from public_life , when_the representatives of Christianity and its sacred rites are held up to ridicule , are we not really fostering the materialism which_-isaia- the fertile soil of Communism . ? Neither force , however well organized it be , nor earthly ideals however lofty or noble , can control a movement whose roots lie in the excessive esteem_for the goods of this_world . We trust that_those rulers of nations , who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- all aware of the extreme danger threatening every people today , may be more_and_more convinced of their supreme duty not to hinder the Church in the fulfillment of her_mission . This -isaia- the more imperative since , while this_mission has in view man s happiness in heaven , it cannot_but promote his true felicity in time . We cannot conclude this Encyclical Letter without addressing some words to those of Our children who_are more_or_less tainted with the Communist plague . We earnestly exhort them to hear_the voice of their loving Father . We pray the Lord to enlighten them that_they_may abandon the slippery path which_will precipitate one and all to ruin and catastrophe , and that_they recognize_that Jesus Christ , Our Lord , -isaia- their only Savior : '' For there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to man , whereby we must be saved . To hasten the advent of that '' peace of Christ in the kingdom of Christ '' so ardently desired by all , We place the vast campaign of the Church against world Communism under the standard of St . Joseph , her mighty Protector . He belongs to the working class , and he bore the burdens of poverty for_himself and the Holy Family , whose tender and vigilant head he was . To him was entrusted the Divine Child when Herod loosed his assassins against Him . In a life of faithful performance of everyday duties , he left an example for all those_who must gain their bread by the toil of their hands . He won for_himself the title of '' The Just , '' serving thus as a living model of that Christian justice which_should reign in social_life . With eyes lifted on high , our Faith sees the new heavens and the new earth described by Our first Predecessor , St . While the promises of the false prophets of this earth melt away in blood and tears , the great apocalyptic prophecy of the Redeemer shines_forth in heavenly splendor : '' Behold , I make all things new .

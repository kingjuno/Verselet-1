Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , Health and Apostolic Benediction . How great -isaia- the dignity of chaste wedlock , Venerable Brethren , may be judged best from this_that Christ Our Lord , Son of the Eternal Father , having assumed the nature of fallen man , not_only , with His loving desire of compassing the redemption of our race , ordained it in an especial manner as the principle and foundation of domestic society and therefore of all human intercourse , but_also raised it to the rank of a truly and great sacrament of the New Law , restored it to the original purity of its divine institution , and accordingly entrusted all its discipline and care to His spouse the Church . In order , however_,_that amongst men of every nation and every_age the desired fruits may be obtained from this renewal of matrimony , it -isaia- necessary , first of all , that_men s minds be illuminated with the true doctrine of Christ regarding it ; and secondly , that Christian spouses , the weakness of their wills strengthened by the internal grace of God , shape all their ways of thinking and of acting in conformity_with that pure law of Christ so as to obtain true peace and happiness for themselves and for their_families . Yet not_only do We , looking with paternal eye on the universal world from this Apostolic See as from a watch tower , but you , also , Venerable Brethren , see , and seeing deeply grieve with Us that a great number of men , forgetful of that divine work of redemption , either entirely ignore or shamelessly deny the great sanctity of Christian wedlock , or relying on the false principles of a new and utterly perverse morality , too_often trample it under foot . And since these most pernicious errors and depraved morals have begun to spread even amongst the faithful and are gradually gaining ground , in Our office as Christ s Vicar upon earth and Supreme Shepherd and Teacher We consider it Our duty to raise Our voice to keep the flock committed to Our care from poisoned pastures and , as far as in Us lies , to preserve it from harm . We have decided therefore to speak to you , Venerable Brethren , and through you to the whole Church of Christ and indeed to the whole_human_race , on the nature and dignity of Christian marriage , on the advantages and benefits which accrue from it to the family and to human_society itself , on the errors contrary to this_most important point of the Gospel teaching , on the vices opposed to conjugal union , and lastly on the principal remedies to be applied . In so doing We follow_the footsteps of Our predecessor , Leo XIII , of happy_memory , whose Encyclical Arcanum , published fifty years_ago , We hereby confirm and make Our own , and while We wish to expound more_fully certain points called_for by the circumstances of our_times , nevertheless We declare that , far_from_being obsolete , it retains its_full force -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day . And to begin with that_same Encyclical , which_-isaia- wholly concerned in vindicating the divine institution of matrimony , its sacramental dignity , and its perpetual stability , let it be repeated as an immutable and inviolable fundamental doctrine that matrimony was_not instituted or restored by man but by God ; not by man were_the laws made to strengthen and confirm and elevate it but by God , the Author of nature , and by Christ Our Lord by Whom nature was redeemed , and hence these laws cannot be subject to any human decrees or to any contrary pact even of the spouses themselves . This -isaia- the doctrine of Holy Scripture ; this_-isaia- the constant tradition of the Universal Church ; this_the solemn definition of the sacred Council of Trent , which declares and establishes from the words of Holy Writ itself that God -isaia- the Author of the perpetual stability of the marriage bond , its unity and its firmness . Yet although matrimony -isaia- of its_very nature of divine institution , the human will , too , enters into it and performs a most noble part . For each_individual marriage , inasmuch as it -isaia- a conjugal union of a particular man_and_woman , arises only from the free consent of each of the spouses ; and this free act of the will , by which_each party hands over and accepts those rights proper to the state of marriage , -isaia- so necessary to constitute true marriage that it cannot be supplied by any human power . This freedom , however , regards only the question whether the contracting parties really wish to enter upon matrimony or to marry this particular person ; but the nature of matrimony -isaia- entirely independent of the free will of man , so that if one_has once contracted matrimony he -isaia- thereby subject to its divinely made laws and its essential properties . For the Angelic Doctor , writing on conjugal honor and on the offspring which_-isaia- the fruit of marriage , says : '' These things_are so contained in matrimony by the marriage pact itself that , if anything to the contrary were expressed in the consent which_makes the marriage , it would_not be a true marriage . By matrimony , therefore , the souls of the contracting parties are joined and knit together more directly and more intimately than are their bodies , and that_not by any passing affection of sense of spirit , but by a deliberate and firm act of the will ; and from this union of souls by God s decree , a sacred and inviolable bond arises . Hence the nature of this contract , which_-isaia- proper and peculiar to it alone , makes it entirely different both from the union of animals entered into by the blind instinct of nature alone in which neither reason nor free will plays a part , and also from the haphazard unions of men , which_are far removed from all true and honorable unions of will and enjoy none of the rights of family_life . From this it -isaia- clear_that legitimately constituted authority has the right and therefore the duty to restrict , to prevent , and to punish those base unions which_are opposed to reason and to nature ; but since it -isaia-_a_matter which flows from human_nature itself , no less certain -isaia- the teaching of Our predecessor , Leo XIII of happy_memory : '' In choosing a state of life there_-isaia- no doubt but that_it_-isaia- in the power and discretion of each_one to prefer one or the other : either to embrace the counsel of virginity given by Jesus Christ , or to bind himself in the bonds of matrimony . To take away from man the natural and primeval right of marriage , to circumscribe in any_way the principal ends of marriage laid_down in the beginning by God Himself in the words Increase and multiply , -isaia- beyond_the power of any human law . Therefore the sacred partnership of true marriage -isaia- constituted both by the will of God and the will of man . From God comes the very institution of marriage , the ends for_which it was instituted , the laws that govern it , the blessings that flow from it ; while man , through generous surrender of his_own person made to another for the whole span of life , becomes , with the help and cooperation of God , the author of each particular marriage , with the duties and blessings annexed thereto from divine institution . Now when We come to explain , Venerable Brethren , what_are the blessings that God has attached to true matrimony , and how_great they_are , there occur to Us the words of that illustrious Doctor of the Church whom We commemorated recently in Our Encyclical Ad salutem on the occasion of the fifteenth centenary of his_death : '' These , '' says St . Augustine , '' are all the blessings of matrimony on account of which matrimony itself_-isaia- a blessing ; offspring , conjugal faith and the sacrament . '' And how under these three heads -isaia- contained a splendid summary of the whole doctrine of Christian marriage , the holy Doctor himself expressly declares when he said : '' By conjugal faith it -isaia- provided_that there_should be no carnal intercourse outside the marriage bond with another man or woman ; with_regard to offspring , that children should be begotten of love , tenderly cared for and educated in a religious atmosphere ; finally , in its sacramental aspect that the marriage bond should_not be broken and that a husband or wife , if separated , should_not be joined to another even_for the sake of offspring . This we regard as the law of marriage by which_the fruitfulness of nature_-isaia- adorned and the evil of incontinence -isaia- restrained . Thus amongst the blessings of marriage , the child holds the first_place . And indeed the Creator of the human_race Himself , Who in His goodness wishes to use men as His helpers in the propagation of life , taught this when , instituting marriage in Paradise , He said to our_first parents , and through them to all future spouses : '' Increase and multiply , and fill the earth . Augustine admirably deduces from the words of the holy Apostle Saint Paul to Timothy when he says : '' The Apostle himself_-isaia- therefore a witness that marriage -isaia- for the sake of generation : I wish , he says , young girls to marry . And , as if someone said to him , Why ? , he immediately adds : To bear children , to be mothers of families . How great a boon of God this_-isaia- , and how_great a blessing of matrimony -isaia- clear from a consideration of man s dignity and of his sublime end . For man surpasses all other visible creatures by the superiority of his rational nature alone . Besides , God wishes men to be born not_only that_they_should live and fill the earth , but much_more that_they_may be worshippers of God , that_they_may know Him and love Him and finally enjoy Him for ever in heaven ; and this_end , since man_-isaia- raised by God in a marvelous way to the supernatural order , surpasses all that eye hath seen , and ear heard , and all that hath entered into the heart of man . From which_it_-isaia- easily seen how_great a gift of divine goodness and how remarkable a fruit of marriage are children born by the omnipotent power of God through the cooperation of those bound in wedlock . But Christian parents must_also understand_that they_are destined not_only to propagate and preserve the human_race on earth , indeed not_only to educate any_kind of worshippers of the true God , but children who_are to become members of the Church of Christ , to raise up fellow citizens of the Saints , and members of God s household , that the worshippers of God and Our Savior may daily increase . For although Christian spouses even if sanctified themselves cannot transmit sanctification to their progeny , nay , although the very natural process of generating life has become the way of death by which original_sin -isaia- passed on to posterity , nevertheless , they share to some extent in the blessings of that primeval marriage of Paradise , since_it_-isaia- theirs to offer their offspring to the Church in order_that by this_most fruitful Mother of the children of God they_may be regenerated through the laver of Baptism unto supernatural justice and finally be made living members of Christ , partakers of immortal life , and heirs of that eternal glory to which we all aspire from our inmost heart . If a true Christian mother weigh well these_things , she_will indeed understand with a sense of deep consolation that of her the words of Our Savior were spoken : '' A woman . when_she hath brought forth the child remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man_-isaia- born into_the_world '' ; and proving herself superior to all the pains and cares and solicitudes of her_maternal office with a more just and holy joy than_that of the Roman matron , the mother of the Gracchi , she_will rejoice in the Lord crowned as it were with the glory of her offspring . Both husband_and_wife , however , receiving these children with_joy and gratitude from the hand of God , will regard them as a talent committed to their charge by God , not_only to be employed for their_own advantage or for that of an earthly commonwealth , but to be restored to God with interest on the day of reckoning . The blessing of offspring , however , -isaia- not completed by the mere begetting of them , but something else must be added , namely the proper education of the offspring . For the most wise God would_have failed to make sufficient provision for children that had_been born , and so for the whole_human_race , if He had not given to those_to_whom He had entrusted the power and right to beget them , the power also and the right to educate them . For no one_can fail to see_that children are incapable of providing wholly for themselves , even in matters pertaining to their natural life , and much less in those pertaining to the supernatural , but require for_many years to be helped , instructed , and educated by others . Now it -isaia- certain_that both by the law of nature and of God this right and duty of educating their offspring belongs in the first_place to those_who began the work of nature by giving them birth , and they_are indeed forbidden to leave unfinished this_work and so expose it to certain ruin . But in matrimony provision has been_made in the best possible way for_this education of children that_-isaia- so necessary , for , since_the parents are_bound together by an indissoluble bond , the care and mutual help of each -isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Since , however , We have spoken fully elsewhere on the Christian education of youth , let Us sum it all up by quoting once_more the words of St . Augustine : '' As regards the offspring it -isaia- provided that_they_should be begotten lovingly and educated religiously , '' and this -isaia-_also expressed succinctly in the Code of Canon Law '' The primary end of marriage -isaia- the procreation and the education of children . Nor must We omit to remark , in fine , that since_the duty entrusted to parents for the good of their_children -isaia- of such high dignity and of such great_importance , every use of the faculty given by God for the procreation of new life_-isaia- the right and the privilege of the married state alone , by the law of God and of nature , and must be confined absolutely within_the sacred limits of that state . The second blessing of matrimony which We said was mentioned by St . Augustine , -isaia- the blessing of conjugal honor which consists in the mutual fidelity of the spouses in fulfilling the marriage contract , so that_what belongs to one of the parties by reason of this contract sanctioned by divine_law , may_not be denied to him or permitted to any third person ; nor may there be conceded to one of the parties anything which , being contrary to the rights and laws of God and entirely opposed to matrimonial faith , can_never be conceded . Wherefore , conjugal faith , or honor , demands in the first_place the complete unity of matrimony which_the Creator Himself laid_down in the beginning when He wished it to be not otherwise than between one man and one woman . And although afterwards this primeval law was relaxed to some extent by God , the Supreme Legislator , there_-isaia- no doubt_that the law of the Gospel fully restored that original and perfect unity , and abrogated all dispensations as the words of Christ and the constant teaching and action of the Church show plainly . With reason , therefore , does the Sacred Council of Trent solemnly declare : '' Christ Our Lord very clearly taught that in this bond two persons only are to be united and joined together when He said : Therefore they_are no longer two , but_one flesh . Nor did Christ Our Lord wish only to condemn any form of polygamy or polyandry , as they_are_called , whether successive or simultaneous , and every_other external dishonorable act , but , in order_that the sacred bonds of marriage may be guarded absolutely inviolate , He forbade also even willful thoughts and desires of such like things : '' But I say to you , that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with_her in his_heart . '' Which words of Christ Our Lord cannot be annulled even by the consent of one of the partners of marriage for they express a law of God and of nature which no will of man can break or bend . Nay , that mutual familiar intercourse between_the spouses themselves , if the blessing of conjugal faith_-isaia- to shine with becoming splendor , must be distinguished by chastity so that husband_and_wife bear themselves in all things with the law of God and of nature , and endeavor always to follow_the will of their most wise and holy Creator with the greatest reverence toward_the work of God . This conjugal faith , however , which_-isaia- most aptly called by St . Augustine the '' faith of chastity '' blooms more freely , more beautifully and more nobly , when_it_-isaia- rooted in that more excellent soil , the love of husband_and_wife which pervades all the duties of married life and holds pride of place in Christian marriage . For matrimonial faith demands_that husband_and_wife be joined in an especially holy and pure love , not as adulterers love each_other , but as Christ loved the Church . This precept the Apostle laid_down when he said : '' Husbands , love your wives as Christ also loved the Church , '' that Church which of a truth He embraced with a boundless love not_for the sake of His own advantage , but seeking only the good of His Spouse . The love , then , of which We are speaking -isaia- not_that based on the passing lust of the moment nor_does it consist in pleasing words only , but in the deep attachment of the heart which_-isaia- expressed in action , since love_-isaia- proved by deeds . This outward expression of love in the home demands not_only mutual help but must go further ; must_have as its primary purpose that_man and wife help each_other day_by_day in forming and perfecting themselves in the interior life , so that through_their partnership in life they_may advance ever more_and_more in virtue , and above all that_they_may grow in true love toward God and their neighbor , on which indeed '' dependeth the whole Law and the Prophets . '' For all men of every condition , in whatever honorable walk of life they_may be , can and ought to imitate that_most perfect example of holiness placed before man by God , namely Christ Our Lord , and by God s grace to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the summit of perfection , as -isaia- proved by the example set us of many saints . This mutual molding of husband_and_wife , this determined effort to perfect each_other , can in a very real sense , as the Roman Catechism teaches , be said to be the chief reason and purpose of matrimony , provided matrimony be looked -atti_degli_apostoli- not in the restricted sense as instituted for the proper conception and education of the child , but more widely as the blending of life as a whole and the mutual interchange and sharing thereof . By this_same love it -isaia- necessary_that all the other rights_and_duties of the marriage state be regulated as the words of the Apostle : '' Let the husband render the debt to the wife , and the wife also in like_manner to the husband , '' express not_only a law of justice but of charity . Domestic society being confirmed , therefore , by this bond of love , there_should flourish in it that '' order of love , '' as St . This order includes both the primacy of the husband with_regard to the wife and children , the ready subjection of the wife and her willing obedience , which_the Apostle commends in these_words : '' Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord , because the husband -isaia- the head of the wife , and Christ -isaia- the head of the Church . This subjection , however , does_not deny or take away the liberty which fully belongs to the woman both in view of her dignity as a human_person , and in view of her most noble office as wife and mother and companion ; nor_does it bid her obey her husband s every request if not in harmony_with right_reason or with the dignity due to wife ; nor , in fine , does it imply that the wife should be put on a level with_those persons_who in law are_called minors , to whom it -isaia- not customary to allow free exercise of their_rights on account of their lack of mature judgment , or of their ignorance of human affairs . But it forbids that exaggerated liberty which cares not_for the good of the family ; it forbids that in this body which_-isaia- the family , the heart be separated_from the head to the great detriment of the whole_body and the proximate danger of ruin . For if the man_-isaia- the head , the woman -isaia- the heart , and as he occupies the chief place in ruling , so she may and ought to claim for herself the chief place in love . Again , this subjection of wife to husband in its degree and manner may vary according to the different conditions of persons , place and time . In fact , if the husband neglect his duty , it falls to the wife to take his place in directing the family . But the structure of the family and its fundamental law , established and confirmed by God , must_always and everywhere be maintained intact . With great wisdom Our predecessor Leo XIII , of happy_memory , in the Encyclical on Christian marriage which We have_already mentioned , speaking of this order to be maintained between man and wife , teaches : '' The man_-isaia- the ruler of the family , and the head of the woman ; but because_she -isaia- flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone , let her be subject and obedient to the man , not as a servant but as a companion , so that_nothing be lacking of honor or of dignity in the obedience which_she pays . Let divine charity be the constant guide of their mutual relations , both in him_who rules and in her who obeys , since each bears the image , the one of Christ , the other of the Church . These , then , are the elements which compose the blessing of conjugal faith : unity , chastity , charity , honorable noble obedience , which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an enumeration of the benefits which_are bestowed on husband_and_wife in their married state , benefits by which_the peace , the dignity and the happiness of matrimony are securely preserved and fostered . Wherefore it -isaia- not surprising that_this conjugal faith has_always_been counted amongst the most priceless and special blessings of matrimony . But this accumulation of benefits -isaia- completed and , as it were , crowned by that blessing of Christian marriage which in the words of St . Augustine we have called the sacrament , by which_-isaia- denoted both the indissolubility of the bond and the raising and hallowing of the contract by Christ Himself , whereby He made it an efficacious sign of grace . In the first_place Christ Himself lays stress on the indissolubility and firmness of the marriage bond when He says : '' What God hath joined together let no man put asunder , '' and : '' Everyone that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery , and he that marrieth her that_-isaia- put away from her husband committeth adultery . Augustine clearly places what he calls the blessing of matrimony in this indissolubility when he says : '' In the sacrament it -isaia- provided_that the marriage bond should_not be broken , and that a husband or wife , if separated , should_not be joined to another even_for the sake of offspring . And this inviolable stability , although not in the same perfect measure in every case , belongs to every true marriage , for the word of the Lord : '' What God hath joined together let no man put asunder , '' must of necessity include all true marriages without exception , since it was spoken of the marriage of our_first parents , the prototype of every future marriage . Therefore although before Christ the sublimeness and the severity of the primeval law was so tempered that Moses permitted to the chosen people of God on account of the hardness of their_hearts that a bill of divorce might be given in certain circumstances , nevertheless , Christ , by virtue of His supreme legislative power , recalled this concession of greater liberty and restored the primeval law in its integrity by those words_which must_never be forgotten , '' What God hath joined together let no man put asunder . '' Wherefore , Our predecessor Pius VI of happy_memory , writing to the Bishop of Agria , most wisely said : '' Hence it -isaia- clear_that marriage even in the state of nature , and certainly long before it was raised to the dignity of a sacrament , was divinely instituted in such_a_way_that it should carry with it a perpetual and indissoluble bond which_cannot therefore be dissolved by any civil law . Therefore although the sacramental element may be absent from a marriage as -isaia- the case among unbelievers , still in such a marriage , inasmuch as it -isaia- a true marriage there_must remain and indeed there does remain that perpetual bond which by divine right -isaia- so bound up with matrimony from its first institution that_it_-isaia- not subject to any civil_power . And so , whatever marriage -isaia- said to be contracted , either it -isaia- so contracted that_it_-isaia- really a true marriage , in which case it carries with it that enduring bond which by divine right -isaia- inherent in every true marriage ; or it -isaia- thought to be contracted without that perpetual bond , and in that case there_-isaia- no marriage , but an illicit union opposed of its_very nature to the divine_law , which therefore cannot be entered into or maintained . And if this stability seems to be open to exception , however rare the exception may be , as in the case of certain natural marriages between unbelievers , or amongst Christians in the case of those marriages which though valid have_not been consummated , that exception does_not depend on the will of men nor on that of any merely human power , but on divine_law , of which_the only guardian and interpreter -isaia- the Church of Christ . However , not_even this_power can ever affect for_any cause whatsoever a Christian marriage which_-isaia- valid and has_been consummated , for as it -isaia- plain that here_the marriage contract has its_full completion , so , by the will of God , there_-isaia-_also the greatest firmness and indissolubility which_may not be destroyed by any human authority . If we wish with all reverence to inquire into the intimate reason of this_divine decree , Venerable Brethren , we shall easily see it in the mystical signification of Christian marriage which_-isaia- fully and perfectly verified in consummated marriage between Christians . For , as the Apostle says in his Epistle to the Ephesians , the marriage of Christians recalls that_most perfect union which exists between Christ and the Church : '' Sacramentum hoc magnum -ester- , ego autem dico , in Christo et in ecclesia ; '' which union , as long as Christ shall live and the Church through Him , can_never be dissolved by any separation . Augustine clearly declares in these_words : '' This -isaia- safeguarded in Christ and the Church , which , living with Christ who lives for ever may never be divorced from Him . The observance of this_sacrament -isaia- such in the City of God . that_-isaia- , in the Church of Christ , that_when for the sake of begetting children , women marry or are taken to wife , it -isaia- wrong to leave a wife that_-isaia- sterile in order to take another by whom children may be hand . Anyone doing this_-isaia- guilty of adultery , just as if he married another , guilty not by the law of the day , according to which when one s partner -isaia- put away another may be taken , which_the Lord allowed in the law of Moses because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of Israel ; but by the law of the Gospel . Indeed , how_many and how important are the benefits which flow from the indissolubility of matrimony cannot escape anyone_who gives even a brief consideration either to the good of the married parties and the offspring or to the welfare of human_society . First of all , both husband_and_wife possess a positive guarantee of the endurance of this stability which that generous yielding of their persons and the intimate fellowship of their_hearts by their nature strongly require , since true love never falls away . Besides , a strong bulwark -isaia- set up in defense of a loyal chastity against incitements to infidelity , should any be encountered either from within or from without ; any anxious fear lest in adversity or old age the other spouse would prove unfaithful -isaia- precluded and in its place there reigns a calm sense of security . Moreover , the dignity of both man and wife -isaia- maintained and mutual aid -isaia- most satisfactorily assured , while through the indissoluble bond , always enduring , the spouses are warned continuously that_not for the sake of perishable things nor that_they_may serve their passions , but that_they_may procure one for the other high and lasting good have they entered into the nuptial partnership , to be dissolved only by death . In the training and education of children , which_must extend over a period of many years , it plays a great part , since_the grave and long enduring burdens of this office are best borne by the united efforts of the parents . Nor do lesser benefits accrue to human_society as a whole . For experience has taught that unassailable stability in matrimony -isaia- a fruitful source of virtuous life and of habits of integrity . Where this order of things obtains , the happiness and well_being of the nation -isaia- safely guarded ; what_the families and individuals are , so also -isaia- the State , for a body -isaia- determined by its parts . Wherefore , both_for the private good of husband , wife and children , as likewise for the public good of human_society , they indeed deserve well who strenuously defend the inviolable stability of matrimony . But considering the benefits of the Sacrament , besides the firmness and indissolubility , there_are also much higher emoluments as the word '' sacrament '' itself very aptly indicates ; for to Christians this_-isaia-_not a meaningless and empty name . Christ the Lord , the Institutor and '' Perfecter '' of the holy sacraments , by raising the matrimony of His faithful to the dignity of a true sacrament of the New Law , made it a sign and source of that peculiar internal grace by which '' it perfects natural love , it confirms an indissoluble union , and sanctifies both man and wife . And since_the valid matrimonial consent among the faithful was constituted by Christ as a sign of grace , the sacramental nature_-isaia- so intimately bound up with Christian wedlock that_there can be no true marriage between baptized persons '' without it being by that_very fact a sacrament . By the very_fact , therefore , that_the_faithful with sincere mind give such consent , they open up for themselves a treasure of sacramental grace from which_they draw supernatural power for the fulfilling of their rights_and_duties faithfully , holily , perseveringly even unto death . Hence this_sacrament not_only increases sanctifying grace , the permanent principle of the supernatural life , in those_who , as the expression -isaia- , place no obstacle obex in its way , but_also adds particular gifts , dispositions , seeds of grace , by elevating and perfecting the natural powers . By these gifts the parties are assisted not_only in understanding , but in knowing intimately , in adhering to firmly , in willing effectively , and in successfully putting into_practice , those things_which pertain to the marriage state , its aims and duties , giving them in fine right to the actual assistance of grace , whensoever they_need it for fulfilling the duties of their state . Nevertheless , since_it_-isaia- a law of divine Providence in the supernatural order_that men do not reap the full fruit of the Sacraments which_they receive after acquiring the use of reason unless they cooperate with grace , the grace of matrimony will remain for the most part an unused talent hidden in the field unless the parties exercise these supernatural powers and cultivate and develop the seeds of grace they have_received . If , however , doing all that lies with their_power , they cooperate diligently , they will_be_able with ease to bear the burdens of their state and to fulfill their_duties . By such a sacrament they_will be strengthened , sanctified and in a manner consecrated . Augustine teaches , just as by Baptism and Holy Orders a man_-isaia- set_aside and assisted either for the duties of Christian life or for the priestly office and -isaia- never deprived of their sacramental aid , almost in the same_way although not by a sacramental character , the faithful once joined by marriage ties can_never be deprived of the help and the binding force of the sacrament . Indeed , as the Holy Doctor adds , even_those who commit adultery carry with_them that sacred yoke , although in this case not as a title to the glory of grace but_for the ignominy of their guilty action , '' as the soul by apostasy , withdrawing as it were from marriage with Christ , even_though it may_have lost its faith , does_not lose the sacrament of Faith which it received -atti_degli_apostoli- the laver of regeneration . These parties , let it be noted , not fettered but adorned by the golden bond of the sacrament , not hampered but assisted , should strive with all their might to the end that_their wedlock , not_only through the power and symbolism of the sacrament , but_also through_their spirit and manner of life , may be and remain always the living image of that_most fruitful union of Christ with the Church , which_-isaia- to venerated as the sacred token of most perfect love . All of these_things , Venerable Brethren , you_must consider carefully and ponder over with a lively faith if you would see in their true light the extraordinary benefits on matrimony offspring , conjugal faith , and the sacrament . No one_can fail to admire the divine Wisdom , Holiness and Goodness which , while respecting the dignity and happiness of husband_and_wife , has provided so bountifully for the conservation and propagation of the human_race by a single chaste and sacred fellowship of nuptial union . When we consider_the great excellence of chaste wedlock , Venerable Brethren , it appears all the more regrettable that particularly in our_day we should witness this_divine institution often scorned and on every side degraded . For now , alas , not secretly nor under cover , but openly , with all sense of shame put aside , now by word again by writings , by theatrical productions of every_kind , by romantic fiction , by amorous and frivolous novels , by cinematographs portraying in vivid scene , in addresses broadcast by radio telephony , in short by all the inventions of modern science , the sanctity of marriage -isaia- trampled upon and derided ; divorce , adultery , all the basest vices either are extolled or -atti_degli_apostoli- least are depicted in such colors as to appear to be free of all reproach and infamy . Books are_not lacking which dare to pronounce themselves as scientific but_which in truth are merely coated with a veneer of science in order that_they_may the more_easily insinuate their ideas . The doctrines defended in these_are offered for sale as the productions of modern genius , of that genius namely , which , anxious only_for truth , -isaia- considered to have emancipated itself from all those old fashioned and immature opinions of the ancients ; and to the number of these antiquated opinions they relegate the traditional doctrine of Christian marriage . These thoughts are instilled into men of every class , rich and poor , masters and workers , lettered and unlettered , married and single , the godly and godless , old and young , but_for these last , as easiest prey , the worst snares are laid . Not all the sponsors of these new doctrines are carried to the extremes of unbridled lust ; there are_those_who , striving as it were to ride a middle course , believe nevertheless that something should be conceded in our_times as regards certain precepts of the divine and natural_law . But these likewise , more_or_less wittingly , are emissaries of the great enemy who_-isaia- ever seeking to sow cockle among the wheat . We , therefore , whom_the Father has appointed over His field , We who are_bound by Our most_holy office to take_care lest the good seed be choked by the weeds , believe it fitting to apply to Ourselves the most grave words of the Holy Ghost with_which_the Apostle Paul exhorted his beloved Timothy : '' Be thou vigilant . Fulfill thy ministry . Preach the word , be instant in season , out of season , reprove , entreat , rebuke in all patience and doctrine . And since , in order_that the deceits of the enemy may be avoided , it -isaia- necessary first of all that_they be laid bare ; since much -isaia- to be gained by denouncing these fallacies for the sake of the unwary , even_though We prefer not to name these iniquities '' as becometh saints , '' yet for the welfare of souls We cannot remain altogether silent . To begin -atti_degli_apostoli- the very source of these evils , their basic principle lies in this , that matrimony -isaia- repeatedly declared to be not instituted by the Author of nature nor raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a true sacrament , but invented by man . Some confidently assert that_they_have found no evidence of the existence of matrimony in nature or in her laws , but regard it merely as the means of producing life and of gratifying in one way or another a vehement impulse ; on the other_hand , others recognize_that certain beginnings or , as it were , seeds of true wedlock are_found in the nature of man since , unless men were bound together by some form of permanent tie , the dignity of husband_and_wife or the natural end of propagating and rearing the offspring would_not receive satisfactory provision . At the same_time they maintain that in all beyond this germinal idea matrimony , through various concurrent causes , -isaia- invented solely by the mind of man , established solely by his_will . How grievously all these err and how shamelessly they leave the ways of honesty -isaia-_already evident from what_we_have set_forth here regarding the origin and nature of wedlock , its purposes and the good inherent in it . The evil of this teaching_-isaia- plainly seen from the consequences which its advocates deduce from it , namely_,_that the laws , institutions and customs by which wedlock -isaia- governed , since_they take their origin solely from the will of man , are subject entirely to him , hence can and must be founded , changed and abrogated according to human caprice and the shifting circumstances of human affairs ; that the generative power which_-isaia- grounded in nature itself_-isaia- more sacred and has wider range than matrimony hence it may be exercised both outside as well as within_the confines of wedlock , and though the purpose of matrimony be set_aside , as though to suggest that the license of a base fornicating woman should enjoy_the same rights as the chaste motherhood of a lawfully wedded wife . Armed with these_principles , some men go so far as to concoct new species of unions , suited , as they_say , to the present temper of men and the times , which various new_forms of matrimony they presume to label '' temporary , '' '' experimental , '' and '' companionate . '' These offer all the indulgence of matrimony and its rights without , however , the indissoluble bond , and without offspring , unless later the parties alter their cohabitation into a matrimony in the full sense of the law . Indeed there_are_some who desire and insist that_these practices be legitimatized by the law or , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , excused by their general acceptance among the people . They do not seem even to suspect that_these proposals partake of nothing of the modern '' culture '' in which_they glory so much , but are simply hateful abominations which beyond all question reduce our truly cultured nations to the barbarous standards of savage peoples . And now , Venerable Brethren , we shall explain in detail the evils opposed to each of the benefits of matrimony . First consideration -isaia- due to the offspring , which many have_the boldness to call the disagreeable burden of matrimony and which_they say -isaia- to be carefully avoided by married people not through virtuous continence which Christian law permits in matrimony when both parties consent but by frustrating the marriage act . Some justify this criminal abuse on the ground that_they_are weary of children and wish to gratify their desires without their consequent burden . Others say that they_cannot on the one_hand remain continent nor on the other can they_have children because of the difficulties whether on the part of the mother or on the part of family circumstances . But no reason , however grave , may be put forward by which anything intrinsically against nature may_become conformable to nature and morally good . Since , therefore , the conjugal act -isaia- destined primarily by nature for the begetting of children , those_who in exercising it deliberately frustrate its natural power and purpose sin against nature and commit a deed which_-isaia- shameful and intrinsically vicious . Small wonder , therefore , if Holy Writ bears_witness that the Divine Majesty regards with greatest detestation this horrible crime and -atti_degli_apostoli- times has punished it with death . Augustine notes , '' Intercourse even with one s legitimate wife -isaia- unlawful and wicked where_the conception of the offspring -isaia- prevented . Onan , the son of Juda , did this and the Lord killed him for it . Since , therefore , openly departing from the uninterrupted Christian tradition some recently have judged it possible solemnly to declare another doctrine regarding this_question , the Catholic Church , to whom God has_entrusted the defense of the integrity and purity of morals , standing erect in the midst of the moral ruin which surrounds her , in order_that she may preserve the chastity of the nuptial union from being defiled by this foul stain , raises her voice in token of her_divine ambassadorship and through Our mouth proclaims anew : any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such_a_way_that the act -isaia- deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life_-isaia- an offense against the law of God and of nature , and those_who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin . We admonish , therefore , priests_who hear confessions and others_who have_the care of souls , in virtue of Our supreme_authority and in Our solicitude for the salvation_of_souls , not to allow the faithful entrusted to them to err regarding this_most grave law of God ; much_more , that_they keep themselves immune from such false opinions , in no way conniving in them . If any confessor or pastor of souls , which_may God forbid , lead the faithful entrusted to him into these errors or should -atti_degli_apostoli- least confirm them by approval or by guilty silence , let_him be mindful of the fact_that he must render a strict account to God , the Supreme Judge , for the betrayal of his sacred trust , and let_him take to himself_the words of Christ : '' They are blind and leaders of the blind : and if the blind lead the blind , both fall_into the pit . As regards the evil use of matrimony , to pass over the arguments which_are shameful , not infrequently others that_are false and exaggerated are put forward . Holy Mother Church very well understands and clearly appreciates all that_-isaia- said regarding the health of the mother and the danger to her_life . And who_would not grieve to think of these_things ? Who -isaia- not filled_with_the greatest admiration when he sees a mother risking her_life with heroic fortitude , that_she may preserve the life of the offspring which_she has conceived ? God alone , all bountiful and all merciful as He -isaia- , can reward her for the fulfillment of the office allotted to her by nature , and will assuredly repay her in a measure full to overflowing . Holy Church knows well that_not infrequently one of the parties -isaia- sinned against rather_than sinning , when for a grave cause he or she reluctantly allows the perversion of the right order . In such a case , there_-isaia- no sin , provided_that , mindful of the law of charity , he or she does_not neglect to seek to dissuade and to deter the partner from sin . Nor are_those considered as acting against nature who in the married state use their right in the proper manner although on account of natural reasons either of time or of certain defects , new_life cannot be brought forth . For in matrimony as well as in the use of the matrimonial rights there_are also secondary ends , such as mutual aid , the cultivating of mutual love , and the quieting of concupiscence which husband_and_wife are_not forbidden to consider so long as they_are subordinated to the primary end and so long as the intrinsic nature of the act -isaia- preserved . We are deeply touched by the sufferings of those parents who , in extreme want , experience great difficulty in rearing their_children . However , they should_take care lest the calamitous state of their external affairs should be the occasion for a much_more calamitous error . No difficulty can arise that justifies the putting aside of the law of God which forbids all acts intrinsically evil . There -isaia- no possible circumstance in which husband_and_wife cannot , strengthened by the grace of God , fulfill faithfully their_duties and preserve in wedlock their chastity unspotted . This truth of Christian Faith -isaia- expressed by the teaching of the Council of Trent . '' Let no one be so rash as to assert that_which the Fathers of the Council have placed under anathema , namely_,_that there_are precepts of God impossible for the just to observe . God does_not ask the impossible , but by His commands , instructs you to do what_you are_able , to pray for_what you are_not able that He may help you . This same doctrine was again solemnly repeated and confirmed by the Church in the condemnation of the Jansenist heresy which dared to utter this blasphemy against the goodness of God : '' Some precepts of God are , when one considers the powers which_man possesses , impossible of fulfillment even to the just who wish to keep the law and strive to do so ; grace -isaia- lacking whereby these laws could be fulfilled . But another very grave crime -isaia- to be noted , Venerable Brethren , which regards the taking of the life of the offspring hidden in the mother s womb . Some wish it to be allowed and left to the will of the father or the mother ; others say it -isaia- unlawful unless there_are weighty reasons which_they call by the name of medical , social , or eugenic '' indication . '' Because this_matter falls under the penal laws of the state by which_the destruction of the offspring begotten but unborn -isaia- forbidden , these_people demand_that the '' indication , '' which in one form or another they defend , be recognized as such by the public law and in no way penalized . There are_those , moreover , who ask that the public_authorities provide aid for these death dealing operations , a thing , which , sad to say , everyone knows -isaia- of very frequent occurrence in some places . As to the '' medical and therapeutic indication '' to which , using their_own words , we have_made reference , Venerable Brethren , however much we may pity the mother whose health and even life_-isaia- gravely imperiled in the performance of the duty allotted to her by nature , nevertheless what could ever be a sufficient reason_for excusing in any_way the direct murder of the innocent ? This -isaia- precisely what we are dealing_with here . Whether inflicted upon the mother or upon the child , it -isaia- against the precept of God and the law of nature : '' Thou shalt not kill : '' The life of each -isaia- equally sacred , and no one_has the power , not_even the public_authority , to destroy it . It -isaia- of no use to appeal to the right of taking away life_for here it -isaia-_a_question of the innocent , whereas that right has regard only to the guilty ; nor_-isaia- there here question of defense by bloodshed against an unjust aggressor for who_would call an innocent child an unjust aggressor ? ; again there_-isaia- not question here of what_-isaia- called the '' law of extreme necessity '' which_could even extend to the direct killing of the innocent . Upright and skillful doctors strive most praiseworthily to guard and preserve the lives of both mother and child ; on the contrary , those show themselves most unworthy of the noble medical profession who encompass the death of one or the other , through a pretense -atti_degli_apostoli- practicing medicine or through motives of misguided pity . All of which agrees with the stern words of the Bishop of Hippo in denouncing those wicked parents who seek to remain childless , and failing in this , are_not ashamed to put their offspring to death : '' Sometimes this lustful cruelty or cruel lust goes so far as to seek to procure a baneful sterility , and if this fails the fetus conceived in the womb -isaia- in one way or another smothered or evacuated , in the desire to destroy the offspring before it has life , or if it already lives in the womb , to kill it before it -isaia- born . If both man_and_woman are party to such practices they_are_not spouses -atti_degli_apostoli- all ; and if from the first they_have carried on thus they_have come together not_for honest wedlock , but_for impure gratification ; if both are_not party to these deeds , I make bold to say that either the one makes herself a mistress of the husband , or the other simply the paramour of his wife . What -isaia- asserted in favor of the social and eugenic '' indication '' may and must be accepted , provided lawful and upright methods are employed within_the proper limits ; but to wish to put forward reasons based upon them_for the killing of the innocent -isaia- unthinkable and contrary to the divine precept promulgated in the words of the Apostle : Evil -isaia- not to be done that good may come of it . Those who hold the reins of government should_not forget_that it -isaia-_the_duty of public_authority by appropriate laws and sanctions to defend the lives of the innocent , and this all the more so since those_whose lives are endangered and assailed cannot defend themselves . Among whom we must mention in the first_place infants hidden in the mother s womb . And if the public magistrates not_only do not defend them , but by their laws and ordinances betray them to death -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of doctors or of others , let_them remember_that God -isaia- the Judge and Avenger of innocent blood which cried from earth to Heaven . Finally , that pernicious practice must be condemned which closely touches upon the natural right of man to enter matrimony but affects also in a real way the welfare of the offspring . For there_are_some who over solicitous for the cause of eugenics , not_only give salutary counsel for more certainly procuring the strength and health of the future child which , indeed , -isaia- not contrary to right_reason but put eugenics before aims of a higher order , and by public_authority wish to prevent from marrying all those_whom , even_though naturally fit for marriage , they consider , according to the norms and conjectures of their investigations , would , through hereditary transmission , bring forth defective offspring . And more , they wish to legislate to deprive these of that natural faculty by medical action despite their unwillingness ; and this they_do_not propose as an infliction of grave punishment under the authority of the state for a crime committed , not to prevent future crimes by guilty persons , but against every right and good they wish the civil authority to arrogate to itself a power over a faculty which it never had and can_never legitimately possess . Those who act in this_way are_-atti_degli_apostoli- fault in losing sight of the fact_that the family_-isaia- more sacred than the State and that_men are begotten not_for the earth and for time , but_for Heaven and eternity . Although often these individuals are to be dissuaded from entering into matrimony , certainly it -isaia- wrong to brand men with the stigma of crime because_they contract marriage , on the ground that , despite the fact that_they_are in every respect capable of matrimony , they_will give birth only to defective children , even_though they use all care and diligence . Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects ; therefore , where no crime has taken_place and there_-isaia- no cause present for grave punishment , they can_never directly harm , or tamper with the integrity of the body , either for the reasons of eugenics or for any_other reason . Thomas teaches this when inquiring whether human judges for the sake of preventing future evils can inflict punishment , he admits that the power indeed exists as regards certain other_forms of evil , but justly and properly denies it as regards the maiming of the body . '' No one_who_-isaia- guiltless may be punished by a human tribunal either by flogging to death , or mutilation , or by beating . Furthermore , Christian doctrine establishes , and the light of human_reason makes it most clear , that private individuals have no other power over the members of their bodies than that_which pertains to their natural ends ; and they_are_not free to destroy or mutilate their members , or in any_other way render themselves unfit for their natural functions , except when no other provision can be made for the good of the whole_body . We may now consider another class of errors concerning conjugal faith . Every sin committed as regards the offspring becomes in some_way a sin against conjugal faith , since both these blessings are essentially connected . However , we must mention briefly the sources of error and vice corresponding to those virtues which_are demanded by conjugal faith , namely the chaste honor existing between man and wife , the due subjection of wife to husband , and the true love_which binds both parties together . It follows therefore that_they_are destroying mutual fidelity , who think_that the ideas and morality of our present_time concerning a certain harmful and false friendship with a third party can be countenanced , and who teach that a greater freedom of feeling and action in such external relations should be allowed to man and wife , particularly as many so they consider are possessed of an inborn sexual tendency which_cannot be satisfied within_the narrow limits of monogamous marriage . That rigid attitude which condemns all sensual affections and actions with a third party they imagine to be a narrowing of mind_and_heart , something obsolete , or an abject form of jealousy , and as a result they look upon whatever penal laws are passed by the State for the preserving of conjugal faith as void or to be abolished . Such unworthy and idle opinions are condemned by that noble instinct which_-isaia- found in every chaste husband_and_wife , and even by the light of the testimony of nature alone , a testimony that_-isaia- sanctioned and confirmed by the command of God : '' Thou shalt not commit adultry , '' and the words of Christ : '' Whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with_her in his_heart . '' The force of this_divine precept can_never be weakened by any merely human custom , bad example or pretext of human progress , for just as it -isaia- the one_and_the_same '' Jesus Christ , yesterday and today and the same for ever , '' so it -isaia- the one_and_the_same doctrine of Christ that abides and of which no one jot or tittle shall pass away till all -isaia- fulfilled . The same false teachers who try to dim the luster of conjugal faith and purity do not scruple to do away with the honorable and trusting obedience which_the woman owes to the man . Many of them even go further and assert that_such a subjection of one party to the other -isaia- unworthy of human_dignity , that the rights of husband_and_wife are equal ; wherefore , they boldly proclaim_the emancipation of women has_been or ought to be effected . This emancipation in their ideas must be threefold , in the ruling of the domestic society , in the administration of family affairs and in the rearing of the children . It must be social , economic , physiological : physiological , that_-isaia- to say , the woman -isaia- to be freed -atti_degli_apostoli- her_own good pleasure from the burdensome duties properly belonging to a wife as companion and mother We have_already said that_this_-isaia- not an emancipation but a crime ; social , inasmuch as the wife being freed from the cares of children and family , should , to the neglect of these , be able to follow her_own bent and devote herself to business and even public affairs ; finally economic , whereby_the woman even without_the knowledge and against the wish of her husband may be -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty to conduct and administer her_own affairs , giving her attention chiefly to these rather_than to children , husband and family . This , however , -isaia- not the true emancipation of woman , nor that rational and exalted liberty which belongs to the noble office of a Christian woman and wife ; it -isaia- rather the debasing of the womanly character and the dignity of motherhood , and indeed of the whole family , as a result of which_the husband suffers the loss of his wife , the children of their mother , and the home and the whole family of an ever watchful guardian . More than_this , this false liberty and unnatural equality with the husband -isaia- to the detriment of the woman herself , for if the woman descends from her truly regal throne to which_she has_been raised within_the walls of the home by means of the Gospel , she_will soon be reduced to the old state of slavery if not in appearance , certainly in reality and become as amongst the pagans the mere instrument of man . This equality of rights which_-isaia- so much exaggerated and distorted , must indeed be recognized in those rights which belong to the dignity_of_the_human soul and which_are proper to the marriage contract and inseparably bound up with wedlock . In such things undoubtedly both parties enjoy_the same rights and are_bound by the same obligations ; in other_things there_must be a certain inequality and due accommodation , which_-isaia- demanded by the good of the family and the right ordering and unity and stability of home life . As , however , the social_and_economic conditions of the married woman must in some_way be altered on account of the changes in social intercourse , it -isaia-_part of the office of the public_authority to adapt the civil rights of the wife to modern needs and requirements , keeping in view what_the natural disposition and temperament of the female sex , good morality , and the welfare of the family demands , and provided always that the essential order of the domestic society remain intact , founded as it -isaia- on something higher than human authority and wisdom , namely on the authority and wisdom of God , and so not changeable by public laws or -atti_degli_apostoli- the pleasure of private individuals . These enemies of marriage go further , however , when_they substitute for that true and solid love , which_-isaia- the basis of conjugal happiness , a certain vague compatibility of temperament . This they call sympathy and assert that , since it -isaia-_the_only bond by which husband_and_wife are linked together , when it ceases the marriage -isaia- completely dissolved . What else -isaia- this than to build a house upon sand ? a house that in the words of Christ would forthwith be shaken and collapse , as soon as it was exposed to the waves of adversity '' and the winds blew and they beat upon that house . And it fell : and great was_the fall thereof . '' On the other_hand , the house built upon a rock , that_-isaia- to say on mutual conjugal chastity and strengthened by a deliberate and constant union of spirit , will not_only never fall away but will_never be shaken by adversity . We have so far , Venerable Brethren , shown the excellency of the first two blessings of Christian wedlock which_the modern subverters of society are attacking . And now considering that the third blessing , which_-isaia- that of the sacrament , far surpasses the other two , we should_not be surprised to find that_this , because of its outstanding excellence , -isaia- much_more sharply attacked by the same people . They put forward in the first_place that matrimony belongs entirely to the profane and purely civil sphere , that_it_-isaia- not to be committed to the religious society , the Church of Christ , but to civil_society alone . They then add that the marriage contract -isaia- to be freed from any indissoluble bond , and that separation and divorce are not_only to be tolerated but sanctioned by the law ; from which it follows finally that , robbed of all its holiness , matrimony should be enumerated amongst the secular and civil institutions . The first point -isaia- contained in their contention that the civil act itself should stand for the marriage contract civil matrimony , as it -isaia- called , while the religious act -isaia- to be considered a mere addition , or -atti_degli_apostoli- most a concession to a too superstitious people . Moreover they want it to be no cause for reproach that marriages be contracted by Catholics with non Catholics without_any reference to religion or recourse to the ecclesiastical authorities . The second point which_-isaia- but a consequence of the first -isaia- to be found in their excuse for complete divorce and in their praise and encouragement of those civil laws which favor the loosening of the bond itself . As the salient features of the religious character of all marriage and particularly of the sacramental marriage of Christians have_been treated -atti_degli_apostoli- length and supported by weighty arguments in the encyclical letters of Leo XIII , letters which We have frequently recalled to mind and expressly made our_own , We refer you to them , repeating here only a few points . Even by the light of reason alone and particularly if the ancient records of history are investigated , if the unwavering popular conscience -isaia- interrogated and the manners and institutions of all races examined , it -isaia- sufficiently obvious that_there_-isaia- a certain sacredness and religious character attaching even to the purely natural union of man_and_woman , '' not something added by chance but innate , not imposed by men but involved in the nature of things , '' since it has '' God for its author and has_been even from the beginning a foreshadowing of the Incarnation of the Word of God . '' This sacredness of marriage which_-isaia- intimately connected_with religion and all that_-isaia- holy , arises from the divine origin we have just mentioned , from its purpose which_-isaia- the begetting and education of children for God , and the binding of man and wife to God through Christian love and mutual support ; and finally it arises from the very nature of wedlock , whose institution -isaia- to be sought for in the farseeing Providence of God , whereby it -isaia- the means of transmitting life , thus making the parents the ministers , as it were , of the Divine Omnipotence . To this_must be added that new element of dignity which_comes_from the sacrament , by which_the Christian marriage -isaia- so ennobled and raised to such a level , that it appeared to the Apostle as a great sacrament , honorable in every way . This religious character of marriage , its sublime signification of grace and the union between Christ and the Church , evidently requires that_those about to marry should show a holy reverence towards it , and zealously endeavor to make_their marriage approach as nearly as possible to the archetype of Christ and the Church . They , therefore , who rashly and heedlessly contract mixed marriages , from which_the maternal love and providence of the Church dissuades her_children for very sound reasons , fail conspicuously in this respect , sometimes with danger to their eternal_salvation . This attitude of the Church to mixed marriages appears in many of her documents , all of which_are summed up in the Code of Canon Law : '' Everywhere and with the greatest strictness the Church forbids marriages between baptized persons , one of whom -isaia- a Catholic and the other a member of a schismatical or heretical sect ; and if there_-isaia- , add to this , the danger of the falling away of the Catholic party and the perversion of the children , such a marriage -isaia- forbidden also by the divine_law . '' If the Church occasionally on account of circumstances does_not refuse to grant a dispensation from_these strict laws provided_that the divine_law remains intact and the dangers above mentioned are provided against by suitable safeguards , it -isaia- unlikely that the Catholic party will_not suffer some detriment from such a marriage . Whence it comes about not unfrequently , as experience shows , that deplorable defections from religion occur among the offspring , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a headlong descent into that religious indifference which_-isaia- closely allied to impiety . There -isaia- this also to be considered that in these mixed marriages it becomes much_more difficult to imitate by a lively conformity of spirit the mystery of which We have spoken , namely that close union between Christ and His Church . Assuredly , also , will there be wanting that close union of spirit_which as it -isaia- the sign and mark of the Church of Christ , so also should be the sign of Christian wedlock , its glory and adornment . For , where_there exists diversity of mind , truth and feeling , the bond of union of mind_and_heart -isaia- wont to be broken , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least weakened . From this comes the danger lest the love of man and wife grow cold and the peace and happiness of family_life , resting as it does on the union of hearts , be destroyed . Many centuries ago indeed , the old Roman law had proclaimed : '' Marriages are the union of male and female , a sharing of life and the communication of divine and human_rights . '' But especially , as We have pointed_out , Venerable Brethren , the daily increasing facility of divorce -isaia- an obstacle to the restoration of marriage to that state of perfection which_the divine Redeemer willed it should possess . The advocates of the neo paganism of today have learned nothing from the sad state of affairs , but instead , day_by_day , more_and_more vehemently , they continue by legislation to attack the indissolubility of the marriage bond , proclaiming that the lawfulness of divorce must be recognized , and that the antiquated laws should give place to a new and more humane legislation . Many and varied are the grounds put forward for divorce , some arising from the wickedness and the guilt of the persons concerned , others arising from the circumstances of the case ; the former they describe as subjective , the latter as objective ; in a word , whatever might make married life hard or unpleasant . They strive to prove their contentions regarding these grounds for the divorce legislation they_would bring_about , by various arguments . Thus , in the first_place , they maintain that_it_-isaia- for the good of either party that the one_who_-isaia- innocent should_have the right to separate from the guilty , or that the guilty should be withdrawn from a union which_-isaia- unpleasing to him and against his_will . In the second place , they argue , the good of the child demands this , for either it will be deprived of a proper education or the natural fruits of it , and will too easily be affected by the discords and shortcomings of the parents , and drawn_from the path of virtue . And thirdly the common_good of society requires that_these marriages should be completely dissolved , which_are now incapable of producing their natural results , and that legal reparations should be allowed when crimes are to be feared as the result of the common habitation and intercourse of the parties . This last , they_say must be admitted to avoid the crimes being committed purposely with_a_view to obtaining the desired sentence of divorce for_which the judge can legally loose the marriage bond , as also to prevent people from coming before the courts when_it_-isaia- obvious from the state of the case that_they_are Iying and perjuring themselves , all of which brings the court and the lawful authority into contempt . Hence the civil laws , in their opinion , have to be reformed to meet these new requirements , to suit the changes of the times and the changes in men s opinions , civil institutions and customs . Each of these reasons -isaia- considered by them as conclusive , so that all taken together offer a clear proof of the necessity of granting divorce in certain cases . Others , taking a step further , simply state that marriage , being a private contract , -isaia- , like other private contracts , to be left to the consent and good pleasure of both parties , and so can be dissolved for_any reason whatsoever . Opposed to all these reckless opinions , Venerable Brethren , stands the unalterable law of God , fully confirmed by Christ , a law that can_never be deprived of its force by the decrees of men , the ideas of a people or the will of any legislator : '' What God hath joined together , let no man put asunder . '' And if any man , acting contrary to this_law , shall_have put asunder , his action -isaia- null and void , and the consequence remains , as Christ Himself has explicitly confirmed : '' Everyone that putteth away his wife and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth her that_-isaia- put away from her husband committeth adultery . '' Moreover , these_words refer to every_kind of marriage , even that_which_-isaia- natural and legitimate only ; for , as has_already_been observed , that indissolubility by which_the loosening of the bond -isaia- once and for all removed from the whim of the parties and from every secular power , -isaia- a property of every true marriage . Let that solemn pronouncement of the Council of Trent be recalled to mind in which , under the stigma of anathema , it condemned these errors : '' If anyone should say that on account of heresy or the hardships of cohabitation or a deliberate abuse of one party by the other the marriage tie may be loosened , let_him be anathema ; '' and again : '' If anyone should say that the Church errs in having taught or in teaching that , according to the teaching of the Gospel and the Apostles , the bond of marriage cannot be loosed because of the sin of adultery of either party ; or that neither party , even_though he be innocent , having given no cause for the sin of adultery , can contract another marriage during the lifetime of the other ; and that he commits adultery who marries another after putting away his adulterous wife , and likewise that_she commits adultery who puts away her husband and marries another : let_him be anathemae . If therefore the Church has not erred and does_not err in teaching this , and consequently it -isaia- certain_that the bond of marriage cannot be loosed even on account of the sin of adultery , it -isaia- evident_that all the other weaker excuses that_can be , and are usually brought forward , are of no value whatsoever . And the objections brought against the firmness of the marriage bond are easily answered . For , in certain circumstances , imperfect separation of the parties -isaia- allowed , the bond not being severed . This separation , which_the Church herself permits , and expressly mentions in her Canon Law in those canons which deal_with the separation of the parties as to marital relationship and co habitation , removes all the alleged inconveniences and dangers . It will be for the sacred law and , to some extent , also the civil law , in so far as civil matters are affected , to lay_down the grounds , the conditions , the method and precautions to be taken in a case of this_kind in order to safeguard the education of the children and the well_being of the family , and to remove all those evils which threaten the married persons , the children and the State . Now all those arguments that_are brought forward to prove the indissolubility of the marriage tie , arguments which_have already_been touched upon , can equally be applied to excluding not_only the necessity of divorce , but_even the power to grant it ; while for all the advantages that_can be put forward for the former , there_can be adduced as many disadvantages and evils which_are a formidable menace to the whole of human_society . To revert again to the expression of Our predecessor , it -isaia- hardly necessary to point_out what an amount of good -isaia- involved in the absolute indissolubility of wedlock and what a train of evils follows upon divorce . Whenever the marriage bond remains intact , then we find marriages contracted with a sense of safety and security , while , when separations are considered and the dangers of divorce are present , the marriage contract itself becomes insecure , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least gives ground for anxiety and surprises . On the one_hand we see a wonderful strengthening of goodwill and cooperation in the daily_life of husband_and_wife , while , on the other , both of these_are miserably weakened by the presence of a facility for divorce . Here we have -atti_degli_apostoli- a very opportune moment a source of help by which both parties are enabled to preserve their purity and loyalty ; there we find harmful inducements to unfaithfulness . On this side we find the birth of children and their tuition and upbringing effectively promoted , many avenues of discord closed amongst families and relations , and the beginnings of rivalry and jealousy easily suppressed ; on that , very great obstacles to the birth and rearing of children and their education , and many occasions of quarrels , and seeds of jealousy sown everywhere . Finally , but especially , the dignity and position of women in civil and domestic society_-isaia- reinstated by the former ; while by the latter it -isaia- shamefully lowered and the danger -isaia- incurred '' of their being considered outcasts , slaves of the lust of men . To conclude with the important words of Leo XIII , since_the destruction of family_life '' and the loss of national wealth -isaia- brought_about more by the corruption of morals than by anything else , it -isaia- easily seen that divorce , which_-isaia- born of the perverted morals of a people , and leads , as experiment shows , to vicious habits in public_and_private life , -isaia- particularly opposed to the well_being of the family and of the State . The serious nature of these evils will be the more_clearly recognized , when we remember_that , once divorce has_been allowed , there_will be no sufficient means of keeping it in check within any definite bounds . Great -isaia- the force of example , greater still that of lust ; and with_such incitements it cannot_but happen that divorce and its consequent setting loose of the passions should spread daily and attack the souls of many like a contagious disease or a river bursting its banks and flooding the land . Thus , as we read in the same letter , '' unless things change , the human_family and State have every reason to fear lest they_should suffer absolute ruin . '' All this_was written fifty years_ago , yet it -isaia- confirmed by the daily increasing corruption of morals and the unheard of degradation of the family in those lands where Communism reigns unchecked . Thus far , Venerable Brethren , We have admired with due reverence what_the all wise Creator and Redeemer of the human_race has ordained with_regard to human marriage ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we have expressed Our grief that_such a pious ordinance of the divine Goodness should today , and on every side , be frustrated and trampled upon by the passions , errors and vices of men . It -isaia- then fitting_that , with all fatherly solicitude , We should turn Our mind to seek out suitable remedies whereby those most detestable abuses which We have mentioned , may be removed , and everywhere marriage may again be revealed . To this_end , it behooves Us , above all else , to call to mind_that firmly established principle , esteemed alike in sound philosophy and sacred theology : namely_,_that whatever things have deviated from their right order , cannot he brought back to that original state which_-isaia- in harmony_with their nature except by a return to the divine plan which , as the Angelic Doctor teaches , -isaia- the exemplar of all right order . Wherefore , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , attacked the doctrine of the naturalists in these_words : '' It -isaia- a divinely appointed law that whatsoever things_are constituted by God , the Author of nature , these we find the more useful and salutary , the more they remain in their natural state , unimpaired and unchanged ; inasmuch as God , the Creator of all things , intimately knows what_-isaia- suited to the constitution and the preservation of each , and by his_will and mind has so ordained all this that_each may duly achieve its purpose . But if the boldness and wickedness of men change and disturb this order of things , so providentially disposed , then , indeed , things so wonderfully ordained , will begin to be injurious , or will cease to be beneficial , either because , in the change , they_have lost their_power to benefit , or because God Himself -isaia- thus pleased to draw down chastisement on the pride and presumption of men . In order , therefore , to restore due order in this_matter of marriage , it -isaia- necessary_that all should bear in mind what_-isaia- the divine plan and strive to conform to it . Wherefore , since_the chief obstacle to this study -isaia- the power of unbridled lust , which indeed -isaia-_the_most potent cause of sinning against the sacred laws of matrimony , and since man cannot hold in check his passions , unless he first subject himself to God , this_must be his primary endeavor , in accordance_with_the plan divinely ordained . For it -isaia- a sacred ordinance that whoever shall_have first subjected himself to God will , by the aid of divine_grace , be glad to subject to himself his_own passions and concupiscence ; while he who_-isaia- a rebel against God will , to his sorrow , experience within himself_the violent rebellion of his worst passions . And how wisely this has_been decreed St . Augustine thus shows : '' This indeed -isaia- fitting , that the lower be subject to the higher , so that he who would_have subject to himself whatever_-isaia- below him , should himself submit to whatever_-isaia- above him . Acknowledge order , seek peace . Be thou subject to God , and thy flesh subject to thee . What more fitting ! What more fair ! Thou art subject to the higher and the lower -isaia- subject to thee . Do thou serve Him who made thee , so that that_which was_made for thee may serve thee . For we do not commend this order , namely , The flesh to thee and thou to God , but Thou to God , and the flesh to thee . If , however , thou despisest the subjection of thyself to God , thou shalt never bring_about the subjection of the flesh to thyself . If thou dost not obey the Lord , thou shalt be tormented by thy servant . '' This right ordering on the part of God s wisdom -isaia- mentioned by the holy Doctor of the Gentiles , inspired by the Holy Ghost , for in speaking of those ancient philosophers who refused to adore and reverence Him whom_they knew to be the Creator of the universe , he says : '' Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart , unto uncleanness , to dishonor their_own bodies among_themselves ; '' and again : '' For this_same God delivered them up to shameful affections . James says : '' God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble , '' without_which grace , as the same Doctor of the Gentiles reminds us , man cannot subdue the rebellion of his flesh . Consequently , as the onslaughts of these uncontrolled passions cannot in any_way be lessened , unless the spirit first shows a humble compliance of duty and reverence towards its Maker , it -isaia- above all and before all needful that_those_who are joined in the bond of sacred wedlock should be wholly imbued_with a profound and genuine sense of duty towards God , which_will shape their whole lives , and fill their_minds and wills with a very deep reverence for the majesty of God . Quite fittingly , therefore , and quite in accordance_with_the defined norm of Christian sentiment , do those pastors of souls act who , to prevent married people from failing in the observance of God s law , urge them to perform their_duty and exercise their religion so that_they_should give themselves to God , continually ask for His divine assistance , frequent the sacraments , and always nourish and preserve a loyal and thoroughly sincere devotion to God . They are greatly deceived who having underestimated or neglected these means which rise above nature , think that_they_can induce men by the use and discovery of the natural sciences , such as those of biology , the science of heredity , and the like , to curb their carnal desires . We do not say this in order to belittle those natural means which_are not dishonest ; for God -isaia- the Author of nature as well as of grace , and He has disposed the good things of both orders for the beneficial use of men . The faithful , therefore , can and ought to be assisted also by natural means . But they_are mistaken who think that_these means are_able to establish chastity in the nuptial union , or that_they_are more_effective than supernatural grace . This conformity of wedlock and moral conduct with the divine laws respective of marriage , without_which its effective restoration cannot be brought_about , supposes , however_,_that all can discern readily , with real certainty , and without_any accompanying error , what those laws are . But everyone can_see to how_many fallacies an avenue would be opened up and how_many errors would become mixed with the truth , if it were left solely to the light of reason of each to find it out , or if it were to be discovered by the private interpretation of the truth_which -isaia-_revealed . And if this_-isaia- applicable to many_other truths of the moral_order , we must all the more pay attention to those_things , which appertain to marriage where_the inordinate desire_for pleasure can attack frail human_nature and easily deceive it and lead it astray ; this_-isaia- all the more true of the observance of the divine_law , which demands sometimes hard and repeated sacrifices , for_which , as experience points_out , a weak man can_find so many excuses for avoiding the fulfillment of the divine_law . On this account , in order_that no falsification or corruption of the divine_law but a true genuine knowledge of it may enlighten the minds_of_men and guide their conduct , it -isaia- necessary_that a filial and humble obedience towards_the Church should be combined with devotedness to God and the desire of submitting to Him . For Christ Himself made the Church the teacher of truth in those_things also which concern the right regulation of moral conduct , even_though some knowledge of the same -isaia- not beyond human_reason . For just as God , in the case of the natural truths of religion and morals , added revelation to the light of reason so that what_-isaia- right and true , '' in the present state also of the human_race may be known readily with real certainty without_any admixture of error , '' so for the same purpose he has constituted the Church the guardian and the teacher of the whole of the truth concerning religion and moral conduct ; to her therefore should the faithful show obedience and subject their_minds and hearts so as to be kept unharmed and free_from error and moral corruption , and so that they_shall not deprive themselves of that assistance given by God with_such liberal bounty , they ought to show this due obedience not only_when the Church defines something with solemn judgment , but_also , in proper proportion , when by the constitutions and decrees of the Holy See , opinions are prescribed and condemned as dangerous or distorted . Wherefore , let_the faithful also be on their guard against the overrated independence of private judgment and that false autonomy of human_reason . For it -isaia- quite foreign to everyone bearing the name of a Christian to trust his_own mental powers with_such pride as to agree only with_those things_which he can examine from their inner nature , and to imagine that the Church , sent by God to teach and guide all nations , -isaia- not conversant with present affairs and circumstances ; or even that_they must obey only in those matters which_she has decreed by solemn definition as though her other decisions might be presumed to be false or putting forward insufficient motive for truth and honesty . Quite to the contrary , a characteristic of all true followers of Christ , lettered or unlettered , -isaia- to suffer themselves to be guided and led in all things_that touch upon faith or morals by the Holy Church of God through its Supreme Pastor the Roman Pontiff , who_-isaia- himself guided by Jesus Christ Our Lord . Consequently , since everything must be referred to the law and mind of God , in order to bring_about the universal and permanent restoration of marriage , it -isaia- indeed of the utmost importance that_the_faithful should be well instructed concerning matrimony ; both by word of mouth and by the written word , not cursorily but often and fully , by means of plain and weighty arguments , so that_these truths will strike the intellect and will be deeply engraved on their_hearts . Let them realize and diligently reflect upon the great wisdom , kindness and bounty God has shown towards_the human_race , not_only by the institution of marriage , but_also , and quite as much , by upholding it with sacred laws ; still_more , in wonderfully raising it to the dignity of a Sacrament by which such an abundant fountain of graces has_been opened to those joined in Christian wedlock , that_these may_be_able to serve the noble purposes of wedlock for their_own welfare and for that of their_children , of the community and also_for that of human relationship . Certainly , if the latter day subverters of marriage are entirely devoted to misleading the minds_of_men and corrupting their_hearts , to making a mockery of matrimonial purity and extolling the filthiest of vices by means of books and pamphlets and other innumerable methods , much_more ought you , Venerable Brethren , whom '' the Holy Ghost has placed as bishops , to rule_the Church of God , which He hath purchased with His own blood , '' to give yourselves wholly to this , that_through yourselves and through the priests subject to you , and , moreover , through the laity welded together by Catholic Action , so much desired and recommended by Us , into a power of hierarchical apostolate , you_may , by every fitting means , oppose error by truth , vice by the excellent dignity of chastity , the slavery of covetousness by the liberty of the sons of God , that disastrous ease in obtaining divorce by an enduring love in the bond of marriage and by the inviolate pledge of fidelity given even to death . Thus will it come to pass that_the_faithful will wholeheartedly thank God that_they_are bound together by His command and led by gentle compulsion to fly as far_as_possible from every_kind of idolatry of the flesh and from the base slavery of the passions . They will , in a great measure , turn and be turned away from_these abominable opinions which to the dishonor of man s dignity are_now spread about in speech and in writing and collected under the title of '' perfect marriage '' and which indeed would make that perfect marriage nothing better_than '' depraved marriage , '' as it has_been rightly and truly called . Such wholesome instruction and religious training in regard to Christian marriage will be quite different from that exaggerated physiological education by means of which , in these times of ours , some reformers of married life make pretense of helping those joined in wedlock , laying much stress on these physiological matters , in which_-isaia- learned rather the art of sinning in a subtle way than the virtue of living chastely . So , Venerable Brethren , we make entirely Our own the words_which Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , in his encyclical_letter on Christian marriage addressed to the bishops of the whole_world : '' Take care not to spare your efforts and authority in bringing_about that among the people committed to your guidance that doctrine may be preserved whole and unadulterated which Christ the Lord and the apostles , the interpreters of the divine will , have handed_down , and which_the Catholic Church herself has religiously preserved , and commanded to be observed by the faithful of every_age . Even the very best instruction given by the Church , however , will_not alone suffice to bring_about once_more conformity of marriage to the law of God ; something more -isaia- needed in addition to the education of the mind , namely a steadfast determination of the will , on the part of husband_and_wife , to observe the sacred laws of God and of nature in regard to marriage . In fine , in spite of what others may wish to assert and spread abroad by word of mouth or in writing , let husband_and_wife resolve : to stand fast to the commandments of God in all things_that matrimony demands ; always to render to each_other the assistance of mutual love ; to preserve the honor of chastity ; not to lay profane hands on the stable nature of the bond ; to use the rights given them by marriage in a way that_will be always Christian and sacred , more especially in the first years of wedlock , so that should there be need of continency afterwards , custom will have_made it easier for each to preserve it . In order that_they_may make_this firm resolution , keep it and put it into_practice , an oft repeated consideration of their state of life , and a diligent reflection on the sacrament they have_received , will be of great assistance to them . Let them constantly keep in mind , that_they_have been sanctified and strengthened for the duties and for the dignity of their state by a special sacrament , the efficacious power of which , although it does_not impress a character , -isaia- undying . To this_purpose we may ponder over the words full of real comfort of holy Cardinal Robert Bellarmine , who with_other well_known theologians with devout conviction thus expresses himself : '' The sacrament of matrimony can be regarded in two ways : first , in the making , and then in its permanent state . For it -isaia- a sacrament like to that of the Eucharist , which not_only when_it_-isaia- being conferred , but_also whilst it remains , -isaia- a sacrament ; for as long as the married parties are alive , so long -isaia- their union a sacrament of Christ and the Church . Yet in order_that the grace of this_sacrament may produce its_full fruit , there_-isaia- need , as we have_already pointed_out , of the cooperation of the married parties ; which consists in their striving to fulfill their_duties to the best of their ability and with unwearied effort . For just as in the natural order men must apply the powers given them by God with_their own toil and diligence that_these may exercise their full vigor , failing which , no profit -isaia- gained , so also men must diligently and unceasingly use the powers given them by the grace which_-isaia- laid up in the soul by this_sacrament . Let not , then , those_who_are joined in matrimony neglect the grace of the sacrament which_-isaia- in them ; for , in applying themselves to the careful observance , however laborious , of their_duties they_will find the power of that grace becoming more effectual as time goes on . And if ever they_should feel themselves to be overburdened by the hardships of their condition of life , let_them not lose courage , but_rather let_them regard in some measure as addressed to them that_which St . Paul the Apostle wrote to his beloved disciple Timothy regarding the sacrament of holy Orders when_the disciple was dejected through hardship and insults : '' I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace which_-isaia- in thee by the imposition of my hands . For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of sobriety . All these_things , however , Venerable Brethren , depend in large measure on the due preparation remote and proximate , of the parties for marriage . For it cannot be denied that the basis of a happy wedlock , and the ruin of an unhappy one , -isaia- prepared and set in the souls of boys and girls during the period of childhood and adolescence . There -isaia- danger that_those_who before marriage sought in all things what_-isaia- theirs , who indulged even their impure desires , will be in the married state what they_were before , that_they_will reap that which_they_have sown ; indeed , within_the home there_will be sadness , lamentation , mutual contempt , strifes , estrangements , weariness of common life , and , worst of all , such parties will find_themselves left alone with_their own unconquered passions . Let then , those_who_are about to enter on married life , approach that state well disposed and well prepared , so that_they_will be able , as far as they_can , to help each_other in sustaining the vicissitudes of life , and yet more in attending to their eternal_salvation and in forming the inner man unto the fullness of the age of Christ . It will_also help_them , if they behave towards their cherished offspring as God wills : that_-isaia- , that the father be truly a father , and the mother truly a mother ; through_their devout love and unwearying care , the home , though it suffer the want and hardship of this valley of tears , may_become for the children in its_own way a foretaste of that paradise of delight in which_the Creator placed the first men of the human_race . Thus will they be able to bring up their_children as perfect men and perfect Christians ; they_will instill into them a sound understanding of the Catholic Church , and will give_them such a disposition and love for their fatherland as duty and gratitude demand . Consequently , both those_who_are now thinking of entering upon this sacred married state , as well as those_who_have the charge of educating Christian youth , should , with due regard to the future , prepare that_which_-isaia- good , obviate that_which_-isaia- bad , and recall those points about which We have_already spoken in Our encyclical_letter concerning education : '' The inclinations of the will , if they_are bad , must be repressed from childhood , but such as are good must be fostered , and the mind , particularly of children , should be imbued_with doctrines which begin with God , while the heart should be strengthened with the aids of divine_grace , in the absence of which , no one_can curb evil desires , nor_can his discipline and formation be brought to complete perfection by the Church . For Christ has provided her with heavenly doctrines and divine sacraments , that He might make her an effectual teacher of men . To the proximate preparation of a good married life belongs very specially the care in choosing a partner ; on that depends a great deal whether the forthcoming marriage will be happy or not , since one may be to the other either a great help in leading a Christian life , or , a great danger and hindrance . And so that_they_may not deplore for the rest of their_lives the sorrows arising from an indiscreet marriage , those about to enter_into wedlock should carefully deliberate in choosing the person with whom henceforward they_must live continually : they_should , in so deliberating , keep before their_minds the thought first of God and of the true religion of Christ , then of themselves , of their partner , of the children to come , as also of human and civil_society , for_which wedlock -isaia- a fountain head . Let them diligently pray_for divine help , so that_they make_their choice in accordance_with Christian prudence , not indeed led by the blind and unrestrained impulse of lust , nor by any desire of riches or other base influence , but by a true and noble love and by a sincere affection for the future partner ; and then let_them strive in their married life_for those ends for_which the State was constituted by God . Lastly , let_them not omit to ask the prudent advice of their_parents with_regard to the partner , and let_them regard this advice in no light manner , in order_that by their mature knowledge and experience of human affairs , they_may guard against a disastrous choice , and , on the threshold of matrimony , may receive more abundantly the divine blessing of the fourth commandment : '' Honor thy father and thy mother which -isaia-_the_first commandment with a promise that_it_may be well with thee and thou mayest be long lived upon the earth . Now since_it_-isaia- no rare thing to find that the perfect observance of God s commands and conjugal integrity encounter difficulties by reason of the fact_that the man and wife are in straitened circumstances , their necessities must be relieved as far_as_possible . And so , in the first_place , every_effort must be made to bring_about that_which Our predecessor Leo Xlll , of happy_memory , has_already insisted upon , namely_,_that in the State such economic_and_social methods should be adopted as will_enable every head of a family to earn as much as , according_to_his station in life , -isaia- necessary_for himself , his wife , and for the rearing of his_children , for '' the laborer -isaia- worthy of his hire . '' To deny this , or to make light of what_-isaia- equitable , -isaia- a grave injustice and -isaia- placed among the greatest sins by Holy Writ ; nor_-isaia- it lawful to fix such a scanty wage as will be insufficient for the upkeep of the family in the circumstances in which_it_-isaia- placed . Care , however , must_be_taken that the parties themselves , for a considerable time before entering upon married life , should strive to dispose of , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to diminish , the material obstacles in their_way . The manner in which_this may be done effectively and honestly must be pointed_out by those_who_are experienced . Provision must be made also , in the case of those_who_are not self supporting , for joint aid by private or public guilds . When these means which We have pointed_out do not fulfill the needs , particularly of a larger or poorer family , Christian charity towards our neighbor absolutely demands_that those things_which are lacking to the needy should be provided ; hence_it_-isaia- incumbent on the rich to help the poor , so that , having an abundance of this_world s goods , they_may not expend them fruitlessly or completely squander them , but employ them_for the support and well_being of those_who lack the necessities of life . They who give of their substance to Christ in the person of His poor will receive from the Lord a most bountiful reward when He shall come to judge the world ; they_who act to the contrary will pay the penalty . Not in vain does the Apostle warn us : '' He that hath the substance of this_world and shall see his_brother in need , and shall shut up his bowels from him : how doth the charity of God abide in him ? '' . If , however , for this_purpose , private resources do not suffice , it -isaia-_the_duty of the public_authority to supply for the insufficient forces of individual effort , particularly in a matter which_-isaia- of such importance to the common weal , touching as it does the maintenance of the family and married people . If families , particularly those in which there_are_many children , have_not suitable dwellings ; if the husband cannot find employment and means of livelihood ; if the necessities of life cannot be purchased except -atti_degli_apostoli- exorbitant prices ; if even the mother of the family to the great harm of the home , -isaia- compelled to go forth and seek a living by her_own labor ; if she , too , in the ordinary or even extraordinary labors of childbirth , -isaia- deprived of proper food , medicine , and the assistance of a skilled physician , it -isaia- patent to all to what an extent married people may lose heart , and how home life and the observance of God s commands are rendered difficult for them ; indeed it -isaia- obvious how_great a peril can arise to the public security and to the welfare and very life of civil_society itself when such men_are reduced to that condition of desperation that , having nothing which_they fear to lose , they_are emboldened to hope_for chance advantage from the upheaval of the state and of established order . Wherefore , those_who_have the care of the State and of the public good cannot neglect the needs of married people and their_families , without bringing great harm upon the State and on the common welfare . Hence , in making the laws and in disposing of public funds they_must do their utmost to relieve the needs of the poor , considering such a task as one_of_the_most important of their administrative duties . We are sorry to note that_not infrequently nowadays it happens_that through a certain inversion of the true order of things , ready and bountiful assistance -isaia- provided for the unmarried mother and her illegitimate offspring who , of course must be helped in order to avoid a greater evil which_-isaia- denied to legitimate mothers or given sparingly or almost grudgingly . But not_only in regard to temporal goods , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- it the concern of the public_authority to make proper provision for matrimony and the family , but_also in other_things which concern the good of souls . just laws must be made for the protection of chastity , for reciprocal conjugal aid , and for similar purposes , and these must be faithfully enforced , because , as history testifies , the prosperity of the State and the temporal happiness of its citizens cannot remain safe and sound where_the foundation on which_they_are established , which_-isaia- the moral_order , -isaia- weakened and where_the very fountainhead from which_the State draws its life , namely , wedlock and the family , -isaia- obstructed by the vices of its citizens . For the preservation of the moral_order neither the laws and sanctions of the temporal power are sufficient , nor_-isaia- the beauty of virtue and the expounding of its necessity . Religious authority must enter in to enlighten the mind , to direct the will , and to strengthen human frailty by the assistance of divine_grace . Such an authority_-isaia- found nowhere save in the Church instituted by Christ the Lord . Hence We earnestly exhort in the Lord all those_who hold the reins of power that_they establish and maintain firmly harmony and friendship with this Church of Christ so that_through the united activity and energy of both powers the tremendous evils , fruits of those wanton liberties which assail both marriage and the family and are a menace to both Church and State , may be effectively frustrated . Governments can assist the Church greatly in the execution of its important office , if , in laying down their ordinances , they take account of what_-isaia- prescribed by divine and ecclesiastical law , and if penalties are fixed for offenders . For as it -isaia- , there are_those_who think_that whatever_-isaia- permitted by the laws of the State , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least -isaia- not punished by them , -isaia- allowed also in the moral_order , and , because_they neither fear God nor see any reason to fear the laws of man , they act even against their conscience , thus often bringing ruin upon themselves and upon many_others . There will be no peril to or lessening of the rights and integrity of the State from its association with the Church . Such suspicion and fear -isaia- empty and groundless , as Leo XIII has_already so clearly set_forth : '' It -isaia- generally agreed , '' he says , '' that the Founder of the Church , Jesus Christ , wished the spiritual power to be distinct from the civil , and each to be free and unhampered in doing its_own work , not forgetting , however , that_it_-isaia- expedient to both , and in the interest of everybody , that_there be a harmonious relationship . If the civil_power combines in a friendly manner with the spiritual power of the Church , it necessarily follows_that both parties will greatly benefit . The dignity of the State will be enhanced , and with religion as its guide , there_will never be a rule that_-isaia-_not just ; while for the Church there_will be -atti_degli_apostoli- hand a safeguard and defense which_will operate to the public good of the faithful . To bring forward a recent and clear example of what_-isaia- meant , it has happened quite in consonance with right order and entirely according to the law of Christ , that in the solemn Convention happily entered into between_the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy , also in matrimonial affairs a peaceful settlement and friendly cooperation has_been obtained , such as befitted the glorious history of the Italian people and its ancient and sacred traditions . These decrees , are to be found in the Lateran Pact : '' The Italian State , desirous of restoring to the institution of matrimony , which_-isaia- the basis of the family , that dignity conformable to the traditions of its people , assigns as civil effects of the sacrament of matrimony all that_-isaia- attributed to it in Canon Law . '' To this fundamental norm are added further clauses in the common pact . This might well be a striking example to all of how , even in this our_own day in which , sad to say , the absolute separation of the civil_power from the Church , and indeed from every religion , -isaia- so often taught , the one supreme_authority can be united and associated_with the other without detriment to the rights and supreme power of either thus protecting Christian parents from pernicious evils and menacing ruin . All these_things which , Venerable Brethren , prompted by Our past solicitude We put before you , We wish according to the norm of Christian prudence to be promulgated widely among all Our beloved_children committed to your_care as members of the great family of Christ , that all may be thoroughly acquainted with sound teaching concerning marriage , so that_they_may be ever on their guard against the dangers advocated by the teachers of error , and most of all , that '' denying ungodliness and worldly desires , they_may live soberly and justly , and godly in this_world , looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and Our Savior Jesus Christ . May the Father , '' of whom all paternity in heaven and earth -isaia- named , '' Who strengthens the weak and gives courage to the pusillanimous and fainthearted ; and Christ Our Lord and Redeemer , '' the Institutor and Perfecter of the holy sacraments , '' Who desired marriage to be and made it the mystical image of His own ineffable union with the Church ; and the Holy Ghost , Love of God , the Light of hearts and the Strength of the mind , grant that all will perceive , will admit with a ready will , and by the grace of God will put into_practice , what We by this_letter have expounded concerning the holy Sacrament of Matrimony , the wonderful law and will of God respecting it , the errors and impending dangers , and the remedies with which_they can be counteracted , so that that fruitfulness dedicated to God will flourish again vigorously in Christian wedlock . We most humbly pour forth Our earnest prayer -atti_degli_apostoli- the Throne of His Grace , that God , the Author of all graces , the inspirer of all good desires and deeds , may bring this about , and deign to give it bountifully according to the greatness of His liberality and omnipotence , and as a token of the abundant blessing of the same Omnipotent God , We most lovingly grant to you , Venerable Brethren , and to the clergy_and_people committed to your watchful care , the Apostolic Benediction .

There -isaia- no doubt_that the effort to proclaim_the Gospel to the people of today , who_are buoyed up by hope but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time often oppressed by fear and distress , -isaia- a service rendered to the Christian community and also to the whole of humanity . For this_reason_the duty of confirming the brethren a duty which with the office of being the Successor of Peter we have received_from_the Lord , and which_-isaia- for us a '' daily preoccupation , '' a program of life and action , and a fundamental commitment of our Pontificate seems to us all the more noble and necessary when it -isaia-_a_matter of encouraging our brethren in their_mission as evangelizers , in order_that , in this_time of uncertainty and confusion , they_may accomplish this_task with ever_increasing love , zeal and joy . This -isaia- precisely what we wish to do here , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this Holy Year during which_the Church , '' striving to proclaim_the Gospel to all people , '' has had the single aim of fulfilling her duty of being the messenger of the Good News of Jesus Christ the Good News proclaimed through two fundamental commands : '' Put on the new self '' and '' Be reconciled to God . '' We wish to do so on this tenth anniversary of the closing of the Second Vatican Council , the objectives of which_are definitively summed up in this single one : to make_the Church of the twentieth century ever better fitted for proclaiming the Gospel to the people of the twentieth century We wish to do so one year after_the Third General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , which as -isaia- well_known , was devoted to evangelization ; and we do so all the more willingly because it has_been asked of us by the Synod Fathers themselves . In fact , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of that memorable Assembly , the Fathers decided to remit to the Pastor of the universal Church , with_great trust and simplicity , the fruits of all their labors , stating that_they awaited from him a fresh forward impulse , capable of creating within a Church still_more firmly rooted in the undying power and strength of Pentecost a new period of evangelization . We have stressed the importance of this theme of evangelization on many occasions , well before the Synod took_place . On June , , we said to the Sacred College of Cardinals : '' The conditions of the society in which we live oblige all of us therefore to revise methods , to seek by every_means to study how we can bring_the Christian message to modern man . For it -isaia- only in the Christian message that modern man can_find the answer to his questions and the energy for his commitment of human solidarity . '' And we added that in order to give a valid answer to the demands of the Council which call_for our attention , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_for us to take into_account a heritage of faith_that the Church has the duty of preserving in its untouchable purity , and of presenting it to the people of our_time , in a way that_-isaia- as understandable and persuasive as possible . This fidelity both to a message whose servants we are and to the people to whom we must transmit it living and intact -isaia- the central axis of evangelization . It poses three burning questions , which_the Synod kept constantly in mind : In our_day , what_has happened to that hidden energy of the Good News , which_-isaia- able to have a powerful effect on man s conscience ? To what extent and in what way -isaia- that evangelical force capable of really transforming the people of this century ? What methods should be followed in order_that the power of the Gospel may_have its effect ? Basically , these inquiries make explicit the fundamental question that the Church -isaia- asking herself today and which_may be expressed in the following terms : after_the Council and thanks to the Council , which_was a time given her by God , -atti_degli_apostoli- this turning point of history , does the Church or does she not find herself better equipped to proclaim_the Gospel and to put it into people s hearts with conviction , freedom of spirit and effectiveness ? . We can all see the urgency of giving a loyal , humble and courageous answer to this_question , and of acting accordingly . In our '' anxiety for all the Churches , '' we would_like to help our brethren and sons_and_daughters to reply to these inquiries . Our words come from the wealth of the Synod and are meant to be a meditation on evangelization . May they succeed in inviting the whole People of God assembled in the Church to make_the same meditation ; and may_they give a fresh impulse to everyone , especially_those '' who_are assiduous in preaching and teaching , '' so that_each one of them may follow '' a straight course in the message of the truth , '' and may work as a preacher of the Gospel and acquit himself perfectly of his_ministry . Such an exhortation seems to us to be of capital importance , for the presentation of the Gospel message -isaia- not an optional contribution for the Church . It -isaia-_the_duty incumbent on her by the command of the Lord Jesus , so that people can believe and be saved . This message -isaia- indeed necessary . It does_not permit either indifference , syncretism or accommodation . It -isaia-_a_question of people s salvation . It -isaia- the beauty of the Revelation that it represents . It brings with it a wisdom that_-isaia-_not of this_world . It -isaia- able to stir up by itself faith faith_that rests on the power of God . It merits having the apostle consecrate to it all his time and all his energies , and to sacrifice for it , if necessary , his own_life . The witness that the Lord gives of Himself and that Saint Luke gathered together in his Gospel '' I must proclaim_the Good News of the kingdom of God '' without_doubt has enormous consequences , for it sums up the whole mission of Jesus : '' That -isaia- what I was sent to do . '' These words take on their full significance if one links them_with_the previous verses , in which Christ has just applied to Himself the words of the prophet Isaiah : '' The Spirit of the Lord has_been_given to me , for he has anointed me . He has_sent me to bring_the good_news to the poor . '' Going from town to town , preaching to the poorest and frequently the most receptive the joyful news of the fulfillment of the promises and of the Covenant offered by God -isaia- the mission for_which Jesus declares that He -isaia- sent by the Father . And all the aspects of His mystery the Incarnation itself , His miracles , His teaching , the gathering together of the disciples , the sending out of the Twelve , the cross and the resurrection , the permanence of His presence in the midst of His own were components of His evangelizing activity . During the Synod , the bishops very frequently referred to this_truth : Jesus Himself , the Good News of God , was_the very first and the greatest evangelizer ; He was so through and through : to perfection and to the point of the sacrifice of His earthly life . To evangelize : what meaning did this imperative have for Christ ? It -isaia- certainly not easy to express in a complete synthesis the meaning , the content and the modes of evangelization as Jesus conceived it and put it into_practice . In any case the attempt to make such a synthesis will_never end . Let it suffice for us to recall a few essential aspects . As an evangelizer , Christ first of all proclaims a kingdom , the kingdom of God ; and this_-isaia- so important_that , by comparison , everything else becomes '' the rest , '' which_-isaia- '' given in addition . '' Only the kingdom therefore -isaia- absolute and it makes everything else relative . The Lord will delight in describing in many_ways the happiness of belonging to this kingdom a paradoxical happiness which_-isaia- made up of things that_the_world rejects , the demands of the kingdom and its Magna Charta , the heralds of the kingdom , its mysteries , its children , the vigilance and fidelity demanded of whoever awaits its definitive coming . As the kernel and center of His Good News , Christ proclaims salvation , this_great gift of God which_-isaia- liberation from everything_that oppresses man but which_-isaia- above all liberation from sin and the Evil One , in the joy of knowing God and being known by Him , of seeing Him , and of being given over to Him . All of this_-isaia- begun during the life of Christ and definitively accomplished by His death_and_resurrection . But it must be patiently carried on during the course of history , in order to be realized fully on the day of the final coming of Christ , whose date -isaia- known to no one except the Father . This kingdom and this salvation , which_are the key words of Jesus Christ s evangelization , are available to every_human_being as grace and mercy , and yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time each_individual must gain them by force they belong to the violent , says the Lord , through toil and suffering , through a life lived according to the Gospel , through abnegation and the cross , through the spirit of the beatitudes . But above all each_individual gains them through a total interior renewal which_the Gospel calls metanoia ; it -isaia- a radical conversion , a profound change of mind_and_heart . Christ accomplished this proclamation of the kingdom of God through the untiring preaching of a word which , it will be said , has no equal elsewhere : '' Here -isaia- a teaching that_-isaia- new , and with authority behind it . '' '' And he won the approval of all , and they_were astonished by the gracious words that came from his lips . There has_never been anybody who_has spoken like him . '' His words reveal the secret of God , His plan and His promise , and thereby change the heart of man and his destiny . But Christ also carries out this proclamation by innumerable signs , which amaze the crowds and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time draw them to Him in order to see Him , listen to Him and allow themselves to be transformed by Him : the sick are cured , water -isaia- changed into wine , bread -isaia- multiplied , the dead come back to life . And among all these signs there -isaia-_the_one to which He attaches great_importance : the humble and the poor are evangelized , become His disciples and gather together '' in His name '' in the great community of those who_believe in Him . For this Jesus who declared , '' I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God '' -isaia-_the_same Jesus of whom John the Evangelist said_that He had come and was to die '' to gather together in unity the scattered children of God . '' Thus He accomplishes His revelation , completing it and confirming it by the entire revelation that He makes of Himself , by words and deeds , by signs and miracles , and more especially by His death , by His resurrection and by the sending of the Spirit of Truth . Those who sincerely accept the Good News , through the power of this acceptance and of shared faith therefore gather together in Jesus name in order to seek together the kingdom , build it up and live it . They make up a community which_-isaia- in its turn evangelizing . The command to the Twelve to go out and proclaim_the Good News -isaia-_also valid for all Christians , though in a different way . It -isaia- precisely for_this reason_that Peter calls Christians '' a people set apart to sing the praises of God , '' those marvelous things_that each_one was able to hear in his_own language . Moreover , the Good News of the kingdom which_-isaia- coming and which_has begun -isaia- meant for all people of all times . Those who have_received the Good News and who_have_been gathered by it into the community of salvation can and must communicate and spread it . The Church knows this . She has a vivid awareness of the fact_that the Savior s words , '' I must proclaim_the Good News of the kingdom of God , '' apply in all truth to herself : She willingly adds with St . Paul : '' Not that I boast of preaching the gospel , since_it_-isaia- a duty that_has_been laid on me ; I should be punished if I did_not preach it '' It -isaia- with_joy and consolation that -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the great Assembly of we heard these illuminating words : '' We wish to confirm once_more that the task of evangelizing all people constitutes the essential mission of the Church . '' It -isaia- a task and mission which_the vast and profound changes of present_day society make all the more urgent . Evangelizing -isaia-_in_fact the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her deepest identity . She exists in order to evangelize , that_-isaia- to say , in order to preach and teach , to be the channel of the gift of grace , to reconcile sinners with God , and to perpetuate Christ s sacrifice in the Mass , which_-isaia- the memorial of His death and glorious resurrection . Anyone who rereads in the New Testament the origins of the Church , follows her history step by step and watches her live and act , sees that she_-isaia- linked to evangelization in her most intimate being : The Church -isaia- born of the evangelizing activity of Jesus and the Twelve . She -isaia- the normal , desired , most immediate and most visible fruit of this activity : '' Go , therefore , make disciples of all the nations . '' Now , '' they accepted what he said and were baptized . That very day about three thousand were added to their number . Day by day the Lord added to their community those destined to be saved . '' Having been born consequently out of being sent , the Church in her turn -isaia- sent by Jesus . The Church remains in the world when_the Lord of glory returns to the Father . She remains as a sign simultaneously obscure and luminous of a new presence of Jesus , of His departure and of His permanent presence . She prolongs and continues Him . And it -isaia- above all His mission and His condition of being an evangelizer that she_-isaia- called_upon to continue . For the Christian community -isaia- never closed in upon itself . The intimate life of this community the life of listening to the Word and the apostles teaching , charity lived in a fraternal way , the sharing of bread this intimate life only acquires its_full meaning when it becomes a witness , when it evokes admiration and conversion , and when it becomes_the preaching and proclamation of the Good News . Thus it -isaia- the whole Church that receives the mission to evangelize , and the work of each_individual member -isaia- important_for the whole . The Church -isaia- an evangelizer , but she begins by being evangelized herself . She -isaia- the community of believers , the community of hope lived and communicated , the community of brotherly_love , and she needs to listen unceasingly to what she must believe , to her reasons for hoping , to the new commandment of love . She -isaia- the People of God immersed in the world , and often tempted by idols , and she always needs to hear_the proclamation of the '' mighty works of God '' which converted her to the Lord ; she always needs to be called together afresh by Him and reunited . In brief , this means_that she_has a constant need of being evangelized , if she wishes to retain freshness , vigor and strength in order to proclaim_the Gospel . The Second Vatican Council recalled and the Synod vigorously took up again this theme of the Church which_-isaia- evangelized by constant conversion and renewal , in order to evangelize the world with credibility . The Church -isaia- the depositary of the Good News to be proclaimed . The promises of the New Alliance in Jesus Christ , the teaching of the Lord and the apostles , the Word of life , the sources of grace and of God s loving kindness , the path of salvation all these_things have_been entrusted to her . It -isaia- the content of the Gospel , and therefore of evangelization , that_she preserves as a precious living heritage , not in order to keep it hidden but to communicate it . Having been sent and evangelized , the Church herself sends out evangelizers . She puts on their lips the saving Word , she explains to them the message of which_she herself -isaia- the depositary , she gives them the mandate which_she herself has_received and she sends them out to preach . To preach not their_own selves or their_personal ideas , but a Gospel of which neither she nor they_are the absolute masters and owners , to dispose of it as they wish , but a Gospel of which_they_are the ministers , in order to pass it on with complete fidelity . There -isaia- thus a profound link between Christ , the Church and evangelization . During the period of the Church that_we_are living in , it -isaia- she_who has the task of evangelizing . This mandate -isaia- not accomplished without her , and still less against her . It -isaia- certainly fitting to recall this_fact -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment like the present one when it happens_that not_without sorrow we can hear people whom we wish to believe are_well intentioned but who_are certainly misguided in their attitude continually claiming to love Christ but without_the Church , to listen to Christ but_not the Church , to belong to Christ but outside the Church . The absurdity of this dichotomy -isaia- clearly evident in this phrase of the Gospel : '' Anyone who rejects you rejects me . '' And how_can one wish to love Christ without loving the Church , if the finest witness to Christ -isaia- that of St . Paul : '' Christ loved the Church and sacrificed himself for_her '' ? . In the Church s evangelizing activity there_are of course certain elements and aspects to be specially insisted on . Some of them are so important_that there_will be a tendency simply to identify them_with evangelization . Thus it has_been possible to define evangelization in terms of proclaiming Christ to those who_do_not know Him , of preaching , of catechesis , of conferring Baptism and the other sacraments . Any partial and fragmentary definition which attempts to render the reality of evangelization in all its richness , complexity and dynamism does so only -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of impoverishing it and even of distorting it . It -isaia- impossible to grasp the concept of evangelization unless one tries to keep in view all its essential elements . These elements were strongly emphasized -atti_degli_apostoli- the last Synod , and are_still the subject of frequent study , as a result of the Synod s work . We rejoice in the fact that_these elements basically follow_the lines of those transmitted to us by the Second Vatican Council , especially in '' Lumen gentium , '' '' Gaudium et spes '' and '' Ad gentes . For the Church , evangelizing means bringing the Good News into all the strata of humanity , and through its influence transforming humanity from within and making it new : '' Now I -amos- making the whole of creation new . '' But there_-isaia- no new humanity if there_are not first of all new persons renewed by Baptism and by lives lived according to the Gospel . The purpose of evangelization_-isaia- therefore precisely this interior change , and if it had to be expressed in one sentence the best way of stating it would be to say that the Church evangelizes when_she seeks to convert , solely through the divine power of the message she proclaims , both the personal and collective consciences of people , the activities in which_they engage , and the lives and concrete milieu which_are theirs . Strata of humanity which_are transformed : for the Church it -isaia-_a_question not_only of preaching the Gospel in ever wider geographic areas or to ever_greater numbers of people , but_also of affecting and as it were upsetting , through the power of the Gospel , mankind s criteria of judgment , determining values , points of interest , lines of thought , sources of inspiration and models of life_,_which are in contrast with the Word of God and the plan of salvation . All this could he expressed in the following words : what matters -isaia- to evangelize man s culture and cultures not in a purely decorative way , as it were , by applying a thin veneer , but in a vital way , in depth and right to their_very roots , in the wide and rich sense which these terms have in Gaudium et spes , always taking the person as one s starting point and always coming back to the relationships of people among_themselves and with God . The Gospel , and therefore evangelization , are certainly not identical with culture , and they_are independent in regard to all cultures . Nevertheless , the kingdom which_the Gospel proclaims -isaia- lived by men_who are profoundly linked to a culture , and the building up of the kingdom cannot avoid borrowing the elements of human culture or cultures . Though independent of cultures , the Gospel and evangelization are_not necessarily incompatible with_them ; rather they_are capable of permeating them all without becoming subject to any_one of them . The split between_the Gospel and culture -isaia- without a doubt the drama of our_time , just as it was of other times . Therefore every_effort must be made to ensure a full evangelization of culture , or more correctly of cultures . They have to be regenerated by an encounter_with_the Gospel . But this encounter will_not take_place if the Gospel -isaia- not proclaimed . Above all the Gospel must be proclaimed by witness . Take a Christian or a handful of Christians who , in the midst of their_own community , show their capacity_for understanding and acceptance , their sharing of life and destiny with_other people , their solidarity with the efforts of all for whatever_-isaia- noble and good . Let us suppose that , in addition , they radiate in an altogether simple and unaffected way their_faith in values that go beyond current values , and their hope in something that_-isaia-_not seen and that_one would_not dare to imagine . Through this wordless witness these Christians stir up irresistible questions in the hearts of those_who see_how they live : Why are they like this ? Why do they live in this_way ? What or who_-isaia- it that inspires them ? Why are they in our midst ? Such a witness -isaia-_already a silent proclamation of the Good News and a very powerful and effective one . Here we have an initial act of evangelization . The above questions will ask , whether_they are people to whom Christ has_never been proclaimed , or baptized people_who do not practice , or people_who live as nominal Christians but according to principles that_are in no way Christian , or people_who_are seeking , and not_without suffering , something or someone whom_they sense but cannot name . Other questions will arise , deeper and more demanding ones , questions evoked by this witness which involves presence , sharing , solidarity , and which_-isaia- an essential element , and generally the first one , in evangelization . '' All Christians are_called to this witness , and in this_way they_can be real evangelizers . We are thinking especially of the responsibility incumbent on immigrants in the country that receives them . Nevertheless this always remains insufficient , because even the finest witness will prove ineffective in the long run if it -isaia- not explained , justified what Peter called always having '' your answer ready for people_who ask you the reason_for the hope_that you all have '' and made explicit by a clear and unequivocal proclamation of the Lord Jesus . The Good News proclaimed by the witness of life sooner or later has to be proclaimed by the word of life . There -isaia- no true evangelization if the name , the teaching , the life , the promises , the kingdom and the mystery of Jesus of Nazareth , the Son of God are_not proclaimed . The history of the Church , from the discourse of Peter on the morning of Pentecost onwards , has_been intermingled and identified with the history of this proclamation . At every new phase of human_history , the Church , constantly gripped by the desire to evangelize , has but_one preoccupation : whom to send to proclaim_the mystery of Jesus ? In what way -isaia- this_mystery to be proclaimed ? How can one ensure_that it will resound and reach all those_who should hear it ? This proclamation kerygma , preaching or catechesis occupies such an important place in evangelization that it has often become synonymous with it ; and yet it -isaia- only_one aspect of evangelization . In fact the proclamation only reaches full development when_it_-isaia- listened to , accepted and assimilated , and when it arouses a genuine adherence in the one_who has thus received it . An adherence to the truths_which the Lord in His mercy has revealed ; still_more , an adherence to a program of life a life henceforth transformed which He proposes . In a word , adherence to the kingdom , that_-isaia- to say , to the '' new world , '' to the new state of things , to the new manner of being , of living , of living in community , which_the Gospel inaugurates . Such an adherence , which_cannot remain abstract and unincarnated , reveals itself concretely by a visible entry into a community of believers . Thus those_whose life has_been transformed enter a community which_-isaia- itself a sign of transformation , a sign of newness of life : it -isaia- the Church , the visible sacrament of salvation . Our entry into the ecclesial_community will in its turn be expressed through many_other signs which prolong and unfold the sign of the Church . In the dynamism of evangelization , a person_who accepts the Church as the Word which saves normally translates it into the following sacramental acts : adherence to the Church , and acceptance of the sacraments , which manifest and support this adherence through the grace_which they confer . Finally , the person_who has_been evangelized goes on to evangelize others . Here lies the test of truth , the touchstone of evangelization : it -isaia- unthinkable that a person should accept the Word and give himself to the kingdom without becoming a person_who bears_witness to it and proclaims it in his turn . To complete these considerations on the meaning of evangelization , a final observation must be made , one_which we consider will_help to clarify the reflections that follow . Evangelization , as we have_said , -isaia- a complex process made up of varied elements : the renewal of humanity , witness , explicit proclamation , inner adherence , entry into the community , acceptance of signs , apostolic initiative . These elements may appear to be contradictory , indeed mutually exclusive . In fact they_are complementary and mutually enriching . Each one must_always be seen in relationship_with the others . The value of the last Synod was to have constantly invited us to relate these elements rather_than to place them in opposition one to the other , in order to reach a full understanding of the Church s evangelizing activity . It -isaia- this global vision which we now wish to outline , by examining the content of evangelization and the methods of evangelizing and by clarifying to whom_the Gospel message -isaia- addressed and who today -isaia- responsible_for it . In the message which_the Church proclaims there_are certainly many secondary elements . Their presentation depends greatly on changing circumstances . They themselves also change . But there_-isaia- the essential content , the living substance , which_cannot be modified or ignored without seriously diluting the nature of evangelization itself . It -isaia- not superfluous to recall_the following points : to evangelize -isaia- first of all to bear_witness , in a simple and direct way , to God revealed by Jesus Christ , in the Holy Spirit , to bear_witness that in His Son God has loved the world_that in His Incarnate Word He has_given being to all things and has called men to eternal_life . Perhaps this attestation of God will be for many_people the unknown God whom_they adore without giving Him a name , or whom_they seek by a secret call of the heart when_they experience the emptiness of all idols . But it -isaia- fully evangelizing in manifesting the fact_that for_man the Creator -isaia- not an anonymous and remote power ; He -isaia- the Father : '' . that_we_should be called children of God ; and so we are . '' And thus we are one_another s brothers_and_sisters in God . Evangelization will_also always contain as the foundation , center , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , summit of its dynamism a clear proclamation that , in Jesus Christ , the Son of God made man_,_who died and rose from the dead , salvation -isaia- offered to all men , as a gift of God s grace and mercy . And not an immanent salvation , meeting material or even spiritual needs , restricted to the framework of temporal existence and completely identified with temporal desires , hopes , affairs and struggles , but a salvation which exceeds all these limits in order to reach fulfillment in a communion with the one and only divine Absolute : a transcendent and eschatological salvation , which indeed has its beginning in this_life but which_-isaia- fulfilled in eternity . Consequently evangelization cannot_but include the prophetic proclamation of a hereafter , man s profound and definitive calling , in both continuity and discontinuity with the present situation : beyond time and history , beyond_the transient reality of this_world , and beyond_the things of this_world , of which a hidden dimension will one_day be revealed beyond man_himself , whose true destiny -isaia- not restricted to his temporal aspect but will be revealed in the future life . Evangelization therefore also includes the preaching of hope in the promises made by God in the new Covenant in Jesus Christ ; the preaching of God s love for us and of our love for God ; the preaching of brotherly_love for all men the capacity of giving and forgiving , of self denial , of helping one s brother and sister which , springing from the love of God , -isaia- the kernel of the Gospel ; the preaching of the mystery of evil and of the active search_for good . The preaching likewise and this_-isaia- always urgent of the search_for God Himself through prayer which_-isaia- principally that of adoration and thanksgiving , but_also through communion with the visible sign of the encounter_with God which_-isaia- the Church of Jesus Christ ; and this communion in its turn -isaia- expressed by the application of those other signs of Christ living and acting in the Church which_are the sacraments . To live the sacraments in this_way , bringing their celebration to a true fullness , -isaia- not , as some would claim , to impede or to accept a distortion of evangelization : it -isaia- rather to complete it . For in its totality , evangelization over and above the preaching of a message consists in the implantation of the Church , which_does_not exist without_the driving force which_-isaia- the sacramental life culminating in the Eucharist . But evangelization would_not be complete if it did_not take account of the unceasing interplay of the Gospel and of man s concrete life , both personal and social . This -isaia- why evangelization involves an explicit message , adapted to the different situations constantly being realized , about the rights_and_duties of every_human_being , about family_life without_which personal growth and development -isaia- hardly possible , about life in society , about international life , peace , justice and development a message especially energetic today about liberation . It -isaia- well_known in what terms numerous bishops from all the continents spoke of this -atti_degli_apostoli- the last Synod , especially_the bishops from the Third World , with a pastoral accent resonant with the voice of the millions of sons_and_daughters of the Church who make up those peoples . Peoples , as we know , engaged with all their energy in the effort and struggle to overcome everything which condemns them to remain on the margin of life : famine , chronic disease , illiteracy , poverty , injustices in international relations and especially in commercial exchanges , situations of economic and cultural neo colonialism sometimes as cruel as the old political colonialism . The Church , as the bishops repeated , has the duty to proclaim_the liberation of millions of human_beings , many of whom are her_own children the duty of assisting the birth of this liberation , of giving witness to it , of ensuring that_it_-isaia- complete . This -isaia- not foreign to evangelization . Between evangelization and human advancement development and liberation there_are in fact profound links . These include links of an anthropological order , because the man who_-isaia- to be evangelized -isaia- not an abstract being but_-isaia- subject to social_and_economic questions . They also include links in the theological order , since one_cannot dissociate the plan of creation from the plan of Redemption . The latter plan touches the very concrete situations of injustice to be combated and of justice to be restored . They include links of the eminently evangelical order , which_-isaia- that of charity : how in fact can one proclaim_the new commandment without promoting in justice and in peace the true , authentic advancement of man ? We ourself have_taken care to point this out , by recalling that_it_-isaia- impossible to accept '' that in evangelization one could or should ignore the importance of the problems so much discussed today , concerning justice , liberation , development and peace in the world . This would be to forget the lesson which_comes to us from the Gospel concerning love of our neighbor who_-isaia- suffering and in need . '' The same voices which during the Synod touched on this burning theme with zeal , intelligence and courage have , to our great joy , furnished the enlightening principles for a proper understanding of the importance and profound meaning of liberation , such as it was proclaimed and achieved by Jesus of Nazareth and such as it -isaia- preached by the Church . We must_not ignore the fact_that many , even generous Christians who_are sensitive to the dramatic questions involved in the problem of liberation , in their wish to commit the Church to the liberation effort are frequently tempted to reduce her_mission to the dimensions of a simply temporal project . They would reduce her aims to a man centered goal ; the salvation of which she_-isaia- the messenger would be reduced to material well_being . Her activity , forgetful of all spiritual and religious preoccupation , would become initiatives of the political or social_order . But if this were so , the Church would lose her fundamental meaning . Her message of liberation would no longer have any originality and would easily be open to monopolization and manipulation by ideological systems and political parties . She would_have no more authority to proclaim freedom as in the name of God . This -isaia- why we have wished to emphasize , in the same address -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening of the Synod , '' the need to restate clearly_the specifically religious finality of evangelization . This latter would lose its reason_for existence if it were to diverge from the religious axis that guides it : the kingdom of God , before anything else , in its fully theological meaning . With regard to the liberation which evangelization proclaims and strives to put into_practice one_should rather say this : it cannot be contained in the simple and restricted dimension of economics , politics , social or cultural life ; it must envisage the whole man , in all his aspects , right up to and including his openness to the absolute , even the divine Absolute ; it -isaia- therefore attached to a view of man which it can_never sacrifice to the needs of any strategy , practice or short term efficiency . Hence , when preaching liberation and associating herself with_those_who are working and suffering for it , the Church -isaia- certainly not willing to restrict her_mission only to the religious field and dissociate herself from man s temporal problems . Nevertheless she reaffirms the primacy of her spiritual vocation and refuses to replace the proclamation of the kingdom by the proclamation of forms of human liberation she even states that her contribution to liberation -isaia- incomplete if she neglects to proclaim salvation in Jesus Christ . The Church links human liberation and salvation in Jesus Christ , but she never identifies them , because_she knows through revelation , historical experience and the reflection of faith_that not every notion of liberation -isaia- necessarily consistent and compatible with an evangelical vision of man , of things and of events ; she knows too that in order_that God s kingdom should come it -isaia-_not_enough to establish liberation and to create well_being and development . And what_-isaia- more , the Church has the firm conviction_that all temporal liberation , all political liberation even if it endeavors to find its justification in such or such a page of the Old or New Testament , even if it claims for its ideological postulates and its norms of action theological data and conclusions , even if it pretends to be today s theology carries within itself the germ of its_own negation and fails to reach the ideal that it proposes for itself whenever its profound motives are_not those of justice in charity , whenever its zeal lacks a truly spiritual dimension and whenever its final goal -isaia- not salvation and happiness in God . The Church considers it to be undoubtedly important to build up structures which_are more_human , more just , more respectful of the rights of the person and less oppressive and less enslaving , but she_-isaia- conscious that the best structures and the most idealized systems soon become inhuman if the inhuman inclinations of the human_heart are_not made wholesome , if those_who live in these structures or who rule them do not undergo a conversion of heart and of outlook . The Church cannot accept violence , especially_the force of arms which_-isaia- uncontrollable once it -isaia- let loose and indiscriminate death as the path to liberation , because_she knows that violence always provokes violence and irresistibly engenders new_forms of oppression and enslavement which are_often harder to bear than those from which_they claimed to bring freedom . We said this clearly during our journey in Colombia : '' We exhort you not to place your trust in violence and revolution : that_-isaia- contrary to the Christian spirit , and it can_also delay instead of advancing that social uplifting to which_you lawfully aspire . '' '' We must say and reaffirm that violence -isaia- not in accord with the Gospel , that_it_-isaia- not Christian ; and that sudden or violent changes of structures would be deceitful , ineffective of themselves , and certainly not in conformity_with_the dignity of the people . Having said this , we rejoice that the Church -isaia- becoming ever_more conscious of the proper manner and strictly evangelical means_that she possesses in order to collaborate in the liberation of many . And what_-isaia- she doing ? She -isaia- trying more_and_more to encourage large numbers of Christians to devote_themselves to the liberation of men . She -isaia- providing these Christian '' liberators '' with the inspiration of faith , the motivation of fraternal love , a social_teaching which_the true Christian cannot ignore and which he must make_the foundation of his wisdom and of his experience in order to translate it concretely into forms of action , participation and commitment . All this_must characterize the spirit of a committed Christian , without confusion with tactical attitudes or with the service of a political system . The Church strives always to insert the Christian struggle for liberation into the universal plan of salvation which_she herself proclaims . What we have just recalled comes out more_than_once in the Synod debates . In fact we devoted to this theme a few clarifying words in our address to the Fathers -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the assembly . It -isaia- to be hoped that all these considerations will_help to remove the ambiguity which_the word '' liberation '' very often takes on in ideologies , political systems or groups . The liberation which evangelization proclaims and prepares -isaia-_the_one which Christ Himself announced and gave to man by His sacrifice . The necessity of ensuring fundamental human_rights cannot be separated_from this just liberation which_-isaia- bound up with evangelization and which endeavors to secure structures safeguarding human freedoms . Among these fundamental human_rights , religious liberty occupies a place of primary importance . We recently spoke of the relevance of this_matter , emphasizing '' how_many Christians still today , because_they_are Christians , because_they_are Catholics , live oppressed by systematic persecution ! The drama of fidelity to Christ and of the freedom of religion continues , even if it -isaia- disguised by categorical declarations in favor of the rights of the person and of life in society ! '' . The obvious importance of the content of evangelization must_not overshadow the importance of the ways and means . This question of '' how to evangelize '' -isaia- permanently relevant , because the methods of evangelizing vary according to the different circumstances of time , place and culture , and because_they thereby present a certain challenge to our capacity_for discovery and adaptation . On us particularly , the pastors of the Church , rests the responsibility_for reshaping with boldness and wisdom , but in complete fidelity to the content of evangelization , the means_that are_most suitable and effective for communicating the Gospel message to the men_and_women of our_times . Let it suffice , in this meditation , to mention a number of methods which , for one reason or another , have a fundamental importance . Without repeating everything_that we have_already mentioned , it -isaia- appropriate first of all to emphasize the following point : for the Church , the first means of evangelization_-isaia- the witness of an authentically Christian life , given over to God in a communion that_nothing should destroy and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time given to one s neighbor with limitless zeal . As we said recently to a group of lay_people , '' Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers , and if he does listen to teachers , it -isaia- because_they_are witnesses . Peter expressed this well when he held up the example of a reverent and chaste life_that wins over even without a word those_who refuse to obey the word . It -isaia- therefore primarily by her conduct and by her life_that the Church will evangelize the world , in other_words , by her living witness of fidelity to the Lord Jesus the witness of poverty and detachment , of freedom in the face of the powers of this_world , in short , the witness of sanctity . Secondly , it -isaia- not superfluous to emphasize the importance and necessity of preaching . '' And how are they to believe in him of whom_they have_never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ? . So faith comes_from what_-isaia- heard and what_-isaia- heard comes by the preaching of Christ . '' This law once laid_down by the Apostle Paul maintains its_full force today . Preaching , the verbal proclamation of a message , -isaia- indeed always indispensable . We are_well aware_that modern man_-isaia- sated by talk ; he -isaia- obviously often tired of listening and , what_-isaia- worse , impervious to words . We are_also aware_that many psychologists and sociologists express the view that modern man_has passed beyond_the civilization of the word , which_-isaia- now ineffective and useless , and that today he lives in the civilization of the image . These facts should certainly impel us to employ , for the purpose of transmitting the Gospel message , the modern means which_this civilization has produced . Very positive efforts have in fact already_been made in this sphere . We cannot_but praise them and encourage their further development . The fatigue produced these_days by so much empty talk and the relevance of many other_forms of communication must_not however diminish the permanent power of the word , or cause a loss of confidence in it . The word remains ever relevant , especially_when it -isaia- the bearer of the power of God . This -isaia- why St . Paul s axiom , '' Faith comes_from what_-isaia- heard , '' also retains its relevance : it -isaia- the Word that_-isaia- heard which_leads to belief . This evangelizing preaching takes on many forms , and zeal will inspire the reshaping of them almost indefinitely . In fact there_are innumerable events in life and human situations which offer the opportunity_for a discreet but incisive statement of what_the Lord has to say in this or that particular circumstance . It suffices to have true spiritual sensitivity for reading God s message in events . But -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the liturgy renewed by the Council has_given greatly increased value to the Liturgy of the Word , it would be a mistake not to see in the homily an important and very adaptable instrument of evangelization . Of course it -isaia- necessary to know and put to good use the exigencies and the possibilities of the homily , so that it can acquire all its pastoral effectiveness . But above all it -isaia- necessary to be convinced of this and to devote oneself to it with love . This preaching , inserted in a unique way into the Eucharistic celebration , from which it receives special force and vigor , certainly has a particular role in evangelization , to the extent_that it expresses the profound faith of the sacred minister and -isaia- impregnated with love . The faithful assembled as a Paschal Church , celebrating the feast of the Lord present in their midst , expect much from this preaching , and will greatly benefit from it provided that_it_-isaia- simple , clear , direct , well adapted , profoundly dependent on Gospel teaching and faithful to the magisterium , animated by a balanced apostolic ardor coming from its_own characteristic nature , full of hope , fostering belief , and productive of peace and unity . Many parochial or other communities live and are held together thanks to the Sunday homily , when it possesses these qualities . Let us add that , thanks to the same liturgical renewal , the Eucharistic celebration -isaia- not the only appropriate moment for the homily . The homily has a place and must_not be neglected in the celebration of all the sacraments , -atti_degli_apostoli- paraliturgies , and in assemblies of the faithful . It will_always be a privileged occasion for communicating the Word of the Lord . A means of evangelization that_must not be neglected -isaia- that of catechetical instruction . The intelligence , especially that of children and young_people , needs to learn through systematic religious instruction the fundamental teachings , the living content of the truth_which God has wished to convey to us and which_the Church has sought to express in an ever richer fashion during the course of her long history . No one will deny that_this instruction must_be_given to form patterns of Christian living and not to remain only notional . Truly the effort for evangelization will profit greatly -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of catechetical instruction given_-atti_degli_apostoli- church , in the schools , where this_-isaia- possible , and in every case in Christian homes if those giving catechetical instruction have suitable texts , updated with wisdom and competence , under the authority of the bishops . The methods must be adapted to the age , culture and aptitude of the persons concerned , they_must seek always to fix in the memory , intelligence and heart_the essential truths that_must impregnate all of life . It -isaia- necessary above all to prepare good instructors parochial catechists , teachers , parents who_are desirous of perfecting themselves in this superior art , which_-isaia- indispensable and requires religious instruction . Moreover , without neglecting in any_way the training of children , one sees that present conditions render ever_more urgent catechetical instruction , under the form of the catechumenate , for innumerable young_people and adults who , touched by grace , discover little by little the face of Christ and feel the need of giving themselves to Him . Our century -isaia- characterized by the mass_media or means of social communication , and the first proclamation , catechesis or the further deepening of faith cannot do without these means , as we have_already emphasized . When they_are put -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Gospel , they_are capable of increasing almost indefinitely the area in which_the Word of God -isaia- heard ; they enable the Good News to reach millions of people . The Church would feel guilty before the Lord if she did_not utilize these powerful means_that human skill -isaia- daily rendering more_perfect . It -isaia- through them that_she proclaims '' from the housetops '' the message of which she_-isaia- the depositary . In them she finds a modern and effective version of the pulpit . Thanks to them she succeeds in speaking to the multitudes . Nevertheless the use of the means of social communication for evangelization presents a challenge : through them the evangelical message should reach vast numbers of people , but_with the capacity of piercing the conscience of each_individual , of implanting itself in his_heart as though he were_the only person being addressed , with all his_most individual and personal qualities , and evoke an entirely personal adherence and commitment . For this_reason , side by side with the collective proclamation of the Gospel , the other form of transmission , the person to person one , remains valid and important . The Lord often used it for example , with Nicodemus , Zacchaeus , the Samaritan woman , Simon the Pharisee , and so did the apostles . In the long run , -isaia- there any_other way of handing on the Gospel than by transmitting to another person one s personal experience of faith ? It must_not happen that the pressing need to proclaim_the Good News to the multitudes should cause us to forget this form of proclamation whereby an individual s personal conscience -isaia- reached and touched by an entirely unique word that he receives from someone else . We can_never sufficiently praise those priests_who through the sacrament of Penance or through pastoral dialogue show their readiness to guide people in the ways of the Gospel , to support them in their_efforts , to raise them up if they_have fallen , and always to assist them_with discernment and availability . Yet , one can_never sufficiently stress the fact_that evangelization does_not consist only of the preaching and teaching of a doctrine . For evangelization must touch life : the natural life to which it gives a new meaning , thanks to the evangelical perspectives that it reveals ; and the supernatural life , which_-isaia-_not the negation but the purification and elevation of the natural life . This supernatural life finds_its living expression in the seven sacraments and in the admirable radiation of grace and holiness which_they possess . Evangelization thus exercises its_full capacity when it achieves the most intimate relationship , or better still , a permanent and unbroken intercommunication , between_the Word and the sacraments . In a certain_sense it -isaia- a mistake to make a contrast between evangelization and sacramentalization , as -isaia- sometimes done . It -isaia- indeed true_that a certain way of administering the sacraments , without_the solid support of catechesis regarding these same sacraments and a global catechesis , could end up by depriving them of their effectiveness to a great extent . The role of evangelization_-isaia- precisely to educate people in the faith in such_a_way as to lead each_individual Christian to live the sacraments as true sacraments of faith and not to receive them passively or reluctantly . Here we touch upon an aspect of evangelization which_cannot leave us insensitive . We wish to speak about what today -isaia-_often called popular religiosity . One finds among the people particular expressions of the search_for God and for faith , both in the regions where_the Church has_been established for centuries and where she_-isaia- in the course of becoming established . These expressions were for a long time regarded as less pure and were sometimes despised , but today they_are almost everywhere being rediscovered . During the last Synod the bishops studied their significance with remarkable pastoral realism and zeal . Popular religiosity , of course , certainly has its limits . It -isaia-_often subject to penetration by many distortions of religion and even superstitions . It frequently remains -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of forms of worship not involving a true acceptance by faith . It can even lead to the creation of sects and endanger the true ecclesial_community . But if it -isaia- well oriented , above all by a pedagogy of evangelization , it -isaia- rich in values . It manifests a thirst_for God which only the simple and poor can know . It makes people capable of generosity and sacrifice even to the point of heroism , when it -isaia-_a_question of manifesting belief . It involves an acute awareness of profound attributes of God : fatherhood , providence , loving and constant presence . It engenders interior attitudes rarely observed to the same degree elsewhere : patience , the sense of the cross in daily_life , detachment , openness to others , devotion . By reason of these aspects , we readily call it '' popular_piety , '' that_-isaia- , religion of the people , rather_than religiosity . Pastoral charity must dictate to all those_whom the Lord has placed as leaders of the ecclesial_communities the proper attitude in regard to this reality , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time so rich and so vulnerable . Above all one_must be sensitive to it , know_how to perceive its interior dimensions and undeniable values , be ready to help it to overcome its risks of deviation . When it -isaia- well oriented , this popular religiosity call be more_and_more for multitudes of our people a true encounter_with God in Jesus Christ . Jesus last words in St . Mark s Gospel confer on the evangelization which_the Lord entrusts to His apostles a limitless universality : '' Go out to the whole_world ; proclaim_the Good News to all creation . '' The Twelve and the first generation of Christians understood well the lesson of this text and other similar ones ; they made them_into a program of action . Even persecution , by scattering the apostles , helped to spread the Word and to establish the Church in ever_more distant regions . The admission of Paul to the rank of the apostles and his charism as the preacher to the pagans the non Jews of Jesus Coming underlined this universality still_more . In the course of twenty centuries of history , the generations of Christians have periodically faced various obstacles to this universal mission . On the one_hand , on the part of the evangelizers themselves , there_has been_the temptation for various reasons to narrow down the field of their missionary_activity . On the other_hand , there_has been_the often humanly insurmountable resistance of the people being addressed by the evangelizer . Furthermore , we must note with sadness that the evangelizing work of the Church -isaia- strongly opposed , if not prevented , by certain public powers Even in our_own day it happens_that preachers of God s Word are deprived of their_rights , persecuted , threatened or eliminated solely for preaching Jesus Christ and His Gospel . But we are confident that despite these painful trials the activity of these apostles will_never meet final failure in any part_of_the_world . Despite such adversities , the Church constantly renews her deepest inspiration , that which_comes to her directly from the Lord : To the whole_world ! To all creation ! Right to the ends of the earth ! She did this once_more -atti_degli_apostoli- the last Synod , as an appeal not to imprison the proclamation of the Gospel by limiting it to one sector of mankind or to one class of people or to a single type of civilization . Some examples are revealing . To reveal Jesus Christ and His Gospel to those who_do_not know them has_been , ever since_the morning of Pentecost , the fundamental program which_the Church has_taken on as received_from her Founder . The whole of the New Testament , and in a special_way the Acts of the Apostles , bears_witness to a privileged and in a sense exemplary moment of this missionary effort which_will subsequently leave its mark on the whole history of the Church . She carries out this first proclamation of Jesus Christ by a complex and diversified activity which_-isaia- sometimes termed '' pre evangelization '' but_which -isaia-_already evangelization in a true sense , although -atti_degli_apostoli- its initial and still incomplete stage . An almost indefinite range of means can be used for this_purpose : explicit preaching , of course , but_also art , the scientific approach , philosophical research and legitimate recourse to the sentiments of the human_heart . This first proclamation -isaia- addressed especially to those_who_have never heard the Good News of Jesus , or to children . But , as a result of the frequent situations of dechristianization in our_day , it also proves equally necessary_for innumerable people who_have_been baptized but who_live quite outside Christian life , for simple people_who have a certain faith but an imperfect knowledge of the foundations of that_faith , for intellectuals who feel the need to know Jesus Christ in a light different from the instruction they received as children , and for many_others . This first proclamation -isaia-_also addressed to the immense sections of mankind who practice non Christian religions . The Church respects and esteems these non Christian religions because_they_are the living expression of the soul of vast groups of people . They carry within them the echo of thousands of years of searching for God , a quest which_-isaia- incomplete but often made with_great sincerity and righteousness of heart . They possess an impressive patrimony of deeply religious texts . They have taught generations of people how to pray . They are all impregnated with innumerable '' seeds of the Word '' and can constitute a true '' preparation_for the Gospel , '' to quote a felicitous term used by the Second Vatican Council and borrowed from Eusebius of Caesarea . Such a situation certainly raises complex and delicate questions that_must be studied in the light of Christian Tradition and the Church s magisterium , in order to offer to the missionaries of today and of tomorrow new horizons in their contacts with non Christian religions . We wish to point_out , above all today , that neither respect and esteem_for these religions nor the complexity of the questions raised -isaia- an invitation to the Church to withhold from_these non Christians the proclamation of Jesus Christ . On the contrary the Church holds that_these multitudes have_the right to know_the riches of the mystery of Christ riches in which we believe that_the_whole of humanity can_find , in unsuspected fullness , everything_that it -isaia- gropingly searching for concerning God , man and his destiny , life and death , and truth . Even in the face of natural religious expressions most worthy of esteem , the Church finds support in the fact_that the religion of Jesus , which_she proclaims through evangelization , objectively places man in relation with the plan of God , with His living presence and with His action ; she thus causes an encounter_with_the mystery of divine paternity that bends over towards humanity . In other_words , our religion effectively establishes with God an authentic and living relationship which_the other_religions do not succeed in doing , even_though they_have , as it were , their arms stretched out towards heaven . This -isaia- why_the Church keeps her missionary spirit alive , and even wishes to intensify it in the moment of history in which_we_are living . She feels responsible before entire peoples . She has no rest so long as she_has not done her best to proclaim_the Good News of Jesus the Savior . She -isaia- always preparing new generations of apostles . Let us state this_fact with_joy -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when there_are not lacking those_who think and even say that ardor and the apostolic spirit are exhausted , and that the time of the missions -isaia-_now past . The Synod has replied that the missionary proclamation never ceases and that the Church will_always be striving for the fulfillment of this proclamation . Nevertheless the Church does_not feel dispensed from paving unflagging attention also to those_who_have received_the faith and who_have_been in contact_with_the Gospel often for generations . Thus she seeks to deepen , consolidate , nourish and make ever_more mature the faith of those_who_are already called the faithful or believers , in order that_they_may be so still_more . This faith_-isaia- nearly always today exposed to secularism , even to militant atheism . It -isaia- a faith exposed to trials and threats , and even_more , a faith besieged and actively opposed . It runs the risk of perishing from suffocation or starvation if it -isaia- not fed and sustained each_day . To evangelize must_therefore very often be to give this necessary food and sustenance to the faith of believers , especially through a catechesis full of Gospel vitality and in a language suited to people and circumstances . The Church also_has a lively solicitude for the Christians who_are_not in full_communion with_her . While preparing with_them the unity willed by Christ , and precisely in order to realize unity in truth , she_has the consciousness that_she would be gravely lacking in her duty if she did_not give witness before them of the fullness of the revelation whose deposit she guards . Also significant -isaia- the preoccupation of the last Synod in regard to two spheres which_are very different from one_another but_which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time are_very close by reason of the challenge which_they make to evangelization , each in its_own way . The first sphere -isaia-_the_one which_can be called the increase of unbelief in the modern_world . The Synod endeavored to describe this modern_world : how_many currents of thought , values and countervalues , latent aspirations or seeds of destruction , old convictions which disappear and new convictions which arise are covered by this generic name ! From the spiritual point_of_view , the modern_world seems to he forever immersed in what a modern author has termed '' the drama of atheistic humanism . '' On the one_hand one_-isaia- forced to note in the very_heart of this contemporary world_the phenomenon which_-isaia- becoming almost its most striking characteristic : secularism . We are_not speaking of secularization , which_-isaia- the effort , in itself just and legitimate and in no way incompatible with_faith or religion , to discover in creation , in each thing or each happening in the universe , the laws which regulate them_with a certain autonomy , but_with the inner conviction_that the Creator has placed these laws there . The last Council has in this_sense affirmed the legitimate autonomy of culture and particularly of the sciences . Here we are thinking of a true secularism : a concept of the world according to which_the latter -isaia- self explanatory , without_any need_for recourse to God , who thus becomes superfluous and an encumbrance . This sort of secularism , in order to recognize_the power of man , therefore ends up by doing without God and even by denying Him . New forms of atheism seem to flow from it : a man centered atheism , no longer abstract and metaphysical but pragmatic , systematic and militant . Hand in hand with this atheistic secularism , we are daily faced , under the most diverse forms , with a consumer society , the pursuit of pleasure set up as the supreme value , a desire_for power and domination , and discrimination of every_kind : the inhuman tendencies of this '' humanism . '' In this_same modern_world , on the other_hand , and this_-isaia- a paradox , one_cannot deny the existence of real steppingstones to Christianity , and of evangelical values -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the form of a sense of emptiness or nostalgia . It would_not be an exaggeration to say that_there exists a powerful and tragic appeal to be evangelized . The second sphere -isaia- that of those who_do_not practice . Today there_-isaia- a very large number of baptized people_who for the most part have_not formally renounced their Baptism but who_are entirely indifferent to it and not living in accordance_with it . The phenomenon of the non practicing -isaia- a very ancient one in the history of Christianity ; it -isaia- the result of a natural weakness , a profound inconsistency which we unfortunately bear deep within us . Today however it shows certain new characteristics . It -isaia-_often the result of the uprooting typical of our_time . It also springs from the fact_that Christians live in close proximity with non believers and constantly experience the effects of unbelief . Furthermore , the non practicing Christians of today , more so than those of previous periods , seek to explain and justify their position in the name of an interior religion , of personal independence or authenticity . Thus we have atheists and unbelievers on the one side and those who_do_not practice on the other , and both groups put up a considerable resistance to evangelization . The resistance of the former takes the form of a certain refusal and an inability to grasp the new order of things , the new meaning of the world , of life and of history ; such_-isaia- not_possible if one does_not start from a divine absolute . The resistance of the second group takes the form of inertia and the slightly hostile attitude of the person_who feels that_he_-isaia- one of the homily , who claims to know it all and to have tried it all and who no longer believes it . Atheistic secularism and the absence of religious practice are_found among adults and among the young , among the leaders of society and among the ordinary people , -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels of education , and in both the old Churches and the young ones . The Church s evangelizing action cannot ignore these_two worlds , nor must it come to a standstill when faced_with them ; it must constantly seek the proper means and language for presenting , or representing , to them God s revelation and faith in Jesus Christ . Like Christ during the time of His preaching , like the Twelve on the morning of Pentecost , the Church too sees before her an immense multitude of people_who need the Gospel and have a right to it , for God '' wants everyone to be saved and reach full knowledge of the truth . '' The Church -isaia- deeply aware of her duty to preach salvation to all . Knowing that the Gospel message -isaia- not reserved to a small group of the initiated , the privileged or the elect , but_-isaia- destined for everyone , she shares Christ s anguish -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of the wandering and exhausted crowds , '' like sheep without a shepherd '' and she often repeats His words : '' I feel sorry for all these_people . '' But the Church -isaia-_also conscious of the fact_that , if the preaching of the Gospel -isaia- to be effective , she must address her message to the heart of the multitudes , to communities of the faithful whose action can and must reach others . The last Synod devoted considerable attention to these '' small communities , '' or communautes de base , because_they_are often talked about in the Church today . What are they , and why should they be the special beneficiaries of evangelization and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time evangelizers themselves ? According to the various statements heard in the Synod , such communities flourish more_or_less throughout_the Church . They differ greatly among_themselves both within_the same region and even_more so from one region to another . In some regions they appear and develop , almost without exception , within_the Church , having solidarity with her_life , being nourished by her teaching and united with_her pastors . In these cases , they spring from the need to live the Church s life more intensely , or from the desire and quest for a more_human dimension such as larger ecclesial_communities can_only offer with difficulty , especially in the big modern cities which lend themselves both to life in the mass and to anonymity . Such communities call quite simply be in their_own way an extension on the spiritual and religious level worship , deepening of faith , fraternal charity , prayer , contact_with pastors of the small sociological community such as the village , etc . Or again their aim may be to bring together , for the purpose of listening to and meditating on the Word , for the sacraments and the bond of the agape , groups of people_who_are linked by age , culture , civil state or social situation : married_couples , young_people , professional people , etc . ; people_who already happen to be united in the struggle for_justice , brotherly aid to the poor , human advancement . In still other cases they bring Christians together in places_where the shortage of priests does_not favor the normal life of a parish community . This -isaia- all presupposed within communities constituted by the Church , especially individual Churches and parishes . In other regions , on the other_hand , communautes de base come together in a spirit of bitter criticism of the Church , which_they_are quick to stigmatize as '' institutional '' and to which_they set themselves Up in opposition as charismatic communities , free_from structures and inspired only by the Gospel . Thus their obvious characteristic -isaia- an attitude of fault finding and of rejection with_regard to the Church s outward manifestations : her hierarchy , her signs . They are radically opposed to the Church . By following these lines their main inspiration very quickly becomes ideological , and it rarely happens_that they_do_not quickly fall victim to some political option or current of thought , and then to a system , even a party , with all the attendant risks of becoming its instrument . The difference -isaia-_already notable : the communities which by their spirit of opposition cut themselves off from the Church , and whose unity they wound , can well be called communautes de base , but in this case it -isaia- a strictly sociological name . They could_not , without a misuse of terms , be called ecclesial communautes de base , even if while being hostile to the hierarchy , they claim to remain within_the unity of the Church . This name belongs to the other groups , those_which come together within_the Church in order to unite themselves to the Church and to cause the Church to grow . These latter communities will be a place of evangelization , for the benefit of the bigger communities , especially_the individual Churches . And , as we said -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the last Synod , they_will be a hope_for the universal Church to the extent : that_they seek their nourishment in the Word of God and do not_allow themselves to be ensnared by political polarization or fashionable ideologies , which_are ready to exploit their immense human potential ; that_they avoid the ever present temptation of systematic protest and a hypercritical attitude , under the pretext of authenticity and a spirit of collaboration ; that_they remain firmly attached to the local Church in which_they_are inserted , and to the universal Church , thus avoiding the very real danger of becoming isolated within themselves , then of believing themselves to be the only authentic Church of Christ , and hence of condemning the other ecclesial_communities ; that_they maintain a sincere communion with the pastors whom_the Lord gives to His Church , and with the magisterium which_the Spirit of Christ has_entrusted to these pastors ; that_they never look on themselves as the sole beneficiaries or sole agents of evangelization or even the only depositaries of the Gospel but , being aware_that the Church -isaia- much_more vast and diversified , accept the fact_that this Church becomes incarnate in other ways than through themselves ; that_they constantly grow in missionary consciousness , fervor , commitment and zeal ; that_they show themselves to be universal in all things and never sectarian . On these conditions , which_are certainly demanding but_also uplifting , the ecclesial communautes de base will correspond to their most fundamental vocation : as hearers of the Gospel which_-isaia- proclaimed to them and privileged beneficiaries of evangelization , they_will soon become proclaimers of the Gospel themselves . If people proclaim in the world_the Gospel of salvation , they do so by the command of , in the name of and with the grace of Christ the Savior . '' They will_never have a preacher unless one_-isaia- sent , '' wrote he who_was without_doubt one of the greatest evangelizers . No one_can do it without having_been sent . But who then has the mission of evangelizing ? The Second Vatican Council gave a clear reply to this_question : it -isaia- upon the Church that '' there rests , by divine mandate , the duty of going out into the whole_world and preaching the gospel to every_creature . '' And in another text : '' . the whole Church -isaia- missionary , and the work of evangelization_-isaia- a basic duty of the People of God . '' We have_already mentioned this intimate connection_between the Church and evangelization . While the Church -isaia- proclaiming the kingdom of God and building it up , she_-isaia- establishing herself in the midst of the world as the sign and instrument of this kingdom which_-isaia- and which_-isaia- to come . The Council repeats the following expression of St . Augustine on the missionary_activity of the Twelve : '' They preached the word of truth and brought forth Churches . The observation that the Church has_been sent out and given a mandate to evangelize the world should awaken in us two convictions . The first -isaia- this : evangelization_-isaia- for no one an individual and isolated act ; it -isaia- one that_-isaia- deeply ecclesial . When the most obscure preacher , catechist or pastor in the most distant land preaches the Gospel , gathers his little community together or administers a sacrament , even alone , he -isaia- carrying_out an ecclesial act , and his action -isaia- certainly attached to the evangelizing activity of the whole Church by institutional relationships , but_also by profound invisible links in the order of grace . This presupposes that he acts not in virtue of a mission which he attributes to himself or by a personal inspiration , but in union with the mission of the Church and in her name . From this flows the second conviction : if each_individual evangelizes in the name of the Church , who herself does so by virtue of a mandate from the Lord , no evangelizer -isaia- the absolute master of his evangelizing action , with a discretionary power to carry it out in accordance_with individualistic criteria and perspectives ; he acts in communion with the Church and her pastors . We have remarked that the Church -isaia- entirely and completely evangelizing . This means_that , in the whole_world and in each part_of_the_world where she_-isaia- present , the Church feels responsible_for the task of spreading the Gospel . Brothers and sons_and_daughters , -atti_degli_apostoli- this stage of our reflection , we wish to pause with you -atti_degli_apostoli- a question which_-isaia- particularly important -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . In the celebration of the liturgy , in their witness before judges and executioners and in their apologetical texts , the first Christians readily expressed their deep faith in the Church by describing her as being spread throughout_the universe . They were fully conscious of belonging to a large community which neither space nor time can limit : From the just Abel right to the last of the elect , '' indeed to the ends of the earth , '' to the end of time . '' This -isaia- how the Lord wanted His Church to be : universal , a great tree whose branches shelter the birds of the air , a net which catches fish of every_kind or which Peter drew in filled_with one hundred and fifty three big fish , a flock which a single shepherd pastures . A universal Church without boundaries or frontiers except , alas , those of the heart and mind of sinful man . Nevertheless this universal Church -isaia- in practice incarnate in the individual Churches made up of such or such an actual part of mankind , speaking such and such a language , heirs of a cultural patrimony , of a vision of the world , of an historical past , of a particular human substratum . Receptivity to the wealth of the individual Church corresponds to a special sensitivity of modern man . Let us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church as the sum , or , if one_can say so , the more_or_less anomalous federation of essentially different individual Churches . In the mind of the Lord the Church -isaia- universal by vocation and mission , but_when she puts down her roots in a variety of cultural , social and human terrains , she takes on different external expressions and appearances in each part_of_the_world . Thus each_individual Church that_would voluntarily cut itself off from the universal Church would lose its relationship to God s plan and would be impoverished in its ecclesial dimension . But , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a Church toto orbe diffusa would become an abstraction if she did_not take body and life precisely through the individual Churches . Only continual attention to these_two poles of the Church will_enable us to perceive the richness of this relationship_between_the universal Church and the individual Churches . The individual Churches , intimately built up not_only of people but_also of aspirations , of riches and limitations , of ways of praying , of loving , of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- life and the world , which distinguish this or that_human gathering , have_the task of assimilating the essence of the Gospel message and of transposing it , without_the slightest betrayal of its essential truth , into the language that_these particular people understand , then of proclaiming it in this language . The transposition has to be done with the discernment , seriousness , respect and competence which_the matter calls for in the field of liturgical expression , and in the areas of catechesis , theological formulation , secondary ecclesial structures , and ministries . And the word '' language '' should be understood here less in the semantic or literary sense than in the sense which one may call anthropological and cultural . The question -isaia- undoubtedly a delicate one . Evangelization loses much of its force and effectiveness if it does_not take_into consideration the actual people to whom it -isaia- addresses , if it does_not use their language , their signs and symbols , if it does_not answer the questions they ask , and if it does_not have an impact on their concrete life . But on the other_hand , evangelization risks losing its power and disappearing altogether if one empties or adulterates its content under the pretext of translating it ; if , in other_words , one sacrifices this reality and destroys the unity without_which there_-isaia- no universality , out of a wish to adapt a universal reality to a local situation . Now , only a Church which preserves the awareness of her universality and shows_that she -isaia-_in_fact universal -isaia- capable of having a message which_can be heard by all , regardless of regional frontiers . Legitimate attention to individual Churches cannot_fail to enrich the Church . Such attention -isaia- indispensable and urgent . It responds to the very deep aspirations of peoples and human communities to find_their own identity ever more_clearly . But this enrichment requires that the individual Churches should keep their profound openness towards_the universal Church . It -isaia- quite remarkable , moreover , that the most simple Christians , the ones who are_most faithful to the Gospel and most open to the true meaning of the Church , have a completely spontaneous sensitivity to this universal dimension . They instinctively and very strongly feel the need_for it , they easily recognize themselves in such a dimension . They feel with it and suffer very deeply within themselves when , in the name of theories which they_do_not understand , they_are forced to accept a Church deprived of this universality , a regionalist Church , with no horizon . As history in fact shows , whenever an individual Church has cut itself off from the universal Church and from its living and visible center sometimes with the best of intentions , with theological , sociological , political or pastoral arguments , or even in the desire_for a certain freedom of movement or action it has escaped only with_great difficulty if indeed it has escaped from two equally serious dangers . The first danger -isaia- that of a withering isolationism , and then , before long , of a crumbling away , with each of its cells breaking away from it just as it itself has broken away from the central nucleus . The second danger -isaia- that of losing its freedom when , being cut off from the center and from the other Churches which gave it strength and energy , it finds itself all alone and a prey to the most varied forces of slavery and exploitation . The more an individual Church -isaia- attached to the universal Church by solid bonds of communion , in charity and loyalty , in receptiveness to the Magisterium of Peter , in the unity of the lex orandi which_-isaia- also the lex credendi , in the desire_for unity with all the other Churches which_make up the whole the more such a Church will be capable of translating the treasure of faith into the legitimate variety of expressions of the profession_of_faith , of prayer and worship , of Christian life and conduct and of the spiritual influence on the people among which it dwells . The more will it also be truly evangelizing , that_-isaia- to say , capable of drawing upon the universal patrimony in order to enable its_own people to profit from it , and capable too of communicating to the universal Church the experience and the life of this people , for the benefit of all . It was precisely in this sense_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the last Synod we spoke clear words full of paternal affection , insisting on the role of Peter s Successor as a visible , living and dynamic principle of the unity between_the Churches and thus of the universality of the one Church . We also insisted on the grave responsibility incumbent upon us , but_which we share_with our Brothers in the Episcopate , of preserving unaltered the content of the Catholic faith_which the Lord entrusted to the apostles . While being translated into all expressions , this content must be neither impaired nor mutilated . While being clothed with the outward forms proper to each people , and made explicit by theological expression which_takes account of differing cultural , social and even racial milieu , it must remain the content of the Catholic faith just exactly as the ecclesial magisterium has_received it and transmits it . The whole Church therefore -isaia- called_upon to evangelize , and yet within her we have different evangelizing tasks to accomplish . This diversity of services in the unity of the same mission makes up the richness and beauty of evangelization . We shall briefly recall these tasks . First , we would point_out in the pages of the Gospel the insistence with_which_the Lord entrusts to the apostles the task of proclaiming the Word . He chose them , trained them during several years of intimate company , constituted and sent them out as authorized witnesses and teachers of the message of salvation . And the Twelve in their turn sent out_their successors who , in the apostolic line , continue to preach the Good News . The Successor of Peter -isaia- thus , by the will of Christ , entrusted with the preeminent ministry of teaching the revealed_truth . The New Testament often shows Peter '' filled_with_the Holy Spirit '' speaking in the name of all . '' It -isaia- precisely for_this reason_that St . Leo the Great describes him as he who_has merited the primacy of the apostolate . '' This -isaia-_also why_the voice of the Church shows the Pope '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the highest point in apice , in specula of the apostolate . '' The Second Vatican Council wished to reaffirm this when it declared that '' Christ s mandate to preach the Gospel to every_creature cf . : primarily and immediately concerns the bishops with Peter and under Peter . '' The full , supreme and universal power '' which Christ gives to His Vicar for the pastoral government of His Church -isaia- this especially exercised by the Pope in the activity of preaching and causing to be preached the Good News of salvation . In union with the Successor of Peter , the bishops , who_are successors of the apostles , receive through the power of their episcopal ordination the authority to teach the revealed_truth in the Church . They are teachers of the faith . Associated with the bishops in the ministry of evangelization and responsible by a special title are_those_who through priestly ordination '' act in the person of Christ . '' They are educators of the People of God in the faith and preachers , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time being ministers of the Eucharist and of the other sacraments . We pastors are therefore invited to take note of this_duty , more_than any_other members of the Church . What identifies our priestly service , gives a profound unity to the thousand and one tasks which claim our attention day_by_day and throughout our_lives , and confers a distinct character on our activities , -isaia- this aim , ever present in all our action : to proclaim_the Gospel of God . A mark of our identity which no doubts ought to encroach upon and no objection eclipse -isaia- this : as pastors , we have_been chosen by the mercy of the Supreme Pastor , in spite of our inadequacy , to proclaim with authority the Word of God , to assemble the scattered People of God , to teed this People with the signs of the action of Christ which_are the sacraments , to set this People on the road to salvation , to maintain it in that_unity of which_we_are , -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels , active and living instruments , and unceasingly to keep this community gathered around Christ faithful to its deepest vocation . And when we do all these_things , within our human limits and by the grace of God , it -isaia- a work_of_evangelization that_we_are carrying_out . This includes ourself as Pastor of the universal Church , our brother bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the individual Churches , priests and deacons united with_their bishops and whose assistants they_are , by a communion_which has its source in the sacrament of Orders and in the charity of the Church . Religious , for their_part , find in their consecrated_life a privileged means of effective evangelization . At the deepest level of their being they_are caught Up in the dynamism of the Church s life , which_-isaia- thirsty for the divine Absolute and called to holiness . It -isaia- to this holiness that_they bear_witness . They embody the Church in her desire to give herself completely to the radical demands of the beatitudes . By their_lives they_are a sign of total availability to God , the Church and the brethren . As such they_have a special importance in the context of the witness which , as we have_said , -isaia- of prime importance in evangelization . At the same_time as being a challenge to the world and to the Church herself , this silent witness of poverty and abnegation , of purity and sincerity , of self sacrifice in obedience , can become an eloquent witness capable of touching also non Christians who_have good_will and are sensitive to certain values . In this perspective one perceives the role played in evangelization by religious men_and_women consecrated to prayer , silence , penance and sacrifice . Other religious , in great numbers , give themselves directly to the proclamation of Christ . Their missionary_activity depends clearly on the hierarchy and must be coordinated with the pastoral plan which_the latter adopts . But who_does_not see the immense contribution that_these religious have brought and continue to bring to evangelization ? Thanks to their consecration they_are eminently willing and free to leave everything and to go and proclaim_the Gospel even to the ends of the earth . They are enterprising and their apostolate -isaia-_often marked by an originality , by a genius that demands admiration . They are generous : often they are_found -atti_degli_apostoli- the outposts of the mission , and they take the greatest of risks for their health and their_very lives . Truly the Church owes them much . Lay people , whose particular vocation places them in the midst of the world and in charge of the most varied temporal tasks , must for this_very reason exercise a very_special form of evangelization . Their primary and immediate task -isaia- not to establish and develop the ecclesial_community this_-isaia- the specific role of the pastors but to put to use every Christian and evangelical possibility latent but already present and active in the affairs of the world . Their own field of evangelizing activity -isaia- the vast and complicated world of politics , society and economics , but_also the world of culture , of the sciences and the arts , of international life , of the mass_media . It also includes other realities which_are open to evangelization , such as human love , the family , the education of children and adolescents , professional work , suffering . The more Gospel inspired lay_people there_are engaged in these realities , clearly involved in them , competent to promote them and conscious that_they must exercise to the full their Christian powers which are_often buried and suffocated , the more these realities will be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the kingdom of God and therefore of salvation in Jesus Christ , without in any_way losing or sacrificing their human content but_rather pointing to a transcendent dimension which -isaia-_often disregarded . One cannot_fail to stress the evangelizing action of the family in the evangelizing apostolate of the laity . At different moments in the Church s history and also in the Second Vatican Council , the family has well deserved the beautiful name of '' domestic Church . '' This means_that there_should be found in every Christian family the various aspects of the entire Church . Furthermore , the family , like the Church , ought to be a place_where the Gospel -isaia- transmitted and from which_the Gospel radiates . In a family which_-isaia- conscious of this_mission , all the members evangelize and are evangelized . The parents not_only communicate the Gospel to their_children , but_from their_children they_can themselves receive the same Gospel as deeply lived by them . And such a family becomes_the evangelizer of many_other families , and of the neighborhood of which it forms part . Families resulting from a mixed marriage also have_the duty of proclaiming Christ to the children in the fullness of the consequences of a common Baptism ; they_have moreover the difficult task of becoming builders of unity . Circumstances invite us to make special mention of the young . Their increasing number and growing presence in society and likewise the problems assailing them should awaken in every_one the desire to offer them_with zeal and intelligence the Gospel ideal as something to be known and lived . And on the other_hand , young people_who_are well trained in faith and prayer must become more_and_more the apostles of youth . The Church counts greatly on their contribution , and we ourself have often manifested our full confidence in them . Hence the active presence of the laity in the temporal realities takes on all its importance . One cannot , however , neglect or forget the other dimension : the laity can_also feel themselves called , or be called , to work with_their pastors in the service of the ecclesial_community for its growth and life , by exercising a great variety of ministries according to the grace and charisms which_the Lord -isaia- pleased to give_them . We cannot_but experience a great inner joy when we see so many pastors , religious and lay_people , fired with their_mission to evangelize , seeking ever_more suitable ways of proclaiming the Gospel effectively . We encourage the openness which_the Church -isaia- showing today in this direction and with this solicitude . It -isaia- an openness to meditation first of all , and then to ecclesial ministries capable of renewing and strengthening the evangelizing vigor of the Church . It -isaia- certain_that , side by side with the ordained ministries , whereby certain people_are appointed pastors and consecrate themselves in a special_way to the service of the community , the Church recognizes the place of non ordained ministries which_are able to offer a particular service to the Church . A glance -atti_degli_apostoli- the origins of the Church -isaia-_very illuminating , and gives the benefit of an early experience in the matter of ministries . It was an experience which_was all the more valuable in that it enabled the Church to consolidate herself and to grow and spread . Attention to the sources however has to be complemented by attention to the present needs of mankind and of the Church . To drink -atti_degli_apostoli- these ever inspiring sources without sacrificing anything of their values , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to know_how to adapt oneself to the demands and needs of today these_are the criteria which_will make it possible to seek wisely and to discover the ministries which_the Church needs and which many of her members will gladly embrace for the sake of ensuring greater vitality in the ecclesial_community . These ministries will_have a real pastoral value to the extent that_they_are established with absolute respect_for unity and adhering to the directives of the pastors , who_are the ones who_are responsible_for the Church s unity and the builders thereof . These ministries , apparently new but closely tied up with the Church s living experience down_the_centuries such as catechists , directors of prayer and chant , Christians devoted to the service of God s Word or to assisting their brethren in need , the heads of small communities , or other persons charged with the responsibility of apostolic movements these ministries are valuable for the establishment , life , and growth of the Church , and for_her capacity to influence her surroundings and to reach those_who_are remote from her . We owe also our special esteem to all the lay_people who accept to consecrate a part of their time , their energies , and sometimes their entire lives , to the service of the missions . A serious preparation -isaia- needed_for all workers for evangelization . Such preparation -isaia- all the more necessary_for those_who devote_themselves to the ministry of the Word . Being animated by the conviction , ceaselessly deepened , of the greatness and riches of the Word of God , those_who_have the mission of transmitting it must give the maximum attention to the dignity , precision and adaptation of their language . Everyone knows that the art of speaking takes on today a very great_importance . How would preachers and catechists be able to neglect this ? We earnestly desire_that in each_individual Church the bishops should be vigilant concerning the adequate formation of all the ministers of the Word . This serious preparation will increase in them the indispensable assurance and also the enthusiasm to proclaim today Jesus Christ . We would_not wish to end this encounter_with our_beloved brethren and sons_and_daughters without a pressing appeal concerning the interior attitudes which_must animate those_who work_for evangelization . In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , and in the name of the Apostles Peter and Paul , we wish to exhort all those_who , thanks to the charisms of the Holy Spirit and to the mandate of the Church , are true evangelizers to be worthy of this vocation , to exercise it without_the reticence of doubt or fear , and not to neglect the conditions that_will make_this evangelization not_only possible but_also active and fruitful . These , among many_others , are the fundamental conditions which we consider it important to emphasize . Evangelization will_never be possible without_the action of the Holy Spirit . The Spirit descends on Jesus of Nazareth -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of His baptism when_the voice of the Father '' This -isaia- my beloved Son with whom I -amos- well pleased '' manifests in an external way the election of Jesus and His mission . Jesus -isaia- '' led by the Spirit '' to experience in the desert the decisive combat and the supreme test before beginning this_mission . It -isaia- '' in the power of the Spirit '' that He returns to Galilee and begins His preaching -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , applying to Himself the passage of Isaiah : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me . '' And He proclaims : '' Today this Scripture has_been fulfilled . '' To the disciples whom He was about to send forth He says , breathing on them , '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' In fact , it -isaia- only after_the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost that the apostles depart to all the ends of the earth in order to begin the great work of the Church s evangelization . Peter explains this event as the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel : '' I will pour out my spirit . '' Peter -isaia- filled_with_the Holy Spirit so that he can speak to the people about Jesus , the Son of God . Paul too -isaia- filled_with_the Holy Spirit before dedicating himself to his_apostolic ministry , as -isaia- Stephen when he -isaia- chosen for the ministry of service and later on for the witness of blood . The Spirit , who causes Peter , Paul and the Twelve to speak , and who inspires the words that_they_are to utter , also comes down '' on those_who heard the word . '' It -isaia- in the '' consolation of the Holy Spirit '' that the Church increases . The Holy Spirit -isaia- the soul of the Church . It -isaia- He who explains to the faithful the deep meaning of the teaching of Jesus and of His mystery . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit who , today just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Church , acts in every evangelizer who allows himself to be possessed and led by Him . The Holy Spirit places on his lips the words_which he could_not find by himself , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Holy Spirit predisposes the soul of the hearer to be open and receptive to the Good News and to the kingdom being proclaimed . Techniques of evangelization are good , but_even the most advanced ones could_not replace the gentle action of the Spirit . The most perfect preparation of the evangelizer has no effect without_the Holy Spirit . Without the Holy Spirit the most convincing dialectic has no power over the heart of man . Without Him the most highly developed schemas resting on a sociological or psychological basis are quickly seen to be quite valueless . We live in the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- a privileged moment of the Spirit . Everywhere people_are trying to know Him better , as the Scripture reveals Him . They are happy to place themselves under His inspiration . They are gathering about Him ; they want to let themselves be led by Him . Now if the Spirit of God has a preeminent place in the whole_life of the Church , it -isaia- in her evangelizing mission that He -isaia- most active . It -isaia- not by chance that the great inauguration of evangelization took_place on the morning of Pentecost , under the inspiration of the Spirit . It must be said_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- the principal agent of evangelization : it -isaia- He who impels each_individual to proclaim_the Gospel , and it -isaia- He who in the depths of consciences causes the word of salvation to be accepted and understood . But it can equally be said_that He -isaia- the goal of evangelization : He alone stirs up the new creation , the new humanity of which evangelization_-isaia- to be the result , with that_unity in variety which evangelization wishes to achieve within_the Christian community . Through the Holy Spirit the Gospel penetrates to the heart of the world , for it -isaia- He who causes people to discern the signs of the times signs willed by God which evangelization reveals and puts to use within history . The Bishops Synod of , which insisted strongly on the place of the Holy Spirit in evangelization , also expressed the desire_that pastors and theologians and we would also say the faithful marked by the seal of the Spirit by Baptism should study more thoroughly the nature and manner of the Holy Spirit s action in evangelization today . This -isaia-_our desire too , and we exhort all evangelizers , whoever they_may be , to pray without ceasing to the Holy Spirit with_faith and fervor and to let themselves prudently be guided by Him as the decisive inspirer of their plans , their initiatives and their evangelizing activity . Let us now consider_the very persons of the evangelizers . It -isaia-_often said nowadays that the present century thirsts for authenticity . Especially in regard to young_people it -isaia- said that_they_have a horror of the artificial or false and that_they_are searching above all for truth and honesty . These '' signs of the times '' should find us vigilant . Either tacitly or aloud but always forcefully we are_being asked : Do you really believe what_you are proclaiming ? Do you live what_you believe ? Do you really preach what_you live ? The witness of life has become more_than_ever an essential condition_for real effectiveness in preaching . Precisely because of this we are , to a certain extent , responsible_for the progress of the Gospel that we proclaim . '' What -isaia- the state of the Church ten years after_the Council ? '' we asked -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this meditation . Is she firmly established in the midst of the world and yet free and independent enough to call_for the world s attention ? Does she testify to solidarity with people and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to the divine Absolute ? Is she more ardent in contemplation and adoration and more zealous in missionary , charitable and liberating action ? Is she ever_more committed to the effort to search_for the restoration of the complete unity of Christians , a unity that makes more_effective the common witness , '' so that_the_world may believe '' We are all responsible_for the answers that could be given to these questions . We therefore address our exhortation to our brethren in the Episcopate , placed by the Holy Spirit to govern_the Church . We exhort the priests and deacons , the bishops collaborators in assembling the People of God and in animating spiritually the local communities . We exhort the religious , witnesses of a Church called to holiness and hence themselves invited to a life_that bears testimony to the beatitudes of the Gospel . We exhort the laity : Christian families , youth , adults , all those_who exercise a trade or profession , leaders , without forgetting the poor who are_often rich in faith and hope all lay people_who_are conscious of their evangelizing role in the service of their Church or in the midst of society and the world . We say to all of them : our evangelizing zeal must spring from true holiness of life , and , as the Second Vatican Council suggests , preaching must in its turn make_the preacher grow in holiness , which_-isaia- nourished by prayer and above all by love for the Eucharist . The world_which , paradoxically , despite innumerable signs of the denial of God , -isaia- nevertheless searching for Him in unexpected ways and painfully experiencing the need of Him the world_-isaia- calling for evangelizers to speak to it of a God whom_the evangelists themselves should know and be familiar with as if they could see the invisible . The world calls for and expects from us simplicity of life , the spirit of prayer , charity towards all , especially towards_the lowly and the poor , obedience and humility , detachment and self sacrifice . Without this mark of holiness , our word will_have difficulty in touching the heart of modern man . It risks being vain and sterile . The power of evangelization will_find itself considerably diminished if those_who proclaim_the Gospel are divided among_themselves in all sorts of ways . Is this not perhaps one of the great sicknesses of evangelization today ? Indeed , if the Gospel that we proclaim -isaia- seen to be rent by doctrinal disputes , ideological polarizations or mutual condemnations among Christians , -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of the latter s differing views on Christ and the Church and even because_of_their different concepts of society and human institutions , how_can those_to_whom we address our preaching fail to be disturbed , disoriented , even scandalized ? The Lord s spiritual testament tells us that_unity among His followers -isaia-_not_only the proof that_we_are His but_also the proof that He -isaia- sent by the Father . It -isaia- the test of the credibility of Christians and of Christ Himself . As evangelizers , we must offer Christ s faithful not the image of people divided and separated by unedifying quarrels , but the image of people_who_are mature in faith and capable of finding a meeting point beyond_the real tensions , thanks to a shared , sincere and disinterested search_for truth . Yes , the destiny of evangelization_-isaia- certainly bound up with the witness of unity given by the Church . This -isaia- a source of responsibility and also of comfort . At this_point we wish to emphasize the sign of unity among all Christians as the way and instrument of evangelization . The division among Christians -isaia- a serious reality which impedes the very work of Christ . The Second Vatican Council states clearly and emphatically that_this division '' damages the most_holy cause of preaching the Gospel to all men , and it impedes many from embracing the faith . '' For this_reason , in proclaiming the Holy Year we considered it necessary to recall to all the faithful of the Catholic world_that '' before all men can be brought together and restored to the grace of God our Father , communion must be reestablished between those_who by faith have acknowledged and accepted Jesus Christ as the Lord of mercy who sets men free and unites them in the Spirit of love and truth . '' And it -isaia- with a strong feeling of Christian hope_that look to the efforts being made in the Christian world for_this restoration of the full unity willed by Christ . Paul assures us that '' hope does_not disappoint us . '' While we still work to obtain full unity from the Lord , we wish to see prayer intensified . Moreover we make our_own the desire of the Fathers of the Third General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , for a collaboration marked by greater commitment with the Christian brethren with whom we are_not yet united in perfect unity , taking as a basis the foundation of Baptism and the patrimony of faith which_-isaia- common to us . By doing this we can already give a greater common witness to Christ before the world in the very work_of_evangelization . Christ s command urges us to do this ; the duty of preaching and of giving witness to the Gospel requires this . The Gospel entrusted to us -isaia-_also the word of truth . A truth_which liberates and which alone gives peace of heart_-isaia- what people_are looking for when we proclaim_the Good News to them . The truth_about God , about man and his mysterious destiny , about the world ; the difficult truth_that we seek in the Word of God and of which , we repeat , we are neither the masters nor the owners , but the depositaries , the heralds and the servants . Every evangelizer -isaia- expected to have a reverence for truth , especially since_the truth_that he studies and communicates -isaia- none other_than revealed_truth and hence , more_than any_other , a sharing in the first truth which_-isaia- God Himself . The preacher of the Gospel will therefore be a person_who even -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of personal renunciation and suffering always seeks the truth_that he must transmit to others . He never betrays or hides truth out of a desire to please men , in order to astonish or to shock , nor for the sake of originality or a desire to make an impression . He does_not refuse truth . He does_not obscure revealed_truth by being too idle to search_for it , or for the sake of his_own comfort , or out of fear . He does_not neglect to study it . He serves it generously , without making it serve him . We are the pastors of the faithful people , and our pastoral service impels us to preserve , defend , and to communicate the truth regardless of the sacrifices that_this involves . So many eminent and holy pastors have left us the example of this_love of truth . In many cases it was an heroic love . The God of truth expects us to be the vigilant defenders and devoted preachers of truth . Men of learning whether you be theologians , exegetes or historians the work_of_evangelization needs your tireless work of research , and also care and tact in transmitting the truth to which your studies lead you but which_-isaia- always greater_than the heart of man , being the very truth of God . Parents and teachers , your task and the many conflicts of the present_day do not make it an easy one_-isaia- to help your children and your students to discover truth , including religious and spiritual truth . The work_of_evangelization presupposes in the evangelizer an ever_increasing love for those_whom he -isaia- evangelizing . That model evangelizer , the Apostle Paul , wrote these_words to the Thessalonians , and they_are a program for us all : '' With such yearning love we chose to impart to you not_only the gospel of God but our very selves , so dear had you become to us . '' What -isaia- this_love ? It -isaia- much more_than that of a teacher ; it -isaia- the love of a father ; and again , it -isaia- the love of a mother . It -isaia- this love_that the Lord expects from every preacher of the Gospel , from every builder of the Church . A sign of love will be the concern to give the truth and to bring people into unity . Another sign of love will be a devotion to the proclamation of Jesus Christ , without reservation or turning back . Let us add some other signs of this_love . The first -isaia- respect_for the religious and spiritual situation of those being evangelized . Respect for their tempo and pace ; no one_has the right to force them excessively . Respect for their conscience and convictions , which_are not to be treated in a harsh manner . Another sign of this love_-isaia- concern not to wound the other person , especially if he or she_-isaia- weak in faith , with statements that may be clear for those_who_are already initiated but_which for the faithful can be a source of bewilderment and scandal , like a wound in the soul . Yet another sign of love will be the effort to transmit to Christians not doubts and uncertainties born of an erudition poorly assimilated but certainties that_are solid because_they_are anchored in the Word of God . The faithful need these certainties for their Christian life ; they_have a right to them , as children of God who abandon themselves entirely into His arms and to the exigencies of love . Our appeal here -isaia- inspired by the fervor of the greatest preachers and evangelizers , whose lives were devoted to the apostolate . Among these we are glad to point_out those_whom we have proposed to the veneration of the faithful during the course of the Holy Year . They have known how to overcome many obstacles to evangelization . Such obstacles are_also present today , and we shall limit ourself to mentioning the lack of fervor . It -isaia- all the more_serious because it comes_from within . It -isaia- manifested in fatigue , disenchantment , compromise , lack of interest and above all lack of joy and hope . We exhort all those_who_have the task of evangelizing , by whatever title and -atti_degli_apostoli- whatever level , always to nourish spiritual fervor This fervor demands first of all that_we_should know_how to put aside the excuses which_would impede evangelization . The most insidious of these excuses are certainly the ones which people claim to find support for in such and such a teaching of the Council . Thus one too frequently hears it said , in various terms , that to impose a truth , be it that of the Gospel , or to impose a way , be it that of salvation , cannot_but be a violation of religious liberty . Besides , it -isaia- added , why proclaim_the Gospel when_the whole world_-isaia- saved by uprightness of heart ? We know likewise that_the_world and history are filled_with '' seeds of the Word '' ; -isaia- it not therefore an illusion to claim to bring_the Gospel where it already exists in the seeds that the Lord Himself has sown ? Anyone who takes the trouble to study in the Council s documents the questions upon which these excuses draw too superficially will_find quite a different view . It would certainly be an error to impose something on the consciences of our brethren . But to propose to their consciences the truth of the Gospel and salvation in Jesus Christ , with complete clarity and with a total respect_for the free options which it presents '' without coercion , or dishonorable or unworthy pressure '' far_from_being an attack on religious liberty -isaia- fully to respect that liberty , which_-isaia- offered the choice of a way that_even non believers consider noble and uplifting . Is it then a crime against others freedom to proclaim with_joy a Good News which one_has come to know through the Lord s mercy ? And why should only falsehood and error , debasement and pornography have_the right to be put before people and often unfortunately imposed on them by the destructive propaganda of the mass_media , by the tolerance of legislation , the timidity of the good and the impudence of the wicked ? The respectful presentation of Christ and His kingdom -isaia- more_than the evangelizer s right ; it -isaia-_his duty . It -isaia- likewise the right of his fellow men to receive from him the proclamation of the Good News of salvation . God can accomplish this salvation in whomsoever He wishes by ways which He alone knows . And yet , if His Son came , it was precisely in order to reveal to us , by His word and by His life , the ordinary paths of salvation . And He has commanded us to transmit this revelation to others with His own authority . It would be useful if every Christian and every evangelizer were to pray about the following thought : men can gain salvation also in other ways , by God s mercy , even_though we do not preach the Gospel to them ; but as for us , can we gain salvation if through negligence or fear or shame what St . Paul called '' blushing for the Gospel '' or as a result of false ideas we fail to preach it ? For that_would be to betray the call of God , who wishes the seed to bear_fruit through the voice of the ministers of the Gospel ; and it will depend on us whether this grows into trees and produces its_full fruit . Let us therefore preserve our fervor of spirit . Let us preserve the delightful and comforting joy of evangelizing , even when_it_-isaia- in tears that we must sow . May it mean for us as it did for John the Baptist , for Peter and Paul , for the other apostles and for a multitude of splendid evangelizers all through the Church s history an interior enthusiasm that nobody and nothing can quench . May it be the great joy of our consecrated lives . And may the world of our_time , which_-isaia- searching , sometimes with anguish , sometimes with hope , be enabled to receive the Good News not from evangelizers who_are dejected , discouraged , impatient or anxious , but_from ministers of the Gospel whose lives glow with fervor , who_have first received_the joy of Christ , and who_are willing to risk their_lives so that the kingdom may be proclaimed and the Church established in the midst of the world . This then , brothers and sons_and_daughters , -isaia-_our heartfelt plea . It echoes the voice of our brethren assembled for the Third General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . This -isaia- the task we have wished to give_you -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of a Holy Year which_has enabled us to see better_than ever the needs and the appeals of a multitude of brethren , both Christians and non Christians , who await from the Church the Word of salvation . May the light of the Holy Year , which_has shone in the local Churches and in Rome for millions of consciences reconciled with God , continue to shine in the same_way after_the Jubilee through a program of pastoral action with evangelization as its basic feature , for these years which mark the eve of a new century , the eve also of the third_millennium of Christianity . This -isaia- the desire_that we rejoice to entrust to the hands and the heart of the Immaculate Blessed Virgin Mary , on this_day which -isaia-_especially consecrated to her and which_-isaia- also the tenth anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council . On the morning of Pentecost she watched over with_her prayer the beginning of evangelization prompted by the Holy Spirit : may she be the Star of the evangelization ever renewed which_the Church , docile to her Lord s command , must promote and accomplish , especially in these times which_are difficult but full of hope ! In the name of Christ we bless you , your communities , your families , all those_who_are dear to you , in the words_which Paul addressed to the Philippians : '' I give thanks to my God every time I think of you which_-isaia- constantly , in every prayer I utter rejoicing , as I plead on your behalf , -atti_degli_apostoli- the way you_have all continually helped to promote the gospel . I hold all of you dear you_who . are sharers of my gracious lot . to defend the solid grounds on which_the gospel rests . God himself can testify how_much I long for each of you with the affection of Christ Jesus !

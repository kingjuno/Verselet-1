Rejoice in the Lord always ; the Lord -isaia- near to all who call_upon Him in truth ! Dear brothers and sons_and_daughters in Christ , many times already in the course of this Holy Year we have exhorted the People of God to correspond with joyful enthusiasm to the grace of the Jubilee . As you_know , our invitation -isaia- essentially an appeal to interior renewal and reconciliation in Christ . It -isaia-_a_question of people s salvation , of their complete happiness . In this_time , when throughout_the_world believers are preparing to celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit , we invite you to implore from Him the gift of joy . On our_own part indeed , the ministry of reconciliation -isaia- being exercised in the midst of many contradictions and difficulties , but_it_-isaia- sustained and accompanied in us by the joy of the Holy Spirit . Likewise we are truly able to adopt as our_own and address to the universal Church the confidence of the Apostle Paul in his community -atti_degli_apostoli- Corinth : '' . you_are in our_hearts , to die together and to live together . I have great confidence in you . I -amos- filled_with comfort . With all our affliction , I -amos- overjoyed . '' Yes , it -isaia- for us , too , an exigence of love to invite you to share this abounding joy which -isaia-_a_gift of the Holy Spirit . We have therefore felt it as a happy interior need to address to you in the course of this_year of grace , and very fittingly on the occasion of Pentecost , an Apostolic Exhortation whose theme -isaia- precisely : Christian joy joy in the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- a sort of hymn to the divine joy that we would_like to utter , so that_it_may awaken an echo in the whole_world , and first of all in the Church : may joy be poured out in hearts together_with_the love of which_it_-isaia- the fruit , by the Holy Spirit that has_been_given to us . Thus we wish that_your voice may be joined with ours , for the spiritual consolation of the Church of God and of all those_who_are willing to lend their_hearts and minds to this celebration . The need_for joy in all people s hearts Christian joy could_not be properly praised if one were to remain indifferent to the outward and inward witness that God the Creator renders to Himself in the midst of His creation : '' And God saw that_it_was good . '' Raising up man in the setting of a universe that_-isaia- the work of His power , wisdom and love , and even before manifesting Himself personally according to the mode of revelation , God disposes the mind_and_heart of His creature to meet joy , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as truth . One should therefore be attentive to the appeal that rises from man s heart , from the age of wondering childhood to serene old age , as a presentiment of the divine mystery . When he awakens to the world , does_not man feel , in addition to the natural desire to understand and take possession of it , the desire to find within it his fulfillment and happiness ? As everyone knows , there_are several degrees of this '' happiness . '' Its most noble expression -isaia- joy , or '' happiness '' in the strict sense , when man , on the level of his higher faculties , finds his peace and satisfaction in the possession of a known and loved good . Thus , man experiences joy when he finds himself in harmony_with nature , and especially in the encounter , sharing and communion with_other people . All the more does he know spiritual joy or happiness when his_spirit enters into possession of God , known and loved as the supreme and immutable good . Poets , artists , thinkers , but_also ordinary men_and_women , simply disposed to a certain inner light , have been_able and still are_able , in the times before Christ and in our own_time and among us , to experience something of the joy of God . But how_can we ignore the additional fact_that joy -isaia- always imperfect , fragile and threatened ? By a strange paradox , the consciousness of that_which , beyond all passing pleasure , would constitute true happiness , also includes the certainty that_there_-isaia- no perfect happiness . The experience of finiteness , felt by each generation in its turn , obliges one to acknowledge and to plumb the immense gap that always exists between reality and the desire_for the infinite . This paradox , and this difficulty in attaining joy , seem to us particularly acute today . This -isaia- the reason_for our message . Technological society has succeeded in multiplying the opportunities_for pleasure , but it has great difficulty in generating joy . For joy comes_from another source . Money , comfort , hygiene and material security are_often not lacking ; and yet boredom , depression and sadness unhappily remain the lot of many . These feelings sometimes go as far as anguish and despair , which apparent carefreeness , the frenzies of present good fortune and artificial paradises cannot assuage . Do people perhaps feel helpless to dominate industrial progress , to plan society in a human way ? Does the future perhaps seem too uncertain , human_life too threatened ? Or -isaia- it not perhaps a matter of loneliness , of an unsatisfied thirst_for love and for someone s presence , of an ill defined emptiness ? On the contrary , in many regions and sometimes in our midst , the sum of physical and moral sufferings weighs heavily : so many starving people , so many victims of fruitless combats , so many_people torn from their homes ! These miseries are perhaps not deeper than those of the past but_they have_taken on a worldwide dimension . They are better known , reported by the mass_media -atti_degli_apostoli- least as much as the events of good fortune and they overwhelm people s minds . Often there seems to be no adequate human solution to them . This situation nevertheless cannot hinder us from speaking about joy and hoping for joy . It -isaia- indeed in the midst of their distress that_our fellow men need to know joy , to hear its song . We sympathize profoundly with_those over whom poverty and sufferings of every sort cast a veil of sadness . We are thinking in particular of those_who_are without means , without help , without friendship those_who see their human hopes annihilated . More than_ever they_are present in our prayers and our affection . We do not wish to overwhelm anyone . On the contrary , we are looking for the remedies capable of bringing light . In our view , these remedies fall_into three categories . People must obviously unite their_efforts to secure -atti_degli_apostoli- least a minimum of relief , well_being , security and justice , necessary_for happiness , for the many peoples deprived of them . Such solidarity -isaia-_already the work of God , it corresponds to Christ s commandment . Already it secures peace , restores hope , strength , communion , and gives access to joy , for the one who_gives as for the one_who receives , for it -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive . Dear brothers and sons_and_daughters , how_many times do we urge you to prepare a world , one more suitable for living in , to bring_about without delay justice and charity for the integral development of all ! The conciliar Constitution Gaudium et Spes and numerous pontifical documents have indeed insisted on this_point . Even though this_-isaia-_not the theme that_we_are directly touching upon here , effort should be made not to forget this fundamental duty of love of neighbor , without_which it would be unbecoming to speak of joy . There -isaia-_also needed a patient effort to teach people , or teach them once_more , how to savor in a simple way the many human joys that the Creator places in our path : the elating joy of existence and of life ; the joy of chaste and sanctified love ; the peaceful joy of nature and silence ; the sometimes austere joy of work well done ; the joy and satisfaction of duty performed ; the transparent joy of purity , service and sharing ; the demanding joy of sacrifice . The Christian will_be_able to purify , complete and sublimate these joys ; he will_not be able to disdain them . Christian joy presupposes a person capable of natural joy . These natural joys were often used by Christ as a starting point when He proclaimed the kingdom of God . But the theme of our exhortation -isaia- situated on still another level . For the problem seems to be , above all , of the spiritual order . It -isaia-_man in his_soul who finds himself without_the means to take on himself_the sufferings and miseries of our_time . These sufferings and miseries crush him all the more to the extent_that the meaning of life escapes him , that he -isaia-_no_longer sure of himself or of his transcendent calling and destiny . He has desacralized the universe and now he -isaia- desacralizing humanity ; he has -atti_degli_apostoli- times cut the vital link that joined him to God . Hope , and the value of individuals , are no longer sufficiently ensured . God seems to him abstract and useless . Without his being able to express it , God s silence weighs heavily on him . Yes , cold and darkness are first in the heart of the man_who knows sadness . One can speak here of the sadness of non believers , when_the human spirit , created in the image_and_likeness of God , and therefore instinctively oriented towards Him as its sole and supreme good , remains without knowing Him clearly , without loving Him , and therefore without experiencing the happiness , even_though imperfect , that_-isaia- brought by the knowledge of God and by the certainty of having a link with Him that_even death cannot break . Who does_not recall_the words of Saint Augustine : '' You have_made us for Yourself , Lord , and our_hearts are restless until they rest in You '' ? It -isaia- therefore by becoming more present to God , by turning away from sin , that_man can truly enter_into spiritual joy . Without doubt '' flesh and blood '' are incapable of this . But Revelation can open up this possibility and grace can bring_about this return . Our intention -isaia- precisely to invite you to the sources of Christian joy . And how could we do this , without ourselves becoming attentive to God s plan , listening to the Good News of His love ? II . Announcement of Christian joy in the Old Testament In essence , Christian joy -isaia- the spiritual sharing in the unfathomable joy , both divine and human , which_-isaia- in the heart of Jesus Christ glorified . As soon as God the Father begins to manifest in history the mystery of His will , according to His purpose which He set_forth in Christ as a plan_for the fullness_of_time , this joy -isaia- mysteriously announced in the midst of the People of God , before its identity has_been unveiled . Thus Abraham , our_father , who_was set apart for the future accomplishment of the Promise , and who hoped against all hope , receives when his_son Isaac -isaia- born the prophetic first fruits of this joy . This joy becomes transfigured through a trial touching death , when this only_son -isaia- restored to him alive , a prefiguring of the resurrection of the one_who was to come : the only Son of God promised for the remaining sacrifice . Abraham rejoiced -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of seeing the Day of Christ , the Day of Salvation : he '' saw it and was glad . '' The joy of salvation then increases and -isaia- transmitted throughout_the prophetic history of ancient Israel . It persists and -isaia- unfailingly reborn in the course of tragic trials due to the culpable infidelities of the chosen people and to the external persecutions which try to detach them_from their God . This joy , ever threatened and springing up again , -isaia- proper to the people born of Abraham . It -isaia- always a question of an uplifting experience of liberation and restoration -atti_degli_apostoli- least foretold , having its origin in the merciful love of God for His beloved people , on whose behalf He accomplishes , by pure grace and miraculous power , the promises of the Covenant . Such -isaia- the joy of the Mosaic Passover , which happened as the prefiguring of the eschatological liberation which_would be wrought by Jesus Christ in the paschal context of the new and eternal Covenant . It -isaia-_a_question also of the real joy repeatedly hymned by the Psalms the joy of living with God and for God . It -isaia-_a_question finally and above all of the glorious and supernatural joy , prophesied for the new Jerusalem redeemed from the exile and loved with a mystical love by God Himself . The ultimate meaning of this unheard of outpouring of redemptive love will only appear -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the new Pasch and new Exodus . At that_time the People of God will be led , in the death_and_resurrection of the Suffering Servant , from this_world to the Father , from the figurative Jerusalem of here below to the Jerusalem above : '' Whereas you have_been forsaken and hated , with no one passing through , I will_make you majestic for ever , a joy from age to age . For as a young_man marries a virgin , so shall your sons marry you , and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride , so shall your God rejoice over you . Joy according to the New Testament Through the course of many centuries and in the midst of most terrible trials , these promises wonderfully sustained the mystical hope of ancient Israel . And it -isaia- ancient Israel that transmitted them to the Church of Jesus Christ , in such_a_way_that we are indebted to ancient Israel for some of the purest expressions of our hymn of joy . And yet , according to faith and the Christian experience of the Holy Spirit , this peace which_-isaia- given by God and which spreads out like an overflowing torrent when_the time of '' consolation '' comes , -isaia- linked to the coming and presence of Christ . No one_-isaia- excluded from the joy brought by the Lord . The great joy announced by the angel on Christmas night -isaia- truly for all the people , both_for the people of Israel then anxiously awaiting a Savior , and for the numberless people made up of all those_who , in time to come , would receive its message and strive to live by it . The Blessed Virgin Mary was_the first to have_received its announcement , from the angel Gabriel , and her Magnificat was already the exultant hymn of all the humble . Whenever we say the rosary , the joyful mysteries thus place us once_more before the inexpressible event which_-isaia- the center and summit of history : the coming on earth of Emmanuel , God with us . John the Baptist , whose mission_-isaia- to point Him out to the expectation of Israel , had himself leapt for joy , in His presence , in the womb of his_mother . When Jesus begins His ministry , John '' rejoices greatly -atti_degli_apostoli- the bridegroom s voice . '' Let us now pause to contemplate the person of Jesus during His earthly life . In His humanity He had experienced our joys . He has manifestly known , appreciated , and celebrated a whole range of human joys , those simple daily joys within_the reach of everyone . The depth of His interior life did_not blunt His concrete attitude or His sensitivity . He admires the birds of heaven , the lilies of the field . He immediately grasps God s attitude towards creation -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of history . He willingly extols the joy of the sower and the harvester , the joy of the man_who finds a hidden treasure , the joy of the shepherd who recovers his sheep or of the woman who finds her lost coin , the joy of those invited to the feast , the joy of a marriage celebration , the joy of the father_who embraces his_son returning from a prodigal life , and the joy of the woman who_has just brought her child into_the_world . For Jesus , these joys are real because for Him they_are the signs of the spiritual joys of the kingdom of God : the joy of people_who enter this kingdom return there or work there , the joy of the Father who welcomes them . And for His part Jesus Himself manifests His satisfaction and His tenderness when He meets children wishing to approach Him , a rich young_man who_-isaia- faithful and wants to do more , friends who open their home to Him , like Martha , Mary and Lazarus . His happiness -isaia- above all to see the Word accepted , the possessed delivered , a sinful woman or a publican like Zacchaeus converted , a widow taking from her poverty and giving . He even exults with_joy when He states that the little ones have_the revelation of the kingdom which remains hidden from the wise and able . Yes , because Christ was '' a man like us in all things but sin , '' He accepted and experienced affective and spiritual joys , as a gift of God . And He did_not rest until '' to the poor he proclaimed the good_news of salvation . and to those in sorrow , joy . '' The Gospel of Saint Luke particularly gives witness to this seed of joy . The miracles of Jesus and His words of pardon are so many signs of divine goodness : all the people rejoiced -atti_degli_apostoli- all the glorious things_that were done by Him , and gave glory to God . For the Christian as for Jesus , it -isaia-_a_question of living , in thanksgiving to the Father , the human joys , that the Creator gives him . But it -isaia- necessary here below to understand properly the secret of the unfathomable joy which dwells in Jesus and which_-isaia- special to Him . It -isaia-_especially the Gospel of Saint John that lifts the veil , by giving us the intimate words of the Son of God made man . If Jesus radiates such peace , such assurance , such happiness , such availability , it -isaia- by reason of the inexpressible love by which He knows that He -isaia- loved by His Father . When He -isaia- baptized on the banks of the Jordan , this_love , which_-isaia- present from the first moment of His Incarnation , -isaia- manifested : '' You are my Son , the Beloved ; my favor rests on you . '' This certitude -isaia- inseparable from the consciousness of Jesus . It -isaia- a presence which never leaves Him all alone . It -isaia- an intimate knowledge which fills Him : '' . the Father knows me and I know_the Father . '' It -isaia- an unceasing and total exchange : '' All I have -isaia- yours and all you_have -isaia- mine . '' The Father has_given the Son the power to judge , the power to dispose of life . It -isaia- a mutual indwelling : '' . I -amos- in the Father and the Father in me . '' In return , the Son gives the Father immeasurable love : '' . I love the Father . I -amos- doing exactly what_the Father told me . '' He always does what_-isaia- pleasing to His Father : it -isaia- His food and drink . His availability goes even to the gift of His human_life ; His confidence goes even to the certitude of taking it up again : '' The Father loves me because I lay_down my life in order to take it up again . '' In this_sense He rejoices to go to the Father . For Jesus it -isaia- not a question of a passing awareness . It -isaia- the reverberation in His human consciousness of the love_that He has_always known as God in the bosom of the Father : '' . you loved me before the foundation of the world . '' Here there_-isaia- an uncommunicable relationship of love which_-isaia- identified with His existence as the Son and which_-isaia- the secret of the life of the Trinity : the Father -isaia- seen here as the one , who_gives Himself to the Son , without reserve and without ceasing , in a burst of joyful generosity , and the Son -isaia- seen as He who_gives Himself in the same_way to the Father , in a burst of joyful gratitude , in the Holy Spirit . And the disciples and all those who_believe in Christ are_called to share this joy . Jesus wishes them to have in themselves His joy in its fullness . '' I have_made your name known to them and will_continue to make it known , so that the love with_which you loved me may be in them , and so that I may be in them . '' This joy of living in God s love begins here below . It -isaia- the joy of the kingdom of God . But it -isaia- granted on a steep road which requires a total confidence in the Father and in the Son , and a preference given to the kingdom . The message of Jesus promises above all joy this demanding joy ; and does it not begin with the beatitudes ? '' How happy are you who_are poor : yours -isaia- the kingdom of God . Happy you who_are hungry now : you shall be satisfied . Happy you_who weep now : you shall laugh . '' In a mysterious way , Christ Himself accepts death -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of the wicked and death on the cross , in order to eradicate from man s heart_the sins of self sufficiency and to manifest to the Father a complete filial obedience . But the Father has not allowed death to keep Him in its power . The resurrection of Jesus -isaia- the seal placed by the Father on the value of His Son s sacrifice : it -isaia- the proof of the Father s fidelity , according to the desire expressed by Jesus before He enters into His passion : '' Father . glorify your Son so that_your Son may glorify you . '' Henceforth , Jesus -isaia- living forever in the glory of the Father , and this_-isaia-_why the disciples were confirmed in an ineradicable joy when_they saw the Lord on Easter evening . It remains that , here below , the joy of the kingdom brought to realization can_only spring from the simultaneous celebration of the death_and_resurrection of the Lord . This -isaia- the paradox of the Christian condition which sheds particular light on that of the human condition : neither trials nor sufferings have_been eliminated from this_world , but_they take on a new meaning in the certainty of sharing in the redemption wrought by the Lord and of sharing in His glory . This -isaia- why_the Christian , though subject to the difficulties of human_life , -isaia- not reduced to groping for the way ; nor_does he see in death the end of his hopes . As in fact the prophet foretold : '' The people that walked in darkness has seen a great light ; on those_who live in a land of deep shadow a light has shone . You have_made their gladness greater , you have_made their joy increase . '' The Easter Exultet sings of a mystery accomplished beyond_the hopes of the prophets : in the joyful announcement of the resurrection , even man s suffering finds itself transformed , while the fullness of joy springs from the victory of the Crucified , from His pierced heart and His glorified body . This victory enlightens the darker souls . Et nox illuminatio mea in deliciis meis . Paschal joy -isaia- not_just that of a possible transfiguration : it -isaia- the joy of the new presence of the Risen Christ dispensing to His own the Holy Spirit , so that He may dwell with_them . The Holy Spirit -isaia- given to the Church as the inexhaustible principle of her joy as the bride of the glorified Christ . He recalls to her mind , through the ministry of grace and truth exercised by the successors of the apostles , the very teaching of the Lord . The Holy Spirit stirs up in the Church divine_life and the apostolate . And the Christian knows that_this Spirit will_never be quenched in the course of history . The source of hope manifested -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost will_never be exhausted . Thus the Spirit , who proceeds from the Father and the Son and -isaia- their living mutual love , -isaia- henceforth communicated to the People of the New Covenant , and to each soul ready for His secret action . He makes us His dwelling place : dulcis hospes animae . Together with Him , man s heart_-isaia- inhabited by the Father and the Son . The Holy Spirit raises up therein a filial prayer that springs forth_from the depths of the soul and -isaia- expressed in praise , thanksgiving , reparation and supplication . Then we can experience joy which_-isaia- properly spiritual , the joy which_-isaia- a fruit of the Holy Spirit . It consists in the human spirit s finding repose and a deep satisfaction in the possession of the Triune God , known by faith and loved with the charity that comes_from Him . Such a joy henceforth characterizes all the Christian virtues . The humble human joys in our_lives , which_are like seeds of a higher reality are transfigured . Here below this joy will_always include to a certain extent the painful trial of a woman in travail and a certain apparent abandonment , like that of the orphan : tears and lamentation , while the world parades its gloating satisfaction . But the disciples sadness , which_-isaia- according to God and not according to the world , will be promptly changed into a spiritual joy that_no_one will_be_able to take away from them . Such -isaia- the situation of Christian existence , and very particularly of the apostolic_life . This life , being animated by a zealous love of the Lord and His brethren , -isaia- necessarily exercised under the standard of the paschal sacrifice , going through love to death , and through death to life and love . Hence the condition of the Christian , and above all of the apostle , who must become the '' model of the flock '' and associate himself freely with the Redeemer s passion . The apostolic_life thus corresponds to what_was described in the Gospel as the law of Christian blessedness , in continuity with the destiny of the prophets : '' Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you on my account . Rejoice and be glad , for your reward will be great in heaven ; this_-isaia- how they persecuted the prophets before you . '' Unfortunately , in our century which_-isaia- so threatened by the illusion of false happiness , we do not lack opportunities of noting the psychic inability of man to accept '' the gifts of the Spirit of God , for they_are folly to him , and he -isaia- not able to understand them because_they_are spiritually discerned . '' The world_that world which_-isaia- unfitted to receive the Spirit of Truth , whom it neither sees nor knows only sees one side of things . It considers only the affliction and poverty of the disciple , while the latter always remains , in his inmost being , in joy , because he -isaia- in communion with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ . Joy in the hearts of the saints Dear brothers and sons_and_daughters , such_-isaia- the joyful hope drawn_from the very sources of God s Word . For twenty centuries , this source of joy has not ceased to spring up in the Church , and especially in the hearts of the saints . We must now recall some echoes of this spiritual experience ; according to the diversity of charisms and particular vocations , it illustrates the mystery of Christian joy . In the first rank -isaia- the Virgin Mary , full of grace , the Mother of the Savior . She , accepting the announcement from on high , the Servant of the Lord , Spouse of the Spirit and Mother of the Eternal Son , manifests her joy before her cousin Elizabeth who celebrates her faith : '' My soul magnifies the Lord , and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior . henceforth all generations will call me blessed . '' She has grasped , better_than all other creatures , that God accomplishes wonderful things : His name -isaia- holy , He shows His mercy , He raises up the humble , He -isaia- faithful to His promises . Not that the apparent course of her_life in any_way departs from the ordinary , but she meditates on the least signs of God , pondering them in her_heart . Not that she_-isaia- in any_way spared sufferings : she stands , the mother of sorrows , -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross , associated in an eminent way with the sacrifice of the innocent Servant . But she -isaia-_also open in an unlimited degree to the joy of the resurrection ; and she -isaia-_also taken up , body_and_soul , into the glory of heaven . The first of the redeemed , immaculate from the moment of her conception , the incomparable dwelling place of the Spirit , the pure abode of the Redeemer of mankind , she_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the beloved Daughter of God and , in Christ , the Mother of all . She -isaia- the perfect model of the Church both on earth and in glory . What a marvelous echo the prophetic words about the new Jerusalem find in her wonderful existence as the Virgin of Israel : '' I will greatly rejoice in the Lord , my soul shall exult in my God ; for he has clothed me with the garment of salvation , he has covered me with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decks himself_with a garland and as a bride adorns herself with_her jewels . '' With Christ , she sums up in herself all joys ; she lives the perfect joy promised to the Church : Mater plena sanctae laetitiae . And it -isaia- with good_reason that her_children on earth , turning to her who_-isaia- the mother of hope and of grace , invoke her as the cause of their joy : Causa nostrae laetitiae . After Mary , we find the expression of the purest and most burning joy where_the cross of Jesus -isaia- embraced with the most faithful love among the martyrs , in whom , in the very midst of their torment , the Holy Spirit inspires an impassioned longing for the coming of the Spouse . Dying and seeing heaven open , Saint Stephen -isaia- but the first of the innumerable witnesses of Christ . How many there_are , in our_day still and in many countries , who , risking everything for Christ , could declare with the martyr Ignatius of Antioch : '' It -isaia- in the fullness of life_that I write to you , desiring to die . My earthly desire has_been crucified , and there_-isaia- no more fire in me to love matter . There -isaia- only in me a living water that murmurs and says : Come to the Father . '' In the same_way the strength of the Church , the certainty of her victory and her happiness in the celebration of the martyrs combat come from the fact_that she contemplates in them the glorious fruitfulness of the cross . This -isaia- the reason_why our predecessor Saint Leo the Great extolling from this Roman See the martyrdom of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul , exclaims : '' Precious in the eyes of God -isaia- the death of His saints , and no form of cruelty can destroy a religion founded on the mystery of the cross of Christ . The Church -isaia- not diminished but increased by persecutions . And the Lord s field -isaia- unceasingly clothed with a richer harvest , when_the grains which fell alone are multiplied in their rebirth . '' Nevertheless , there_are_many dwellings in the Father s house , and for those_whose heart_-isaia- consumed by the Holy Spirit many_ways of dying to themselves and of coming to the holy joy of the resurrection . The shedding of blood -isaia- not the only path . Yet the combat for the kingdom necessarily includes passing through a passion of love_,_which the spiritual masters have spoken of in excellent ways . And here their interior experiences meet , in the very diversity of mystical traditions , in the East as in the West . They attest to the same path for the soul : per crucem ad lucem , and from this_world to the Father , in the life_giving breath of the Spirit . Each of these spiritual masters has left us a message of joy . The Fathers of the East abound in testimonies about_this joy in the Holy Spirit . Origen , for example , often describes the joy of the one_who has intimate knowledge of Jesus : '' His soul -isaia- then inundated with_joy , like that of the old Simeon . In the temple which_-isaia- the Church he embraces Jesus in his arms . He enjoys the plenitude of salvation , holding Him in whom God reconciles the world to Himself . '' In the Middle Ages , among many_others , a master of spirituality in the East , Nicholas Cabasilas , endeavors to show how the love of God for Himself procures the maximum of joy . In the West , it -isaia- sufficient to cite the names of some of those_who_have taught the way to holiness and joy : St . John of the Cross , St . Francis de Sales and St . We would_like to evoke more especially three figures that are_still very attractive today for the Christian people as a whole . First of all , the poor man of Assisi , in whose footsteps numbers of Holy Year pilgrims are endeavoring to follow . Having left everything for the Lord , St . Francis rediscovers through holy poverty something , so to speak , of the original blessedness , when_the world came forth intact from the hands of the Creator . In the most extreme abnegation , half blind , he was able to chant the unforgettable Canticle of the Creatures , the praise of our brother the sun , of all nature , which_had become transparent for him and like a pure mirror of God s glory . He could even express joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the arrival of '' our sister bodily death '' : '' Blessed are_those_who will be conformed to your most Holy will . '' In more recent_times , St . Therese of Lisieux shows us the courageous way of abandonment into the hands of God to whom she entrusts her littleness . And yet it -isaia- not_that she_has no experience of the feeling of God s absence , a feeling which_our century -isaia- harshly experiencing ; '' Sometimes it seems that the little bird to which_she compared herself cannot believe_that anything else exists except the clouds that envelop it . This -isaia- the moment of perfect joy for the poor , weak little thing . What happiness for it to remain there nevertheless , and to gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- the invisible light that hides from its faith . '' And then how could one fail to recall_the luminous figure and example for our generation of Blessed Maximilian Kolbe , the authentic disciple of St . Francis ? In the most tragic trials which_have bloodied our_age , he offered himself voluntarily to death in order to save an unknown brother , and the witnesses report that_his interior peace , serenity and joy somehow transformed the place of suffering which_was usually like an image of hell into the antechamber of eternal_life , both_for his unfortunate companions and for_himself . In the life of the Church s sons_and_daughters , this sharing in the joy of the Lord cannot be dissociated from the celebration of the Eucharistic mystery , -atti_degli_apostoli- which_they_are nourished with His Body and Blood . For being thus sustained like travelers , on the road to eternity , they already receive sacramentally the first fruits of eschatological joy . Situated in this perspective , the vast and profound joy infused already here below into the hearts of the truly faithful cannot_but appear as '' self multiplying , '' just like the life and love of which_it_-isaia- a happy manifestation . Joy -isaia- the result of a human divine communion , and aspires to a communion ever_more universal . In no way can it encourage the person_who enjoys it to have an attitude of preoccupation with self . Joy gives the heart a catholic openness to the world of people , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that it wounds the heart with a longing for eternal bliss . Among the fervent , joy deepens their awareness of being exiles , but it guards them_from the temptation to desert the place of their combat for the coming of the kingdom . It makes them hasten actively towards_the heavenly consummation of the nuptials of the Lamb . It -isaia- peacefully stretched between_the moment of earthly toil and the peace of the eternal dwelling , in conformity_with_the Spirit s force of attraction : '' If then , already here below , because we have_received this pledge of the Spirit of sonship , we exclaim Abba , Father ! what will it be like when we shall be raised and see Him face to face ? When all the members , like an immense flood , will burst forth in a hymn of exultation , glorifying Him who_has raised them_from the dead and given them eternal_life ? For if simple pledges , enveloping man on all sides , already make him exclaim Abba , Father , what will the full grace of the Spirit not do when_it_-isaia- given to men by God ? It will_make us like Him and will accomplish the will of the Father , for it will_make man to the image_and_likeness of God . '' Already here below the saints give us a foretaste of this likeness . A joy for all the people In listening to this harmony of the many voices of the saints , have we forgotten the present condition of human_society , apparently so little oriented towards things supernatural ? Have we overestimated the spiritual aspirations of the Christians of the present_time ? Have we limited our exhortation to a small number of wise and learned people ? We cannot forget_that the Gospel with its so simple splendor and complete content was first announced to the poor and the humble . If we have evoked this bright horizon of Christian joy it -isaia- in no way with the idea of discouraging any of you , dear_brothers and sons_and_daughters , who feel your heart divided when God s call reaches you . Quite the contrary ; we feel_that our joy , like yours , will only be complete if we look together , with full confidence , to Him '' who leads us in our_faith and brings it to perfection ; for the sake of the joy which_was still in the future , he endured the cross , disregarding the shamefulness of it , and from now on has_taken his place -atti_degli_apostoli- the right of God s throne . Think of the way he stood such opposition from sinners and then you will_not give up for want of courage . '' The invitation given by God the Father to share fully in the joy of Abraham , in the everlasting feast of the nuptials of the Lamb , -isaia- a universal convocation . Everyone , provided he makes himself attentive and available , can perceive this invitation in the depths of his_heart , especially in this Holy Year when_the Church opens more abundantly to all the riches of God s mercy . '' The promise that_was made -isaia- for you and your children , and for all those_who_are far away , for all those_whom the Lord our God will call to himself . '' We cannot think of the People of God in an abstract way . Our gaze rests first of all on the world of children . As long as they find in the love of those close to them the security which_they need , they_have a capacity_for welcoming , for wonderment , for confidence and for spontaneous giving . They are apt subjects for Gospel joy . Whoever wishes to enter_the kingdom_of_heaven , Jesus tells us , must first study children . We include also all those_who_are deeply involved in family , professional and social responsibility . The burden of their charges , in a fast moving world , too_often prevents them_from enjoying daily joys . Nevertheless such joys do exist . The Holy Spirit wants to help these_people rediscover these joys , to purify them , to share them . We think of the world of the suffering , we think of all those_who_have reached the evening of their_lives . God s joy -isaia- knocking -atti_degli_apostoli- the door of their physical and moral sufferings , not indeed with irony , but to achieve therein His paradoxical work of transfiguration . Our heart and mind turn also to all those_who live beyond_the visible sphere of the People of God . By bringing their_lives into harmony_with_the innermost appeal of their conscience , which_-isaia- the echo of God s voice , they_are on the road to joy . But the People of God cannot go forward without guides . These are the pastors , the theologians , the spiritual directors , the priests and those_who collaborate with_them in the animation of Christian communities . Their mission_-isaia- to help their brethren to take the paths of Gospel joy , in the midst of the realities which_make up their_lives and from which they_cannot flee . Yes , it -isaia- the immense love of God which_-isaia- summoning towards_the heavenly City those_who_are coming in this Holy Year from the different points of the compass , whether_they be near or still far off . And because all those_who_are summoned all of us in fact remain to some extent sinners , we must today cease to harden our_hearts , in order to listen to the voice of the Lord and accept the offer of the great pardon , as Jeremiah announced it : '' I will cleanse them of every sin they_have committed against me ; the sins by which_they offended me and apostatized from me , all these I will forgive . And Jerusalem shall be my theme of joy , my honor and my boast before all the nations of the earth . '' And just as this promise of pardon , and many_others , find_their definite meaning in the redeeming sacrifice of Jesus , the Suffering Servant , it -isaia- He , and He alone , who_can say to us , in this crucial moment of mankind s life : '' Repent , and believe the Good News . '' The Lord wishes above all to make us understand_that the conversion demanded of us -isaia- in no way a backward step , as sin_-isaia- . It -isaia- rather a setting out , an advancement in true freedom and in joy . It -isaia- the response to an invitation coming from Him an invitation that_-isaia- loving , respectful and pressing -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time : '' Come to me , all you_who labor and are overburdened , and I will_give you rest . Shoulder my yoke and learn from me , for I -amos- gentle and humble in heart , and you will_find rest for your souls ! '' In fact , what burden -isaia- more crushing than_that of sin ? What distress more lonely than_that of the prodigal son , described by the evangelist Saint Luke ? On the other_hand , what meeting -isaia- more overwhelming than_that of the Father , patient and merciful , and the son returned to life ? '' There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ninety nine virtuous men who_have no need of repentance . '' And who_-isaia- without sin , apart_from Christ and His Immaculate Mother ? Thus , by its invitation to return to the Father by repentance , the Holy Year a promise of jubilation for all the people -isaia-_also a call to rediscover the meaning and the practice of the sacrament of Reconciliation . Following the line of the best spiritual tradition , we remind the faithful and their pastors that the confessing of grave sins -isaia- necessary and that frequent confession remains a privileged source of holiness , peace and joy . Joy and hope in the hearts of the young Without detracting from the fervor of our message to the whole of the People of God , we wish to take the time to address ourself -atti_degli_apostoli- greater length to the world of the young . We do so with_special hope . If in fact the Church , regenerated by the Holy Spirit , in a certain_sense constitutes the true youth of the world , as long as she remains faithful to her being and to her_mission , how could she fail spontaneously and preferably to recognize herself in those_who feel themselves to be the bearers of life and hope and of the task of ensuring that_there will be a tomorrow for the history of today ? And vice versa , how_can those_who in every period of this history more intensely experience in themselves the impetus of life , the expectation of hope_for the future , the need_for true renewal , not be secretly in harmony_with a Church animated by the Spirit of Christ ? How could they not expect from the Church the revelation of her secret of permanent youth , and therefore the joy of their_own youth ? We think_that in fact such a correspondence exists , not_always visibly , but certainly deep down , despite many accidental contradictions . This -isaia- why , in this Exhortation on Christian Joy , our mind_and_heart urge us to turn very decisively to the young_people of today . We do so in the name of Christ and of His Church which , despite her human failings , He wishes to be '' glorious , with no speck or wrinkle or anything like that , but holy and faultless . '' In doing so we are_not giving way to a sentimental cult of youth . Considered only from the viewpoint of age , youth -isaia- a short lived thing . The excessive attention that_-isaia- given to it quickly becomes nostalgic or ridiculous . But this_-isaia-_not true in what concerns the spiritual meaning of this moment of grace : youth lived in the proper way . What catches our attention -isaia- essentially the correspondence between_the soaring impulse of a being which_-isaia- naturally receptive to the appeals and demands of his high destiny as a person , and the dynamism of the Holy Spirit , from whom_the Church ceaselessly receives her_own youthfulness , her substantial fidelity to herself and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of this faithfulness , her living creativity . It -isaia- a correspondence which_-isaia- transitory and threatened , yes , but still full of meaning and rich in generous promises . From the encounter between_the human_being which , for a few decisive years , has youth -atti_degli_apostoli- his command , and the Church in her permanent spiritual youthfulness , there necessarily arises , on both sides , a joy of high quality and a fruitful promise . The Church , as the People of God on pilgrimage towards_the future kingdom , must be able to perpetuate herself , and therefore renew herself down succeeding human generations . For her this_-isaia- a condition_for fruitfulness , and even simply for life_itself . It -isaia- therefore necessary_that -atti_degli_apostoli- each moment of her history the rising generation should in some_way fulfill the hope of the preceding generations , the very hope of the Church , which_-isaia- to transmit without end the gift of God , the Truth and the Life . This -isaia- why in every generation young Christians justly ratify , with full consciousness and unconditionally , the covenant entered into by them in the sacrament of Baptism and reinforced in the sacrament of Confirmation . In this_regard our_age of profound change -isaia- not_without grave difficulties for the Church . We who_have , together_with_the whole College of Bishops , '' anxiety for all the churches '' and preoccupation for their immediate future , are well_aware of this . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , being supported by faith and hope which_does_not disappoint us , we are sure_that grace will not_fail the Christian people , and we hope_that they_themselves will not_fail grace , or reject as some today are gravely tempted to do the inheritance of truth and holiness handed_down to this decisive moment in the history of the world . And this_-isaia- the point we think that_we_have every reason to have confidence in Christian youth : youth will not_fail the Church if within_the Church there_are enough older people able to understand it , to love it , to guide it and to open up to it a future by passing on to it with complete fidelity the Truth which endures . Then new workers , resolute and fervent , will in their turn enter upon spiritual and apostolic work in the fields which_are white and ready for the harvest . Then the sower and the reaper will share the same joy of the kingdom . It seems to us in fact_that the present world crisis , which_-isaia- marked by a great confusion among many young_people , partly betrays a senile and definitely out of date aspect of a commercial , hedonistic and materialistic civilization which_-isaia- still trying to present itself as the gateway to the future . Even in its_very excesses , the instinctive reaction of many young_people against this illusion takes on a certain importance . This generation -isaia- waiting for something else . Having suddenly been deprived of protective traditions , then bitterly deceived by the vanity and spiritual vacuum of false novelties , atheistic ideologies and certain deleterious forms of mysticism , will_not this generation come to discover or rediscover the sure and unalterable newness of the divine mystery revealed in Jesus Christ ? Has not He , in the splendid words of Saint Irenaeus , '' brought all newness by bringing His own person '' ? And this_-isaia-_why we are pleased to dedicate more expressly to you , the young Christians of the present_day , the promise of the Church of tomorrow , this celebration of spiritual joy . We cordially urge you to be attentive to the inner appeals which come to you . We urge you to raise up your eyes , your hearts , your fresh energies , to the heights , to accept the effort of the soul s yearnings . And we wish to give_you this assurance : however debilitating the prejudice diffused everywhere today , of the human spirit s inability to discover permanent and life_giving Truth , equally profound and liberating -isaia- the joy of divine Truth finally recognized in the Church : gaudium de Veritate . This -isaia- the joy which_-isaia- offered to you . It gives itself to those_who love it enough to seek it tenaciously . By disposing yourselves to accept it and to communicate it , you will ensure together your_own fulfillment in Christ and the next historical stage of the People of God . The joy of the pilgrim in this Holy Year The Holy Year with its pilgrimage forms a natural part in this journey of the whole People of God . The grace of the Jubilee -isaia-_in_fact obtained -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of setting out and of a journey towards God , in faith , hope and love . By varying the means and the times of this Jubilee , we have wished to make it easier for everyone . The essential element remains the inner decision to respond to the call of the Spirit , in a personal manner , as a disciple of Jesus , as a child of the Catholic and Apostolic Church and according to the intention of this Church . The remainder -isaia- in the order of signs and means . Yes , the desired pilgrimage -isaia- , for the People of God as a whole , and for each_individual within it , a movement , a Passover , that_-isaia- to say , a journey to the inner place_where the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit welcome one into_their own intimacy and divine unity : '' If anyone loves me . my Father will love him , and we shall come to him and make our home with_him . '' To reach this presence always presupposes a deepening of true knowledge of oneself , as a creature and as a child of God . Was it not an inner renewal of this_kind that the recent Council fundamentally desired ? Assuredly we have here a work of the Spirit , a gift of Pentecost . One must_also recognize a prophetic intuition on the part of our predecessor John XXIII , who envisaged a kind of new Pentecost as a fruit of the Council . We too have wished to place ourself in the same perspective and in the same attitude of expectation . Not that Pentecost has_ever ceased to be an actuality during the whole history of the Church , but so great are the needs and the perils of the present age , so vast the horizon of mankind drawn towards world coexistence and powerless to achieve it , that_there_-isaia- no salvation for it except in a new outpouring of the gift of God . Let Him then come , the Creating Spirit , to renew the face of the earth ! In this Holy Year , we have invited you to make , either materially or in spirit and intention , a pilgrimage to Rome , that_-isaia- , to the heart of the Catholic Church . But obviously Rome does_not constitute the goal of our pilgrimage in time . No holy city here below constitutes this goal . This goal -isaia- hidden beyond this_world , in the heart of God s mystery which_-isaia- still invisible to us . For it -isaia- in faith_that we journey , not in clear vision , and what we shall be has not_yet been manifested . The New Jerusalem of which_we_are already citizens and sons_and_daughters , comes down from above , from God . Of this only lasting city we have_not yet contemplated the splendor , except as in a mirror and in a confused way , by holding fast to the prophetic word . But already we are its citizens , or we are invited to become so ; every spiritual pilgrimage receives its interior meaning from this ultimate destination . And so it was with the Jerusalem praised by the psalmists . Jesus Himself and Mary His Mother sang on earth as they went up to Jerusalem the canticles of Zion : '' perfection of beauty , '' '' joy to the whole_world . '' But henceforth it -isaia- from Christ that the Jerusalem above receives its attraction , and it -isaia- towards Him that_we_are making our inner journey . And so it -isaia- with Rome where_the holy Apostles Peter and Paul gave with_their blood their final witness . The vocation of Rome -isaia- of apostolic origin , and the ministry which_it_-isaia- our lot to exercise here -isaia- a service for the benefit of the entire Church and of mankind . But it -isaia- an irreplaceable service , because it has pleased the Wisdom of God to place the Rome of Peter and Paul , so to speak , on the road that leads to the eternal City , by the fact_that Wisdom chose to confide to Peter who unifies in himself_the College of Bishops the keys of the kingdom_of_heaven . What remains here , not through the effect of man s will but through the free and merciful benevolence of the Father and the son and the Holy Spirit , -isaia- the soliditas Petri , such as our predecessor Saint Leo the Great extolled in unforgettable terms : '' Saint Peter does not_cease to preside over his See , and preserves an endless sharing with the Sovereign Priest . The firmness that he received_from_the Rock which_-isaia- Christ , he himself , having become the Rock , transmits it equally to his_successors too ; and wherever there appears a certain firmness , there_-isaia- manifested without_doubt the strength of the Pastor . Thus there_-isaia- , in full vigor and life , in the Prince of the Apostles , this_love of God and of men which_has_been daunted neither by the confinement of prison , nor chains , nor the pressures of the crowd nor the threats of kings ; and the same -isaia- true of his invincible faith_,_which has not wavered in the combat or grown lukewarm in victory . '' It -isaia- always our wish , but still_more in this Catholic celebration of the Holy Year , that_you_may experience with us , both in Rome and in every Church conscious of the duty of being in harmony_with_the authentic tradition preserved in Rome , '' how good , how delightful it -isaia- for all to live together like brothers . '' A common joy , truly supernatural , a gift of the Spirit of unity and love , which_-isaia-_not possible in truth except where_the preaching of the faith_-isaia- accepted in its entirety , according to the apostolic norm . For then although this faith '' -isaia- spread throughout_the_world the Catholic Church guards it carefully , as if it dwelt in a single home , and she believes it unanimously , as if it had but a single soul and a single heart ; and in perfect accord she preaches it , teaches it and transmits it , as though it had only_one mouth . '' This '' single home , '' this single '' heart '' and '' soul , '' this '' one mouth '' are indispensable to the Church and to humanity in its entirety , so that_there may be raised permanently here below , in unison with the Jerusalem above , the new canticle , the hymn of divine joy . And this_-isaia- the reason_why we ourself must render witness humbly , patiently and perseveringly even_though it be amid the incomprehension of many to the charge received_from_the Lord , that of leading the flock and of confirming our brethren . But in how many_ways it -isaia-_our lot to be in our turn comforted by the very thought of you all , in order to accomplish our_apostolic mission for the service of the universal Church and the glory of God the Father ! Conclusion In the middle of this Holy Year we have considered it fidelity to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit to ask Christians thus to return to the sources of joy . Beloved brethren and sons_and_daughters , -isaia- it not normal that joy should dwell in us , when our_hearts contemplate or rediscover , in faith , the fundamental and simple reasons for joy ? God has so loved the world_that He gave His only_begotten Son ; through His Spirit , God s presence does not_cease to enfold us with His tenderness and to fill us with His life ; and we are journeying towards_the blessed transfiguration of our life in the path of the resurrection of Jesus . Yes , it would be very strange if this Good News , which evokes the alleluia of the Church , did_not give us the look of those_who_are saved . The joy of being Christian , of being united with the Church , of being '' in Christ , '' and in the state of grace with God , -isaia- truly able to fill the human_heart . Is it not this profound exultation that gives an overwhelming accent to the Memorial of Pascal : '' Joy , joy , joy , tears of joy '' ? And near to us , how_many writers there_are who know_how to express in a new form we are thinking , for example , of Georges Bernanos this evangelical joy of the humble which shines_forth everywhere in the world and which speaks of God s silence ! Joy always springs from a certain outlook on man and on God . '' When your eye -isaia- sound , your whole_body too -isaia- filled_with light . '' We are touching here on the original and inalienable dimension of the human_person : his vocation to happiness always passes through the channels of knowledge and love , of contemplation and action . May you attain this good quality which_-isaia- in your brother s soul , and this_divine presence so close to the human_heart ! Let the agitated members of various groups therefore reject the excesses of systematic and destructive criticism ! Without departing from a realistic viewpoint , let Christian communities become centers of optimism where all the members resolutely endeavor to perceive the positive aspect of people and events . '' Love does_not rejoice in what_-isaia- wrong but rejoices with the truth . There -isaia- no limit to love s forbearance , to its trust , its hope , its power to endure . '' The attainment of such an outlook -isaia- not_just a matter of psychology . It -isaia-_also a fruit of the Holy Spirit . This Spirit , who dwells fully in the person of Jesus , made Him during His earthly life so alert to the joys of daily_life , so tactful and persuasive for putting sinners back on the road to a new youth of heart and mind ! It -isaia- this_same Spirit who animated the Blessed Virgin and each of the saints . It -isaia- this_same Spirit who still today gives to so many Christians the joy of living day_by_day their particular vocation , in the peace and hope which surpass setbacks and sufferings . It -isaia- the Spirit of Pentecost who today leads very many followers of Christ along the paths of prayer , in the cheerfulness of filial praise , towards_the humble and joyous service of the disinherited and of those on the margins of society . For joy cannot be dissociated from sharing . In God Himself , all -isaia- joy because all -isaia- giving . This positive outlook on people and things , the fruit of an enlightened human spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit , finds in Christians a privileged place of replenishment : the celebration of the Paschal Mystery of Jesus . In His passion , death_and_resurrection , Christ summarizes the history of each man and of all men , with_their weight of sufferings and sins , with_their capacities for progress and holiness . This -isaia- why our last word in this_exhortation -isaia- a pressing appeal to all the leaders and animators of the Christian communities : let_them not be afraid to insist time and time again on the need_for baptized Christians to be faithful to the Sunday celebration , in joy , of the Eucharist . How could they neglect this encounter , this banquet which Christ prepares for us in His love ? Let participation in this celebration be -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time very dignified and festive ! It -isaia- the crucified and glorious Christ who passes among His disciples to bring them together into the renewal of His resurrection . This -isaia- the culmination here below of the alliance of love between God and His people : the sign and source of Christian joy , the preparation_for the eternal feast . May the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit draw you to it ! And on our part we bless you with_all_our heart .

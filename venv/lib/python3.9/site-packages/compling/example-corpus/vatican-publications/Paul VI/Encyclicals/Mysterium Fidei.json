Venerable Brothers and Dear Sons , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The Mystery of Faith , that_-isaia- , the ineffable gift of the Eucharist that the Catholic Church received_from Christ , her Spouse , as a pledge of His immense love , -isaia- something_that she has_always devoutly guarded as her most_precious treasure , and during the Second Vatican Council she professed her faith and veneration in a new and solemn declaration . In dealing_with the restoration of the sacred_liturgy , the Fathers of the Council were led by their pastoral concern_for the whole Church to regard it as a matter of highest importance to urge the faithful to participate actively , with undivided faith and the utmost devotion , in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery , to offer it to God along_with the priest as a sacrifice for their_own salvation and that of the whole_world , and to use it as spiritual nourishment . For if the sacred_liturgy holds first_place in the life of the Church , then the Eucharistic Mystery stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart and center of the liturgy , since_it_-isaia- the font of life_that cleanses us and strengthens us to live not_for ourselves but_for God and to be united to each_other by the closest ties of love . In order to make_the indissoluble bond that exists between_faith and devotion perfectly clear , the Fathers of the Council decided , in the course of reaffirming the doctrine that the Church has_always held and taught and that_was solemnly defined by the Council of Trent , to offer the following compendium of truths as an introduction to their treatment of the Most Holy Mystery of the Eucharist : . '' At the Last Supper , on the night when He was betrayed , our Savior instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood . He did this in order to perpetuate the Sacrifice of the Cross throughout_the centuries until He should come again , and so to entrust to His beloved Spouse , the Church , a memorial of His Death and Resurrection : a sacrament of love , a sign of unity , a bond of charity , a paschal banquet in which Christ -isaia- eaten , the mind -isaia- filled_with grace , and a pledge of future glory -isaia- given to us . '' Both Sacrifice and Sacrament Highlighted . These words highlight both the sacrifice , which pertains to the essence of the Mass that_-isaia- celebrated daily , and the sacrament in which those_who participate in it through holy Communion eat the flesh of Christ and drink the blood of Christ , and thus receive grace , which_-isaia- the beginning of eternal_life , and the '' medicine of immortality '' according to Our Lord s words : '' The man_who eats my flesh and drinks my blood enjoys eternal_life , and I will raise him up on the last day . '' Restoration of Liturgy Linked to Eucharistic Devotion . And so We earnestly hope_that the restoration of the sacred_liturgy will produce abundant fruits in the form of Eucharistic devotion , so that the Holy Church may , with this salvific sign of piety raised on high , make daily progress toward_the full achievement of unity , inviting all Christians to a unity of faith and love and drawing them to it gently , through the action of divine_grace . We seem to have a preview of these fruits and a first taste of them in the outpouring of joy and eagerness that_has marked the reception the sons of the Catholic Church have accorded to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and to the restoration of the liturgy ; and we find these fruits too in the large number of carefully edited publications that make it their purpose to go into the doctrine of the Holy Eucharist more profoundly and to come to a more fruitful understanding of it , especially in terms of its relationship to the mystery of the Church . All of this brings Us deep consolation and joy . And it gives Us great pleasure to inform you of this , Venerable Brothers , so that_you_may join with Us in giving thanks to God , the bestower of all gifts , who rules the Church and makes her grow in virtue through His Spirit . REASONS FOR PASTORAL CONCERN AND ANXIETY . There are , however , Venerable Brothers , a number of reasons for serious pastoral concern and anxiety in this_very matter that_we_are now discussing , and because of Our consciousness of Our Apostolic office , We cannot remain silent about them . False and Disturbing Opinions . For We can_see that_some of those_who_are dealing_with this Most Holy Mystery in speech and writing are disseminating opinions on Masses celebrated in private or on the dogma of transubstantiation that_are disturbing the minds of the faithful and causing them no small measure of confusion about matters of faith , just as if it were all right for someone to take doctrine that has_already_been defined by the Church and consign it to oblivion or else interpret it in such_a_way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved . To give an example of what We are talking about , it -isaia- not permissible to extol the so called '' community '' Mass in such_a_way as to detract from Masses that_are celebrated privately ; or to concentrate on the notion of sacramental sign as if the symbolism which no one will deny -isaia- certainly present in the Most Blessed Eucharist fully expressed and exhausted the manner of Christ s presence in this Sacrament ; or to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what_the Council of Trent had to say about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ , as if they involve nothing_more than '' transignification , '' or '' transfinalization '' as they call it ; or , finally , to propose and act upon the opinion that Christ Our Lord -isaia-_no_longer present in the consecrated Hosts that remain after_the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass has_been completed . Everyone can see_that the spread of these and similar opinions does great harm to belief in and devotion to the Eucharist . Purpose of the Encyclical . And so , with the aim of seeing to it that the hope to which_the Council has_given rise that a new wave of Eucharistic devotion will sweep over the Church not be reduced to nil through the sowing of the seeds of false opinions , We have decided to use Our apostolic authority and speak Our mind to you on this_subject , Venerable Brothers . We certainly do not deny that_those_who are spreading these strange opinions are making a praiseworthy effort to investigate this lofty Mystery and to set_forth its inexhaustible riches and to make it more understandable to the men of today ; rather , We acknowledge this and We approve of it . But We cannot approve the opinions that_they set_forth , and We have an obligation to warn you about the grave danger that_these opinions involve for true faith . HOLY EUCHARIST A MYSTERY OF FAITH . First of all , We want to recall something_that you_know very well but that_-isaia- absolutely necessary if the virus of every_kind of rationalism -isaia- to be repelled ; it -isaia- something_that many illustrious martyrs have witnessed to with_their blood , something_that celebrated fathers and Doctors of the Church have constantly professed and taught . We mean the fact_that the Eucharist -isaia- a very great mystery in fact , properly speaking and in the words of the Sacred Liturgy , the mystery of faith . '' It contains within it , '' as Leo XIII , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , very wisely remarked , '' all supernatural realities in a remarkable richness and variety of miracles . '' Relying on Revelation , Not Reason . And so we must approach this_mystery in particular with humility and reverence , not relying on human reasoning , which ought to hold its peace , but_rather adhering firmly to divine Revelation . John Chrysostom who , as you_know , dealt_with the Mystery of the Eucharist in such eloquent language and with_such insight born of devotion , had these most fitting words to offer on one occasion when he was instructing his faithful about this_mystery : '' Let us submit to God in all things and not contradict Him , even if what He says seems to contradict our reason and intellect ; let His word prevail over our reason and intellect . Let us act in this_way with_regard to the Eucharistic mysteries , and not limit our attention just to what can be perceived by the senses , but instead hold fast to His words . For His word cannot deceive . The scholastic Doctors made similar statements on more_than one occasion . Thomas says , the fact_that the true body and the true blood of Christ are present in this Sacrament '' cannot be apprehended by the senses but_only by faith_,_which rests upon divine authority . This -isaia- why Cyril comments upon the words , This -isaia- my body which_-isaia- delivered up for you , in Luke , , in this_way : Do not doubt that_this_-isaia- true ; instead accept the words of the Savior in faith ; for since He -isaia- truth , He cannot tell a lie . Hence the Christian people often follow_the lead of St . Thomas and sing the words : '' Sight , touch and taste in Thee are each deceived ; The ear alone most safely -isaia- believed . I believe all the Son of God has spoken ; Than truth s own word , there_-isaia- no truer token . Bonaventure declares : '' There -isaia- no difficulty over Christ s being present in the sacrament as in a sign ; the great difficulty -isaia- in the fact_that He -isaia- really in the sacrament , as He -isaia- in heaven . And so believing this -isaia-_especially meritorious . '' Example of the Apostles . Moreover , the Holy Gospel alludes to this when it tells of the many disciples of Christ who turned away and left Our Lord , after hearing Him speak of eating His flesh and drinking His blood . '' This -isaia- strange talk , '' they said . '' Who can be expected to listen to it '' Peter , on the contrary , replied to Jesus question as to whether the twelve wanted to go away too by promptly and firmly expressing his_own faith and that of the other Apostles in these marvelous words : '' Lord , to whom should we go ? Thy words are the words of eternal_life . It -isaia- only logical , then , for us to follow_the magisterium of the Church as a guiding star in carrying on our investigations into this_mystery , for the Divine Redeemer has_entrusted the safeguarding and the explanation of the written or transmitted word of God to her . And we are convinced_that '' whatever has_been preached and believed throughout_the whole Church with true Catholic faith since_the days of antiquity -isaia- true , even if it not be subject to rational investigation , and even if it not be explained in words . '' Proper Wording of Great Importance . But this -isaia-_not_enough . Once the integrity of the faith_has been safeguarded , then it -isaia- time to guard the proper way of expressing it , lest our careless use of words give rise , God forbid , to false opinions regarding faith in the most sublime things . Augustine gives a stern warning about_this when he takes up the matter of the different_ways of speaking that_are employed by the philosophers on the one_hand and that ought to be used by Christians on the other . '' The philosophers , '' he says , '' use words freely , and they_have no fear of offending religious listeners in dealing_with subjects that_are difficult to understand . But we have to speak in accordance_with a fixed rule , so that a lack of restraint in speech on our part may_not give rise to some irreverent opinion about the things represented by the words . And so the rule of language which_the Church has established through the long labor of centuries , with the help of the Holy Spirit , and which_she has confirmed with the authority of the Councils , and which_has more_than_once been_the watchword and banner of orthodox faith , -isaia- to be religiously preserved , and no one may presume to change it -atti_degli_apostoli- his_own pleasure or under the pretext of new knowledge . Who would ever tolerate that the dogmatic formulas used by the ecumenical councils for the mysteries of the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation be judged as no longer appropriate for men of our_times , and let others be rashly substituted for them ? In the same_way , it cannot be tolerated that any individual should on his_own authority take something away from the formulas which_were used by the Council of Trent to propose the Eucharistic Mystery for our belief . These formulas like the others that the Church used to propose the dogmas of faith express concepts that_are not tied to a certain specific form of human culture , or to a certain level of scientific progress , or to one or another theological school . Instead they set_forth what_the human mind grasps of reality through necessary and universal experience and what it expresses in apt and exact words , whether it be in ordinary or more refined language . For this_reason , these formulas are adapted to all men of all times and all places . Greater Clarity of Expression Always Possible . They can , it -isaia- true , be made clearer and more obvious ; and doing this_-isaia- of great benefit . But it must_always be done in such_a_way_that they retain the meaning in which_they_have been used , so that_with the advance of an understanding of the faith , the truth of faith will remain unchanged . For it -isaia- the teaching of the First Vatican Council that '' the meaning that Holy Mother the Church has once declared , -isaia- to be retained forever , and no pretext of deeper_understanding ever justifies any deviation from that meaning . '' EUCHARISTIC MYSTERY IN SACRIFICE OF THE MASS . For the joy and edification of everyone , We would_like to review with you , Venerable Brothers , the doctrine on the Mystery of the Eucharist that_has_been handed_down , and that the Catholic Church holds and teaches with unanimity . Re enactment -atti_degli_apostoli- Heart of Doctrine . It -isaia- a good idea to recall -atti_degli_apostoli- the very outset what may be termed the heart and core of the doctrine , namely that , by means of the Mystery of the Eucharist , the Sacrifice of the Cross which_was once carried_out on Calvary -isaia- re enacted in wonderful fashion and -isaia- constantly recalled , and its salvific power -isaia- applied to the forgiving of the sins we commit each_day . just as Moses made the Old Testament sacred with the blood of calves , so too Christ the Lord took the New Testament , of which He -isaia- the Mediator , and made it sacred through His own blood , in instituting the mystery of the Eucharist . For , as the Evangelists narrate , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper '' he took bread , and blessed and broke it , and gave it to them , saying , This -isaia- my body , given for you ; do this for a commemoration of me . And so with the cup , when supper was ended , This cup , he said , -isaia- the new_testament , in my Blood which_-isaia- to be shed for you . '' l And by bidding the Apostles to do this in memory of Him , He made clear_that He wanted it to be forever repeated . This intention of Christ was faithfully carried_out by the primitive Church through_her adherence to the teaching of the Apostles and through_her gatherings to celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice . Luke -isaia- careful to point_out , '' They occupied themselves continually with the Apostles teaching , their fellowship in the breaking of bread , and the fixed times of prayer . '' l The faithful used to derive such spiritual fervor from this practice that_it_was said of them that '' there_was one heart and soul in all the company of the believers . '' New Offering of the New Testament . Moreover , the Apostle Paul , who faithfully transmitted to us what he had received_from_the Lord , -isaia- clearly speaking of the Eucharistic Sacrifice when he points_out that Christians ought not take_part in pagan sacrifices , precisely_because they_have_been made partakers of the table of the Lord . '' Is not this cup we bless , '' he says , '' a participation in Christ s Blood ? Is not the Bread we break a participation in Christ s Body ? . To drink the Lord s cup , and yet to drink the cup of evil spirits , to share the Lord s feast , and to share the feast of evil spirits , -isaia- impossible for you . '' Foreshadowed by Malachias , this_new oblation of the New Testament has_always_been offered by the Church , in accordance_with_the teaching of Our Lord and the Apostles , '' not_only to atone for the sins and punishments and satisfactions of the living faithful and to appeal for their other needs , but_also to help those_who_have died in Christ but have_not yet been completely purified . '' Offered Also for the Dead . We will pass over the other citations and rest content with recalling the testimony offered by St . Cyril of Jerusalem , who wrote the following memorable words for the neophytes whom he was instructing in the Christian faith : '' After the spiritual sacrifice , the un bloody act of worship , has_been completed , we bend over this propitiatory offering and beg God to grant peace to all the Churches , to give harmony to the whole_world , to bless our rulers , our soldiers and our companions , to aid the sick and afflicted , and in general to assist all those_who stand in need ; we all pray_for all these intentions and we offer this victim for them . and last of all for our deceased holy forefathers and bishops and for all those_who_have lived among us . For we have a deep conviction_that great help will be afforded those souls for_whom prayers are offered while this_holy and awesome victim -isaia- present . '' In support of this , this_holy Doctor offers the example of a crown made for an emperor in order to win a pardon for some exiles , and he concludes his talk with these_words : '' In the same fashion , when we offer our prayers to God for the dead , even those_who_are sinners , we are not_just making a crown but instead are offering Christ who_was slaughtered for our sins , and thus begging the merciful God to take pity both on them and on ourselves . Augustine attests that_this custom of offering the '' sacrifice which ransomed us '' also_for the dead was observed in the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , and he mentions -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the universal Church observed this custom as something handed_down from the Fathers . The Universal Priesthood . But there_-isaia- something else that We would_like to add that -isaia-_very helpful in shedding light on the mystery of the Church ; We mean the fact that_the_whole Church plays the role of priest and victim along_with Christ , offering the Sacrifice of the Mass and itself completely offered in it . The Fathers of the Church taught this wondrous doctrine . A few years_ago Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , explained it . And only recently the Second Vatican Council reiterated it in its Constitution on the Church , in dealing_with the people of God . To be sure , the distinction between_the universal priesthood and the hierarchical priesthood -isaia- something essential and not_just a matter of degree , and it has to be maintained in a proper way . Yet We cannot help being filled_with an earnest desire to see this_teaching explained over and over until it takes deep root in the hearts of the faithful . For it -isaia- a most effective means of fostering devotion to the Eucharist , of extolling the dignity of all the faithful , and of spurring them on to reach the heights of sanctity , which means the total and generous offering of oneself to the service of the Divine Majesty . No Mass -isaia- '' Private '' . It -isaia-_also only fitting for us to recall_the conclusion that_can be drawn_from this about '' the public and social nature of each_and_every Mass . '' For each_and_every Mass -isaia- not something private , even if a priest celebrates it privately ; instead , it -isaia- an act of Christ and of the Church . In offering this sacrifice , the Church learns to offer herself as a sacrifice for all and she applies the unique and infinite redemptive power of the sacrifice of the Cross to the salvation of the whole_world . For every Mass that_-isaia- celebrated -isaia- being offered not_just for the salvation of certain people , but_also_for the salvation of the whole_world . The conclusion from this_-isaia- that even_though active participation by many faithful -isaia- of its_very nature particularly fitting when Mass -isaia- celebrated , still there_-isaia- no reason to criticize but_rather only to approve a Mass that a priest celebrates privately for a good_reason in accordance_with_the regulations and legitimate traditions of the Church , even_when only a server to make_the responses -isaia- present . For such a Mass brings a rich and abundant treasure of special graces to help the priest himself , the faithful , the whole Church and the whole_world toward salvation and this_same abundance of graces -isaia- not gained through mere reception of Holy Communion . And so , We recommend from a paternal and solicitous heart that priests , who constitute Our greatest joy and Our crown in the Lord , be mindful of the power they_have received_from_the bishop who ordained them the power of offering sacrifice to God and of celebrating Mass for the living and for the dead in the name of the Lord . We recommend that_they celebrate Mass daily in a worthy and devout fashion , so that they_themselves and the rest of the faithful may enjoy_the benefits that flow in such abundance from the Sacrifice of the Cross . In doing so , they_will also be making a great contribution toward_the salvation of mankind . CHRIST SACRAMENTALLY PRESENT IN THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS . The few things_that We have touched upon concerning the Sacrifice of the Mass encourage Us to say something about the Sacrament of the Eucharist , since both Sacrifice and Sacrament pertain to the same mystery and cannot be separated_from each_other . The Lord -isaia- immolated in an unbloody way in the Sacrifice of the Mass and He re presents the sacrifice of the Cross and applies its salvific power -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment when he becomes sacramentally present through the words of consecration as the spiritual food of the faithful , under the appearances of bread and wine . Various Ways in Which Christ -isaia- Present . All of us realize that_there_-isaia- more_than one way_in_which Christ -isaia- present in His Church . We want to go into this_very joyful subject , which_the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy presented briefly , -atti_degli_apostoli- somewhat greater length . Christ -isaia- present in His Church when_she prays , since He -isaia-_the_one who '' prays for us and prays in us and to whom we pray : He prays for us as our priest , He prays in us as our head , He -isaia- prayed to by us as our God '' ; and He -isaia-_the_one who_has promised , '' Where two or three are gathered together in my name , I -amos- there in the midst of them . '' He -isaia- present in the Church as she performs her works of mercy , not_just because whatever good we do to one of His least brethren we do to Christ Himself , but also_because Christ -isaia-_the_one who performs these works through the Church and who continually helps men with His divine_love . He -isaia- present in the Church as she moves along on her pilgrimage with a longing to reach the portals of eternal_life , for He -isaia-_the_one who dwells in our_hearts through_faith , and who instills charity in them through the Holy Spirit whom He gives to us . In still another very genuine way , He -isaia- present in the Church as she preaches , since_the Gospel which_she proclaims -isaia- the word of God , and it -isaia- only in the name of Christ , the Incarnate Word of God , and by His authority and with His help that_it_-isaia- preached , so that_there might be '' one flock resting secure in one shepherd . He -isaia- present in His Church as she rules and governs the People of God , since her sacred power comes_from Christ and since Christ , the '' Shepherd of Shepherds , '' -isaia- present in the bishops_who exercise that power , in keeping_with_the promise He made to the Apostles . Moreover , Christ -isaia- present in His Church in a still_more sublime manner as she offers the Sacrifice of the Mass in His name ; He -isaia- present in her as she administers the sacraments . On the matter of Christ s presence in the offering of the Sacrifice of the Mass , We would_like very much to call what St . John Chrysostom , overcome with awe , had to say in such accurate and eloquent words : '' I wish to add something_that -isaia- clearly awe inspiring , but do not be surprised or upset . What -isaia- this ? It -isaia-_the_same offering , no matter who offers it , be it Peter or Paul . It -isaia-_the_same one_that Christ gave to His disciples and the same one_that priests now perform : the latter -isaia- in no way inferior to the former , for it -isaia- not men_who sanctify the latter , but He who sanctified the former . For just as the words_which God spoke are the same as those_that the priest now pronounces , so too the offering -isaia-_the_same . '' No one_-isaia- unaware that the sacraments are the actions of Christ who administers them through men . And so the sacraments are holy in themselves and they pour grace into the soul by the power of Christ , when_they touch the body . The Highest Kind of Presence . These various_ways in which Christ -isaia- present fill the mind with astonishment and offer the Church a mystery for_her contemplation . But there_-isaia- another way_in_which Christ -isaia- present in His Church , a way_that surpasses all the others . It -isaia- His presence in the Sacrament of the Eucharist , which_-isaia- , for this_reason , '' a more consoling source of devotion , a lovelier object of contemplation and holier in what it contains '' than all the other sacraments ; for it contains Christ Himself and it -isaia- '' a kind of consummation of the spiritual_life , and in a sense the goal of all the sacraments . This presence -isaia- called '' real '' not to exclude the idea that the others are '' real '' too , but_rather to indicate presence par excellence , because_it_-isaia- substantial and through it Christ becomes present whole and entire , God and man . And so it would be wrong for anyone to try to explain this manner of presence by dreaming up a so called '' pneumatic '' nature of the glorious body of Christ that_would be present everywhere ; or for anyone to limit it to symbolism , as if this most_sacred Sacrament were to consist in nothing_more than an efficacious sign '' of the spiritual presence of Christ and of His intimate_union with the faithful , the members of His Mystical Body . '' The Proper Use of Symbolism . It -isaia- true_that the Fathers and Scholastics had a great deal to say about symbolism in the Eucharist , especially with_regard to the unity of the Church . The Council of Trent , in re stating their doctrine , taught that_our Saviour bequeathed the Eucharist to His Church '' as a symbol . of the unity and charity with_which He wished all Christians to be joined among_themselves , '' '' and hence as a symbol of that_one Body of which He -isaia- the Head . When Christian literature was still in its infancy , the unknown author of the work called the '' Didache or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles '' had this to write on the subject : '' As far as the Eucharist -isaia- concerned , give thanks in this manner : . just as this bread had_been broken and scattered over the hills and was_made one when it was gathered together , so too may your church be gathered into your kingdom from the ends of the earth . Cyprian too , in the course of laying stress on the Church s unity in opposition to schism , said this : '' Finally the Lord s sacrifices proclaim_the unity of Christians who are_bound together by a firm and unshakeable charity . For when_the Lord calls the bread that_has_been made from many grains of wheat His Body , He -isaia- describing our people whose unity He has sustained ; and when He refers to wine pressed from many grapes and berries as His Blood , once_again He -isaia- speaking of our flock which_has_been formed by fusing many into one . But before all of these , St . Paul had written to the Corinthians : '' The one bread makes us one_body , though we are_many in number ; the same bread -isaia- shared by all . '' Symbolism Inadequate to Express Real Presence . While Eucharistic symbolism -isaia- well suited to helping us understand_the effect that_-isaia- proper to this Sacrament the unity of the Mystical Body still it does_not indicate or explain what it -isaia- that makes this Sacrament different from all the others . For the constant teaching that the Catholic Church has passed on to her catechumens , the understanding of the Christian people , the doctrine defined by the Council of Trent , the very words that Christ used when He instituted the Most Holy Eucharist , all require us to profess that '' the Eucharist -isaia- the flesh of Our Savior Jesus Christ which suffered for our sins and which_the Father in His loving kindness raised again . Ignatius , we may well add those_which Theodore of Mopsuestia , who_-isaia- a faithful witness to the faith of the Church on this_point , addressed to the people : '' The Lord did_not say : This -isaia- symbol of my body , and this_-isaia- a symbol of my blood , but_rather : This -isaia- my body and my blood . He teaches us not to look to the nature of what lies before us and -isaia- perceived by the senses , because the giving of thanks and the words spoken over it have changed it into flesh and blood . The Council of Trent , basing itself on this faith of the Church , '' openly and sincerely professes that after_the consecration of the bread and wine , Our Lord Jesus Christ , true God and man , -isaia- really , truly and substantially contained in the Blessed Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist under the outward appearances of sensible things . '' And so Our Savior -isaia- present in His humanity not_only in His natural manner of existence -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father , but_also -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time in the sacrament of the Eucharist '' in a manner of existing that_we_can hardly express in words but_that our minds , illumined by faith , can come to see as possible to God and that we must most firmly believe . '' CHRIST PRESENT IN THE EUCHARIST THROUGH TRANSUBSTANTIATION . To avoid any misunderstanding of this type of presence , which goes beyond_the laws of nature and constitutes the greatest miracle of its kind , we have to listen with docility to the voice of the teaching and praying Church . Her voice , which constantly echoes the voice of Christ , assures us that the way_in_which Christ becomes present in this Sacrament -isaia- through the conversion of the whole substance of the bread into His body and of the whole substance of the wine into His blood , a unique and truly wonderful conversion that the Catholic Church fittingly and properly calls transubstantiation . As a result of transubstantiation , the species of bread and wine undoubtedly take on a new signification and a new finality , for they_are no longer ordinary bread and wine but instead a sign of something sacred and a sign of spiritual food ; but_they take on this_new signification , this_new finality , precisely_because they contain a new '' reality '' which we can rightly call ontological . For what now lies beneath the aforementioned species -isaia- not what_was there before , but something completely different ; and not_just in the estimation of Church belief but in reality , since once the substance or nature of the bread and wine has_been changed into the body_and_blood of Christ , nothing remains of the bread and the wine except for the species beneath which Christ -isaia- present whole and entire in His physical '' reality , '' corporeally present , although not in the manner in which bodies are in a place . Writings of the Fathers . This -isaia- why_the Fathers felt they_had a solemn duty to warn the faithful that , in reflecting upon this most_sacred Sacrament , they_should not pay attention to the senses , which report only the properties of bread and wine , but_rather to the words of Christ , which_have power great enough to change , transform , '' transelementize '' the bread and wine into His body_and_blood . As a matter of fact , as the same Fathers point_out on more_than one occasion , the power that does this -isaia-_the_same power of Almighty God that created the whole universe out of nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of time . '' Instructed as you_are in these_matters , '' says St . Cyril of Jerusalem , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of a sermon on the mysteries of the faith , '' and filled_with an unshakeable faith_that what seems to be bread -isaia- not bread though it tastes like it but_rather the Body of Christ ; and that_what seems to be wine -isaia- not wine even_though it too tastes like it but_rather the Blood of Christ . draw strength from receiving this bread as spiritual food and your soul will rejoice . John Chrysostom insists upon the same point with these_words : '' It -isaia- not man_who makes what_-isaia- put before him the Body and Blood of Christ , but Christ Himself who_was crucified for us . The priest standing there in the place of Christ says these_words , but their_power and grace are from God . This -isaia- my Body , he says , and these_words transform what lies before him . Cyril , the Bishop of Alexandria , -isaia- in wonderful harmony_with John , the Bishop of Constantinople , when he writes in his commentary on the Gospel of St . Matthew : '' He said This -isaia- my body and this_-isaia- my blood in a demonstrative fashion , so that_you might not judge that_what you see -isaia- a mere figure ; instead the offerings are truly changed by the hidden power of God Almighty into Christ s body_and_blood , which bring us the life_giving and sanctifying power of Christ when we share in them . Ambrose , the Bishop of Milan , in a clear statement on the Eucharistic conversion , has this to say : '' Let us be assured that_this_-isaia- not what nature formed but_what the blessing has consecrated ; and there_-isaia- greater power in the blessing and in nature , since nature itself_-isaia- changed through the blessing . '' To confirm the truth of this_mystery , he recounts many of the miracles described in the Sacred Scriptures , including Christ s birth of the Virgin Mary , and then he turns his mind to the work of creation , concluding this_way : '' Surely the word of Christ , who could make something_that did not_exist out of nothing , can change things_that do exist into something they_were not before . For it -isaia- no less extraordinary to give new natures to things than it -isaia- to change nature . '' Constant Teaching of the Popes and the Councils . But this_-isaia- no time for assembling a long list of evidence . Instead , We would rather recall_the firmness of faith and complete unanimity that the Church displayed in opposing Berengarius who gave in to certain difficulties raised by human reasoning and first dared to deny the Eucharistic conversion . More than_once she threatened to condemn him unless he retracted . Thus it was that Our predecessor , St . Gregory VII , commanded him to swear to the following oath : '' I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine that_are placed on the altar are , through the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer , substantially changed into the true and proper and lifegiving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord , and that after_the consecration they_are the true body of Christ which_was born of the Virgin and which hung on the Cross as an offering for the salvation of the world and the true blood of Christ which flowed from His side and not_just as a sign and by reason of the power of the sacrament , but in the very truth and reality of their substance and in what_-isaia- proper to their nature . We have a wonderful example of the stability of the Catholic faith in the way_in_which these_words meet with_such complete agreement in the constant teaching of the Ecumenical Councils of the Lateran , Constance , Florence and Trent on the mystery of the Eucharistic conversion , whether it be contained in their explanations of the teaching of the Church or in their condemnations of error . After the Council of Trent , Our predecessor , Pius VI , issued a serious warning , on the occasion of the errors of the Synod of Pistoia , that parish priests not neglect to speak of transubstantiation , which_-isaia- listed among the articles of the faith , in the course of carrying_out their office of teaching . Similarly , Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius XII , recalled the bounds beyond which those_who were carrying on subtle discussion of the mystery of transubstantiation might not pass ; and We Ourself , -atti_degli_apostoli- the National Eucharistic Congress that_was recently celebrated -atti_degli_apostoli- Pisa , bore open and solemn witness to the faith of the Church , in fulfillment of Our apostolic duty . Moreover , the Catholic Church has held firm to this belief in the presence of Christ s Body and Blood in the Eucharist not_only in her teaching but in her_life as well , since she_has -atti_degli_apostoli- all times paid this_great Sacrament the worship known as '' latria , '' which_may be given to God alone . Augustine says : '' It was in His flesh that Christ walked among us and it -isaia- His flesh that He has_given us to eat for our_salvation ; but no one eats of this flesh without having first adored it . and not_only do we not sin in thus adoring it , but we would be sinning if we did_not do so . '' ON THE WORSHIP OF LATRIA . The Catholic Church has_always displayed and still displays this latria that ought to be paid to the Sacrament of the Eucharist , both during Mass and outside of it , by taking the greatest possible care of consecrated Hosts , by exposing them to the solemn veneration of the faithful , and by carrying them about in processions to the joy of great numbers of the people . The ancient documents of the Church offer many evidences of this veneration . The bishops of the Church always urged the faithful to take the greatest possible care of the Eucharist that_they had in their homes . '' The Body of Christ -isaia- meant to be eaten by the faithful , not to be treated with irreverence , '' -isaia- the serious warning of St . In fact , the faithful regarded themselves as guilty , and rightly so as Origen recalls , if , after they_had received_the body of the Lord and kept it with all reverence and caution , some part of it were to fall to the ground through negligence . These same bishops were severe in reproving any lack of due reverence that might occur . We have evidence of this from the words of Novatian , whose testimony -isaia- trustworthy in this_matter ; He felt that anybody deserved to be condemned who '' came out after Sunday service bringing the Eucharist with_him , as was_the custom , . and carried the holy body of the Lord around with_him , '' going off to places of amusement instead of going home . Cyril of Alexandria denounced as mad the opinion that the Eucharist was of no use to sanctification if some of it were left over for another day . '' For Christ -isaia- not altered , '' he says , '' and His holy body -isaia- not changed ; instead the power and force and life_giving grace of the blessing remain in it forever . Nor should we forget_that in ancient times the faithful whether being harassed by violent persecutions or living in solitude out of love for monastic life nourished themselves even daily on the Eucharist , by receiving Holy Communion from their_own hands when there_was no priest or deacon present . We are_not saying this with any thought of effecting a change in the manner of keeping the Eucharist and of receiving Holy Communion that_has_been laid_down by subsequent ecclesiastical laws still in force ; Our intention -isaia- that_we_may rejoice over the faith of the Church which_-isaia- always one_and_the_same . Corpus Christi , Another Instance of Latria . This faith also gave rise to the feast of Corpus Christi , which_was first celebrated in the diocese of Liege especially through the efforts of the servant of God , Blessed Juliana of Mount Cornelius and Our predecessor , Urban IV , established for the universal Church . It has_also given rise to many forms of Eucharistic devotion that_have , through the inspiration of God s grace , grown with each passing day . Through them the Catholic Church -isaia- eagerly striving to pay honor to Christ and to thank Him for_such a great gift and to beg His mercy . EXHORTATION TO FOSTERING EUCHARISTIC DEVOTION . And so We beseech you , Venerable Brothers , to take this faith_,_which means nothing less_than maintaining complete fidelity to the words of Christ and the Apostles , and preserve it in its purity and integrity among the people entrusted_to_your care and vigilance , with all false and pernicious opinions being completely rejected ; and We beseech you to foster devotion to the Eucharist , which_should be the focal point and goal of all other_forms of devotion . May the faithful , thanks to your constant efforts , come to realize and experience more_and_more that : '' he who wants to live can_find here a place to live in and the means to live on . Let him approach , let_him believe , let_him be incorporated so that_he_may receive life . Let him not shy away from union with the members , let_him not be a rotten member that deserves to be cut away , nor a distorted member to be ashamed of : let_him be beautiful , let_him be fitting , let_him be healthy . Let him adhere to the body ; let_him live for God on God : let_him labor now upon earth , so that_he_may afterwards reign in heaven . '' Daily Mass and Holy Communion . It -isaia- desirable to have_the faithful in large numbers take an active part in the sacrifice of the Mass each_and_every day and receive the nourishment of Holy Communion with a pure and holy mind and offer fitting thanks to Christ the Lord for_such a great gift . They should remember these_words : '' The desire of Jesus Christ and of the Church to see all the faithful approach the sacred banquet each_and_every day -isaia- based on a wish to have them all united to God through the Sacrament and to have them draw from it the strength to master their passions , to wash away the lesser sins that_are committed every_day and to prevent the serious sins to which human frailty -isaia- subject . '' And they_should not forget about paying a visit during the day to the Most Blessed Sacrament in the very_special place of honor where it -isaia- reserved in churches in keeping_with_the liturgical laws , since this_-isaia- a proof of gratitude and a pledge of love and a display of the adoration that_-isaia- owed to Christ the Lord who_-isaia- present there . Dignity Bestowed by Eucharist . No one_can fail to see_that the divine Eucharist bestows an incomparable dignity upon the Christian people . For it -isaia- not_just while the Sacrifice -isaia- being offered and the Sacrament -isaia- being confected , but_also after_the Sacrifice has_been offered and the Sacrament confected while the Eucharist -isaia- reserved in churches or oratories that Christ -isaia- truly Emmanuel , which means '' God with us . '' For He -isaia- in the midst of us day and night ; He dwells in us with the fullness of grace and of truth . He raises the level of morals , fosters virtue , comforts the sorrowful , strengthens the weak and stirs up all those_who draw near to Him to imitate Him , so that_they_may learn from his example to be meek and humble of heart , and to seek not their_own interests but those of God . Anyone who_has a special devotion to the sacred Eucharist and who tries to repay Christ s infinite love for us with an eager and unselfish love of his_own , will experience and fully understand and this will_bring great delight and benefit to his_soul just how precious -isaia- a life hidden with Christ in God and just how worthwhile it -isaia- to carry on a conversation with Christ , for there_-isaia-_nothing more consoling here on earth , nothing_more efficacious for progress along the paths of holiness . You also realize , Venerable Brothers , that the Eucharist -isaia- reserved in churches or oratories to serve as the spiritual center of a religious community or a parish community , indeed of the whole Church and the whole of mankind , since it contains , beneath the veil of the species , Christ the invisible Head of the Church , the Redeemer of the world , the center of all hearts , '' by whom all things_are and by whom we exist . Hence it -isaia- that devotion to the divine Eucharist exerts a great influence upon the soul in the direction of fostering a '' social '' love , in which we put the common_good ahead of private good , take up the cause of the community , the parish , the universal Church , and extend our charity to the whole_world because we know that_there are members of Christ everywhere . A Sign and Cause of Unity . Because , Venerable Brothers , the Sacrament of the Eucharist -isaia- a sign and cause of the unity of Christ s Mystical Body , and because it stirs up an active '' ecclesial '' spirit in those_who_are more fervent in their Eucharistic devotion , never stop urging your faithful , as they approach the Mystery of the Eucharist , to learn to embrace the Church s cause as their_own , to pray to God without slackening , to offer themselves to God as an acceptable sacrifice for the peace and unity of the Church ; so that all the sons of the Church may be united and feel united and there_may be no divisions among_them but_rather unity of mind and intention , as the Apostle commands . May all those_who_are not_yet in perfect communion with the Catholic Church and who glory in the name of Christian despite their separation from her , come as soon as possible to share_with us , through the help of God s grace , in that_unity of faith and communion that Christ wanted to be the distinctive mark of His disciples . A Special Task for Religious . This zeal -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer and -atti_degli_apostoli- devoting oneself to God for the sake of the unity of the Church -isaia- something_that religious , both men_and_women , should regard as very specially their_own since_they are_bound in a special_way to adoration of the Blessed Sacrament , and they_have , by virtue of the vows they_have pronounced , become a kind of crown set around it here on earth . The Tridentine Decree . The Church in the past has felt and still feels that nothing_-isaia- more ancient and more pleasing than the desire_for the unity of all Christians , and We want to express this in the very same words that the Council of Trent used to conclude its decree on the Most Holy Eucharist : '' In conclusion , the Council with paternal love admonishes , exhorts , begs and implores through the merciful kindness of our God that each_and_every Christian may come -atti_degli_apostoli- last to full agreement in this sign of unity , in this bond of charity , in this symbol of harmony ; that_they_may be mindful of the great dignity and the profound love of Our Lord Jesus Christ , who gave up His precious life as the price of our_salvation and who gave us His flesh to eat ; and that_they_may believe and adore these sacred mysteries of His body_and_blood with_such firm and unwavering faith , with_such devotion and piety and veneration that_they_will be able to receive that supersubstantial bread often and it will truly be the life of their_souls and the unfailing strength of their_minds , so that fortified by its vigor , they may_be_able to move on from this wretched earthly pilgrimage to their heavenly home where , without_any veil , they_will eat the bread of angels that_they now eat beneath the sacred veils . May the all merciful Redeemer , who shortly before His death prayed to the Father that all who_were to believe in Him might be one , just as He and the Father are_one , deign to hear this_most ardent prayer of Ours and of the whole Church as quickly as possible , so that_we_may all celebrate the Eucharistic Mystery with one voice and one faith , and through sharing in the Body of Christ become one_body , joined together by the same bonds that Christ wanted it to have . A Word to the Eastern Churches . We also want to address with fraternal affection those_who belong to the venerable Churches of the East , which_have had so many glorious Fathers whose testimony to belief in the Eucharist We have_been so glad to cite in this present letter of Ours . Our soul -isaia- filled_with great joy as We contemplate your belief in the Eucharist , which_-isaia- ours as well , as we listen to the liturgical prayers you use to celebrate this_great mystery , as we behold your Eucharistic devotion , as we read your theological works explaining or defending the doctrine of this most_sacred Sacrament . May the most blessed Virgin Mary , from whom Christ the Lord took the flesh that '' -isaia- contained , offered , received '' in this Sacrament under the appearances of bread and wine , and may all the saints of God and especially_those who_were more inflamed with ardent devotion toward_the divine Eucharist , intercede with the Father of mercies so that_this common belief in the Eucharist and devotion to it may give rise among all Christians to a perfect unity of communion that will_continue to flourish . Lingering in Our mind are the words of the holy martyr Ignatius warning the Philadelphians against the evil of divisions and schisms , the remedy for which_-isaia- to be found in the Eucharist . '' Strive then , '' he says , '' to make_use of one single thanksgiving . For there_-isaia- only_one flesh of Our Lord Jesus Christ , and only_one chalice unto the union of His blood , only_one altar , only_one bishop . Fortified by the most consoling hope of blessings that_will accrue to the whole Church and to the whole_world from an increase in devotion to the Eucharist , as a pledge of heavenly blessings We lovingly impart Our apostolic blessings to you , Venerable Brothers , and to the priests , religious and all who_are helping you , as well as to all the faithful entrusted_to_your care .

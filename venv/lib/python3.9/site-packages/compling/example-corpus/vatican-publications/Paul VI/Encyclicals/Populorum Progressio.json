Honored Brothers and Dear Sons , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The progressive development of peoples -isaia- an object of deep interest and concern to the Church . This -isaia- particularly true in the case of those peoples who_are trying to escape the ravages of hunger , poverty , endemic disease and ignorance ; of those_who_are seeking a larger share in the benefits of civilization and a more active improvement of their human qualities ; of those_who_are consciously striving for fuller growth . The Church s Concern With an even clearer awareness , since_the Second Vatican Council , of the demands imposed by Christ s Gospel in this area , the Church judges it her duty to help all men explore this serious problem in all its dimensions , and to impress upon them the need_for concerted action -atti_degli_apostoli- this critical juncture . Our recent predecessors did not_fail to do their_duty in this area . Their noteworthy messages shed the light of the Gospel on contemporary social questions . There was Leo XIII s encyclical Rerum Novarum , Pius XI s encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , Pius XII s radio message to the world , and John XXIII s two encyclicals , Mater et Magistra and Pacem in Terris . A Problem for All Men . Today it -isaia- most important_for people to understand and appreciate that the social_question ties all men together , in every part_of_the_world . John XXIII stated this clearly , and Vatican II confirmed it in its Pastoral Constitution on The Church in the World of Today . The seriousness and urgency of these teachings must be recognized without delay . The hungry nations of the world cry out to the peoples blessed with abundance . And the Church , cut to the quick by this cry , asks each_and_every man to hear his_brother s plea and answer it lovingly . Before We became pope , We traveled to Latin America and Africa . There We saw the perplexing problems that vex and besiege these continents , which_are otherwise full of life and promise . On being elected pope , We became the father of all men . We made trips to Palestine and India , gaining first hand knowledge of the difficulties that_these age old civilizations must face in their struggle for further development . Before the close of the Second Vatican Council , providential circumstances allowed Vs to address the United Nations and to plead the case of the impoverished nations before that distinguished assembly . Justice and Peace . Even more recently , We sought to fulfill the wishes of the Council and to demonstrate the Holy See s concern_for the developing nations . To do this , We felt it was necessary to add another pontifical commission to the Church s central administration . The purpose of this commission -isaia- '' to awaken in the People of God full awareness of their_mission today . In this_way they_can further the progress of poorer nations and international social_justice , as well as help less developed nations to contribute to their_own development . '' The name of this commission , Justice and Peace , aptly describes its program and its goal . We are sure_that all men_of_good will want to join Our fellow Catholics and fellow Christians in carrying_out this program . So today We earnestly urge all men to pool their ideas and their activities for_man s complete development and the development of all mankind . MAN S COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT . Today we see men trying to secure a sure food supply , cures for diseases , and steady employment . We see them trying to eliminate every ill , to remove every obstacle which offends man s dignity . They are continually striving to exercise greater personal responsibility ; to do more , learn more , and have more so that they_might increase their_personal worth . And yet , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a large number of them live amid conditions which frustrate these legitimate desires . Moreover , those nations which_have recently gained independence find that political freedom -isaia-_not_enough . They must_also acquire the social_and_economic structures and processes that accord with_man s nature and activity , if their citizens are to achieve personal growth and if their_country -isaia- to take its rightful place in the international community . Though insufficient for the immensity and urgency of the task , the means inherited from the past are_not totally useless . It -isaia- true_that colonizing nations were sometimes concerned_with nothing save their_own interests , their_own power and their_own prestige ; their departure left the economy of these countries in precarious imbalance the one crop economy , for example , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of sudden , wide ranging fluctuations in market prices . Certain types of colonialism surely caused harm and paved the way_for further troubles . On the other_hand , we must_also reserve a word of praise for those colonizers whose skills and technical know_how brought benefits to many untamed lands , and whose work survives to this_day . The structural machinery they introduced was_not fully developed or perfected , but it did help to reduce ignorance and disease , to promote communication , and to improve living conditions . The Widening Gap . Granted all this , it -isaia- only too clear_that these structures are no match for the harsh economic realities of today . Unless the existing machinery -isaia- modified , the disparity between rich and poor nations will increase rather_than diminish ; the rich nations are progressing with rapid strides while the poor nations move forward -atti_degli_apostoli- a slow pace . The imbalance grows with each passing day : while some nations produce a food surplus , other nations are in desperate need of food or are unsure of their export market . Signs of Social Unrest . At the same_time , social unrest has gradually spread throughout_the_world . The acute restlessness engulfing the poorer classes in countries that_are now being industrialized has spread to other regions where agriculture -isaia- the mainstay of the economy . The farmer -isaia- painfully aware of his '' wretched lot . '' Then there_are the flagrant inequalities not merely in the enjoyment of possessions , but even_more in the exercise of power . In certain regions a privileged minority enjoys the refinements of life , while the rest of the inhabitants , impoverished and disunited , '' are deprived of almost all possibility of acting on their_own initiative and responsibility , and often subsist in living and working conditions unworthy of the human_person . Moreover , traditional culture comes into conflict with the advanced techniques of modern industrialization ; social structures out of tune with today s demands are threatened with extinction . For the older generation , the rigid structures of traditional culture are the necessary mainstay of one s personal and family_life ; they_cannot be abandoned . The younger generation , on the other_hand , regards them as useless obstacles , and rejects them to embrace new_forms of societal life . The conflict between generations leads to a tragic dilemma : either to preserve traditional beliefs and structures and reject social progress ; or to embrace foreign technology and foreign culture , and reject ancestral traditions with_their wealth of humanism . The sad fact -isaia- that we often see the older moral , spiritual and religious values give way without finding any place in the new scheme of things . In such troubled times some people_are strongly tempted by the alluring but deceitful promises of would be saviors . Who does_not see the concomitant dangers : public upheavals , civil insurrection , the drift toward totalitarian ideologies ? These are the realities of the question under study here , and their gravity must surely be apparent to everyone . The Church and Development . True to the teaching and example of her_divine Founder , who cited the preaching of the Gospel to the poor as a sign of His mission , the Church has_never failed to foster the human progress of the nations to which_she brings faith in Christ . Besides erecting sacred edifices , her missionaries have_also promoted construction of hospitals , sanitariums , schools and universities . By teaching the native population how to take full advantage of natural resources , the missionaries often protected them_from the greed of foreigners . We would certainly admit that_this work was sometimes far from perfect , since it was_the work of men . The missionaries sometimes intermingled the thought patterns and behavior patterns of their native land with the authentic message of Christ . Yet , for all this , they did protect and promote indigenous institutions ; and many of them pioneered in promoting the country s material and cultural progress . We need only mention the efforts of Pere Charles de Foucauld : he compiled a valuable dictionary of the Tuareg language , and his charity won him the title , '' everyone s brother . '' So We deem it fitting to praise those oft forgotten pioneers who_were motivated by love for Christ , just as We honor their imitators and successors who today continue to put themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the generous and unselfish service of those_to_whom they preach the Gospel . The Present Need . In the present_day , however , individual and group effort within these countries -isaia-_no_longer enough . The world situation requires the concerted effort of everyone , a thorough examination of every facet of the problem social , economic , cultural and spiritual . The Church , which_has long experience in human affairs and has no desire to be involved in the political activities of any nation , '' seeks but_one goal : to carry forward the work of Christ under the lead of the befriending Spirit . And Christ entered this_world to give witness to the truth ; to save , not to judge ; to serve , not to be served . '' Founded to build the kingdom_of_heaven on earth rather_than to acquire temporal power , the Church openly avows that the two powers Church and State are distinct from one_another ; that_each -isaia- supreme in its_own sphere of competency . But since_the Church does dwell among_men , she_has the duty '' of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel . '' Sharing the noblest aspirations of men and suffering when_she sees these aspirations not satisfied , she wishes to help_them attain their full realization . So she offers man her distinctive contribution : a global perspective on man and human realities . The development We speak of here cannot be restricted to economic growth alone . To be authentic , it must be well rounded ; it must foster the development of each man and of the whole man . As an eminent specialist on this_question has rightly said : '' We cannot allow economics to be separated_from human realities , nor development from the civilization in which it takes_place . What counts for us -isaia-_man each_individual man , each human group , and humanity as a whole . In God s plan , every man_-isaia- born to seek self fulfillment , for every_human life_-isaia- called to some task by God . At birth a human_being possesses certain aptitudes and abilities in germinal form , and these qualities are to be cultivated so that_they_may bear_fruit . By developing these traits through formal education of personal effort , the individual works his way toward_the goal set for him by the Creator . Endowed with intellect and free will , each man_-isaia- responsible_for his self fulfillment even as he -isaia- for his salvation . He -isaia- helped , and sometimes hindered , by his teachers and those around him ; yet whatever be the outside influences exerted on him , he -isaia- the chief architect of his_own success or failure . Utilizing only his talent and willpower , each man can grow in humanity , enhance his personal worth , and perfect himself . Man s Supernatural Destiny . Self development , however , -isaia- not left up to man s option . Just as the whole of creation -isaia- ordered toward its Creator , so too the rational creature should of his_own accord direct his_life to God , the first truth and the highest good . Thus human self fulfillment may be said to sum up our obligations . Moreover , this harmonious integration of our human_nature , carried through by personal effort and responsible activity , -isaia- destined for a higher state of perfection . United with the life_giving Christ , man s life_-isaia- newly enhanced ; it acquires a transcendent humanism which surpasses its_nature and bestows new fullness of life . This -isaia- the highest goal of human self fulfillment . Ties With All Men . Each man -isaia-_also a member of society ; hence he belongs to the community of man . It -isaia- not_just certain individuals but all men_who are_called to further the development of human_society as a whole . Civilizations spring up , flourish and die . As the waves of the sea gradually creep farther and farther in along the shoreline , so the human_race inches its way forward through history . We are the heirs of earlier generations , and we reap benefits from the efforts of our contemporaries ; we are under obligation to all men . Therefore we cannot disregard the welfare of those_who will come after us to increase the human_family . The reality of human solidarity brings us not_only benefits but_also obligations . Development in Proper Perspective . Man s personal and collective fulfillment could be jeopardized if the proper scale of values were_not maintained . The pursuit of life s necessities -isaia- quite legitimate ; hence we are duty bound to do the work_which enables us to obtain them : '' If anyone -isaia- unwilling to work , do not let_him eat . '' l But the acquisition of worldly goods can lead men to greed , to the unrelenting desire_for more , to the pursuit of greater personal power . Rich and poor alike be they individuals , families or nations can fall prey to avarice and soulstifling materialism . Neither individuals nor nations should regard the possession of more_and_more goods as the ultimate objective . Every kind of progress -isaia- a two edged sword . It -isaia- necessary if man_-isaia- to grow as a human_being ; yet it can_also enslave him , if he comes to regard it as the supreme good and cannot look beyond it . When this happens , men harden their_hearts , shut out others from their_minds and gather together solely for reasons of self interest rather_than out of friendship ; dissension and disunity follow soon after . Thus the exclusive pursuit of material possessions prevents man s growth as a human_being and stands in opposition to his true grandeur . Avarice , in individuals and in nations , -isaia-_the_most obvious form of stultified moral development . A New Humanism Needed . If development calls for an ever growing number of technical experts , even_more necessary still -isaia- the deep thought and reflection of wise men in search of a new humanism , one_which will_enable our contemporaries to enjoy_the higher values of love and friendship , of prayer and contemplation , and thus find_themselves . This -isaia- what will guarantee man s authentic development his transition from less_than human conditions to truly human ones . The Scale of Values . What are less_than human conditions ? The material poverty of those_who lack the bare necessities of life , and the moral poverty of those_who_are crushed under the weight of their_own self love ; oppressive political structures resulting from the abuse of ownership or the improper exercise of power , from the exploitation of the worker or unjust transactions . What are truly human conditions ? The rise from poverty to the acquisition of life s necessities ; the elimination of social ills ; broadening the horizons of knowledge ; acquiring refinement and culture . From there one_can go on to acquire a growing awareness of other people s dignity , a taste for the spirit of poverty , l an active interest in the common_good , and a desire_for peace . Then man can acknowledge_the highest values and God Himself , their author and end . Finally and above all , there_-isaia- faith God s gift to men_of_good will and our loving unity in Christ , who calls all men to share God s life as sons of the living God , the Father of all men . Issues and Principles . In the very first pages of Scripture we read these_words : '' Fill the earth and subdue it . '' This teaches us that_the_whole of creation -isaia- for_man , that_he_has been charged to give it meaning by his intelligent activity , to complete and perfect it by his_own efforts and to his_own advantage . Now if the earth truly was created to provide man with the necessities of life and the tools for his_own progress , it follows_that every man_has the right to glean what he needs from the earth . The recent Council reiterated this_truth : '' God intended the earth and everything in it for the use of all human_beings and peoples . Thus , under the leadership of justice and in the company of charity , created goods should flow fairly to all . '' All other rights , whatever they_may be , including the rights of property and free trade , are to be subordinated to this principle . They should in no way hinder it ; in fact , they_should actively facilitate its implementation . Redirecting these rights back to their original purpose must be regarded as an important and urgent social duty . The Use of Private Property . '' He who_has the goods of this_world and sees his_brother in need and closes his_heart to him , how does the love of God abide in him ? '' Everyone knows that the Fathers of the Church laid_down the duty of the rich toward_the poor in no uncertain terms . Ambrose put it : '' You are_not making a gift of what_-isaia- yours to the poor man , but you_are giving him back what_-isaia- his . You have_been appropriating things_that_are meant to be for the common use of everyone . The earth belongs to everyone , not to the rich . '' These words indicate that the right to private_property -isaia- not absolute and unconditional . No one may appropriate surplus goods solely for his_own private use when others lack the bare necessities of life . In short , '' as the Fathers of the Church and other eminent theologians tell us , the right of private_property may never be exercised to the detriment of the common_good . '' When '' private gain and basic community needs conflict with one_another , '' it -isaia- for the public_authorities '' to seek a solution to these questions , with the active involvement of individual citizens and social groups . '' The Common Good . If certain landed estates impede the general prosperity because_they_are extensive , unused or poorly used , or because_they bring hardship to peoples or are detrimental to the interests of the country , the common_good sometimes demands their expropriation . Vatican II affirms this emphatically . At the same_time it clearly teaches_that income thus derived -isaia- not for_man s capricious use , and that the exclusive pursuit of personal gain -isaia- prohibited . Consequently , it -isaia- not permissible for citizens who_have garnered sizeable income from the resources and activities of their_own nation to deposit a large portion of their income in foreign countries for the sake of their_own private gain alone , taking no account of their_country s interests ; in doing this , they clearly wrong their_country . The Value of Industrialization . The introduction of industrialization , which_-isaia- necessary_for economic growth and human progress , -isaia- both a sign of development and a spur to it . By dint of intelligent thought and hard work , man gradually uncovers the hidden laws of nature and learns to make better use of natural resources . As he takes control over his way_of_life , he -isaia- stimulated to undertake new investigations and fresh discoveries , to take prudent risks and launch new ventures , to act responsibly and give of himself unselfishly . However , certain concepts have somehow arisen out of these new conditions and insinuated themselves into the fabric of human_society . These concepts present profit as the chief spur to economic progress , free competition as the guiding norm of economics , and private ownership of the means_of_production as an absolute right , having no limits nor concomitant social obligations This unbridled liberalism paves the way_for a particular type of tyranny , rightly condemned by Our predecessor Pius XI , for it results in the '' international imperialism of money . '' Such improper manipulations of economic forces can_never be condemned enough ; let it be said once_again that economics -isaia- supposed to be in the service of man . But if it -isaia- true_that a type of capitalism , as it -isaia- commonly called , has_given rise to hardships , unjust practices , and fratricidal conflicts that persist to this_day , it would be a mistake to attribute these evils to the rise of industrialization itself , for they really derive from the pernicious economic concepts that grew up along_with it . We must in all fairness acknowledge_the vital role played by labor systemization and industrial organization in the task of development . The concept of work can turn into an exaggerated mystique . Yet , for all that , it -isaia- something willed and approved by God . Fashioned in the image of his Creator , '' man must cooperate with Him in completing the work of creation and engraving on the earth the spiritual imprint which he himself has_received . '' God gave man intelligence , sensitivity and the power of thought tools with_which to finish and perfect the work He began . Every worker -isaia- , to some extent , a creator be he artist , craftsman , executive , laborer or farmer . Bent over a material that resists his efforts , the worker leaves his imprint on it , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time developing his_own powers of persistence , inventiveness and concentration . Further , when work_-isaia- done in common when hope , hardship , ambition and joy are shared it brings together and firmly unites the wills , minds and hearts of men . In its accomplishment , men find_themselves to be brothers . Dangers and Ideals . Work , too , has a double edge . Since it promises money , pleasure and power , it stirs up selfishness in some and incites other to revolt . On the other_hand , it also fosters a professional outlook , a sense of duty , and love of neighbor . Even though it -isaia-_now being organized more scientifically and efficiently , it still can threaten man s dignity and enslave him ; for work_-isaia- human only if it results from man s use of intellect and free will . Our predecessor John XXIII stressed the urgent_need of restoring dignity to the worker and making him a real partner in the common task : '' Every effort must be made to ensure_that the enterprise -isaia- indeed a true human community , concerned about the needs , the activities and the standing of each of its_members . '' Considered from a Christian point_of_view , work has an even loftier connotation . It -isaia-_directed to the establishment of a supernatural order here on earth , a task that_will not be completed until we all unite to form that perfect manhood of which St . Paul speaks , '' the mature measure of the fullness of Christ . '' Balanced Progress Required . We must make haste . Too many_people are suffering . While some make progress , others stand still or move backwards ; and the gap between_them -isaia- widening . However , the work must proceed in measured steps if the proper equilibrium -isaia- to be maintained . Makeshift agrarian reforms may fall short of their goal . Hasty industrialization can undermine vital institutions and produce social evils , causing a setback to true human values . Reform , Not Revolution . The injustice of certain situations cries out for God s attention . Lacking the bare necessities of life , whole nations are under the thumb of others ; they_cannot act on their_own initiative ; they_cannot exercise personal responsibility ; they_cannot work toward a higher degree of cultural refinement or a greater participation in social and public_life . They are sorely tempted to redress these insults to their human_nature by violent means . Everyone knows , however_,_that revolutionary uprisings except where there_-isaia- manifest , longstanding tyranny which_would do great damage to fundamental personal rights and dangerous harm to the common_good of the country engender new injustices , introduce new inequities and bring new disasters . The evil situation that exists , and it surely -isaia- evil , may_not be dealt_with in such_a_way_that an even worse situation results . A Task for Everyone . We want to be clearly understood on this_point : The present state of affairs must be confronted boldly , and its concomitant injustices must be challenged and overcome . Continuing development calls for bold innovations that_will work profound changes . The critical state of affairs must be corrected for the better without delay . Everyone must lend a ready hand to this_task , particularly those_who can do most by reason of their education , their office , or their authority . They should set a good example by contributing part of their_own goods , as several of Our brother bishops have_done . In this_way they_will be responsive to men s longings and faithful to the Holy Spirit , because '' the ferment of the Gospel , too , has aroused and continues to arouse in man s heart_the irresistible requirements of his dignity . Programs and Planning . Individual initiative alone and the interplay of competition will_not ensure satisfactory development . We cannot proceed to increase the wealth and power of the rich while we entrench the needy in their poverty and add to the woes of the oppressed . Organized programs are necessary_for '' directing , stimulating , coordinating , supplying and integrating '' the work of individuals and intermediary organizations . It -isaia- for the public_authorities to establish and lay_down the desired goals , the plans to be followed , and the methods to be used in fulfilling them ; and it -isaia-_also their task to stimulate the efforts of those involved in this common activity . But they must_also see_to_it_that private initiative and intermediary organizations are involved in this_work . In this_way they_will avoid total collectivization and the dangers of a planned economy which might threaten human liberty and obstruct the exercise of man s basic human_rights . The Ultimate Purpose . Organized programs designed to increase productivity should_have but_one aim : to serve human_nature . They should reduce inequities , eliminate discrimination , free men from the bonds of servitude , and thus give_them the capacity , in the sphere of temporal realities , to improve their lot , to further their moral growth and to develop their_spiritual endowments . When we speak of development , we should mean social progress as well as economic growth . It -isaia-_not_enough to increase the general fund of wealth and then distribute it more fairly . It -isaia-_not_enough to develop technology so that the earth may_become a more suitable living place_for human_beings . The mistakes of those_who led the way should help those now on the road to development to avoid certain dangers . The reign of technology technocracy , as it -isaia- called can cause as much harm to the world of tomorrow as liberalism did to the world of yesteryear . Economics and technology are meaningless if they_do_not benefit man , for it -isaia- he they_are to serve . Man -isaia- truly human only if he -isaia- the master of his_own actions and the judge of their worth , only if he -isaia- the architect of his_own progress . He must act according_to_his God given nature , freely accepting its potentials and its claims upon him . We can even say that economic growth -isaia- dependent on social progress , the goal to which it aspires ; and that basic education -isaia-_the_first objective for_any nation seeking to develop itself . Lack of education -isaia- as serious as lack of food ; the illiterate -isaia- a starved spirit . When someone learns how to read and write , he -isaia- equipped to do a job and to shoulder a profession , to develop self confidence and realize_that he can progress along with_others . As We said in Our message to the UNESCO meeting -atti_degli_apostoli- Teheran , literacy -isaia- the '' first and most basic tool for personal enrichment and social integration ; and it -isaia- society s most valuable tool for furthering development and economic progress . '' We also rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- the good work accomplished in this_field by private initiative , by the public_authorities , and by international organizations . These are the primary agents of development , because_they enable man to act for_himself . Role of the Family . Man -isaia- not really himself , however , except within_the framework of society and there the family plays the basic and most important role . The family s influence may have_been excessive -atti_degli_apostoli- some periods of history and in some places , to the extent_that it was exercised to the detriment of the fundamental rights of the individual . Yet time honored social frameworks , proper to the developing nations , are_still necessary_for awhile , even as their excessive strictures are gradually relaxed . The natural family , stable and monogamous as fashioned by God and sanctified by Christianity '' in which different generations live together , helping each_other to acquire greater wisdom and to harmonize personal rights with_other social needs , -isaia- the basis of society '' Population Growth . There -isaia- no denying that the accelerated rate of population growth brings many added difficulties to the problems of development where_the size of the population grows more rapidly than the quantity of available resources to such a degree that things seem to have reached an impasse . In such circumstances people_are inclined to apply drastic remedies to reduce the birth rate . There -isaia- no doubt_that public_authorities can intervene in this_matter , within_the bounds of their competence . They can instruct citizens on this_subject and adopt appropriate measures , so long as these_are in conformity_with_the dictates of the moral_law and the rightful freedom of married_couples -isaia- preserved completely intact . When the inalienable right of marriage and of procreation -isaia- taken away , so -isaia- human_dignity . Finally , it -isaia- for parents to take a thorough look -atti_degli_apostoli- the matter and decide upon the number of their_children . This -isaia- an obligation they take upon themselves , before their_children already born , and before the community to which_they belong following the dictates of their_own consciences informed by God s law authentically interpreted , and bolstered by their trust in Him . In the task of development man finds the family to be the first and most basic social structure ; but he -isaia-_often helped by professional organizations . While such organizations are founded to aid and assist their members , they bear a heavy responsibility_for the task of education which_they can and must carry_out . In training and developing individual men , they do much to cultivate in them an awareness of the common_good and of its demands upon all . Every form of social action involves some doctrine ; and the Christian rejects that_which_-isaia- based on a materialistic and atheistic philosophy , namely one_which shows no respect_for a religious outlook on life , for freedom or human_dignity . So long as these higher values are preserved intact , however , the existence of a variety of professional organizations and trade unions -isaia- permissible . Variety may even help to preserve freedom and create friendly rivalry . We gladly commend those people_who unselfishly serve their_brothers by working in such organizations . Cultural institutions also do a great deal to further the work of development . Their important role was stressed by the Council : '' . the future of the world stands in peril unless wiser men_are forthcoming . It should_also be pointed_out that_many nations , poorer in economic goods , are quite rich in wisdom and can_offer noteworthy advantages to others . '' Every country , rich or poor , has a cultural tradition handed_down from past generations . This tradition includes institutions required by life in the world , and higher manifestations artistic , intellectual and religious of the life of the spirit . When the latter embody truly human values , it would be a great mistake to sacrifice them_for the sake of the former . Any group of people_who would consent to let this happen , would be giving up the better portion of their heritage ; in order to live , they_would be giving up their reason_for living . Christ s question -isaia-_directed to nations also : '' What does it profit a man , if he gain the whole_world but suffer the loss of his_own soul ? '' Avoiding Past Temptations . The poorer nations can_never be too much on guard against the temptation posed by the wealthier nations . For these nations , with_their favorable results from a highly technical and culturally developed civilization , provide an example of work and diligence with temporal prosperity the main pursuit . Not that temporal prosperity of itself precludes the activity of the human spirit . Indeed , with it , '' the human spirit , being less subjected to material things , can be more_easily drawn to the worship and contemplation of the Creator . '' On the other_hand , '' modern civilization itself often complicates the approach to God , not for_any essential reason , but because_it_-isaia- so much engrossed in worldly affairs . '' The developing nations must choose wisely from among the things_that_are offered to them . They must test and reject false values that_would tarnish a truly human way_of_life , while accepting noble and useful values in order to develop them in their_own distinctive way , along_with their_own indigenous heritage . A Full Bodied Humanism . The ultimate goal -isaia- a full bodied humanism . And does this not_mean the fulfillment of the whole man and of every man ? A narrow humanism , closed in on itself and not open to the values of the spirit and to God who_-isaia- their source , could achieve apparent success , for_man can set about organizing terrestrial realities without God . But '' closed off from God , they_will end up being directed against man . A humanism closed off from other realities becomes inhuman . '' True humanism points the way toward God and acknowledges the task to which_we_are called , the task which offers us the real meaning of human_life . Man -isaia- not the ultimate measure of man . Man becomes truly man only by passing beyond himself . In the words of Pascal : '' Man infinitely surpasses man . THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND . Development of the individual necessarily entails a joint effort for the development of the human_race as a whole . At Bombay We said : '' Man must meet man , nation must meet nation , as brothers_and_sisters , as children of God . In this mutual understanding and friendship , in this sacred communion , we must_also begin to work together to build the common future of the human_race . '' We also urge men to explore concrete and practicable ways of organizing and coordinating their_efforts , so that available resources might be shared with_others ; in this_way genuine bonds between nations might be forged . Three Major Duties . This duty concerns first_and_foremost the wealthier nations . Their obligations stem from the human and supernatural brotherhood of man , and present a three fold obligation : mutual solidarity the aid that the richer nations must give to developing nations ; social_justice the rectification of trade relations_between strong and weak nations ; universal charity the effort to build a more humane world community , where all can_give and receive , and where_the progress of some -isaia- not bought -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of others . The matter -isaia- urgent , for on it depends the future of world civilization . Aid to Developing Nations . '' If a brother or a sister be naked and in want of daily food , '' says St . James , '' and one of you say to them , Go in peace , be warm and filled , yet you do not give_them what_-isaia- necessary_for the body , what does it profit ? '' Today no one_can be unaware of the fact_that on some continents countless men_and_women are ravished by hunger and countless children are undernourished . Many children die -atti_degli_apostoli- an early age ; many more of them find_their physical and mental growth retarded . Thus whole populations are immersed in pitiable circumstances and lose heart . Anxious appeals for help have already_been voiced . That of Our predecessor John XXIII was warmly received . We reiterated his sentiments in Our Christmas message of , and again in on behalf of India . The work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO has_been encouraged by the Holy See and has found generous support . Our own organization , Caritas Internationalis , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work all over the world . Many Catholics , -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of Our brother bishops , have contributed unstintingly to the assistance of the needy and have gradually widened the circle of those they call neighbors . A World of Free Men . But these efforts , as well as public_and_private allocations of gifts , loans and investments , are not_enough . It -isaia- not_just a question of eliminating hunger and reducing poverty . It -isaia- not_just a question of fighting wretched conditions , though this_-isaia- an urgent and necessary task . It involves building a human community where men can live truly human lives , free_from discrimination on account of race , religion or nationality , free_from servitude to other men or to natural forces which they_cannot yet control satisfactorily . It involves building a human community where liberty -isaia- not an idle word , where_the needy Lazarus can sit down with the rich man -atti_degli_apostoli- the same banquet table . On the part of the rich man , it calls for great generosity , willing sacrifice and diligent effort . Each man must examine his conscience , which sounds a new call in our present times . Is he prepared to support , -atti_degli_apostoli- his_own expense , projects and undertakings designed to help the needy ? Is he prepared to pay higher taxes so that public_authorities may expand their_efforts in the work of development ? Is he prepared to pay more for imported goods , so that the foreign producer may make a fairer profit ? Is he prepared to emigrate from his homeland if necessary and if he -isaia- young , in order to help the emerging nations ? A National Duty . The duty of promoting human solidarity also falls upon the shoulders of nations : '' It -isaia- a very_important duty of the advanced nations to help the developing nations . '' This conciliar teaching must be implemented . While it -isaia- proper that a nation be the first to enjoy_the God given fruits of its_own labor , no nation may dare to hoard its riches for its_own use alone . Each and every nation must produce more and better goods and products , so that all its citizens may live truly human lives and so that_it_may contribute to the common development of the human_race . Considering the mounting indigence of less developed countries , it -isaia- only fitting_that a prosperous nation set_aside some of the goods it has produced in order to alleviate their needs ; and that it train educators , engineers , technicians and scholars who_will contribute their knowledge and their skill to these less fortunate countries . We must repeat that the superfluous goods of wealthier nations ought to be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of poorer nations . The rule , by virtue of which in times past those nearest us were to be helped in time of need , applies today to all the needy throughout_the_world . And the prospering peoples will be the first to benefit from this . Continuing avarice on their_part will arouse the judgment of God and the wrath of the poor , with consequences no one_can foresee . If prosperous nations continue to be jealous of their_own advantage alone , they_will jeopardize their highest values , sacrificing the pursuit of excellence to the acquisition of possessions . We might well apply to them the parable of the rich man . His fields yielded an abundant harvest and he did not_know where to store it : '' But God said to him , Fool , this_very night your soul will be demanded from you . If these efforts are to be successful , they_cannot be disparate and disorganized ; nor_should they vie with one_another for the sake of power or prestige . The times call_for coordinated planning of projects and programs , which_are much more_effective than occasional efforts promoted by individual goodwill . As We said above , studies must be made , goals must be defined , methods and means must be chosen , and the work of select men must be coordinated ; only then will present needs be met and future demands anticipated . Moreover , such planned programs do more_than promote economic_and_social progress . They give force and meaning to the work undertaken , put due order into human_life , and thus enhance man s dignity and his capabilities . A further step must_be_taken . When We were -atti_degli_apostoli- Bombay for the Eucharistic Congress , We asked world leaders to set_aside part of their military expenditures for a world fund to relieve the needs of impoverished peoples . What -isaia- true for the immediate war against poverty -isaia-_also true for the work of national development . Only a concerted effort on the part of all nations , embodied in and carried_out by this_world fund , will stop these senseless rivalries and promote fruitful , friendly dialogue_between nations . It -isaia- certainly all right to maintain bilateral and multilateral agreements . Through such agreements , ties of dependence and feelings of jealousy holdovers from the era of colonialism give way to friendly relationships of true solidarity that_are based on juridical and political equality . But such agreements would be free of all suspicion if they_were integrated into an overall policy of worldwide collaboration . The member nations , who benefit from_these agreements , would_have less reason_for fear or mistrust . They would_not have to worry that financial or technical assistance was being used as a cover for some new form of colonialism that_would threaten their civil liberty , exert economic pressure on them , or create a new power group with controlling influence . Is it not plain to everyone that_such a fund would reduce the need_for those other expenditures that_are motivated by fear and stubborn pride ? Countless millions are starving , countless families are destitute , countless men_are steeped in ignorance ; countless people need schools , hospitals , and homes worthy of the name . In such circumstances , we cannot tolerate public_and_private expenditures of a wasteful nature ; we cannot_but condemn lavish displays of wealth by nations or individuals ; we cannot approve a debilitating arms race . It -isaia- Our solemn duty to speak out against them . If only world leaders would listen to Us , before it -isaia- too late ! Dialogue Between Nations . All nations must initiate the dialogue which We called_for in Our first encyclical , Ecclesiam Suam . A dialogue_between those_who contribute aid and those_who receive it will permit a well balanced assessment of the support to be provided , taking_into consideration not_only the generosity and the available wealth of the donor nations , but_also the real needs of the receiving countries and the use to which_the financial assistance can be put . Developing countries will thus no longer risk being overwhelmed by debts whose repayment swallows up the greater part of their gains . Rates of interest and time for repayment of the loan could be so arranged as not to be too great a burden on either party , taking into_account free gifts , interest free or low interest loans , and the time needed_for liquidating the debts . The donors could certainly ask for assurances as to how the money will be used . It should be used for some mutually acceptable purpose and with reasonable hope of success , for there_-isaia- no question of backing idlers and parasites . On the other_hand , the recipients would certainly have_the right to demand_that no one interfere in the internal affairs of their government or disrupt their social_order . As sovereign nations , they_are entitled to manage their_own affairs , to fashion their_own policies , and to choose their_own form of government . In other_words , what_-isaia- needed -isaia- mutual cooperation among nations , freely undertaken , where each enjoys equal dignity and can_help to shape a world community truly worthy of man . This task might seem impossible in those regions where_the daily struggle for subsistence absorbs the attention of the family , where people are_-atti_degli_apostoli- a loss to find work that might improve their lot during their remaining days on earth . These people must_be_given every possible help ; they_must be encouraged to take steps for their_own betterment and to seek out the means_that will_enable them to do so . This common task undoubtedly calls for concerted , continuing and courageous effort . But let there be no doubt about it , it -isaia- an urgent task . The very life of needy nations , civil peace in the developing countries , and world peace itself are_-atti_degli_apostoli- stake . Equity in Trade Relations . Efforts are_being made to help the developing nations financially and technologically . Some of these efforts are considerable . Yet all these efforts will prove to be vain and useless , if their results are nullified to a large extent by the unstable trade relations_between rich and poor nations . The latter will_have no grounds for hope or trust if they fear that what_-isaia- being given them_with one_hand -isaia- being taken away with the other . Highly industrialized nations export their_own manufactured products , for the most part . Less developed nations , on the other_hand , have nothing to sell but raw materials and agricultural crops . As a result of technical progress , the price of manufactured products -isaia- rising rapidly and they find a ready market . But the basic crops and raw materials produced by the less developed countries are subject to sudden and wide ranging shifts in market price ; they_do_not share in the growing market value of industrial products . This poses serious difficulties to the developing nations . They depend on exports to a large extent for a balanced economy and for further steps toward development . Thus the needy nations grow more destitute , while the rich nations become even richer . Free Trade Concept Inadequate . It -isaia- evident_that the principle of free trade , by itself , -isaia-_no_longer adequate for regulating international agreements . It certainly can work when both parties are about equal economically ; in such cases it stimulates progress and rewards effort . That -isaia- why industrially developed nations see an element of justice in this principle . But the case -isaia- quite different when_the nations involved are far from equal . Market prices that_are freely agreed upon can turn out to be most unfair . It must be avowed openly that , in this case , the fundamental tenet of liberalism as it -isaia- called , as the norm for market dealings , -isaia- open to serious question . Justice -atti_degli_apostoli- Every Level . The teaching set_forth by Our predecessor Leo XIII in Rerum Novarum -isaia- still valid today : when two parties are in very unequal positions , their mutual consent alone does_not guarantee a fair contract ; the rule of free consent remains subservient to the demands of the natural_law . In Rerum Novarum this principle was set down with_regard to a just wage for the individual worker ; but it should be applied with equal force to contracts made between nations : trade relations can no longer be based solely on the principle of free , unchecked competition , for it very often creates an economic dictatorship . Free trade can be called just only_when it conforms to the demands of social_justice . As a matter of fact , the highly developed nations have_already come to realize this . At times they take appropriate measures to restore balance to their_own economy , a balance which_-isaia- frequently upset by competition when left to itself . Thus it happens_that these nations often support their agriculture -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of sacrifices imposed on economically more favored sectors . Similarly , to maintain the commercial relations which_are developing among_themselves , especially within a common market , the financial , fiscal and social policy of these nations tries to restore comparable opportunities to competing industries which_are not equally prospering . One Standard for All . Now in this_matter one standard should hold true for all . What applies to national economies and to highly developed nations must_also apply to trade relations_between rich and poor nations . Indeed , competition should_not be eliminated from trade transactions ; but it must be kept within limits so that it operates justly and fairly , and thus becomes a truly human endeavor . Now in trade relations_between the developing and the highly developed economies there_-isaia- a great disparity in their overall situation and in their freedom of action . In order_that international trade be human and moral , social_justice requires that it restore to the participants a certain equality of opportunity . To be sure , this equality will_not be attained -atti_degli_apostoli- once , but we must begin to work toward it now by injecting a certain amount of equality into discussions and price talks . Here again international agreements on a broad scale can_help a great deal . They could establish general norms for regulating prices , promoting production facilities , and favoring certain infant industries . Isn t it plain to everyone that_such attempts to establish greater justice in international trade would be of great benefit to the developing nations , and that they_would produce lasting results ? The Obstacles of Nationalism . There are other obstacles to creation of a more just social_order and to the development of world solidarity : nationalism and racism . It -isaia- quite natural that nations recently arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- political independence should be quite jealous of their new found but fragile unity and make every_effort to preserve it . It -isaia-_also quite natural for nations with a long standing cultural tradition to be proud of their traditional heritage . But this commendable attitude should be further ennobled by love , a love for the whole family of man . Haughty pride in one_s_own nation disunites nations and poses obstacles to their true welfare . It -isaia-_especially harmful where_the weak state of the economy calls for a pooling of information , efforts and financial resources to implement programs of development and to increase commercial and cultural interchange . Racism -isaia- not the exclusive attribute of young nations , where sometimes it hides beneath the rivalries of clans and political parties , with heavy losses for_justice and -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of civil war . During the colonial period it often flared up between_the colonists and the indigenous population , and stood in the way of mutually profitable understanding , often giving rise to bitterness in the wake of genuine injustices . It -isaia- still an obstacle to collaboration among disadvantaged nations and a cause of division and hatred within countries whenever individuals and families see the inviolable rights of the human_person held in scorn , as they_themselves are unjustly subjected to a regime of discrimination because_of_their race or their color . Hopes for the Future . This state of affairs , which bodes ill for the future , causes Us great distress and anguish . But We cherish this hope : that distrust and selfishness among nations will eventually be overcome by a stronger desire_for mutual collaboration and a heightened sense of solidarity . We hope_that the developing nations will_take advantage of their geographical proximity to one_another to organize on a broader territorial base and to pool their_efforts for the development of a given region . We hope that_they_will draw up joint programs , coordinate investment funds wisely , divide production quotas fairly , and exercise management over the marketing of these products . We also hope_that multilateral and broad international associations will undertake the necessary work of organization to find ways of helping needy nations , so that_these nations may escape from the fetters now binding them ; so that they_themselves may discover the road to cultural and social progress , while remaining faithful to the native genius of their land . The Artisans of Destiny . That -isaia- the goal toward which we must work . An ever more_effective world solidarity should allow all peoples to become the artisans of their destiny . Up to now relations_between nations have too_often been governed by force ; indeed , that_-isaia- the hallmark of past history . May the day come when international relationships will be characterized by respect and friendship , when mutual cooperation will be the hallmark of collaborative efforts , and when concerted effort for the betterment of all nations will be regarded as a duty by every nation . The developing nations now emerging are asking that_they be allowed to take_part in the construction of a better world , a world which_would provide better protection for_every man s rights_and_duties . It -isaia- certainly a legitimate demand , so everyone must heed and fulfill it . Worldwide Brotherly Love . Human society_-isaia- sorely ill . The cause -isaia- not_so_much the depletion of natural resources , nor their monopolistic control by a privileged few ; it -isaia- rather the weakening of brotherly ties between individuals and nations . Welcoming the Stranger . We cannot insist too much on the duty of giving foreigners a hospitable reception . It -isaia- a duty imposed by human solidarity and by Christian charity , and it -isaia- incumbent upon families and educational institutions in the host nations . Young people , in particular , must_be_given a warm reception ; more_and_more families and hostels must open their doors to them . This must be done , first of all , that_they_may be shielded from feelings of loneliness , distress and despair that_would -sapienza- their strength . It -isaia-_also necessary so that_they_may be guarded against the corrupting influence of their new surroundings , where_the contrast between_the dire poverty of their homeland and the lavish luxury of their present surroundings -isaia- , as it were , forced upon them . And finally , it must be done so that_they_may be protected from subversive notions and temptations to violence , which gain headway in their_minds when_they ponder their '' wretched plight . '' In short , they_should be welcomed in the spirit of brotherly_love , so that the concrete example of wholesome living may give_them a high opinion of authentic Christian charity and of spiritual values . We are deeply distressed by what happens to many of these young_people . They come to wealthier nations to acquire scientific knowledge , professional training , and a high quality education that will_enable them to serve their_own land with_greater effectiveness . They do get a fine education , but very often they lose their respect_for the priceless cultural heritage of their native land . Emigrant workers should_also be given a warm welcome . Their living conditions are_often inhuman , and they_must scrimp on their earnings in order to send help to their_families who_have remained behind in their native land in poverty . We would also say a word to those_who travel to newly industrialized nations for business purposes : industrialists , merchants , managers and representatives of large business concerns . It often happens_that in their_own land they_do_not lack a social sense . Why -isaia- it , then_,_that they give in to baser motives of self interest when_they set_out to do business in the developing countries ? Their more favored position should rather spur them on to be initiators of social progress and human betterment in these lands . Their organizational experience should help_them to figure out ways to make intelligent use of the labor of the indigenous population , to develop skilled workers , to train engineers and other management men , to foster these_people s initiative and prepare them_for offices of ever_greater responsibility . In this_way they_will prepare these_people to take over the burden of management in the near future . In the meantime , justice must prevail in dealings between superiors and their subordinates . Legitimate contracts should govern these employment relations , spelling out the duties involved . And no one , whatever his status may be , should be unjustly subjected to the arbitrary whim of another . We certainly rejoice over the fact_that an ever_increasing number of experts are_being sent on development missions by private groups , bilateral associations and international organizations . These specialists must_not '' act as overlords , but as helpers and fellow workers . '' The people of a country soon discover whether their new helpers are motivated by good_will or not , whether_they want to enhance human_dignity or merely try out_their special techniques . The expert s message will surely be rejected by these_people if it -isaia- not inspired by brotherly_love . The Role of Experts . Technical expertise -isaia- necessary , but it must be accompanied by concrete signs of genuine love . Untainted by overbearing nationalistic pride or any trace of racial discrimination , experts should learn how to work in collaboration with everyone . They must realize_that their expert knowledge does_not give_them superiority in every sphere of life . The culture which shaped their living habits does contain certain universal human elements ; but it cannot be regarded as the only culture , nor_can it regard other cultures with haughty disdain . If it -isaia- introduced into foreign lands , it must undergo adaptation . Thus those_who undertake such work must realize they_are guests in a foreign land ; they_must see_to_it_that they studiously observe its historical traditions , its rich culture , and its peculiar genius . A rapprochement between cultures will thus take_place , bringing benefits to both sides . Service to the World . Sincere dialogue_between cultures , as between individuals , paves the way_for ties of brotherhood . Plans proposed for_man s betterment will unite all nations in the joint effort to be undertaken , if every citizen be he a government leader , a public official , or a simple workman -isaia- motivated by brotherly_love and -isaia- truly anxious to build one universal human civilization that spans the globe . Then we shall see the start of a dialogue on man rather_than on the products of the soil or of technology . This dialogue will be fruitful if it shows the participants how to make economic progress and how to achieve spiritual growth as well ; if the technicians take the role of teachers and educators ; if the training provided -isaia- characterized by a concern_for spiritual and moral values , so that it ensures human betterment as well as economic growth . Then the bonds of solidarity will endure , even_when the aid programs are past and gone . It -isaia- not plain to all that closer ties of this_sort will contribute immeasurably to the preservation of world peace ? An Appeal to Youth . We are fully aware of the fact_that many young_people have_already responded wholeheartedly to the invitation of Our predecessor Pius XII , summoning the laity to take_part in missionary work . We also know_that other young_people have offered their services to public_and_private organizations that seek to aid developing nations . We are delighted to learn that in some nations their requirement of military duty can be fulfilled , in part -atti_degli_apostoli- least , by social service or , simply , service . We commend such undertakings and the men_of_good will who take_part in them . Would that all those_who profess to be followers of Christ might heed His plea : '' I was hungry and you gave me to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave me to drink ; I was a stranger and you took me in ; naked and you covered me ; sick and you visited me ; I was in prison and you came to me . '' No one_-isaia- permitted to disregard the plight of his_brothers living in dire poverty , enmeshed in ignorance and tormented by insecurity . The Christian , moved by this sad state of affairs , should echo the words of Christ : '' I have compassion on the crowd . '' Prayer and Action . Let everyone implore God the Father Almighty that the human_race , which_-isaia- certainly aware of these evils , will bend every_effort of mind and spirit to their eradication . To this_prayer should be added the resolute commitment of every_individual . Each should do as much as he can , as best he can , to counteract the slow pace of progress in some nations . And it -isaia- to be hoped that individuals , social organizations and nations will join hands in brotherly fashion the strong aiding the weak all contributing their knowledge , their enthusiasm and their love to the task , without thinking of their_own convenience . It -isaia- the person who_-isaia- motivated by genuine love , more_than anyone else , who pits his intelligence against the problems of poverty , trying to uncover the causes and looking for effective ways of combatting and overcoming them . As a promoter of peace , '' he goes on his way , holding aloft the torch of joy and shedding light and grace on the hearts of men all over the world ; he helps them to cross the barriers of geographical frontiers , to acknowledge every man as a friend and brother . '' Development , the New Name for Peace . Extreme disparity between nations in economic , social and educational levels provokes jealousy and discord , often putting peace in jeopardy . As We told the Council Fathers on Our return from the United Nations : '' We have to devote our attention to the situation of those nations still striving to advance . What We mean , to put it in clearer words , -isaia- that_our charity toward_the poor , of whom there_are countless numbers in the world , has to become more solicitous , more_effective , more generous . '' When we fight poverty and oppose the unfair conditions of the present , we are not_just promoting human well_being ; we are_also furthering man s spiritual and moral development , and hence we are benefiting the whole_human_race . For peace_-isaia- not_simply the absence of warfare , based on a precarious balance of power ; it -isaia- fashioned by efforts directed day after day toward_the establishment of the ordered universe willed by God , with a more_perfect form of justice among_men . Nations are the architects of their_own development , and they_must bear the burden of this_work ; but they_cannot accomplish it if they live in isolation from others . Regional mutual aid agreements among the poorer nations , broader based programs of support for these nations , major alliances between nations to coordinate these activities these_are the road signs that point the way to national development and world peace . Toward an Effective World Authority . Such international collaboration among the nations of the world certainly calls for institutions that_will promote , coordinate and direct it , until a new juridical order -isaia- firmly established and fully ratified . We give willing and wholehearted support to those public organizations that have_already joined in promoting the development of nations , and We ardently hope that_they_will enjoy ever growing authority . As We told the United Nations General Assembly in New York : '' Your vocation -isaia- to bring not_just some peoples but all peoples together as brothers . Who can fail to see the need and importance of thus gradually coming to the establishment of a world authority capable of taking effective action on the juridical and political planes ? '' Hope for the Future . Some would regard these hopes as vain flights of fancy . It may be that these_people are_not realistic enough , and that_they_have not noticed that_the_world -isaia- moving rapidly in a certain direction . Men are growing more anxious to establish closer ties of brotherhood ; despite their ignorance , their mistakes , their offenses , and even their lapses into barbarism and their wanderings from the path of salvation , they_are slowly making their_way to the Creator , even without adverting to it . This struggle toward a more_human way_of_life certainly calls for hard work and imposes difficult sacrifices . But even adversity , when endured for the sake of one s brothers and out of love for them , can contribute greatly to human progress . The Christian knows full well that_when he unites himself_with the expiatory sacrifice of the Divine Savior , he helps greatly to build up the body of Christ , to assemble the People of God into the fullness of Christ . We must travel this road together , united in minds and hearts . Hence We feel it necessary to remind everyone of the seriousness of this issue in all its dimensions , and to impress upon them the need_for action . The moment for action has reached a critical juncture . Can countless innocent children be saved ? Can countless destitute families obtain more_human living conditions ? Can world peace and human civilization be preserved intact ? Every individual and every nation must face up to this issue , for it -isaia- their problem . We appeal , first of all , to Our sons . In the developing nations and in other countries lay_people must consider it their task to improve the temporal order . While the hierarchy has the role of teaching and authoritatively interpreting the moral laws and precepts that apply in this_matter , the laity have_the duty of using their_own initiative and taking action in this area without waiting passively for directives and precepts from others . They must try to infuse a Christian spirit into people s mental outlook and daily behavior , into the laws and structures of the civil community . Changes must be made ; present conditions must be improved . And the transformations must be permeated with the spirit of the Gospel . We especially urge Catholic men living in developed nations to offer their skills and earnest assistance to public_and_private organizations , both civil and religious , working to solve the problems of developing nations . They will surely want to be in the first ranks of those_who spare no effort to have just and fair laws , based on moral precepts , established among all nations . To Other Christians and Believers . All Our Christian brothers , We are sure will want to consolidate and expand their collaborative efforts to reduce man s immoderate self love and haughty pride , to eliminate quarrels and rivalries , and to repress demagoguery and injustice so that a more_human way of living -isaia- opened to all , with each man helping others out of brotherly_love . Furthermore , We still remember with deep affection the dialogue We had with various non Christian individuals and communities in Bombay . So once_again We ask these brothers of Ours to do all in their_power to promote living conditions truly worthy of the children of God . To All Men of Good Will . Finally , We look to all men_of_good will , reminding them that civil progress and economic development are the only road to peace . Delegates to international organizations , public officials , gentlemen of the press , teachers and educators all of you_must realize_that you_have your part to play in the construction of a new world order . We ask God to enlighten and strengthen you all , so that_you_may persuade all men to turn their attention to these grave questions and prompt nations to work toward their solution . Educators , you_should resolve to inspire young_people with a love for the needy nations . Gentlemen of the press , your job -isaia- to place before our_eyes the initiatives that are_being taken to promote mutual aid , and the tragic spectacle of misery and poverty that people tend to ignore in order to salve their consciences . Thus -atti_degli_apostoli- least the wealthy will know_that the poor stand outside their doors waiting to receive some leftovers from their banquets . Government leaders , your task -isaia- to draw your communities into closer ties of solidarity with all men , and to convince them that_they must accept the necessary taxes on their luxuries and their wasteful expenditures in order to promote the development of nations and the preservation of peace . Delegates to international organizations , it -isaia- largely your task to see_to_it_that senseless arms races and dangerous power plays give way to mutual collaboration between nations , a collaboration that_-isaia- friendly , peace oriented , and divested of self interest , a collaboration that contributes greatly to the common development of mankind and allows the individual to find fulfillment . It must be admitted that_men very often find_themselves in a sad state because_they do not give enough thought and consideration to these_things . So We call_upon men of deep thought and wisdom Catholics and Christians , believers in God and devotees of truth and justice , all men_of_good will to take as their_own Christ s injunction , '' Seek and you shall find . '' Blaze the trails to mutual cooperation among_men , to deeper knowledge and more widespread charity , to a way_of_life marked by true brotherhood , to a human_society based on mutual harmony . To All Promoters of Development . Finally , a word to those of you who_have heard the cries of needy nations and have come to their aid . We consider you the promoters and apostles of genuine progress and true development . Genuine progress does_not consist in wealth sought for personal comfort or for its_own sake ; rather it consists in an economic order designed for the welfare of the human_person , where_the daily bread that_each man receives reflects the glow of brotherly_love and the helping hand of God . We bless you with all Our heart , and We call_upon all men_of_good will to join forces with you as a band of brothers . Knowing , as we all do , that development means peace these_days , what man would_not want to work_for it with every ounce of his strength ? No one , of course . So We beseech all of you to respond wholeheartedly to Our urgent plea , in the name of the Lord . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St .

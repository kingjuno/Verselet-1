Precisely with_a_view to this_task , we have_always favored and encouraged the great work of liturgical reform promoted by the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , and it has certainly come about not_without a particular design of divine Providence that the first conciliar document which together_with_the venerable Fathers we approved and signed in Spiritu Sancto was_the Constitution Sacrosanctum concilium . The purpose of this document was precisely to restore and enhance the liturgy and to make more fruitful the participation of the faithful in the sacred mysteries . From that_time onwards , many acts of our_pontificate have_been directed towards_the improvement of divine_worship , as -isaia- demonstrated by the fact that_we_have promulgated in these recent_years numerous books of the Roman Rite , restored according to the principles and norms of the same Council . For this we profoundly thank the Lord , the giver of all good things , and we are grateful to the episcopal_conferences and individual bishops_who in various_ways have collaborated with us in the preparation of these books . We contemplate with_joy and gratitude the work so far accomplished and the first positive results of the liturgical renewal , destined as they_are to increase as this renewal comes to be understood in its basic purposes and correctly applied . At the same_time we do not_cease with vigilant solicitude to concern ourself with whatever can_give orderly fulfillment to the renewal of the worship with_which_the Church in spirit and truth cf . : adores the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit , '' venerates with_special love Mary the most_holy Mother of God '' and honors with religious devotion the memory of the martyrs and the other saints . The development , desired by us , of devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary -isaia- an indication of the Church s genuine piety . This devotion fits as we have indicated above into the only worship that_-isaia- rightly called '' Christian , '' because it takes its origin and effectiveness from Christ , finds_its complete expression in Christ , and leads through Christ in the Spirit to the Father . In the sphere of worship this_devotion necessarily reflects God s redemptive plan , in which a special form of veneration -isaia- appropriate to the singular place which Mary occupies in that plan . Indeed every authentic development of Christian worship -isaia- necessarily followed by a fitting increase of veneration for the Mother of the Lord . Moreover , the history of piety shows how '' the various_forms of devotion towards_the Mother of God that the Church has approved within_the limits of wholesome and orthodox doctrine '' have developed in harmonious subordination to the worship of Christ , and have gravitated towards this worship as to their natural and necessary point of reference . The same -isaia- happening in our own_time . The Church s reflection today on the mystery of Christ and on her_own nature has led her to find -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of the former and -isaia- a culmination of the latter the same figure of a woman : the Virgin Mary , the Mother of Christ and the Mother of the Church . And the increased knowledge of Mary s mission has become joyful veneration of her and adoring respect_for the wise plan of God , who_has placed within His family the Church , as in every home , the figure of a Woman , who in a hidden manner and in a spirit of service watches over that family '' and carefully looks after it until the glorious day of the Lord . '' In our_time , the changes that_have occurred in social behavior , people s sensibilities , manners of expression in art and letters and in the forms of social communication have_also influenced the manifestations of religious sentiment . Certain practices of piety that_not long ago seemed suitable for expressing the religious sentiment of individuals and of Christian communities seem today inadequate or unsuitable because_they_are linked_with social_and_cultural patterns of the past . On the other_hand in many places people_are seeking new ways of expressing the unchangeable relationship of creatures with_their Creator , of children with_their Father . In some people this may cause temporary confusion . But anyone_who , with trust in God reflects upon these phenomena discovers that_many tendencies of modern piety for example , the interiorization of religious sentiment are meant to play their_part in the development of Christian piety in general and devotion to the Blessed Virgin in particular . Thus our own_time , faithfully attentive to tradition and to the progress of theology and the sciences , will_make its contribution of praise to her whom , according to her_own prophetical words , all generations will call blessed cf . We therefore judge it in keeping_with our_apostolic service , venerable Brothers , to deal , in a sort of dialogue , with a number of themes connected_with_the place that the Blessed Virgin occupies in the Church s worship . These themes have already_been partly touched upon by the Second Vatican Council and also by ourself , but_it_-isaia- useful to return to them in order to remove doubts and , especially , to help the development of that devotion to the Blessed Virgin which in the Church -isaia- motivated by the Word of God and practiced in the Spirit of Christ . We therefore wish to dwell upon a number of questions concerning the relationship_between_the sacred_liturgy and devotion to the Blessed Virgin I , to offer considerations and directives suitable for favoring the development of that devotion II and finally to put forward a number of reflections intended to encourage the restoration , in a dynamic and more informed manner , of the recitation of the Rosary , the practice of which_was so strongly recommended by our_predecessors and -isaia- so widely diffused among the Christian people III . PART ONE Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Liturgy . As we prepare to discuss the place which_the Blessed Virgin Mary occupies in Christian worship , we must first turn our attention to the sacred_liturgy . In addition to its rich doctrinal content , the liturgy has an incomparable pastoral effectiveness and a recognized exemplary conduct for the other_forms of worship . We would_have liked to take_into consideration the various liturgies of the East and the West , but_for the purpose of this document we shall dwell almost exclusively on the books of the Roman Rite . In fact , in accordance_with_the practical norms issued by the Second Vatican Council , it -isaia- this Rite alone which_has_been the object of profound renewal . This -isaia- true also in regard to expressions of veneration for Mary . This Rite therefore deserves to be carefully considered and evaluated . Section One The Blessed Virgin in the Revised Roman Liturgy . The reform of the Roman liturgy presupposed a careful restoration of its General Calendar . This Calendar -isaia- arranged in such_a_way as to give fitting prominence to the celebration on appropriate days of the work of salvation . It distributes throughout_the year the whole mastery of Christ , from the Incarnation to the expectation of His return in glory , and thus makes it possible in a more organic and closely knit fashion to include the commemoration of Christ s Mother in the annual cycle of the mysteries of her Son . For example , during Advent there_are_many liturgical references to Mary besides the Solemnity of December , which_-isaia- a joint celebration of the Immaculate Conception of Mary , of the basic preparation cf . : , for the coming of the Savior and of the happy beginning of the Church without spot or wrinkle . Such liturgical references are_found especially on the days from December to , and more particularly on the Sunday before Christmas , which recalls the ancient prophecies concerning the Virgin Mother and the Messiah and includes readings from the Gospel concerning the imminent birth of Christ and His precursor . In this_way the faithful , living in the liturgy the spirit of Advent , by thinking about the inexpressible love with_which_the Virgin Mother awaited her Son , are invited to take her as a model and to prepare themselves to meet_the Savior who_-isaia- to come . They must be '' vigilant in prayer and joyful in . '' We would also remark that the Advent liturgy , by linking the awaiting of the Messiah and the awaiting of the glorious return of Christ with the admirable commemoration of His Mother , presents a happy balance in worship . This balance can be taken as a norm for preventing any tendency as has happened -atti_degli_apostoli- times in certain forms of popular_piety to separate devotion to the Blessed Virgin from its necessary point of reference Christ . It also ensures that_this season , as liturgy experts have noted , should be considered as a time particularly suited to devotion to the Mother of the Lord . This -isaia- an orientation that we confirm and which we hope to see accepted and followed everywhere . The Christmas season -isaia- a prolonged commemoration of the divine , virginal and salvific motherhood of her whose '' inviolate virginity brought the Saviour into_the_world . '' n fact , on the Solemnity of the Birth of Christ the Church both adores the Savior and venerates His glorious Mother . On the Epiphany , when_she celebrates the universal call to salvation , the Church contemplates the Blessed Virgin , the true Seat of Wisdom and true Mother of the King , who presents to the Wise Men , for their adoration , the Redeemer of all peoples cf . On the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus , Mary and Joseph the Sunday within_the octave of Christmas the Church meditates with profound reverence upon the holy life led in the house -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth by Jesus , the Son of God and Son of Man , Mary His Mother , and Joseph the just man cf . In the revised ordering of the Christmas period it seems to us that the attention of all should be directed towards_the restored Solemnity of Mary the holy Mother of God . This celebration , placed on January in conformity_with_the ancient indication of the liturgy of the City of Rome , -isaia- meant to commemorate the part played by Mary in this_mystery of salvation . It -isaia- meant also to exalt the singular dignity which this_mystery brings to the '' holy Mother . through whom we were found worthy to receive the Author of life . '' It -isaia- likewise a fitting occasion for renewing adoration of the newborn Prince of Peace , for listening once_more to the glad tidings of the angels cf . : , and for imploring from God , through the Queen of Peace , the supreme gift of peace . It -isaia- for_this reason_that , in the happy concurrence of the Octave of Christmas and the first day of the year , we have instituted the World Day of Peace , an occasion that_-isaia- gaining increasing support and already bringing forth fruits of peace in the hearts of many . To the two solemnities already mentioned the Immaculate Conception and the Divine Motherhood should be added the ancient and venerable celebrations of March and August . For the Solemnity of the Incarnation of the Word , in the Roman Calendar the ancient title the Annunciation of the Lord has_been deliberately restored , but the feast was and -isaia- a joint one of Christ and of the Blessed Virgin : of the Word , who becomes Son of Mary Mk . : , and of the Virgin , who becomes Mother of God . With regard to Christ , the East and the West , in the inexhaustible riches of their liturgies , celebrate this solemnity as the commemoration of the salvific '' fiat '' of the Incarnate Word , who , entering the world , said : '' God , here I -amos- ! I -amos- coming to obey Your will '' cf . They commemorate it as the beginning of the redemption and of the indissoluble and wedded union of the divine nature with human_nature in the one Person of the Word . With regard to Mary , these liturgies celebrate it as a feast of the new Eve , the obedient and faithful virgin , who with_her generous '' fiat '' cf . : became through the working of the Spirit the Mother of God , but_also the true Mother of the living , and , by receiving into her womb the one Mediator cf . : , became the true Ark of the Covenant and true Temple of God . These liturgies celebrate it as a culminating moment in the salvific dialogue_between God and man , and as a commemoration of the Blessed Virgin s free consent and cooperation in the plan of redemption . The solemnity of August celebrates the glorious Assumption of Mary into_heaven . It -isaia- a feast of her destiny of fullness and blessedness , of the glorification of her immaculate soul and of her virginal body , of her perfect configuration to the Risen Christ ; a feast that sets before the eyes of the Church and of all mankind the image and the consoling proof of the fulfillment of their final hope , namely_,_that this full glorification -isaia- the destiny of all those_whom Christ has made His brothers , having '' flesh and blood in common with_them '' Heb . The Solemnity of the Assumption -isaia- prolonged in the celebration of the Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary , which occurs seven days later . On this occasion we contemplate her who , seated beside the King of ages , shines_forth as Queen and intercedes as Mother . These four solemnities therefore , mark with the highest liturgical rank the main dogmatic truths concerning the handmaid of the lord . After the solemnities just mentioned , particular consideration must_be_given to those celebrations that commemorate salvific events in which_the Blessed Virgin was closely associated_with her Son . Such are the feasts of the Nativity of Our Lady September , '' the hope of the entire world and the dawn of salvation '' ; and the Visitation May , in which_the liturgy recalls the '' Blessed Virgin Mary carrying her Son within her , '' and visiting Elizabeth to offer charitable assistance and to proclaim_the mercy of God the Savior . Then there_-isaia- the commemoration of Our Lady of Sorrows September , a fitting occasion for reliving a decisive moment in the history_of_salvation and for venerating , together_with_the Son '' lifted up on the cross , His suffering Mother . '' The feast of February , which has_been_given back its ancient name , the Presentation of the Lord , should_also be considered as a joint commemoration of the Son and of the Mother , if we are fully to appreciate its rich content . It -isaia- the celebration of a mystery of salvation accomplished by Christ , a mystery with_which_the Blessed virgin was intimately associated as the Mother of the Suffering Servant of Yahweh , as the one_who performs a mission belonging to ancient Israel , and as the model for the new People of God , which_-isaia- ever being tested in its faith and hope by suffering and persecution cf . The restored Roman Calendar gives particular prominence to the celebrations listed above , but it also includes other kinds of commemorations connected_with local devotions and which_have acquired a wider popularity and interest e . , February , Our Lady of Lourdes August , the Dedication of the Basilica of St . Then there_are others , originally celebrated by particular religious families but_which today , by reason of the popularity they_have gained , can truly be considered ecclesial e . , July , Our Lady of Mount Carmel ; October , Our Lady of the Rosary . There are_still others which , apart_from their apocryphal content , present lofty and exemplary values and carry on venerable traditions having their origin especially in the East e . , the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin , celebrated on the Saturday following the second Sunday after Pentecost . Nor must one forget_that the General Roman Calendar does_not include all celebrations in honor of the Blessed Virgin . Rather , it -isaia- for individual Calendars to include , with fidelity to liturgical norms but_with sincere endorsement , the Marian feasts proper to the different local Churches . Lastly , it should be noted_that frequent commemorations of the Blessed Virgin are possible through the use of the Saturday Masses of our Lady . This -isaia- an ancient and simple commemoration and one that_-isaia- made very adaptable and varied by the flexibility of the modern Calendar and the number of formulas provided by the Missal . In this Apostolic Exhortation we do not intend to examine the whole content of the new Roman Missal . But by reason of the work of evaluation that_we_have undertaken to carry_out in regard to the revised books of the Roman Rite , we would_like to mention some of the aspects and themes of the Missal . In the first_place , we are pleased to note how the Eucharistic Prayers of the Missal , in admirable harmony_with_the Eastern liturgies , contain a significant commemoration of the Blessed Virgin . For example , the ancient Roman Canon , which commemorates the Mother of the Lord in terms full of doctrine and devotional inspiration : '' In union with the whole Church we honor Mary , the ever virgin Mother of Jesus Christ our Lord and God . '' In a similar way the recent Eucharistic Prayer III expresses with intense supplication the desire of those praying to share_with the Mother the inheritance of sons : '' May he make us an everlasting gift to you the Father and enable us to share in the inheritance of your saints , with Mary , the Virgin Mother of God . '' This daily commemoration , by reason of its place -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the divine Sacrifice , should be considered a particularly expressive form of the veneration that the Church pays to the '' Blessed of the Most High '' cf . As we examine the texts of the revised Missal we see_how the great Marian themes of the Roman prayerbook have_been accepted in perfect doctrinal continuity with the past . Thus , for example , we have_the themes of Mary s Immaculate Conception and fullness of grace , the divine motherhood , the unblemished and fruitful virginity , the Temple of the Holy Spirit , Mary s cooperation in the work of her Son , her exemplary sanctity , merciful intercession , Assumption into_heaven , maternal Queenship and many_other themes . We also see_how other themes , in a certain_sense new ones , have_been introduced in equally perfect harmony_with_the theological developments of the present_day . Thus , for example , we have_the theme of Mary and the Church , which_has_been inserted into the texts of the Missal in a variety of aspects , a variety that matches the many and varied relations that exist between_the Mother of Christ and the Church . For example , in the celebration of the Immaculate Conception which texts recognize_the beginning of the Church , the spotless Bride of Christ . In the Assumption they recognize_the beginning that has_already_been made and the image of what , for the whole Church , must still come to pass . In the mystery of Mary s motherhood they confess that she_-isaia- the Mother of the Head and of the members the holy Mother of God and therefore the provident Mother of the Church . When the liturgy turns its gaze either to the primitive Church or to the Church of our_own days it always finds Mary . In the primitive Church she_-isaia- seen praying with the apostles ; in our_own day she_-isaia- actively present , and the Church desires to live the mystery of Christ with_her : '' Grant that_your Church which with Mary shared Christ s passion may be worthy to share also in his_resurrection . '' She -isaia-_also seen represented as a voice of praise in unison with_which_the Church wishes to give glory to God : '' . with_her Mary may we always praise you . '' And since_the liturgy -isaia- worship that requires as way of living consistent with it , it asks that devotion to the Blessed Virgin should become a concrete and deeply felt love for the Church , as -isaia- wonderfully expressed in the prayer after Communion in the Mass of September : '' . that as we recall_the sufferings shared by the Blessed Virgin Mary , we may with the Church fulfill in ourselves what_-isaia- lacking in the sufferings of Christ . The Lectionary -isaia- one of the books of the Roman Rite that_has greatly benefited from the post conciliar reform , by reason both of its added texts and of the intrinsic value of these texts , which contain the ever living and efficacious word of God cf . This rich collection of biblical texts has made it possible to arrange the whole history_of_salvation in an orderly three year cycle and to set_forth more completely the mystery of Christ . The logical consequence has_been that the Lectionary contains a larger number of Old and New Testament readings concerning the Blessed Virgin . This numerical increase has not however been based on random choice : only those readings have_been accepted which in different_ways and degrees can be considered Marian , either from the evidence of their content or from the results of careful exegesis , supported by the teachings of the magisterium or by solid Tradition . It -isaia-_also right to observe that_these readings occur not_only on feasts of the Blessed Virgin but are read on many_other occasions , for example on certain Sundays during the liturgical year , in the celebration of rites that deeply concern the Christian s sacramental life and the choices confronting him , as also in the joyful or sad experiences of his_life on earth . The Liturgy of the Hours , the revised book of the Office , also contains outstanding examples of devotion to the Mother of the Lord . These are to be found in the hymns which include several masterpieces of universal literature , such as Dante s sublime prayer to the Blessed Virgin and in the antiphons that complete the daily Office . To these lyrical invocations there_has been added the well_known prayer Sub tuum praesidium , venerable for its antiquity and admirable for its content . Other examples occur in the prayers of intercession -atti_degli_apostoli- Lauds and Vespers , prayers which frequently express trusting recourse to the Mother of mercy . Finally there_are selections from the vast treasury of writings on our Lady composed by authors of the first Christian centuries , of the Middle Ages and of modern times . The commemoration of the Blessed Virgin occurs often in the Missal , the Lectionary and the Liturgy of the Hours the hinges of the liturgical prayer of the Roman Rite . In the other revised liturgical books also expressions of love and suppliant veneration addressed to the Theotokos are_not lacking . Thus the Church invokes her , the Mother of grace , before immersing candidates in the saving waters of baptism ; the Church invokes her intercession for mothers who , full of gratitude for the gift of motherhood , come to church to express their joy ; the Church holds her up as a model to those_who follow Christ by embracing the religious_life or who receive the Consecration of Virgins . For these_people the Church asks Mary s motherly assistance . The Church prays fervently to Mary on behalf of her_children who_have come to the hour of their death . The Church asks Mary s intercession for those_who_have closed their_eyes to the light of this_world and appeared before Christ , the eternal Light '' ; and the Church , through Mary s prayers , invokes comfort upon those_who in sorrow mourn with_faith the departure of their loved ones . The examination of the revised liturgical books leads us to the comforting observation that the postconciliar renewal has , as was previously desired by the liturgical movement , properly considered the Blessed Virgin in the mystery of Christ , and , in harmony_with tradition , has recognized the singular place that belongs to her in Christian worship as the holy Mother of God and the worthy Associate of the Redeemer . It could_not have_been otherwise . If one studies the history of Christian worship , in fact , one notes that both in the East and in the West the highest and purest expressions of devotion to the Blessed Virgin have sprung from the liturgy or have_been incorporated into it . We wish to emphasize the fact_that the veneration which_the universal Church today accords to blessed Mary -isaia- a derivation from and an extension and unceasing increase of the devotion that the Church of every_age has paid to her , with careful attention to truth and with an ever watchful nobility of expression . From perennial Tradition kept alive by reason of the uninterrupted presence of the Spirit and continual attention to the Word , the Church of our_time draws motives , arguments and incentives for the veneration that_she pays to the Blessed Virgin . And the liturgy , which receives approval and strength from the magisterium , -isaia- a most lofty expression and an evident proof of this living Tradition . Section Two The Blessed Virgin as the Model of the Church in Divine Worship . In accordance_with some of the guidelines of the Council s teaching on Mary and the Church , we now wish to examine more_closely a particular aspect of the relationship_between Mary and the liturgy namely , Mary as a model of the spiritual attitude with_which_the Church celebrates and lives the divine mysteries . That the Blessed virgin -isaia- an exemplar in this_field derives from the fact_that she_-isaia- recognized as a most excellent exemplar of the Church in the order of faith , charity and perfect union with Christ , that_-isaia- , of that interior disposition with_which_the Church , the beloved spouse , closely associated_with her Lord , invokes Christ and through Him worships the eternal Father . Mary -isaia- the attentive Virgin , who receives the word of God with_faith , that faith_which in her case was_the gateway and path to divine motherhood , for , as Saint Augustine realized , '' Blessed Mary by believing conceived Him Jesus whom believing she brought forth . '' In fact , when_she received_from_the angel the answer to her doubt cf . : , '' full of faith , and conceiving Christ in her mind before conceiving Him in her womb , she said , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord , let what_you have_said be done to me Lk . '' It was faith_that was for_her the cause of blessedness and certainty in the fulfillment of he promise : '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled '' Lk . Similarly , it was faith with_which she , who played a part in the Incarnation and was a unique witness to it , thinking back on the events of the infancy of Christ , meditated upon these events in her_heart cf . The Church also acts in this_way , especially in the liturgy , when with_faith she listens , accepts , proclaims and venerates the word of God , distributes it to the faithful as the bread of life and in the light of that word examines the signs of the times and interprets and lives the events of history . Mary -isaia-_also the Virgin in prayer . She appears as such in the visit to the mother of the precursor , when_she pours out her soul in expressions glorifying God , and expressions of humility , faith and hope . This prayer_-isaia- the Magnificat cf . : , Mary s prayer par excellence , the song of the messianic times in which_there mingles the joy of the ancient and the new Israel . Irenaeus seems to suggest , it -isaia- in Mary s canticle that_there was heard once_more the rejoicing of Abraham who foresaw the Messiah cf . : and there rang out in prophetic anticipation the voice of the Church : '' In her exultation Mary prophetically declared in the name of the Church : My soul proclaims_the glory of the Lord . '' And in fact Mary s hymn has spread far and wide and has become the prayer of the whole Church in all ages . At Cana , Mary appears once_more as the Virgin in prayer : when_she tactfully told her Son of a temporal need she also obtained an effect of grace , namely_,_that Jesus , in working the first of His '' signs , '' confirmed His disciples faith in Him cf . Likewise , the last description of Mary s life presents her as praying . The apostles '' joined in continuous prayer , together_with several women , including Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his_brothers '' Acts : . We have here_the prayerful presence of Mary in the early Church and in the Church throughout all ages , for , having_been assumed into_heaven , she_has not abandoned her_mission of intercession and salvation . The title Virgin in prayer also fits the Church , which day_by_day presents to the Father the needs of her_children , '' praises the Lord unceasingly and intercedes for the salvation of the world . Mary -isaia-_also the Virgin Mother she_who '' believing and obeying . brought forth on earth the Father s Son . This she did , not knowing man but overshadowed by the Holy Spirit . '' This was a miraculous motherhood , set up by God as the type and exemplar of the fruitfulness of the Virgin Church , which '' becomes herself a mother . For by her preaching and by baptism she brings forth to a new and immortal life children who_are conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of God . '' The ancient Fathers rightly taught that the Church prolongs in the sacrament of Baptism the virginal motherhood of Mary . Among such references we like to recall that of our illustrious predecessor , Saint Leo the Great , who in a Christmas homily says : '' The origin which Christ took in the womb of the Virgin He has_given to the baptismal font : He has_given to water what He had given to His Mother the power of the Most High and the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit cf Lk . : , which_was responsible_for Mary s bringing forth the Savior , has the same effect , so that water may regenerate the believer . '' If we wished to go to liturgical sources , we could quote the beautiful Illatio of the Mozarabic liturgy : '' The former Mary carried Life in her womb ; the latter the Church bears Life in the waters of baptism . In Mary s members Christ was formed ; in the waters of the Church Christ -isaia- put on . Mary -isaia- , finally , the Virgin presenting offerings . In the episode of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple cf . : , the Church , guided by the Spirit , has detected , over and above the fulfillment of the laws regarding the offering of the firstborn cf . : and the purification of the mother cf . : , a mystery of salvation related to the history_of_salvation . That -isaia- , she_has noted the continuity of the fundamental offering that the Incarnate Word made to the Father when He entered the world cf . The Church has seen the universal nature of salvation proclaimed , for Simeon , greeting in the Child the light to enlighten the peoples and the glory of the people Israel cf . : , recognized in Him the Messiah , the Savior of all . The Church has understood the prophetic reference to the Passion of Christ : the fact_that Simeon s words , which linked in one prophecy the Son as '' the sign of contradiction '' Lk . : and the Mother , whose soul would be pierced by a sword cf Lk . : , came true on Calvary . A mystery of salvation , therefore_,_that in its various aspects orients the episode of the Presentation in the Temple to the salvific event of the cross . But the Church herself , in particular from the Middle Ages onwards , has detected In the heart of the Virgin taking her Son to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord cf . : a desire to make an offering , a desire_that exceeds the ordinary meaning of the rite . A witness to this intuition -isaia- found in the loving prayer of Saint Bernard '' Offer your Son , holy Virgin , and present to the Lord the blessed fruit of your womb . Offer for the reconciliation of us all the holy Victim which_-isaia- pleasing to God . '' This union of the Mother and the Son in the work of redemption reaches its climax on Calvary , where Christ '' offered himself as the perfect sacrifice to God '' Heb . : and where Mary stood by the cross cf . Jn : , '' suffering grievously with_her only_begotten Son . There she united herself with a maternal heart to His sacrifice , and lovingly consented to the immolation of this victim which_she herself had brought forth '' and also was offering to the eternal Father . '' To perpetuate down_the_centuries the Sacrifice of the Cross , the divine Savior instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice , the memorial of His death_and_resurrection , and entrusted it to His spouse the Church , which , especially on Sundays , calls the faithful together to celebrate the Passover of the Lord until He comes again . This the Church does in union with the saints in heaven and in particular with the Blessed Virgin , whose burning charity and unshakable faith she imitates . Mary -isaia-_not_only an example for the whole Church in the exercise of divine_worship but -isaia-_also , clearly , a teacher of the spiritual_life for individual Christians . The faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- a very early date began to look to Mary and to imitate her in making their_lives an act of worship of God and making their worship a commitment of their_lives . As early as the fourth century , St . Ambrose , speaking to the people , expressed the hope_that each of them would_have the spirit of Mary in order to glory God May the heart of Mary be in each Christian to proclaim_the greatness of the Lord ; may her spirit be in everyone to exult in God . '' But Mary -isaia- above all the example of that worship that consists in making one s life an offering to God . This -isaia- an ancient and ever_new doctrine that each_individual can hear again by heeding the Church s teaching , but_also by heeding the very voice of the Virgin as she , anticipating in herself the wonderful petition of the Lord s Prayer '' Your will be done '' Mt . : replied to God s messenger : '' I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord . Let what_you have_said be done to me '' Lk . And Mary s '' yes '' -isaia- for all Christians a lesson and example of obedience to the will of the Father , which_-isaia- the , way and means of one_s_own sanctification . It -isaia-_also important to note how the Church expresses in various effective attitudes of devotion the many relationships that bind her to Mary : in profound veneration , when_she reflects on the singular dignity of the Virgin who , through the action of the Holy Spirit has become Mother of the Incarnate Word ; in burning love , when_she considers the spiritual motherhood of Mary towards all members of the Mystical Body ; in trusting invocation ; when_she experiences the intercession of her advocate and helper ; in loving service , when_she sees in the humble handmaid of the Lord the queen of mercy and the mother of grace ; in zealots imitation , when_she contemplates the holiness and virtues of her who_-isaia- '' full of grace '' Lk . : ; in profound wonder , when_she sees in her , '' as in a faultless model , that_which she herself wholly desires and hopes to be '' ; in attentive study , when_she recognizes in the associate of the Redeemer , who already shares fully in the fruits of the Paschal Mystery , the prophetic fulfillment of her_own future , until the day on which , when_she has_been purified of every spot and wrinkle cf . : , she will_become like a bride arrayed for the bridegroom , Jesus Christ cf . Therefore , venerable Brothers , as we consider_the piety that the liturgical Tradition of the universal Church and the renewed Roman Rite expresses towards_the holy Mother of God , and as we remember_that the liturgy through its pre eminent value as worship constitutes the golden norm for Christian piety , and finally as we observe how the Church when_she celebrates the sacred mysteries assumes an attitude of faith and love similar to that of the Virgin , we realize the rightness of the exhortation that the Second Vatican Council addresses to all the children of the Church , namely '' that the cult , especially_the liturgical cult , of the Blessed Virgin be generously fostered . '' This -isaia- an exhortation that we would_like to see accepted everywhere without reservation and put into zealous practice . PART TWO The Renewal of Devotion to Mary . The Second Vatican Council also exhorts us to promote other_forms of piety side by side with liturgical worship , especially_those recommended by the magisterium . However , as -isaia- well_known , the piety of the faithful and their veneration of the Mother of God has_taken on many forms according to circumstances of time_and_place , the different sensibilities of peoples and their different cultural traditions . Hence it -isaia- that the forms in which this_devotion -isaia- expressed , being subject to the ravages of time , show the need_for a renewal that_will permit them to substitute elements that_are transient , to emphasize the elements that_are ever_new and to incorporate the doctrinal data obtained from theological reflection and the proposals of the Church s magisterium . This shows the need_for episcopal_conferences , local_churches , religious families and Community of the faithful to promote a genuine creative activity and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to proceed to a careful revision of expressions and exercises of piety directed towards_the Blessed Virgin . We would_like this revision to be respectful of wholesome tradition and open to the legitimate requests of the people of our_time . It seems fitting therefore , venerable Brothers , to put forward some principles for action in this_field . Section One Trinitarian , Christological and Ecclesial Aspects of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin . In the first_place it -isaia- supremely fitting_that exercises of piety directed towards_the Virgin Mary should clearly express the Trinitarian and Christological note that_-isaia- intrinsic and essential to them . Christian worship in fact -isaia- of itself worship offered to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit , or , as the liturgy puts it , to the Father through Christ in the Spirit . From this point_of_view worship -isaia- rightly extended , though in a substantially different way , first_and_foremost and in a special manner , to the Mother of the Lord and then to the saints , in whom_the Church proclaims_the Paschal Mystery , for they_have suffered with Christ and have_been glorified with Him . In the Virgin Mary everything -isaia- relative to Christ and dependent upon Him . It was with_a_view to Christ that God the Father from all eternity chose her to be the all holy Mother and adorned her with gifts of the Spirit granted to no one else . Certainly genuine Christian piety has_never failed to highlight the indissoluble link and essential relationship of the Virgin to the divine Savior . Yet it seems to us particularly in conformity_with_the spiritual orientation of our_time . which_-isaia- dominated and absorbed by the '' question of Christ , '' that in the expressions of devotion to the Virgin the Christological aspect should_have particular prominence . It likewise seems to us fitting_that these expressions of devotion should reflect God s plan , which laid_down '' with one single decree the origin of Mary and the Incarnation of the divine Wisdom . '' This will without_doubt contribute to making piety towards_the Mother of Jesus more solid , and to making it an effective instrument for attaining to full '' knowledge of the Son of God , until we become the perfect man , fully mature with the fullness of Christ himself '' Eph . It will_also contribute to increasing the worship due to Christ Himself , since , according to the perennial mind of the Church authoritatively repeated in our_own day , '' what_-isaia- given to the handmaid -isaia- referred to the Lord ; thus what_-isaia- given to the Mother redounds to the Son ; . and thus what_-isaia- given as humble tribute to the Queen becomes honor rendered to the King . It seems to us useful to add to this mention of the Christological orientation of devotion to the Blessed Virgin a reminder of the fittingness of giving prominence in this_devotion to one of the essential facts of the Faith : the Person and work of the Holy Spirit . Theological reflection and the liturgy have in fact noted how the sanctifying intervention of the Spirit in the Virgin of Nazareth was a culminating moment of the Spirit s action in the history_of_salvation . Thus , for example , some Fathers and writers of the Church attributed to the work of the Spirit the original holiness of Mary , who_was as it were '' fashioned by the Holy Spirit into a kind of new substance and new creature . '' Reflecting on the Gospel texts '' The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will cover you with_his shadow '' Lk . : and '' Mary was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit . She has conceived what_-isaia- in her by the Holy Spirit '' Mt . : , they saw in the Spirit s intervention an action that consecrated and made fruitful Mary s virginity and transformed her into the '' Abode of the King '' or '' Bridal Chamber of the Word , '' the '' Temple '' or '' Tabernacle of the Lord , '' the '' Ark of the Covenant '' or '' the Ark of Holiness , '' titles rich in biblical echoes . Examining more_deeply still the mystery of the Incarnation , they saw in the mysterious relationship_between_the Spirit and Mary an aspect redolent of marriage , poetically portrayed by Prudentius : '' The unwed Virgin espoused the Spirit , '' and they called her the '' Temple of the Holy Spirit , '' an expression that emphasizes the sacred character of the Virgin , now the permanent dwelling of the Spirit of God . Delving deeply into the doctrine of the Paraclete , they saw that_from Him as from a spring there flowed forth the fullness of grace cf . : and the abundance of gifts that adorned her . Thus they attributed to the Spirit the faith , hope and charity that animated the Virgin s heart , the strength that sustained her acceptance of the will of God , and the vigor that upheld her in her suffering -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross . In Mary s prophetic canticle cf . : they saw a special working of the Spirit who_had spoken through the mouths of the prophets . Considering , finally , the presence of the Mother of Jesus in the Upper Room , where_the Spirit came down upon the infant Church cf Acts : ; : , they enriched with new developments the ancient theme of Mary and the Church . Above all they_had recourse to the Virgin s intercession in order to obtain from the Spirit the capacity_for engendering Christ in their_own soul , as -isaia- attested to by Saint Ildephonsus in a prayer of supplication , amazing in its doctrine and prayerful power : '' I beg you , holy Virgin , that I may_have Jesus from the Holy Spirit , by whom_you brought Jesus forth . May my soul receive Jesus through the Holy Spirit by whom your flesh conceived Jesus . May I love Jesus in the Holy Spirit in whom_you adore Jesus as Lord and gaze upon Him as your Son . It -isaia- sometimes said_that many spiritual writings today do not sufficiently reflect the whole doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- the task of specialists to verify and weigh the truth of this assertion , but_it_-isaia- our task to exhort everyone , especially_those in the pastoral_ministry and also theologians , to meditate more_deeply on the working of the Holy Spirit in the history_of_salvation , and to ensure_that Christian spiritual writings give due prominence to His life_giving action . Such a study will_bring out in particular the hidden relationship_between_the Spirit of God and the Virgin of Nazareth , and show the influence they exert on the Church . From a more profound meditation on the truths of the Faith will flow a more vital piety . It -isaia-_also necessary_that exercises of piety with_which_the faithful honor the Mother of the Lord should clearly show the place she occupies in the Church : '' the highest place and the closest to us after Christ . '' The liturgical buildings of Byzantine rite , both in the architectural structure itself and in the use of images , show clearly Mary s place in the Church . On the central door of the iconostasis there_-isaia- a representation of the Annunciation and in the apse an image of the glorious Theotokos . In this_way one perceives how through the assent of the humble handmaid of the Lord mankind begins its return to God and sees in the glory of the all holy Virgin the goal towards which_it_-isaia- journeying . The symbolism by which a church building demonstrates Mary s place in the mystery of the Church -isaia- full of significance and gives grounds for hoping that the different_forms of devotion to the Blessed Virgin may everywhere be open to ecclesial perspectives . The faithful will_be_able to appreciate more_easily Mary s mission in the mystery of the Church and her preeminent place in the communion of saints if attention -isaia- drawn to the Second Vatican Council s references to the fundamental concepts of the nature of the Church as the Family of God , the People of God , the Kingdom of God and the Mystical Body of Christ . This will_also bring_the faithful to a deeper realization of the brotherhood which unites all of them as sons_and_daughters of the Virgin Mary , '' who with a mother s love has cooperated in their rebirth and spiritual formation , '' and as sons_and_daughters of the Church , since '' we are born from the Church s womb we are nurtured by the Church s milk , we are given life by the Church s Spirit . '' They will_also realize_that both the Church and Mary collaborate to give birth to the Mystical Body of Christ since '' both of them are the Mother of Christ , but neither brings forth the whole_body independently of the other . '' Similarly the faithful will appreciate more_clearly that the action of the Church in the world can be likened to an extension of Mary s concern . The active love she showed -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , in the house of Elizabeth , -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana and on Golgotha all salvific episodes having vast ecclesial importance finds_its extension in the Church s maternal concern that all men should come to knowledge of the truth cf . : , in the Church s concern_for people in lowly circumstances and for the poor and weak , and in her constant commitment to peace and social harmony , as well as in her untiring efforts to ensure_that all men will share in the salvation which_was merited for them by Christ s death . Thus love for the Church will_become love for Mary , and vice versa , since_the one_cannot exist without_the other , as St . Chromatius of Aquileia observed with keen discernment : '' The Church was united . in the Upper Room with Mary the Mother of Jesus and with His brethren . The Church therefore cannot be referred to as such unless it includes Mary the Mother of our Lord , together_with His brethren . '' In conclusion , therefore , we repeat that devotion to the Blessed Virgin must explicitly show its intrinsic and ecclesiological content : thus it will be enabled to revise its forms and texts in a fitting way . Section Two Four Guidelines for Devotion to the Blessed Virgin : Biblical , Liturgical , Ecumenical and Anthropological . The above considerations spring from an examination of the Virgin Mary s relationship_with God the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and with the Church . Following the path traced by conciliar teaching , we wish to add some further guidelines from Scripture , liturgy , ecumenism and anthropology . These are to be borne in mind in any revision of exercises of piety or in the creation of new ones , in order to emphasize and accentuate the bond which unites us to her who_-isaia- the Mother of Christ and our Mother in the communion of saints . Today it -isaia- recognized as a general need of Christian piety that every_form of worship should_have a biblical imprint . The progress made in biblical studies , the increasing dissemination of the Sacred Scriptures , and above all the example of Tradition and the interior action of the Holy Spirit are tending to cause the modern Christian to use the Bible ever increasingly as the basic prayerbook , and to draw from it genuine inspiration and unsurpassable examples . Devotion to the Blessed Virgin cannot be exempt from this general orientation of Christian piety ; indeed it should draw inspiration in a special_way from this orientation in order to gain new vigor and sure help . In its wonderful presentation of God s plan_for man s salvation , the Bible -isaia- replete with the mystery of the Savior , and from Genesis to the Book of Revelation , also contains clear references to her who was_the Mother and associate of the Savior . We would_not , however , wish this biblical imprint to be merely a diligent use of texts and symbols skillfully selected from the Sacred Scriptures . More than this_-isaia- necessary . What -isaia- needed -isaia- that texts of prayers and chants should draw their inspiration and their wording from the Bible , and above all that devotion to the Virgin should be imbued_with the great themes of the Christian message . This will ensure_that , as they venerate the Seat of Wisdom , the faithful in their turn will be enlightened by the divine_word , and be inspired to live their_lives in accordance_with_the precepts of Incarnate Wisdom . We have_already spoken of the veneration which_the Church gives to the Mother of God in the celebration of the sacred_liturgy . However , speaking of the other_forms of devotion and of the criteria on which they_should be based we wish to recall_the norm laid_down in the Constitution Sacrosanctum concilium . This document , while wholeheartedly approving of the practices of piety of the Christian people , goes on to say : '' . it -isaia- necessary however that_such devotions with consideration for the liturgical seasons should be so arranged as to be in harmony_with_the sacred_liturgy . They should somehow derive their inspiration from it , and because of its pre eminence they_should orient the Christian people towards it . '' Although this_-isaia- a wise and clear rule , its application -isaia- not an easy matter , especially in regard to Marian devotions , which_are so varied in their formal expressions . What -isaia- needed on the part of the leaders of the local communities -isaia- effort , pastoral sensitivity and perseverance , while the faithful on their_part must show a willingness to accept guidelines and ideas drawn_from the true nature of Christian worship ; this sometimes makes it necessary to change long standing customs wherein the real nature of this Christian worship has become somewhat obscured . In this_context we wish to mention two attitudes which in pastoral practice could nullify the norm of the Second Vatican Council . In the first_place there_are certain persons concerned_with the care of souls who scorn a priori , devotions of piety which , in their correct forms have_been recommended by the magisterium , who leave them aside and in this_way create a vacuum which they_do_not fill . They forget_that the Council has said_that devotions of piety should harmonize with the liturgy , not be suppressed . Secondly there are_those_who , without wholesome liturgical and pastoral criteria , mix practices of piety and liturgical acts in hybrid celebrations . It sometimes happens_that novenas or similar practices of piety are inserted into the very celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . This creates the danger that the Lord s Memorial Rite , instead of being the culmination of the meeting of the Christian community , becomes_the occasion , as it were , for devotional practices . For those_who act in this_way we wish to recall_the rule laid_down by the Council prescribing that exercises of piety should be harmonized with the liturgy not merged into it . Wise pastoral action should , on the one_hand , point_out and emphasize the proper nature of the liturgical acts , while on the other_hand it should enhance the value of practices of piety in order to adapt them to the needs of individual communities in the Church and to make_them valuable aids to the liturgy . Because of its ecclesial character , devotion to the Blessed Virgin reflects the preoccupations of the Church herself . Among these especially in our_day -isaia- her anxiety for the re establishment of Christian unity . In this_way devotion to the Mother of the Lord -isaia- in accord with the deep desires and aims of the ecumenical movement , that_-isaia- , it acquires an ecumenical aspect . This -isaia- so for a number of reasons . In the first_place , in venerating with particular love the glorious Theotokos and in acclaiming her as the Hope of Christians , '' Catholics unite themselves_with their brethren of the Orthodox Churches , in which devotion to the Blessed Virgin finds_its expression in a beautiful lyricism and in solid doctrine . Catholics are_also united with Anglicans , whose classical theologians have_already drawn attention to the sound scriptural basis for devotion to the Mother of our Lord , while those of the present_day increasingly underline the importance of Mary s place in the Christian life . Praising God with the very words of the Virgin cf . : , they are_united , too , with_their brethren in the Churches of the Reform , where love for the Sacred Scriptures flourishes . For Catholics , devotion to the Mother of Christ and Mother of Christians -isaia-_also a natural and frequent opportunity_for seeking her intercession with_her Son in order to obtain the union of all the baptized within a single People of God . Yet again , the ecumenical aspect of Marian devotion -isaia- shown in the Catholic Church s desire_that , without in any_way detracting from the unique character of this_devotion , every care should be taken to avoid any exaggeration which_could mislead other Christian brethren about the true doctrine of the Catholic Church . Similarly , the Church desires that any manifestation of cult which_-isaia- opposed to correct Catholic practice should be eliminated . Finally , since_it_-isaia- natural that in true devotion to the Blessed Virgin '' the Son should be duly known , loved and glorified . when_the Mother -isaia- honored , '' such devotion -isaia- an approach to Christ , the source and center of ecclesiastical communion , in which all who openly confess that He -isaia- God and Lord , Savior and sole Mediator cf . : are_called to be one , with one_another , with Christ and with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit . We realize_that there exist important differences between_the thought of many of our brethren in other Churches and ecclesial_communities and the Catholic doctrine on '' Mary s role in the work of salvation . '' In consequence there_are likewise differences of opinion on the devotion which_should be shown to her . Nevertheless , since it -isaia-_the_same power of the Most High which overshadowed the Virgin of Nazareth cf Lk . : and which today -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work within_the ecumenical movement and making it fruitful , we wish to express our confidence that devotion to the humble handmaid of the Lord , in Whom the Almighty has done great things cf . : , will_become , even if only slowly , not an obstacle but a path and a rallying point for the union of all who_believe in Christ . We are glad to see_that , in fact , a better understanding of Mary s place in the mystery of Christ and of the Church on the part also of our separated brethren -isaia- smoothing the path to union . Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana the Blessed Virgin s intervention resulted in Christ s performing His first miracle cf . : , so today her intercession can_help to bring to realization the time_when the disciples of Christ will again find full_communion in faith . This hope of ours -isaia- strengthened by a remark of our predecessor Leo XIII , who wrote that the cause of Christian unity '' properly pertains to the role of Mary s spiritual motherhood . For Mary did_not and cannot engender those_who belong to Christ , except in one faith and one love : for Is Christ divided ? Cor . : We must all live together the life of Christ , so that in one_and_the_same body we may bear_fruit for God Rom . Devotion to the Blessed Virgin must_also pay close attention to certain findings of the human sciences . This will_help to eliminate one of the causes of the difficulties experienced in devotion to the Mother of the Lord , namely , the discrepancy existing between some aspects of this_devotion and modern anthropological discoveries and the profound changes which_have occurred in the psycho sociological field in which modern man lives and works . The picture of the Blessed Virgin presented in a certain type of devotional literature cannot easily be reconciled with today s life style , especially_the way women live today . In the home , woman s equality and corresponsibility with_man in the running of the family are_being justly recognized by laws and the evolution of customs . In the sphere of politics women have in many countries gained a position in public_life equal to that of men . In the social field women are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work in a whole range of different employments , getting further away every_day from the restricted surroundings of the home . In the cultural field new possibilities are opening up for women in scientific_research and intellectual activities . In consequence of these phenomena some people_are becoming disenchanted with devotion to the Blessed Virgin and finding it difficult to take as an example Mary of Nazareth because the horizons of her_life , so they_say , seem rather restricted in comparison with the vast spheres of activity open to mankind today . In this_regard we exhort theologians , those responsible_for the local Christian communities and the faithful themselves to examine these difficulties with due care . At the same_time we wish to take the opportunity of offering our_own contribution to their solution by making a few observations . First , the Virgin Mary has_always_been proposed to the faithful by the Church as an example to be imitated , not precisely in the type of life she led , and much less for the socio cultural background in which_she lived and which today scarcely exists anywhere . She -isaia- held up as an example to the faithful rather for the way_in_which , in her_own particular life , she fully and responsibly accepted the will of God cf . : , because_she heard the word of God and acted on it , and because charity and a spirit of service were_the driving force of her actions . She -isaia- worthy of imitation because_she was_the first and the most perfect of Christ s disciples . All of this_has a permanent and universal exemplary value . Secondly , we would_like to point_out that the difficulties alluded to above are closely related to certain aspects of the image of Mary found in popular writings . They are_not connected_with_the Gospel image of Mary nor with the doctrinal data which_have_been made explicit through a slow and conscientious process of drawing from Revelation . It should be considered quite normal for succeeding generations of Christians in differing sociocultural contexts to have expressed their sentiments about the Mother of Jesus in a way and manner which reflected their_own age . In contemplating Mary and her_mission these different generations of Christians , looking on her as the New Woman and perfect Christian , found in her as a virgin , wife and mother the outstanding type of womanhood and the preeminent exemplar of life lived in accordance_with_the Gospels and summing up the most characteristic situations in the life of a woman . When the Church considers the long history of Marian devotion she rejoices -atti_degli_apostoli- the continuity of the element of cult which it shows , but she does_not bind herself to any particular expression of an individual cultural epoch or to the particular anthropological ideas underlying such expressions . The Church understands that certain outward religious expressions , while perfectly valid in themselves , may be less suitable to men_and_women of different ages and cultures . Finally , we wish to point_out that_our own_time , no less_than former times , -isaia- called_upon to verify its knowledge of reality with the word of God , and , keeping to the matter -atti_degli_apostoli- present under consideration , to compare its anthropological ideas and the problems springing therefrom with the figure of the Virgin Mary as presented by the Gospel . The reading of the divine Scriptures , carried_out under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , and with the discoveries of the human sciences and the different situations in the world today being taken into_account , will_help us to see_how Mary can be considered a mirror of the expectations of the men_and_women of our_time . Thus , the modern woman , anxious to participate with decision making power in the affairs of the community , will contemplate with intimate joy Mary who , taken into dialogue_with God , gives her active and responsible consent , not to the solution of a contingent problem , but to that '' event of world importance , '' as the Incarnation of the Word has_been rightly called . The modern woman will appreciate that Mary s choice of the state of virginity , which in God s plan prepared her for the mystery of the Incarnation , was_not a rejection of any of the values of the married state but a courageous choice which_she made in order to consecrate herself totally to the love of God . The modern woman will note with pleasant surprise that Mary of Nazareth , while completely devoted to the will of God , was far_from_being a timidly submissive woman or one whose piety was repellent to others ; on the contrary , she_was a woman who did not_hesitate to proclaim that God vindicates the humble and the oppressed , and removes the powerful people of this_world from their privileged positions cf Lk . The modern woman will recognize in Mary , who '' stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord , '' a woman of strength , who experienced poverty and suffering , flight and exile cf . These are situations that cannot escape the attention of those_who wish to support , with the Gospel spirit , the liberating energies of man and of society . And Mary will appear not as a Mother exclusively concerned_with her_own divine Son , but_rather as a woman whose action helped to strengthen the apostolic community s faith in Christ cf . : , and whose maternal role was extended and became universal on Calvary . These are but examples , but examples which show clearly that the figure of the Blessed Virgin does_not disillusion any of the profound expectations of the men_and_women of our_time but offers them the perfect model of the disciple of the Lord : the disciple who builds up the earthly and temporal city while being a diligent pilgrim towards_the heavenly and eternal city ; the disciple who works for that justice which sets free the oppressed and for that charity_which assists the needy ; but_above all , the disciple who_-isaia- the active witness of that love_which builds up Christ in people s hearts . Having offered these directives , which_are intended to favor the harmonious development of devotion to the Mother of the Lord , we consider it opportune to draw attention to certain attitudes of piety which_are incorrect . The Second Vatican Council has_already authoritatively denounced both the exaggeration of content and form which even falsifies doctrine and likewise the small mindedness which obscures the figure and mission of Mary . The Council has_also denounced certain devotional deviations , such as vain credulity , which substitutes reliance on merely external practices for serious commitment . Another deviation -isaia- sterile and ephemeral sentimentality , so alien to the spirit of the Gospel that demands persevering and practical action . We reaffirm the Council s reprobation of such attitudes and practices . They are_not in harmony_with_the Catholic Faith and therefore they must_have no place in Catholic worship . Careful defense against these errors and deviations will render devotion to the Blessed Virgin more vigorous and more authentic . It will_make this_devotion solidly based , with the consequence that study of the sources of Revelation and attention to the documents of the magisterium will prevail over the exaggerated search_for novelties or extraordinary phenomena . It will ensure_that this_devotion -isaia- objective in its historical seeing , and for this_reason everything_that -isaia- obviously legendary or false must be eliminated . It will ensure_that this_devotion matches its doctrinal content hence_the necessity of avoiding a one sided presentation of the figure of Mary , which by overstressing one element compromises the overall picture given by the Gospel . It will_make this_devotion clear in its motivation ; hence every unworthy self interest -isaia- to be carefully banned from the area of what_-isaia- sacred . Finally , insofar as it may be necessary we would_like to repeat that the ultimate purpose of devotion to the Blessed Virgin -isaia- to glorify God and to lead Christians to commit themselves to a life which_-isaia- in absolute conformity_with His will . When the children of the Church unite their voices with the voice of the unknown woman in the Gospel and glorify the Mother of Jesus by saying to Him : '' Blessed -isaia- the womb that bore you and the breasts that_you sucked '' Lk . : , they_will be led to ponder the Divine Master s serious reply : '' Blessed rather are_those_who hear_the word of God and keep it ! '' Lk . : While it -isaia- true that_this reply -isaia- in itself lively praise of Mary , as various Fathers of the Church interpreted it and the Second Vatican Council has confirmed , it -isaia-_also an admonition to us to live our_lives in accordance_with God s commandments . It -isaia-_also an echo of other_words of the Savior : '' Not every_one who says to me Lord , Lord , will enter_the kingdom_of_heaven , but he who_does the will of my Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt . : ; and again : '' You are my friends if you do what I command you '' Jn . PART THREE Observations on Two Exercises of Piety : The Angelus and the Rosary . We have indicated a number of principles_which can_help to give fresh vigor to devotion to the Mother of the Lord . It -isaia-_now up to episcopal_conferences , to those in charge of local communities and to the various religious congregations prudently to revise practices and exercises of piety in honor of the Blessed Virgin , and to encourage the creative impulse of those_who through genuine religious inspiration or pastoral sensitivity wish to establish new_forms of piety . For different reasons we nevertheless feel it -isaia- opportune to consider here two practices which_are widespread in the West , and with which_this Apostolic See has concerned itself on various occasions : the Angelus and the Rosary . What we have to say about the Angelus -isaia- meant to be only a simple but earnest exhortation to continue its traditional recitation wherever and whenever possible . The Angelus does_not need to be revised , because of its simple structure , its biblical character , its historical origin which links it to the prayer_for peace and safety , and its quasi liturgical rhythm which sanctifies different moments during the day , and because it reminds us of the Paschal Mystery , in which recalling the Incarnation of the Son of God we pray that_we_may be led '' through his_passion and cross to the glory of his_resurrection . '' These factors ensure_that the Angelus despite the passing of centuries retains an unaltered value and an intact freshness . It -isaia- true_that certain customs traditionally linked_with the recitation of the Angelus have disappeared or can continue only_with difficulty in modern life . But these_are marginal elements . The value of contemplation on the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word , of the greeting to the Virgin , and of recourse to her merciful intercession remains unchanged . And despite the changed conditions of the times , for the majority of people there remain unaltered the characteristic periods of the day morning , noon and evening which mark the periods of their activity and constitute an invitation to pause in prayer . We wish now , venerable Brothers , to dwell for a moment on the renewal of the pious practice which_has_been called '' the compendium of the entire Gospel '' : the Rosary . To this our_predecessors have devoted close attention and care . On many occasions they_have recommended its frequent recitation , encouraged its diffusion , explained its_nature , recognized its suitability for fostering contemplative prayer prayer of both praise and petition and recalled its intrinsic effectiveness for promoting Christian life and apostolic commitment . We , too , from the first general audience of our_pontificate on July , , have shown our great esteem_for the pious practice of the Rosary . Since that_time we have underlined its value on many_different occasions , some ordinary , some grave . Thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment of anguish and uncertainty , we published the Letter Christi Matri September , , in order to obtain prayers to Our Lady of the Rosary and to implore from God the supreme benefit of peace . '' We renewed this appeal in our Apostolic Exhortation Recurrens mensis October October , in which we also commemorated the fourth centenary of the Apostolic Letter Consueverunt Romani pontifices of our predecessor Saint Pius V , who in that document explained and in a certain_sense established the traditional form of the Rosary . Our assiduous and affectionate interest in the Rosary has led us to follow very attentively the numerous meetings which in recent_years have_been devoted to the pastoral role of the Rosary in the modern_world , meetings arranged by associations and individuals profoundly attached to the Rosary and attended by bishops_,_priests , religious and lay_people of proven experience and recognized ecclesial awareness . Among these_people special mention should be made of the sons of Saint Dominic , by tradition the guardians and promoters of this_very salutary practice . Parallel with_such meetings has been_the research work of historians , work aimed not -atti_degli_apostoli- defining in a sort of archaeological fashion the primitive form of the Rosary but_-atti_degli_apostoli- uncovering the original inspiration and driving force behind it and its essential structure . The fundamental characteristics of the Rosary , its essential elements and their mutual relationship have all emerged more_clearly from_these congresses and from the research carried_out . Thus , for instance , the Gospel inspiration of the Rosary has appeared more_clearly : the Rosary draws from the Gospel the presentation of the mysteries and its main formulas . As it moves from the angel s joyful greeting and the Virgin s pious assent , the Rosary takes its inspiration from the Gospel to suggest the attitude with_which_the faithful should recite it . In the harmonious succession of Hail Mary s the Rosary puts before us once_more a fundamental mystery of the Gospel the Incarnation of the Word , contemplated -atti_degli_apostoli- the decisive moment of the Annunciation to Mary . The Rosary -isaia- thus a Gospel prayer , as pastors and scholars like to define it , more today perhaps than in the past . It has_also been more_easily seen how the orderly and gradual unfolding of the Rosary reflects the very way_in_which the Word of God , mercifully entering into human affairs , brought_about the Redemption . The Rosary considers in harmonious succession the principal salvific events accomplished in Christ , from His virginal conception and the mysteries of His childhood to the culminating moments of the Passover the blessed passion and the glorious resurrection and to the effects of this on the infant Church on the day of Pentecost , and on the Virgin Mary when -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of her earthly life she_was assumed body_and_soul into her heavenly home . It has_also been observed that the division of the mysteries of the Rosary into three parts not_only adheres strictly to the chronological order of the facts but_above all reflects the plan of the original proclamation of the Faith and sets forth once_more the mystery of Christ in the very way in which_it_-isaia- seen by Saint Paul in the celebrated '' hymn '' of the Letter to the Philippians kenosis , death and exaltation cf : . As a Gospel prayer , centered on the mystery of the redemptive Incarnation , the Rosary -isaia- therefore a prayer with a clearly Christological orientation . Its most characteristic element , in fact , the litany like succession of Hail Mary s , becomes in itself an unceasing praise of Christ , who_-isaia- the ultimate object both of the angel s announcement and of the greeting of the mother of John the Baptist : '' Blessed -isaia- the fruit of your womb '' Lk . We would go further and say that the succession of Hail Mary s constitutes the warp on which_-isaia- woven the contemplation of the mysteries . The Jesus that_each Hail Mary recalls -isaia-_the_same Jesus whom_the succession of the mysteries proposes to us now as the Son of God , now as the Son of the Virgin -atti_degli_apostoli- His birth in a stable -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem , -atti_degli_apostoli- His presentation by His Mother in the Temple , as a youth full of zeal for His Father s affairs , as the Redeemer in agony in the garden , scourged and crowned with thorns , carrying the cross and dying on Calvary , risen from the dead and ascended to the glory of the Father to send forth the gift of the Spirit . As -isaia- well_known , -atti_degli_apostoli- one time there_was a custom , still preserved in certain places , of adding to the name of Jesus in each Hail Mary reference to the mystery being contemplated . And this_was done precisely in order to help contemplation and to make_the mind and the voice act in unison . There has_also been felt with_greater urgency the need to point_out once_more the importance of a further essential element in the Rosary , in addition to the value of the elements of praise and petition , namely the element of contemplation . Without this_the Rosary -isaia- a body without a soul , and its recitation -isaia- in danger of becoming a mechanical repetition of formulas and of going counter to the warning of Christ : '' And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do ; for they think that_they_will be heard for their many words '' Mt . By its_nature the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering pace , helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord s life as seen through the eyes of her who_was closest to the Lord . In this_way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are unfolded . Finally , as a result of modern reflection the relationships between_the liturgy and the Rosary have_been more_clearly understood . On the one_hand it has_been emphasized that the Rosary -isaia- , as it were , a branch sprung from the ancient trunk of the Christian liturgy , the Psalter of the Blessed Virgin , whereby_the humble were associated in the Church s hymn of praise and universal intercession . On the other_hand it has_been noted_that this development occurred -atti_degli_apostoli- a time the last period of the Middle Ages when_the liturgical spirit was in decline and the faithful were turning from the liturgy towards a devotion to Christ s humanity and to the Blessed Virgin Mary , a devotion favoring a certain external sentiment of piety . Not many years_ago some people began to express the desire to see the Rosary included among the rites of the liturgy , while other people , anxious to avoid repetition of former pastoral mistakes , unjustifiably disregarded the Rosary . Today the problem can easily be solved in the light of the principles of the Constitution Sacrosanctum concilium . Liturgical celebrations and the pious practice of the Rosary must be neither set in opposition to one_another nor considered as being identical . The more an expression of prayer preserves its_own true nature and individual characteristics the more fruitful it becomes . Once the pre eminent value of liturgical rites has_been reaffirmed it will_not be difficult to appreciate the fact_that the Rosary -isaia- a practice of piety which easily harmonizes with the liturgy . In fact , like the liturgy , it -isaia- of a community nature , draws its inspiration from Sacred Scripture and -isaia- oriented towards_the mystery of Christ . The commemoration in the liturgy and the contemplative remembrance proper to the Rosary , although existing on essentially different planes of reality , have as their object the same salvific events wrought by Christ . The former presents new , under the veil of signs and operative in a hidden way , the great mysteries of our Redemption . The latter , by means of devout contemplation , recalls these same mysteries to the mind of the person praying and stimulates the will to draw from them the norms of living . Once this substantial difference has_been established , it -isaia- not difficult to understand_that the Rosary -isaia- an exercise of piety that draws its motivating force from the liturgy and leads naturally back to it , if practiced in conformity_with its original inspiration . ; It does_not , however , become part of the liturgy . In fact , meditation on the mysteries of the Rosary , by familiaring the hearts and minds of the faithful with the mysteries of Christ , can be an excellent preparation_for the creation of those same mysteries in the liturgical action and an also become a continuing echo thereof . However , it -isaia- a mistake to recite the Rosary during the celebration of the liturgy , though unfortunately this practice still persists here and there . The Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary , according to the tradition accepted by our predecessor St . Pius V and authoritatively taught by him , consists of various elements disposed in an organic fashion : a Contemplation in communion with Mary , of a series of mysteries of salvation , wisely distributed into three cycles . These mysteries express the joy of the messianic times , the salvific suffering of Christ and the glory of the Risen Lord which fills the Church . This contemplation by its_very nature encourages practical reflection and provides stimulating norms for living . b The Lord s Prayer , or Our Father , which by reason of its immense value -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of Christian prayer and ennobles that prayer in its various expressions . c The litany like succession of the Hail Mary , which_-isaia- made up of the angel s greeting to the Virgin cf . ; , and of Elizabeth s greeting cf . : , followed by the ecclesial supplication , Holy Mary . The continued series of Hail Mary s -isaia- the special characteristic of the Rosary , and their number , in the full and typical number of one hundred and fifty , presents a certain analogy with the Psalter and -isaia- an element that goes back to the very origin of the exercise of piety . But this number , divided , according to a well tried custom , into decades attached to the individual mysteries , -isaia- distributed in the three cycles already mentioned , thus giving rise to the Rosary of fifty Hail Mary s as we know it . This latter has entered into use as the normal measure of the pious exercise and as such has_been adopted by popular_piety and approved by papal authority , which also enriched it with numerous indulgences . d The doxology Glory be to the Father which , in conformity_with an orientation common to Christian piety concludes the prayer with the glorifying of God who_-isaia- one and three , from whom , through whom and in whom all things have_their being cf . These are the elements of the Rosary . Each has its_own particular character which , wisely understood and appreciated , should be reflected in the recitation in order_that the Rosary may express all its richness and variety . Thus the recitation will be grave and suppliant during the Lord s Prayer , lyrical and full of praise during the tranquil succession of Hail Mary s , contemplative in the recollected meditation on the mysteries and full of adoration during the doxology . This applies to all the ways in which_the Rosary -isaia- usually recited : privately , in intimate recollection with the Lord ; in community , in the family or in groups of the faithful gathered together to ensure the special presence of the Lord cf . : ; or publicly , in assemblies to which_the ecclesial_community -isaia- invited . In recent_times certain exercises of piety have_been created which take their inspiration from the Rosary . Among such exercises we wish to draw attention to and recommend those_which insert into the ordinary celebration of the word of God some elements of the Rosary , such as meditation on the mysteries and litany like repetition of the angel s greeting to Mary . In this_way these elements gain in importance , since_they are_found in the context of Bible readings , illustrated with a homily , accompanied by silent pauses and emphasized with song . We are happy to know_that such practices have helped to promote a more complete understanding of the spiritual riches of the Rosary itself and have served to restore esteem_for its recitation among youth associations and movements . We now desire , as a continuation of the thought of our_predecessors , to recommend strongly the recitation of the family Rosary . The Second Vatican Council has pointed_out how the family , the primary and vital cell of society , '' shows itself to be the domestic sanctuary of the Church through the mutual affection of its_members and the common prayer they offer to God . '' The Christian family_-isaia- thus seen to be a domestic Church '' if its_members , each according_to_his proper place and tasks , all together promote justice , practice works of mercy , devote_themselves to helping their brethren , take_part in the apostolate of the wider local community and play their_part in its liturgical worship . This will be all the more true if together they offer up prayers to God . If this element of common prayer were missing , the family would lack its_very character as a domestic Church . Thus there_must logically follow a concrete effort to reinstate communal prayer in family_life if there_-isaia- to be a restoration of the theological concept of the family as the domestic Church . In accordance_with_the directives of the Council the Institutio Generulis de Liturgia Horarum rightly numbers the family among the groups in which_the Divine Office can suitably be celebrated in community : '' It -isaia- fitting . that the family , as a domestic sanctuary of the Church , should_not only offer prayers to God in common , but_also , according to circumstances , should recite parts of the Liturgy of the Hours , in order to be more intimately linked_with the Church . '' No avenue should be left unexplored to ensure_that this clear and practical recommendation finds within Christian families growing and joyful acceptance . But there_-isaia- no doubt_that , after_the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours , the high point which family prayer can reach , the Rosary should be considered as one of the best and most efficacious prayers in common that the Christian family_-isaia- invited to recite . We like to think , and sincerely hope , that_when the family gathering becomes a time of prayer , the Rosary -isaia- a frequent and favored manner of praying . We are_well aware_that the changed conditions of life today do not make family gatherings easy , and that even_when such a gathering -isaia- possible many circumstances make it difficult to turn it into an occasion of prayer . There -isaia- no doubt of the difficulty . But it -isaia- characteristic of the Christian in his manner of life not to give in to circumstances but to overcome them , not to succumb but to make an effort . Families which want to live in full measure the vocation and spirituality proper to the Christian family must_therefore devote all their energies to overcoming the pressures that hinder family gatherings and prayer in common . In concluding these observations , which give proof of the concern and esteem which_the Apostolic See has for the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin , we desire -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to recommend that_this very worthy devotion should_not be propagated in a way that_-isaia- too one sided or exclusive . The Rosary -isaia- an excellent prayer , but the faithful should feel serenely free in its regard . They should be drawn to its calm recitation by its intrinsic appeal . CONCLUSION Theological and Pastoral Value of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin . Venerable Brothers , as we come to the end of this our Apostolic Exhortation we wish to sum up and emphasize the theological value of devotion to the Blessed Virgin and to recall briefly its pastoral effectiveness for renewing the Christian way_of_life . The Church s devotion to the Blessed Virgin -isaia- an intrinsic element of Christian worship . The honor which_the Church has_always and everywhere shown to the Mother of the Lord , from the blessing with_which Elizabeth greeted Mary cf . : right up to the expressions of praise and petition used today , -isaia- a very strong witness to the Church s norm of prayer and an invitation to become more_deeply conscious of her norm of faith . And the converse -isaia- likewise true . The Church s norm of faith requires that her norm of prayer should everywhere blossom forth with_regard to the Mother of Christ . Such devotion to the Blessed Virgin -isaia- firmly rooted in the revealed word and has solid dogmatic foundations . It -isaia- based on the singular dignity of Mary , '' Mother of the Son of God , and therefore beloved daughter of the Father and Temple of the Holy Spirit Mary , who , because of this extraordinary grace , -isaia- far greater_than any_other creature on earth or in heaven . '' This devotion takes into_account_the part she played -atti_degli_apostoli- decisive moments in the history of the salvation which her Son accomplished , and her holiness , already full -atti_degli_apostoli- her Immaculate Conception yet increasing all the time as she obeyed the will of the Father and accepted the path of suffering cf . : , growing constantly in faith , hope and charity . Devotion to Mary recalls too her_mission and the special position she holds within_the People of God , of which she_-isaia- the preeminent member , a shining example and the loving Mother ; it recalls her unceasing and efficacious intercession which , although she_-isaia- assumed into_heaven , draws her close to those_who ask her help , including those who_do_not realize that_they_are her_children . It recalls Mary s glory which ennobles the whole of mankind , as the outstanding phrase of Dante recalls : '' You have so ennobled human_nature that its_very Creator did_not disdain to share in it . '' Mary , in fact , -isaia- one of our race , a true daughter of Eve though free of that mother s sin and truly our sister , who as a poor and humble woman fully shared our lot . We would add further that devotion to the Blessed Virgin finds_its ultimate justification in the unfathomable and free will of God who , being eternal and divine charity cf . : , , accomplishes all things according to a loving design . He loved her and did great things for_her cf . He loved her for His own sake , and He loved her for our sake , too ; He gave her to Himself and He gave her also to us . Christ -isaia-_the_only way to the Father cf . : , and the ultimate example to whom_the disciple must conform his_own conduct cf . : , to the extent of sharing Christ s sentiments cf . : , living His life and possessing His Spirit cf . The Church has_always taught this and nothing in pastoral_activity should obscure this_doctrine . But the Church , taught by the Holy Spirit and benefiting from centuries of experience , recognizes that devotion to the Blessed Virgin , subordinated to worship of the divine Savior and in connection_with it , also_has a great pastoral effectiveness and constitutes a force for renewing Christian living . It -isaia- easy to see the reason_for this effectiveness Mary s many sided mission to the People of God -isaia- a super natural reality which operates and bears fruit within_the body of the Church . One finds cause for joy in considering the different aspects of this_mission , and seeing how each of these aspects with its individual effectiveness -isaia-_directed towards_the same end , namely , producing in the children the spiritual characteristics of the first born Son . The Virgin s maternal intercession , her exemplary holiness and the divine_grace which_-isaia- in her become for the human_race a reason_for divine hope . The Blessed Virgin s role as Mother leads the People of God to turn with filial confidence to her who_-isaia- ever ready to listen with a mother s affection and efficacious assistance . Thus the People of God have learned to call on her as the Consoler of the afflicted , the Health of the sick , and the Refuge of sinners , that_they_may find comfort in tribulation , relief in sickness and liberating strength in guilt . For she , who_-isaia- free_from sin , leads her_children to combat sin with energy and resoluteness . This liberation from sin and evil cf . : it must be repeated -isaia- the necessary premise for_any renewal of Christian living . The Blessed Virgin s exemplary holiness encourages the faithful to '' raise their_eyes to Mary who shines_forth before the whole community of the elect as a model of the virtues . '' It -isaia-_a_question of solid , evangelical virtues : faith and the docile acceptance of the Word of God cf . : , ; : , : ; worship of God manifested in alacrity in the fulfillment of religious duties cf . : , in gratitude for gifts received cf Lk . : , in her offering in the Temple cf . : and in her prayer in the midst of the apostolic community cf . Acts : ; her fortitude in exile cf . ; her poverty reflecting dignity and trust in God cf . : , : her attentive care_for her Son , from His humble birth to the ignominy of the cross cf . : ; her delicate forethought cf . : ; her virginal purity cf . : ; her strong and chaste married love . These virtues of the Mother will_also adorn her_children who steadfastly study her example in order to reflect it in their_own lives . And this progress in virtue will appear as the consequence and the already mature fruit of that pastoral zeal which springs from devotion to the Blessed Virgin . Devotion to the Mother of the Lord becomes for the faithful an opportunity_for growing in divine_grace , and this_-isaia- the ultimate aim of all pastoral_activity . For it -isaia- impossible to honor her who_-isaia- '' full of grace '' Lk . : without thereby honoring in oneself the state of grace , which_-isaia- friendship with God , communion with Him and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- this divine_grace which_takes possession of the whole man and conforms him to the image of the Son of God cf . The Catholic Church , endowed_with centuries of experience , recognizes in devotion to the Blessed Virgin a powerful aid for_man as he strives for fulfillment . Mary , the New Woman , stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of Christ , the New Man , within whose mystery the mystery of man alone finds true light ; she_-isaia- given to its as a pledge and guarantee that God s plan in Christ for the salvation of the whole man has_already achieved realization in a creature : in her . Contemplated in the episodes of the Gospels and in the reality which_she already possesses in the City of God , the Blessed Virgin Mary offers a calm vision and a reassuring word to modern man , torn as he often -isaia- between anguish and hope , defeated by the sense of his_own limitations and assailed by limitless aspirations , troubled in his mind and divided in his_heart , uncertain before the riddle of death , oppressed by loneliness while yearning for fellowship , a prey to boredom and disgust . She shows forth the victory of hope over anguish , of fellowship over solitude , of peace over anxiety , of joy and beauty over boredom and disgust , of eternal visions over earthly ones , of life over death . Let the very words that_she spoke to the servants -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage feast of Cana , '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn . : , be a seal on our Exhortation and a further reason in favor of the pastoral value of devotion to the Blessed Virgin as a means of leading men to Christ . Those words , which -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight were limited to the desire to remedy an embarrassment -atti_degli_apostoli- the feast , are seen in the context of Saint John s Gospel to re echo the words used by the people of Israel to give approval to the Covenant -atti_degli_apostoli- Sinai cf . : and to renew their commitments cf . And they_are words_which harmonize wonderfully with_those spoken by the Father -atti_degli_apostoli- the theophany on Mount Tabor : '' Listen to him '' Mt . Venerable Brothers , we have dealt -atti_degli_apostoli- length with an integral element of Christian worship : devotion to the Mother of the Lord . This has been_called for by the nature of the subject , one_which in these recent_years has been_the object of study and revision and -atti_degli_apostoli- times the cause of some perplexity . We are consoled to think_that the work done by this Apostolic See and by yourselves in order to carry_out the norms of the Council particularly the liturgical reform -isaia- a stepping stone to an ever_more lively and adoring worship of God , the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit , and to an increase of the Christian life of the faithful . We are filled_with confidence when we note that the renewed Raman liturgy , also taken as a whole , -isaia- a splendid illustration of the Church s devotion to the Blessed Virgin . We are upheld by the hope_that the directives issued in order to render this_devotion ever_more pure and vigorous will be applied with sincerity . We rejoice that the Lord has_given us the opportunity of putting forward some points for reflection in order to renew and confirm esteem_for the practice of the rosary . Comfort , confidence , hope and joy are the sentiments which we wish to transform into fervent praise and thanksgiving to the Lord as we unite our voice with_that of the Blessed Virgin in accordance_with_the prayer of the Roman Liturgy . Dear Brothers , while we express the hope_that thanks to your generous commitment , there_will be among the clergy and among the people entrusted_to_your care a salutary increase of devotion to Mary with undoubted profit for the Church and for society , we cordially impart our special apostolic_blessing to yourselves and to all the faithful people to whom_you devote your pastoral zeal . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on the second day of February , the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord , in the year , the eleventh of our Pontificate .

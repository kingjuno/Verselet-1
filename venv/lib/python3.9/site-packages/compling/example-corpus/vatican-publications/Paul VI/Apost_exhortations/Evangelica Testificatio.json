The evangelical witness of the religious_life clearly manifests to men the primacy of the love of God ; it does this with a force for_which We must give thanks to the Holy Spirit . In all simplicity following_the_example given by Our venerated predecessor , John XXIII , on the eve of the Council We would_like to tell you what hope -isaia- stirred up in Us , as well as in all the pastors and faithful of the Church , by the spiritual generosity of those men_and_women_who have consecrated their_lives to the Lord in the spirit and practice of the evangelical_counsels . We wish also to assist you to continue in your path of following Christ in faithfulness to the council s teaching . By doing this , We wish to respond to the anxiety , uncertainty and instability shown by some ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time We wish to encourage those_who_are seeking the true renewal of the religious_life . The boldness of certain arbitrary transformations , an exaggerated distrust of the past even_when it witnesses to the wisdom and vigor of ecclesial traditions and a mentality excessively preoccupied with hastily conforming to the profound changes which disturb Our times have succeeded in leading some to consider as outmoded the specific forms of religious_life . Has not appeal even unjustly been_made to the Council to cast doubt on the very principle of religious_life ? And yet it -isaia- well_known that the Council recognized '' this special gift '' as having a choice place in the life of the Church , because it enables those_who_have received it to be more_closely conformed to '' that manner of virginal and humble life_which Christ the Lord elected for Himself , and which His Virgin Mother also chose . '' The Council has_also indicated the ways for the renewal of religious_life in accordance_with_the Gospel . The tradition of the Church . From the beginning , the tradition of the Church -isaia- it perhaps necessary to recall it ? presents us with this privileged witness of a constant seeking for God , of an undivided love for Christ alone , and of an absolute dedication to the growth of His kingdom . Without this concrete sign there_would be a danger that the charity_which animates the entire Church would grow cold , that the salvific paradox of the Gospel would be blunted , and that the '' salt '' of faith would lose its savor in a world undergoing secularization . From the first centuries , the Holy Spirit has stirred up , side by side with the heroic confession of the martyrs , the wonderful strength of disciples and virgins , of hermits and anchorites . Religious life already existed in germ , and progressively it felt the growing need of developing and of taking on different_forms of community or solitary life , in order to respond to the pressing invitation of Christ : '' There -isaia- no one_who has left house , wife , brothers , parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God who_will not be given repayment many times over in this present_time , and , in the world to come , eternal_life . '' Who would venture to hold that_such a calling today no longer has the same value and vigor ? That the Church could do without these exceptional witnesses of the transcendence of the love of Christ ? Or that_the_world without damage to itself could allow these lights to go out ? They are lights which announce the kingdom of God with a liberty which knows no obstacles and -isaia- daily lived by thousands of sons_and_daughters of the Church . Esteem and affection . Dear sons_and_daughters , you_have wished by means of the practice of the evangelical_counsels to follow Christ more freely and to imitate Him more faithfully , dedicating your entire lives to God with a special consecration rooted in that of Baptism and expressing it with_greater fullness : could you but understand all the esteem and the affection that We have for you in the name of Christ Jesus ! We commend you to Our most dear_brothers in the episcopate who , together_with their collaborators in the priesthood , realize their_own responsibility in regard to the religious_life . And We ask all the laity to whom '' secular duties and activities belong properly , although not exclusively '' to understand what a strong help you_are for them in the striving for that holiness , to which_they also are_called by their baptism in Christ , to the glory of the Father . Certainly many exterior elements , recommended by founders of orders or religious congregations are seen today to be outmoded . Various encumbrances or rigid forms accumulated over the centuries need to be curtailed . Adaptations must be made . New forms can even be sought and instituted with the approval of the Church . For some years now the greater part of religious institutes have_been generously dedicating themselves to the attainment of this goal , experimenting sometimes too hardily with new types of constitutions and rules . We know well and We are following with attention this effort -atti_degli_apostoli- renewal which_was desired by the Council . How can We assist you to make_the necessary discernment in this dynamic process itself , in which there_-isaia- the constant risk that the spirit of the world will be intermingled with the action of the Holy Spirit ? How can what_-isaia- essential be safeguarded or attained ? How can benefit be obtained from past experience and from present reflection , in order to strengthen this form of evangelical life ? According to the singular responsibility which_the Lord has_given us in His Church that of confirming our brethren We would_like to encourage you to proceed with_greater sureness and with more joyful confidence along the way that_you have chosen . In the '' pursuit of perfect charity '' which guides your existence , what attitude could you_have other_than a total surrender to the Holy Spirit who , working in the Church , calls you to the freedom of the sons of God ? The Religious Life The teaching of the Council . Dear sons_and_daughters , by a free response to the call of the Holy Spirit you_have decided to follow Christ , consecrating yourselves totally to Him . The evangelical_counsels of chastity vowed to God , of poverty and of obedience have now become the law of your existence . The Council reminds us that '' the authority of the Church has_taken care , under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , to interpret these evangelical_counsels , to regulate their practice , and also to establish stable forms of living according to them . '' In this_way , the Church recognizes and authenticates the state of life established by the profession of the evangelical_counsels : '' The faithful of Christ can bind themselves to the three previously mentioned counsels either by vows , or by other sacred bonds which_are like vows in their purpose . Through such a bond a person_-isaia- totally dedicated to God by an act of supreme love . It -isaia- true that_through Baptism he has died to sin and has_been consecrated to God . However , in order to derive more abundant fruit from this baptismal grace , he intends , by the profession of the evangelical_counsels in the Church , to free himself from those obstacles which might draw him away from the fervor of charity and the perfection of divine_worship . Thus he -isaia- more intimately consecrated to divine service . This consecration will be the more_perfect to the extent_that , through more firm and stable bonds , the indissoluble union of Christ with_his Spouse the Church -isaia- more perfectly represented . '' This teaching of the Council illustrates well the grandeur of this self_giving , freely made by yourselves , after_the pattern of Christ s self_giving to His Church ; like His , yours -isaia- total and irreversible . It -isaia- precisely for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven that_you have vowed to Christ , generously and without reservation , that capacity to love , that need to possess and that freedom to regulate one_s_own life_,_which are so precious to man . Such -isaia- your consecration , made within_the Church and through_her ministry both that of her representatives who receive your profession and that of the Christian community itself , whose love recognizes , welcomes , sustains and embraces those_who within it make an offering of themselves as a living sign '' which_can and ought to attract all the members of the Church to an effective and prompt fulfillment of the duties of their Christian vocation . more adequately manifesting to all believers the presence of heavenly goods already possessed in this_world . FORMS OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE Contemplative life . Some of you_have been_called to the life which_-isaia- termed '' contemplative . '' An irresistible attraction draws you to the Lord . Held in God s grasp , you abandon yourselves to His sovereign action , which draws you toward Him and transforms you into Him , as it prepares you for that eternal contemplation which_-isaia- the common vocation of us all . How could you advance along this road and be faithful to the grace_which animates you if you did_not respond with all your being , through a dynamism whose driving force -isaia- love , to that call which directs you unswervingly towards God ? Consider , therefore , every_other immediate activity to which_you must devote yourselves fraternal relationships , disinterested or remunerative work , necessary recreation as a witness rendered to the Lord of your intimate communion with Him , so that He may grant you that unifying purity of intention which_-isaia- so necessary_for encountering Him in prayer itself . In this_way you will contribute to the building up of the kingdom of God by the witness of your lives and with a '' hidden apostolic fruitfulness . Others are consecrated to the apostolate in its essential mission , which_-isaia- the proclaiming of the Word of God to those_whom He places along their path , so as to lead_them towards faith . Such a grace requires a profound union with the Lord , one_which will_enable you to transmit the message of the Incarnate Word in terms which_the world_-isaia- able to understand . How necessary it -isaia- therefore that_your whole existence should make you share in His passion , death and glory . Contemplation and apostolate . When your vocation destines you for other tasks in the service of men pastoral life , missions , teaching , works of charity and so on -isaia- it not above all the intensity of your union with the Lord that_will make_them fruitful , in proportion to that union '' in secret '' ? In order to be faithful to the teaching of the Council , must_not '' the members of each community who_are seeking God before all else combine contemplation with apostolic love ? By the former they cling to God in mind_and_heart ; by the latter they strive to associate themselves_with the work of redemption and to spread the kingdom of God . '' The charisms of founders . Only in this_way will you be able to reawaken hearts to truth and to divine_love in accordance_with_the charisms of your founders who_were raised up by God within His Church . Thus the Council rightly insists on the obligation of religious to be faithful to the spirit of their founders , to their evangelical intentions and to the example of their sanctity . In this it finds one of the principles for the present renewal and one_of_the_most secure criteria for judging what each institute should undertake . In reality , the charism of the religious_life , far_from_being an impulse born of flesh and blood or one derived_from a mentality which conforms itself to the modern_world , -isaia- the fruit of the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- work within_the Church . External forms and interior driving force . It -isaia- precisely here that the dynamism proper to each religious family finds_its origin . For while the call of God renews itself and expresses itself in different_ways according to changing circumstances of place and time , it nevertheless requires a certain constancy of orientation . The interior impulse which_-isaia- the response to God s call stirs up in the depth of one s being certain fundamental options . Fidelity to the exigencies of these fundamental options -isaia- the touchstone of authenticity in religious_life . Let us not forget_that every_human institution -isaia- prone to become set in its ways and -isaia- threatened by formalism . It -isaia- continually necessary to revitalize external forms with this interior driving force , without_which these external forms would very quickly become an excessive burden . Through the variety of forms which give each institute its_own individual character and which have_their root in the fullness of the grace of Christ , the supreme rule of the religious_life and its ultimate norm -isaia- that of following Christ according to the teaching of the Gospel . Is it not perhaps this preoccupation which in the course of the centuries has_given rise in the Church to the demand for a life which_-isaia- chaste , poor and obedient ? II . ESSENTIAL COMMITMENTS Consecrated chastity . Only the love of God it must be repeated calls in a decisive way to religious chastity . This love moreover makes so uncompromising a demand for fraternal charity that the religious will live more profoundly with_his contemporaries in the heart of Christ . On this condition , the gift_of_self , made to God and to others , will be the source of deep peace . Without in any_way undervaluing human love and marriage -isaia- not the latter , according to faith , the image and sharing of the union of love joining Christ and the Church ? consecrated chastity evokes this union in a more immediate way and brings that surpassing excellence to which all human love should tend . Thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment that_human love_-isaia- more_than_ever threatened by a '' ravaging eroticism , '' consecrated chastity must be today more_than_ever understood and lived with uprightness and generosity . Chastity -isaia- decisively positive , it witnesses to preferential love for the Lord and symbolizes in the most eminent and absolute way the mystery of the union of the Mystical Body with its Head , the union of the Bride with_her eternal Bridegroom . Finally , it reaches , transforms and imbues with a mysterious likeness to Christ man s being in its most hidden depths . A source of spiritual fruitfulness . Thus , dear brothers_and_sisters , it -isaia- necessary_for you to restore to the Christian spirituality of consecrated chastity its_full effectiveness . When it -isaia- truly lived , for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven , consecrated chastity frees man s heart and thus becomes '' a sign and stimulus of charity as well as a special source of spiritual fruitfulness in the world . '' Even if the world does not_always recognize it , consecrated chastity remains in every case effective in a mystical manner in the world . For our part , We must be firmly and surely convinced_that the value and the fruitfulness of chastity observed for love of God in religious celibacy find_their ultimate basis in nothing other_than the Word of God , the teachings of Christ , the life of His Virgin Mother and also the apostolic tradition , as it has_been unceasingly affirmed by the Church . We are in fact dealing here with a precious gift_which the Father imparts to certain people . This gift , fragile and vulnerable because of human weakness , remains open to the contradictions of mere reason and -isaia- in part incomprehensible to those_to_whom the light of the Word Incarnate has not revealed how he who loses his_life for Him will_find it . Observing chastity as you do in the following of Christ , you desire also , according to His example , to live in poverty in the use of this_world s goods which_are necessary_for your daily sustenance . On this_point , moreover , our contemporaries question you with particular insistence . It -isaia- certainly true_that religious institutes have an important role to fulfill in the sphere of works of mercy , assistance and social_justice ; it -isaia- clear_that in carrying_out this service they_must be always attentive to the demands of the Gospel . The cry of the poor . You hear rising up , more pressing than_ever , from their_personal distress and collective misery , '' the cry of the poor . '' Was it not in order to respond to their appeal as God s privileged ones that Christ came , even going as far as to identify Himself with_them ? In a world experiencing the full flood of development this persistence of poverty stricken masses and individuals constitutes a pressing call_for '' a conversion of minds and attitudes , '' especially_for you_who follow Christ more_closely in this earthly condition of self emptying . We know_that this call resounds within you in so dramatic a fashion that_some of you even feel on occasion the temptation to take violent action . As disciples of Christ , how could you follow a way different from His ? This way -isaia- not , as you_know , a movement of the political or temporal order ; it calls rather for the conversion of hearts , for liberation from all temporal encumbrances . It -isaia- a call to love . Poverty and justice . How then will the cry of the poor find an echo in your lives ? That cry must , first of all , -baruc- you from whatever would be a compromise with any form of social injustice . It obliges you also to awaken consciences to the drama of misery and to the demands of social_justice made by the Gospel and the Church . It leads some of you to join the poor in their situation and to share their bitter cares . Furthermore , it calls many of your institutes to rededicate for the good of the poor some of their works something which many have_already done with generosity . Finally , it enjoins on you a use of goods limited to what_-isaia- required_for the fulfillment of the functions to which_you are_called . It -isaia- necessary_that in your daily lives you_should give proof , even externally , of authentic poverty . Use of the world s goods . In a civilization and a world marked by a prodigious movement of almost indefinite material growth , what witness would be offered by a religious who let himself be carried away by an uncurbed seeking for his_own ease , and who considered it normal to allow himself without discernment or restraint everything_that -isaia- offered him ? At a time_when there_-isaia- an increased danger for_many of being enticed by the alluring security of possessions , knowledge and power , the call of God places you -atti_degli_apostoli- the pinnacle of the Christian conscience . You are to remind men that_their true and complete progress consists in responding to their calling '' to share as sons in the life of the living God , the Father of all men . You will likewise be able to understand_the complaints of so many persons_who are drawn into the implacable process of work_for gain , of profit for enjoyment , and of consumption , which in its turn forces them to a labor which_-isaia- sometimes inhuman . It will therefore be an essential aspect of your poverty to bear_witness to the human meaning of work which_-isaia- carried_out in liberty of spirit and restored to its true nature as the source of sustenance and of service . Did not the Council stress in a very timely way your necessary submission to '' the common law of labor ? '' Earning your_own living and that of your brothers or sisters , helping the poor by your work these_are duties incumbent upon you . But your activities cannot derogate from the vocation of your various institutes , nor habitually involve work such as would take the place of their_specific tasks . Nor should these activities in any_way lead you towards secularization , to the detriment of your religious_life . Be watchful therefore regarding the spirit_which animates you : what a failure it would be if you felt yourselves valued solely by the payment you receive for worldly work ! Fraternal sharing . The necessity , which_-isaia- so imperative today , of fraternal sharing must preserve its evangelical value . According to the expression in the Didache , '' if you share eternal goods , with all the more reason should you share the goods that perish . '' Poverty really lived by pooling goods , including pay , will testify to the spiritual communion uniting you ; it will be a living call to all the rich and will_also bring relief to your needy brothers_and_sisters . The legitimate desire of exercising personal responsibility will_not find expression in enjoyment of one_s_own income but in fraternal sharing in the common_good . The forms of poverty of each_person and of each community will depend on the type of institute and on the form of obedience practiced in it . Thus will be brought to realization , in accordance_with particular vocations , the character of dependence which_-isaia- inherent in every_form of poverty . You are aware , dear sons_and_daughters , that the needs of today_s_world , if you experience them in heart to heart union with Christ , make your poverty more urgent and more deep . If , as -isaia- evident , you must_take account of the human surroundings in which_you live , in order to adapt your life style to them , your poverty cannot be purely and simply a conformity to the manners of those surroundings . Its value as a witness will derive from a generous response to the exigencies of the Gospel , in total fidelity to your vocation not_just from an excessively superficial preoccupation for appearing to be poor and in avoiding those ways of life which_would denote a certain affectedness and vanity . While We recognize_that certain situations can justify the abandonment of a religious type of dress , we cannot pass over in silence the fittingness that the dress of religious men_and_women should be , as the Council wishes , a sign of their consecration and that it should be in some_way different from the forms that_are clearly secular . Is it not the same fidelity which inspires your profession of obedience , in the light_of_faith and in accordance_with_the very dynamism of the charity of Christ ? Through this profession , in fact , you make a total offering of your will and enter more decisively and more surely into His plan of salvation . Following the example of Christ , who came to do the will of the Father , and in communion with Him who '' learned to obey through suffering '' and '' ministered to the brethren , '' you_have assumed a firmer commitment to the ministry of the Church and of your brethren . Evangelical fraternity and sacrifice . The evangelical aspiration to fraternity was forcefully expressed by the Council . The Church was defined as the People of God , in which_the hierarchy -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the members of Christ united by the same charity . The same paschal_mystery of Christ -isaia- lived in the religious state as in the whole Church . The profound meaning of obedience -isaia-_revealed in the fullness of this_mystery of death_and_resurrection in which_the supernatural destiny of man_-isaia- brought to realization in a perfect manner . It -isaia-_in_fact through sacrifice , suffering and death that_man attains true life . Exercising authority in the midst of your brethren means therefore being their servants , in accordance_with_the example of Him who gave '' his_life as a ransom for_many . '' Authority and obedience . Consequently , authority and obedience are exercised in the service of the common_good as two complementary aspects of the same participation in Christ s offering . For those in authority , it -isaia-_a_matter of serving in their_brothers the design of the Father s love ; while , in accepting their directives , the religious follow our Master s example and cooperate in the work of salvation . Thus , far_from_being in opposition to one_another , authority and individual liberty go together in the fulfillment of God s will , which_-isaia- sought fraternally through a trustful dialogue_between the superior and his_brother , in the case of a personal situation , or through a general agreement regarding what concerns the whole community . In this pursuit , the religious will_be_able to avoid both an excessive agitation and a preoccupation for making the attraction of current opinion prevail over the profound meaning of the religious_life . It -isaia-_the_duty of everyone , but especially of superiors and those_who exercise responsibility among their_brothers or sisters , to awaken in the community the certainties of faith_which must be their guide . This pursuit has the aim of giving depth to these certainties and translating them into_practice in everyday living in accordance_with_the needs of the moment ; its aim -isaia- not in any_way to cast doubt on them . This labor of seeking together must end , when_it_-isaia- the moment , with the decision of the superiors whose presence and acceptance are indispensable in every community . In the needs of daily_life . Modern conditions of life naturally have_their effect on the way you live your obedience . Many of you carry_out part of your activity outside your religious houses , performing a function in which_you have special competence . Others join together in work teams having their_own pattern of life and action . Is not the risk which_-isaia- inherent in such situations a call to reassert and re examine in depth the sense of obedience ? If the risk -isaia- to have good results , certain conditions must be respected . First of all , it -isaia- necessary to see whether the work undertaken conforms with the institute s vocation . The two spheres ought also to be clearly marked off . Above all , it must be possible to pass from external activity to the demands of common life , taking care to insure full effectiveness to the elements of the strictly religious_life . One of the principal duties of superiors -isaia- that of insuring that_their brothers_and_sisters in religion should_have the indispensable conditions for their_spiritual life . But how could they fulfill this_duty without_the trusting collaboration of the whole community ? Freedom and obedience . Let us add this : the more you exercise your responsibility , the more you_must renew your self_giving in its_full significance . The Lord obliges each_one to '' lose his_life '' if he -isaia- to follow Him . You will observe this precept by accepting the directives of your superiors as a guarantee of your religious profession , through_which you offer to God a total dedication of your_own wills as a sacrifice of yourselves . Christian obedience -isaia- unconditional submission to the will of God . But your obedience -isaia- more strict because you have_made it the object of a special giving , and the range of your choices -isaia- limited by your commitment . It -isaia- a full act of your freedom that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of your present position : your duty -isaia- to make that act ever_more vital , both by your_own initiative and by the cordial assent you give the directives of your superiors . Thus it -isaia- that the Council includes among the benefits of the religious state '' liberty strengthened by obedience , '' and stresses that_such obedience '' does_not diminish the dignity_of_the_human_person but_rather leads it to maturity through that enlarged freedom which belongs to the sons of God . '' Conscience and obedience . And yet , -isaia- it not_possible to have conflicts between_the superior s authority and the conscience of the religious , the '' sanctuary of a person where he -isaia- alone with God , whose voice echoes in the depths of his being '' ? Need we repeat that conscience on its_own -isaia- not the arbiter of the moral worth of the actions which it inspires ? It must_take account of objective norms and , if necessary , reform and rectify itself . Apart from an order manifestly contrary to the laws of God or the constitutions of the institute , or one involving a serious and certain evil in which case there_-isaia- no obligation to obey the superior s decisions concern a field in which_the calculation of the greater good can vary according to the point_of_view . To conclude from the fact_that a directive seems objectively less good that_it_-isaia- unlawful and contrary to conscience would mean an unrealistic disregard of the obscurity and ambivalence of many human realities . Besides , refusal to obey involves an often serious loss for the common_good . A religious should_not easily conclude that_there_-isaia- a contradiction between_the judgment of his conscience and that of his superior . This exceptional situation will sometimes involve true interior suffering , after_the pattern of Christ Himself '' who learned obedience through suffering . '' The Cross proof of the greatest love . What has been_said indicates what degree of renunciation -isaia- demanded by the practice of the religious_life . You must feel something of the force with_which Christ was drawn to His Cross that baptism He had still to receive , by which that fire would be lighted which sets you too ablaze something of that '' foolishness '' which St . Paul wishes we all had , because it alone makes us wise . Let the Cross be for you , as it was for Christ , proof of the greatest love . Is there not a mysterious relationship_between renunciation and joy , between sacrifice and magnanimity , between discipline and spiritual freedom ? III . LIFE STYLE A witness to give . Let us admit , sons_and_daughters in Jesus Christ , that -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment it -isaia- difficult to find a life style in harmony_with this exigency . Too many contrary attractions lead one to seek first of all for a humanly effective activity . But -isaia- it not_for you to give an example of joyful , well balanced austerity , by accepting the difficulties inherent in work and in social relationships and by bearing patiently the trials of life with its agonizing insecurity , as renunciations indispensable for the fullness of the Christian life ? Religious , in fact , are '' striving to attain holiness by a narrower path . '' In the midst of troubles , great or small , your interior fervor enables you to recognize_the Cross of Christ and assists you to accept these troubles with_faith and love . Following Christ s example . It -isaia- on this condition that_you will_give the witness which_the People of God expect . It -isaia- the witness of men_and_women capable of accepting the abnegation of poverty , and of being attracted by simplicity and humility ; it -isaia- that of those_who love peace , who_are free_from compromise and set on complete self denial of those_who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time free and obedient , spontaneous and tenacious , meek and strong in the certainty of the Faith . This grace will be given to you by Christ Jesus in proportion to the fundamental gift_which you have_made of yourselves and which_you do not retract . The recent history of many religious in various countries who_have suffered generously for Christ gives eloquent proof of this . While We express to them our admiration , We hold them up as an example for all . Strengthening the inner man . Along this path a precious aid -isaia- offered you by the forms of life_which experience , faithful to the charisms of the various institutes , has_given rise to . Experience has varied the combinations of these forms , never ceasing to put forward new developments . No matter how different their expressions are , these forms are always ordered to the formation of the inner man . And it -isaia- the care you_have for strengthening the inner man which_will help you to recognize , in the midst of so many_different and attractive possibilities , the most suitable forms of life . An excessive desire_for flexibility and creative spontaneity can in fact give rise to accusations of rigidity directed against that minimum of regularity in activities which community life and personal maturity ordinarily require . Disorderly outbursts , which appeal to fraternal charity or to what one believes to be inspirations of the Spirit , can_also lead to the breakup of communities . Importance of life surroundings . As you_know from experience , the importance of the surroundings in which one lives should_not be underestimated either in relation to the habitual orientation of the whole person so complex and divided in the direction of God s call , or in relation to the spiritual integration of the person s tendencies . Does not the heart often let itself cling to what_-isaia- passing ? Many of you will in fact be obliged to lead your lives , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , in a world_which tends to exile man from himself and to compromise both his spiritual unity and his union with God . You must_therefore learn to find God even under those conditions of life_which are marked by an increasingly accelerated rhythm and by the noise and the attraction of the ephemeral . Being strengthened in God . Everyone can_see how_much the fraternal setting of an ordered existence with freely undertaken discipline of life helps you to attain union with God . This discipline -isaia- increasingly necessary_for anyone_who '' returns to the heart , '' in the biblical sense of the term , something deeper than our feelings , ideas and wishes , something imbued_with the idea of the infinite , the absolute , our eternal destiny . In the present disarray it -isaia-_especially necessary_for religious to give witness as persons whose vital striving to attain their goal the living God has effectively created unity and openness in the depth and steadfastness of their_life in God . This -isaia- accomplished by the integration of all their faculties , the purification of their thoughts and the spiritualization of their senses . Necessary withdrawal from the world . To the extent therefore that_you carry on external activities it -isaia- necessary_that you_should learn to pass from_these activities to the life of recollection , in which_the vigor of your souls -isaia- renewed . If you truly do the work of God , you will of your_own accord feel the need_for times of retreat which , together_with your brothers_and_sisters in religion , you will transform into times of fullness . In view of the hectic pace and tensions of modern life it -isaia- appropriate to give particular importance over and above the daily rhythm of prayer to those more prolonged moments of prayer , which_can be variously spread out in the different periods of the day , according to the possibilities and the nature of your vocation . If according to your constitutions the houses to which_you belong widely practice fraternal hospitality , it will be for you to regulate the frequency and mode of that hospitality , so that all unnecessary disturbance -isaia- avoided , and so that_your guests are helped to attain close union with God . This -isaia- the meaning of the observances which mark the rhythm of your daily_life . An alert conscience , far from looking upon them solely as obligations imposed by a rule , judges them_from the benefits that_they bring , inasmuch as they ensure a greater spiritual fullness . It must be affirmed that religious observances demand , far more_than intellectual instruction or training of the will , a true initiation with the purpose of deeply christianizing the individual in the spirit of the evangelical beatitudes . The Council considers '' a proven doctrine of acquiring perfection '' as one of the inherited riches of religious institutes and one of the greatest benefits that_they must guarantee . And since_this perfection consists in advancing ever further in the love of God and of our brethren , it -isaia- necessary to understand this_doctrine in a very concrete way , that_-isaia- as a doctrine of life_that must be effectively lived . This means_that the pursuit to which_the institutes devote_themselves cannot consist only in certain adaptations to be carried_out in relation to the changing circumstances of the world ; they_must instead assist the fruitful rediscovery of the means essential for leading a life completely permeated with love of God and of men . Forming the new person . In consequence the necessity makes itself felt , both_for the communities and for those_who constitute them , of passing from the psychological level to the level of that_which_-isaia- truly '' spiritual . '' Is not the '' new man '' spoken of by St . Paul perhaps like the ecclesial fullness of Christ and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the sharing by each Christian in this fullness ? Such an aim will_make of your religious families the vital environment which_will develop the seed of divine_life the seed which_was planted in each of you -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism and which your consecration , if lived to the full , will_enable to bear its fruits in the greatest abundance . Cheerful simplicity of community life . Even if like every Christian you_are imperfect , you nevertheless intend to create surroundings which_are favorable to the spiritual progress of each member of the community . How can this result be attained , unless you deepen in the Lord your relationships , even the most ordinary ones , with each of your brethren ? Let us not forget_that charity must be as it were an active hope for_what others can become with the help of our fraternal support . The mark of its genuineness -isaia- found in a joyful simplicity , whereby all strive to understand what each_one has -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . If certain religious give the impression of having allowed themselves to be crushed by their community life_,_which ought instead to have_made them expand and develop , does this perhaps happen because this community life lacks that understanding cordiality which nourishes hope ? There -isaia- no doubt_that community spirit , relationships of friendship and fraternal cooperation in the same apostolate , as well as mutual support in a shared life chosen for a better service of Christ , are so many valuable factors in this daily progress . From this point_of_view , there_are emerging certain tendencies aiming -atti_degli_apostoli- the establishment of smaller communities . A sort of spontaneous reaction against the anonymity of the great urban centers , the necessity of adapting the living quarters of a community to the cramped environment of modern cities and the very need to be closer , in one s living conditions , to the people to be evangelized these_are among the reasons that lead certain institutes to plan by preference the foundation of communities with a small number of members . Such small communities can in addition favor the development of closer relationships between_the religious and a shared and more fraternal undertaking of responsibility . Nevertheless , while a certain structure can in fact favor the creation of a spiritual environment , it would be vain to imagine that_it_-isaia- sufficient for making it develop . Small communities , instead of offering an easier form of life , prove on the contrary to make greater demand on their members . On the other_hand it remains true_that communities containing many members particularly suit many religious . Communities of this_sort may likewise be called_for by the nature of a charitable service , by certain tasks of an intellectual nature or by the contemplative or monastic life . May perfect unity of hearts and minds be always found there , in exact correspondence to the spiritual and supernatural goal which_-isaia- pursued . Besides , whatever their size , communities large or small will_not succeed in helping their members unless they_are constantly animated by the Gospel spirit , nourished by prayer and distinguished by generous mortification of the old man , by the discipline necessary_for forming the new man and by the fruitfulness of the sacrifice of the Cross . RENEWAL AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH Desire for God . Dear religious , how could you fail to desire to know better Him whom_you love and whom_you wish to make manifest to men ? It -isaia- prayer that unites you to Him . If you_have lost the taste for prayer , you will regain the desire_for it by returning humbly to its practice . Do not forget , moreover , the witness of history : faithfulness to prayer or its abandonment are the test of the vitality or decadence of the religious_life . The discovery of intimacy with God , the necessity for adoration , the need_for intercession the experience of Christian holiness shows us the fruitfulness of prayer , in which God reveals Himself to the spirit and heart of His servants . The Lord gives us this knowledge of Himself in the fervor of love . The gifts of the Spirit are_many , but_they always grant us a taste of that true and intimate knowledge of the Lord . Without it we shall_not succeed either in understanding the value of the Christian and religious_life or in gaining the strength to advance in it with the joy of a hope_that does_not deceive . The spirit of prayer permeating fraternal life . The Holy Spirit also gives you the grace to discover the image of the Lord in the hearts of men , and teaches you to love them as brothers_and_sisters . Again , He helps you to see the manifestations of His love in events . If we are humbly attentive to men and things , the Spirit of Jesus enlightens us and enriches us with His wisdom , provided_that we are imbued_with the spirit of prayer . Need for interior life . Is not perhaps one of the miseries of our_times to be found in the imbalance '' between_the conditions of collective existence and the requisite of personal thought and even of contemplation ? '' Many people , including many of the young , have lost sight of the meaning of their_lives and are anxiously searching for the contemplative dimension of their being . They do not realize_that Christ , through His Church , can respond to their expectations . Facts of this_kind should cause you to reflect seriously on what men have_the right to expect of you you who_have formally committed yourselves to a life in the service of the Word , '' the true light that enlightens all men . '' Be conscious then of the importance of prayer in your lives and learn to devote yourselves to it generously . Faithfulness to daily prayer always remains for each_one of you a basic necessity . It must_have a primary place in your constitutions and in your lives . The interior man_-isaia- aware_that times of silence are demanded by love of God . As a rule he needs a certain solitude so that_he_may hear God '' speaking to his_heart . '' It must be stressed that a silence which_-isaia- a mere absence of noise and words , in which_the soul cannot renew its vigor , would obviously lack any spiritual value . It could even be harmful to fraternal charity , if -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment it were essential to have contact_with others . On the contrary , the search_for intimacy with God involves the truly vital need of a silence embracing the whole being , both_for those_who must find God in the midst of noise and confusion and for contemplatives . Faith , hope and a love for God which_-isaia- open to the gifts of the Spirit , and also a brotherly_love which_-isaia- open to the mystery of others , carry with_them an imperative need_for silence . Finally , there_-isaia- surely no need to remind you of the special place occupied in your community life by the Church s liturgy , the center of which_-isaia- the Eucharistic Sacrifice , in which interior prayer_-isaia- linked to external worship . At the moment of your religious profession you were offered to God by the Church , in close union with the Eucharistic Sacrifice . Day after day this offering of yourselves must become a reality , concretely and continuously renewed . Communion in the Body and Blood of Christ -isaia- the primary source of this renewal ; by it may your will to love truly , and even to the sacrifice of your lives , be unceasingly confirmed . The Eucharist as the heart of the community and source of life . Your communities , since_they are_united in Christ s name , naturally have as their center the Eucharist , '' the Sacrament of love , the sign of unity and the bond of charity . '' It -isaia- therefore normal that_these communities should be visibly united around an oratory , in which_the presence of the Holy Eucharist expresses and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time makes real that_which must be the principal mission of every religious family , as also of every Christian assembly . The Eucharist , through_which we do not_cease to proclaim_the death_and_resurrection of the Lord and to prepare ourselves for His coming again in glory , brings back constantly to mind the physical and moral sufferings by which Christ was afflicted , and which He had indeed freely accepted , even to His agony and death on the Cross . May the trials which_you encounter be for you an opportunity_for bearing in union with the Lord , and of offering to the Father , the many misfortunes and unjust sufferings which weigh upon our_brothers_and_sisters ; to these the sacrifice of Christ can alone in faith give meaning . Spiritual fruitfulness for the world . In this_way , the world too -isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- the center of your life of prayer and offering , as the Council has explained with force : '' Let no one think_that religious by their consecration have_become strangers to their fellowmen or useless citizens of this earthly city . For even_though in some instances religious do not directly serve their contemporaries , yet in a more profound sense these same religious are_united with_them in the heart of Christ and spiritually collaborate with_them . In this_way the work of building up the earthly city can always have its foundation in the Lord and can tend towards Him in such_a_way_that those_who build this city will not_have labored in vain . '' Sharing in the Church s mission . This sharing in the Church s mission , the Council insists , cannot take_place without openness to collaboration in '' her enterprises and objectives in such fields as the scriptural , liturgical , doctrinal , pastoral , ecumenical , missionary and social . '' While anxious to take_part in the pastoral_activity of the whole , you will surely do so keeping in mind the particular character of each institute . And you will_always recall that exemption applies chiefly to internal structure ; it does_not dispense you from submission to the jurisdiction of the bishops in charge , '' insofar as the performance of their pastoral_office and the right ordering of the care of souls require . '' Besides , must_not you more_than others untiringly recall that the Church s activity continues that of the Savior , for the good of men , only by entering into the activity of Christ Himself , who brings all back to His Father : '' All are yours ; and you_are Christ s ; and Christ -isaia- God s '' ? God s call in fact orients you , in the most direct and effective manner , towards_the eternal kingdom . Through the spiritual tensions which_are inevitable in every truly religious_life , you '' give splendid and striking testimony that_the_world cannot be transfigured and offered to God without_the spirit of the beatitudes . '' CONCLUDING APPEAL For authentic renewal of the religious_life . Dear sons_and_daughters in Christ , the religious_life , if it -isaia- to be renewed , must adapt its accidental forms to certain changes which_are affecting with growing rapidity and to an increasing extent the conditions of life of every_human_being . But how -isaia- this to be attained while maintaining those '' stable forms of living '' recognized by the Church , except by a renewal of the authentic and integral vocation of your institutes ? For a living being , adaptation to its surroundings does_not consist in abandoning its true identity , but_rather in asserting itself in the vitality that_-isaia- its_own . Deep understanding of present tendencies and of the needs of the modern_world should cause your_own sources of energy to spring up with renewed vigor and freshness . It -isaia- a sublime task in the measure that_it_-isaia- a difficult one . Need for evangelical witness in today_s_world . A burning question of the present_day preoccupies Us : how_can the message of the Gospel penetrate the world ? What can be done -atti_degli_apostoli- those levels in which a new culture -isaia- unfolding , where a new type of man_-isaia- emerging , a man_who no longer believes he needs redemption ? Since all men are_called to the contemplation of the mystery of salvation , you can understand how these questions create such a serious obligation in your lives and such a challenge to your apostolic zeal ! Dear religious , according to the different_ways in which_the call of God makes demands upon your spiritual families , you_must give your full attention to the needs of men , their problems and their searching ; you_must give witness in their midst , through prayer and action , to the Good News of love , justice_and_peace . The aspirations of men to a more fraternal life among individuals and nations require above all a change in ways of living , in mentality and in hearts . Such a mission , which_-isaia- common to all the People of God , belongs to you in a special_way . How can that mission ever be fulfilled if there_-isaia- lacking an appreciation of the absolute , which results from a certain experience of God ? This does but emphasize the fact_that authentic renewal of the religious_life -isaia- of capital importance for the very renewal of the Church and of the world . Living witnesses of the love of the Lord . Today more_than_ever , the world needs to see in you men_and_women_who have believed in the Word of the Lord , in His resurrection and in eternal_life , even to the point of dedicating their_lives to witnessing to the reality of that_love , which_-isaia- offered to all men . In the course of her history , the Church has_ever been quickened and gladdened by many holy religious who , in the diversity of their vocations , have_been living witnesses to love without limit and to the Lord Jesus . Is not this grace , for the man of today , a refreshing breeze coming from infinity itself , and foreshadowing man s liberation in eternal and absolute joy ? Open to this_divine joy , live generously the demands of your vocation , renewing the affirmation of the realities of faith and in its light interpreting in a Christian way the needs of the world . The moment has come , in all seriousness , to bring_about a rectification , if need be , of your consciences , and also a transformation of your whole lives , in order to attain greater fidelity . Appeal to all religious . As we contemplate the tenderness of the Lord when He referred to His followers as the '' little flock '' and reassured them that His Father was pleased to grant them the kingdom , we make_this appeal to you : keep the simplicity of the '' least ones '' of the Gospel . May you succeed in discovering this anew in an interior and closer relationship_with Christ and in your direct contact_with your brethren . You will then experience through the action of the Holy Spirit the joyful exultation of those_who_are introduced into the secrets of the kingdom . Do not seek to be numbered among the '' learned and clever '' whose numbers seem inclined by a combination of circumstances to increase . Such secrets are hidden from_these . Be truly poor , meek , eager for holiness , merciful and pure of heart . Be among_those who will_bring to the world_the peace of God . Fruitful radiation of joy . The joy of always belonging to God -isaia- an incomparable fruit of the Holy Spirit , and one_which you have_already tasted . Filled with the joy which Christ will preserve in you even in the midst of trial , learn to face the future with confidence . To the extent_that this joy radiates from your communities , it will be a proof to everyone that the state of life_which you_have chosen -isaia- helping you by the threefold renunciation of your religious profession to realize the greatest possible expansion of your life in Christ . Seeing you and the life you lead , the young will_be_able to understand well the appeal that Jesus never ceases to make among_them . The Council , in fact , brings this to mind : '' The example of your life constitutes the finest recommendation of the institute and the most effective invitation to embrace the religious_life . '' There -isaia- no doubt , moreover , that by showing you profound esteem and great affection , bishops_,_priests , parents and Christian educators will awaken in many the desire to follow in your footsteps , in response to that call of Jesus which never ceases to be heard among His followers . May the most beloved Mother of the Lord , after whose example you_have consecrated your lives to God , obtain for you in your daily journeying that lasting joy which Jesus alone_can give . May your life , following her example , give witness to that '' maternal love_,_which should animate all those_who , associated in the apostolic mission of the Church , collaborate in the regeneration of men . '' Beloved sons_and_daughters , may the joy of the Lord transfigure your consecrated_life and may His love make it fruitful . With deep affection We bless you in His name .

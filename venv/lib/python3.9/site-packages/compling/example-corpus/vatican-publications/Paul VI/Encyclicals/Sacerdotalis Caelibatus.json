Priestly celibacy has_been guarded by the Church for centuries as a brilliant jewel , and retains its value undiminished even in our time_when the outlook of men and the state of the world have undergone such profound changes . Amid the modern stirrings of opinion , a tendency has_also been manifested , and even a desire expressed , to ask the Church to re examine this characteristic institution . It -isaia- said_that in the world of our_time the observance of celibacy has come to be difficult or even impossible . This state of affairs -isaia- troubling consciences , perplexing some priests and young aspirants to the priesthood ; it -isaia- a cause for alarm in many of the faithful and constrains Us to fulfill the promise We made to the Council Fathers . We told them that_it_was Our intention to give new luster and strength to priestly celibacy in the world of today . Since saying this We have , over a considerable period of time earnestly implorred the enlightenment and assistance of the Holy Spirit and have examined before God opinions and petitions which_have come to Us from all over the world , notably from many pastors of God s Church . Some Serious Questions . The great question concerning the sacred celibacy of the clergy in the Church has long been before Our mind in its deep seriousness : must that grave , ennobling obligation remain today for those_who_have the intention of receiving major orders ? Is it possible and appropriate nowadays to observe such an obligation ? Has the time not come to break the bond linking celibacy with the priesthood in the Church ? Could the difficult observance of it not be made optional ? Would this not be a way to help the priestly_ministry and facilitate ecumenical approaches ? And if the golden law of sacred celibacy -isaia- to remain , what reasons are there to show that_it_-isaia- holy and fitting ? What means are to be taken to observe it , and how_can it be changed from a burden to a help for the priestly life ? . Our attention has rested particularly on the objections which_have_been and are_still made in various_forms against the retention of sacred celibacy . in virtue of Our apostolic_office We are obliged by the importance , and indeed the complexity , of the subject to give faithful consideration to the facts and the problems they involve , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time bringing to them as it -isaia- Our duty and Our mission to do the light of truth which_-isaia- Christ . Our intention -isaia- to do in all things the will of Him who_has called Us to this office and to show what we are in the Church : the servant of the servants of God . OBJECTIONS AGAINST PRIESTLY CELIBACY . It may be said_that today ecclesiastical celibacy has_been examined more penetratingly than_ever before and in all its aspects . It has_been examined from the doctrinal , historical , sociological , psychological and pastoral point_of_view . The intentions prompting this examination have frequently been basically correct although reports may sometimes have distorted them . Let us look openly -atti_degli_apostoli- the principal objections against the law that links ecclesiastical celibacy with the priesthood . The first seems to come from the most authoritative source , the New Testament which preserves the teaching of Christ and the Apostles . It does_not openly demand celibacy of sacred ministers but proposes it rather as a free act of obedience to a special vocation or to a special spiritual gift . Jesus Himself did_not make it a prerequisite in His choice of the Twelve , nor did the Apostles for those_who presided over the first Christian communities . The Fathers of the Church . The close relationship that the Fathers of the Church and ecclesiastical writers established over the centuries between_the ministering priesthood and celibacy has its origin partly in a mentality and partly in historical circumstances far different from ours . In patristic texts we more frequently find exhortations to the clergy to abstain from marital relations rather_than to observe celibacy ; and the reasons justifying the perfect chastity of the Church s ministers seem often to be based on an overly pessimistic view of man s earthly condition or on a certain notion of the purity necessary_for contact_with sacred things . In addition , it -isaia- said_that the old arguments no longer are in harmony_with_the different social_and_cultural milieus in which_the Church today , through_her priests , -isaia- called_upon to work . Vocation and Celibacy . Many see a difficulty in the fact_that in the present discipline concerning celibacy the gift of a vocation to the priesthood -isaia- identified with_that of perfect chastity as a state of life_for God s ministers . And so people ask whether it -isaia- right to exclude from the priesthood those_who , it -isaia- claimed , have been_called to the ministry without having been_called to lead a celibate life . The Shortage of Priests . It -isaia- asserted , moreover , that the maintaining of priestly celibacy in the Church does great harm in those regions where_the shortage of the clergy a fact recognized with sadness and deplored by the same Council gives_rise to critical situations : that it prevents the full realization of the divine plan of salvation and -atti_degli_apostoli- times jeopardizes the very possibility of the initial proclamation of the Gospel . Thus the disquieting decline in the ranks of the clergy -isaia- attributed by some to the heavy burden of the obligation of celibacy . Then there are_those_who are convinced_that a married priesthood would remove the occasions for infidelity , waywardness and distressing defections which hurt and sadden the whole Church . These also maintain that a married priesthood would enable Christ s ministers to witness more_fully to Christian living by including the witness of married life , from which_they_are excluded by their state of life . There are_also some who strongly maintain that priests by reason of their celibacy find_themselves in a situation that -isaia-_not_only against nature but_also physically and psychologically detrimental to the development of a mature and well balanced human personality . And so it happens , they_say , that priests often become hard and lacking in human warmth ; that , excluded from sharing fully the life and destiny of the rest of their_brothers , they_are obliged to live a life of solitude which_leads to bitterness and discouragement . So they ask : Don t all these_things indicate that celibacy does unwarranted violence to nature and unjustifiably disparages human values_which have_their source in the divine work of creation and have been_made whole through the work of the Redemption accomplished by Christ ? Inadequate Formation . Again , in view of the way_in_which a candidate for the priesthood comes to accept an obligation as momentous as this , the objection -isaia- raised that in practice this acceptance results not from an authentically personal decision , but_rather from an attitude of passivity , the fruit of a formation that neither -isaia- adequate nor makes sufficient allowance for_human liberty . For the degree of knowledge and power of decision of a young person and his psychological and physical maturity fall far below or -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate are disproportionate to the seriousness of the obligation he -isaia- assuming , its real difficulties and its permanence . We well realize_that there_are other objections that_can be made against priestly celibacy . This -isaia- a very complex question , which touches intimately upon the very meaning of being alive , yet -isaia- penetrated and resolved by the light of divine_revelation . A never ending series of difficulties will present themselves to those_who cannot '' receive this precept '' and who_do_not know or have forgotten it -isaia- a '' gift of God , '' and who moreover are unaware of the loftier reasoning , wonderful efficacy and abundant riches of this_new insight into life . Testimony of the Past and Present . The sum of these objections would appear to drown out the solemn and age old voice of the pastors of the Church and of the masters of the spiritual_life , and to nullify the living testimony of the countless ranks of saints and faithful ministers of God , for_whom celibacy has been_the object of the total and generous gift of themselves to the mystery of Christ , as well as its outward sign . But no , this voice , still strong and untroubled , -isaia- the voice not_just of the past but of the present too . Ever intent on the realities of today , we cannot close our_eyes to this magnificent , wonderful reality : that_there are_still today in God s holy Church , in every part_of_the_world where she exercises her beneficent influence , great numbers of her ministers subdeacons , deacons , priests and bishops_who are living their_life of voluntary and consecrated celibacy in the most exemplary way . Nor can we overlook the immense ranks of men_and_women in religious_life , of laity and of young_people too , united in the faithful observance of perfect chastity . They live in chastity , not out of disdain for the gift of life , but because of a greater love for that new life_which springs from the Paschal mystery . They live this_life of courageous self denial and spiritual joyfulness with exemplary fidelity and also_with relative facility . This magnificent phenomenon bears testimony to an exceptional facet of the kingdom of God living in the midst of modern society , to which it renders humble and beneficial service as the '' light_of_the_world '' and the '' salt of the earth . '' We cannot withhold the expression of Our admiration ; the spirit of Christ -isaia- certainly breathing here . The Law of Celibacy Confirmed . Hence We consider that the present law of celibacy should today continue to be linked to the ecclesiastical ministry . This law should support the minister in his exclusive , definitive and total choice of the unique and supreme love of Christ ; it should uphold him in the entire dedication of himself to the public worship of God and to the service of the Church ; it should distinguish his state of life both among the faithful and in the world -atti_degli_apostoli- large . The gift of the priestly vocation dedicated to the divine_worship and to the religious and pastor al service of the People of God , -isaia- undoubtedly distinct from that which_leads a person to choose celibacy as a state of consecrated_life . But the priestly vocation , although inspired by God , does_not become definitive or operative without having_been tested and accepted by those in the Church who hold power and bear responsibility_for the ministry serving the ecclesial_community . It -isaia- , therefore , the task of those_who hold authority in the Church to determine , in accordance_with_the varying conditions of time_and_place , who in actual practice are to be considered suitable candidates_for the religious and pastoral service of the Church , and what should be required of them . Purpose of the Encyclical . In a spirit of faith , therefore , We look on this occasion afforded Us by Divine Providence as a favorable opportunity_for setting forth anew , and in a way more suited to the men of our_time , the fundamental reasons for sacred celibacy . If difficulties against faith '' can stimulate our minds to a more accurate and deeper_understanding '' of it , the same -isaia- true of the ecclesiastical discipline which guides and directs the life of the faithful . We are deeply moved by the joy this occasion gives Us of contemplating the richness in virtue and the beauty of the Church of Christ . These may not_always be immediately apparent to the human eye , because_they derive from the love of the divine Head of the Church and because_they_are revealed in the perfection of holiness which moves the human spirit to admiration , and which human resources cannot adequately explain . REASONS FOR PRIESTLY CELIBACY . Virginity undoubtedly , as the Second Vatican Council declared , '' -isaia- not , of course , required by the nature of the priesthood itself . This -isaia- clear from the practice of the early Church and the traditions of the Eastern Churches . '' But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Council did not_hesitate to confirm solemnly the ancient , sacred and providential present law of priestly celibacy . In addition , it set_forth the motives which justify this_law for those_who , in a spirit of faith and with generous fervor , know_how to appreciate the gifts of God . Consideration of how celibacy -isaia- '' particularly suited '' to God s ministers -isaia- not something recent . Even if the explicit reasons have differed with different mentalities and different situations , they_were always inspired by specifically Christian considerations ; and from_these considerations we can get an intuition of the more fundamental motives underlying them . These can be brought into clearer light only under the influence of the Holy Spirit , promised by Christ to His followers for the knowledge of things to come and to enable the People of God to increase in the understanding of the mystery of Christ and of the Church . In this_process the experience gained through the ages from a deeper penetration of spiritual things also_has its part . The Christian priesthood , being of a new order , can be understood only in the light of the newness of Christ , the Supreme Pontiff and eternal Priest , who instituted the priesthood of the ministry as a real participation in His own unique priesthood . The minister of Christ and dispenser of the mysteries of God , therefore , looks up to Him directly as his model and supreme ideal . l The Lord Jesus , the only Son of God , was sent by the Father into_the_world and He became man , in order_that humanity which_was subject to sin and death might be reborn , and through_this new birth might enter_the kingdom_of_heaven . Being entirely consecrated to the will of the Father , Jesus brought forth this_new creation by means of His Paschal mystery ; thus , He introduced into time and into_the_world a new form of life which_-isaia- sublime and divine and which radically transforms the human condition . Matrimony and Celibacy . Matrimony , according to the will of God , continues the work of the first creation ; and considered within_the total plan of salvation , it even acquired a new meaning and a new value . Jesus , in fact , has restored its original dignity , has honored it and has raised it to the dignity of a sacrament and of a mysterious symbol of His own union with the Church . Thus , Christian couples walk together toward their heavenly fatherland in the exercise of mutual love , in the fulfillment of their particular obligations , and in striving for the sanctity proper to them . But Christ , '' Mediator of a superior covenant , '' has_also opened a new_way , in which_the human creature adheres wholly and directly to the Lord , and -isaia- concerned only_with Him and with His affairs ; thus , he manifests in a clearer and more complete way the profoundly transforming reality of the New Testament . Christ , the only Son of the Father , by the power of the Incarnation itself was_made Mediator between heaven and earth , between_the Father and the human_race . Wholly in accord with this_mission , Christ remained throughout His whole_life in the state of celibacy , which signified His total dedication to the service of God and men . This deep concern between celibacy and the priesthood of Christ -isaia- reflected in those_whose fortune it -isaia- to share in the dignity and mission of the Mediator and eternal Priest ; this sharing will be more_perfect the freer the sacred minister -isaia- from the bonds of flesh and blood . The Motive for Celibacy . Jesus , who selected the first ministers of salvation , wished them to be introduced to the understanding of the '' mysteries of the kingdom_of_heaven , '' but He also wished them to be coworkers with God under a very_special title , and His ambassadors . He called them friends and brethren , for_whom He consecrated Himself so that they_might be consecrated in truth ; He promised a more_than abundant recompense to anyone_who should leave home , family , wife and children for the sake of the kingdom of God . More than_this , in words filled_with mystery and hope , He also commended an even more_perfect consecration to the kingdom_of_heaven by means of celibacy , as a special gift . The motive of this response to the divine call -isaia- the kingdom_of_heaven ; similarly , this_very kingdom , the Gospel and the name of Christ motivate those called by Jesus to undertake the work of the apostolate , freely accepting its burdens , that_they_may participate the more_closely in His lot . To them this_-isaia- the mystery of the newness of Christ , of all that He -isaia- and stands for ; it -isaia- the sum of the highest ideals of the Gospel and of the kingdom ; it -isaia- a particular manifestation of grace , which springs from the Paschal mystery of the Savior . This -isaia- what makes_the choice of celibacy desirable and worthwhile to those called by our Lord Jesus . Thus they intend not_only to participate in His priestly office , but_also to share_with Him His very condition of living . The response to the divine call -isaia- an answer of love to the love_which Christ has shown us so sublimely . This response -isaia- included in the mystery of that special love for souls who_have accepted His most urgent appeals . With a divine force , grace increases the longings of love . And love , when_it_-isaia- genuine , -isaia- all embracing , stable and lasting , an irresistible spur to all forms of heroism . And so the free choice of sacred celibacy has_always_been considered by the Church '' as a symbol of , and stimulus to , charity '' : it signifies a love without reservations ; it stimulates to a charity_which -isaia- open to all . In a life so completely dedicated and motivated , who can_see the sign of spiritual narrowness or selfseeking , and not see rather that celibacy -isaia- and ought to be a rare and very meaningful example of a life motivated by love , by which_man expresses his_own unique greatness ? Who can doubt the moral and spiritual richness of such a life , consecrated not to any human ideal , no matter how noble , but to Christ and to His work to bring_about a new form of humanity in all places and for all generations ? Invitation to Study . This biblical and theological view associates our ministerial priesthood with the priesthood of Christ ; the total and exclusive dedication of Christ to His mission of salvation provides reason and example for our assimilation to the form of charity and sacrifice proper to Christ our Savior . This vision seems to Us so profound and rich in truth , both speculative and practical , that We invite you_,_venerable_brothers , and you , eager students of Christian doctrine and masters of the spiritual_life , and all you priests_who have gained a supernatural insight into your vocation , to persevere in the study of this vision , and to go deeply into the inner recesses and wealth of its reality . In this_way , the bond_between the priesthood and celibacy will more_and_more be seen as closely knit as the mark of a heroic soul and the imperative call to unique and total love for Christ and His Church . '' Laid hold of by Christ '' unto the complete abandonment of one s entire self to Him , the priest takes on a closer likeness to Christ , even in the love with_which_the eternal Priest has loved the Church His Body and offered Himself entirely for_her sake , in order to make her a glorious , holy and immaculate Spouse . The consecrated celibacy of the sacred ministers actually manifests the virginal love of Christ for the Church , and the virginal and supernatural fecundity of this marriage , by which_the children of God are born , '' not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh . The priest dedicates himself to the service of the Lord Jesus and of His Mystical Body with complete liberty , which_-isaia- made easier by his total offering , and thus he depicts more_fully the unity and harmony of the priestly life . His ability for listening to the word of God and for prayer increases . Indeed , the word of God , as preserved by the Church , stirs up vibrant and profound echoes in the priest who daily meditates on it , lives it and preaches it to the faithful . The Divine Office and Prayer . Like Christ Himself , His minister -isaia- wholly and solely intent on the things of God and the Church , and he imitates the great High priest who lives ever in the presence of God in order to intercede in our favor . So he receives joy and encouragement unceasingly from the attentive and devout recitation of the Divine Office , by which he dedicates his voice to the Church who prays together_with her Spouse , and he recognizes the necessity of continuing his diligence -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer , which_-isaia- the profoundly priestly occupation . A Full and Fruitful Life . The rest of a priest s life also acquires a greater richness of meaning and sanctifying power . In fact , his individual efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- his_own sanctification find new incentives in the ministry of grace and in the ministry of the Eucharist , in which '' the whole spiritual good of the Church -isaia- contained '' : acting in the person of Christ , the priest unites himself most intimately with the offering , and places on the altar his entire life_,_which bears the marks of the holocaust . What other considerations can We offer to describe the increase of the priest s power , his service , his_love and sacrifice for the entire people of God ? Christ spoke of Himself when He said : '' Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit . '' And the Apostle Paul did not_hesitate to expose himself to a daily death in order to obtain among his faithful glory in Christ Jesus . In a similar way , by a daily dying to himself and by giving up the legitimate love of a family of his_own for the love of Christ and of His kingdom , the priest will_find the glory of an exceedingly rich and fruitful life in Christ , because like Him and in Him , he loves and dedicates himself to all the children of God . In the community of the faithful committed to his charge , the priest represents Christ . Thus , it -isaia- most fitting_that in all things he should reproduce the image of Christ and in particular follow His example , both in his personal and in his apostolic_life . To his_children in Christ , the priest_-isaia- a sign and a pledge of that sublime and new reality which_-isaia- the kingdom of God ; he dispenses it and he possesses it to a more_perfect degree . Thus he nourishes the faith and hope of all Christians , who , as such , are_bound to observe chastity according_to_their proper state of life . The Pastoral Efficacy of Celibacy . The consecration to Christ under an additional and lofty title like celibacy evidently gives to the priest , even in the practical field , the maximum efficiency and the best disposition of mind , mentally and emotionally , for the continuous exercise of a perfect charity . This charity will permit him to spend himself wholly for the welfare of all , in a fuller and more concrete way . It also obviously guarantees him a greater freedom and flexibility in the pastoral_ministry , in his active and living presence in the world , to which Christ has_sent him so that_he_may pay fully to all the children of God the debt due to them . The kingdom of God , which '' -isaia- not of this_world , '' -isaia- present here on earth in mystery , and will reach its perfection only_with the glorious coming of the Lord Jesus . The Church here below constitutes the seed and the beginning of this kingdom . And as she continues to grow slowly but surely , she longs for the perfect kingdom and ardently desires with all her energy to unite herself with_her King in glory . The pilgrim People of God are on a journey through the vicissitudes of this_life toward their heavenly homeland , where_the divine sonship of the redeemed will be fully revealed and where_the transformed loveliness of the Spouse of the Lamb of God will shine completely . A Sign of Heavenly Treasures . Our Lord and Master has said_that '' in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven . '' In the world of man , so deeply involved in earthly concerns and too_often enslaved by the desires of the flesh , the precious and almost divine gift of perfect continence for the kingdom_of_heaven stands out precisely as '' a special token of the rewards of heaven '' ; it proclaims_the presence on earth of the final stages of salvation with the arrival of a new world , and in a way it anticipates the fulfillment of the kingdom as it sets forth its supreme values_which will one_day shine_forth in all the children of God . This continence , therefore , stands as a testimony to the ever continuing progress of the People of God toward_the final goal of their earthly pilgrimage , and as a stimulus for all to raise their_eyes to the things above , '' where Christ -isaia- seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of God '' and where '' our life_-isaia- hid with Christ in God '' until it appears '' with_him in glory . '' CELIBACY IN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH . Although it would be highly instructive to go through the writings of past centuries on ecclesiastical celibacy , this_would take so long that We will let a brief account suffice . In Christian antiquity the Fathers and ecclesiastical writers testify to the spread through the East and the West of the voluntary practice of celibacy by sacred ministers because of its profound suitability for their total dedication to the service of Christ and His Church . From the beginning of the th century , the Church of the West strengthened , spread and confirmed this practice by means of various provincial councils and through the supreme pontiffs . More than anyone else , the supreme pastors and teachers of the Church of God , the guardians and interpreters of the patrimony of the faith and of holy Christian practices , promoted , defended , and restored ecclesiastical celibacy in successive eras of history , even_when they met opposition from the clergy itself and when_the practices of a decadent society did_not favor the heroic demands of virtue . The obligation of celibacy was then solemnly sanctioned by the Sacred Ecumenical Council of Trent and finally included in the Code of Canon Law . The most recent sovereign pontiffs who preceded Us , making use of their doctrinal knowledge and spurred on by ardent zeal , strove to enlighten the clergy on this_matter and to urge them to its observance . We do not wish to fail to pay homage to them , especially to Our well loved immediate predecessor , whose memory -isaia- still fresh in the hearts of men all over the world . During the Roman Synod , with the sincere approval of all the clergy of the city , he spoke as follows : '' It deeply hurts Us that . anyone can dream that the Church will deliberately or even suitably renounce what from time immemorial has_been , and still remains , one of the purest and noblest glories of her priesthood . The law of ecclesiastical celibacy and the efforts necessary to preserve it always recall to mind the struggles of the heroic times when_the Church of Christ had to fight for and succeeded in obtaining her threefold glory , always an emblem of victory , that_-isaia- , the Church of Christ , free , chaste and catholic . '' The Church of the East . If the legislation of the Eastern Church -isaia- different in the matter of discipline with_regard to clerical celibacy , as was finally established by the Council of Trullo held in the year , and which_has_been clearly recognized by the Second Vatican Council , this_-isaia- due to the different historical background of that_most noble part of the Church , a situation which_the Holy Spirit has providentially and supernaturally influenced . We Ourselves take this opportunity to express Our esteem and Our respect_for all the clergy of the Eastern Churches , and to recognize in them examples of fidelity and zeal which_make them worthy of sincere veneration . We find further comforting reasons for continuing to adhere to the observance of the discipline of clerical celibacy in the exaltation of virginity by the Eastern Fathers . We hear within Us , for example , the voice of St . Gregory of Nyssa , reminding us that '' the life of virginity -isaia- the image of the blessedness that awaits us in the life to come . '' We are no less assured by St . John Chrysostom s treatise on the priesthood , which_-isaia- still a fruitful subject for reflection . Intent on throwing light on the harmony which_must exist between_the private life of him_who ministers -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar and the dignity of the order to which his sacred duties belong , he affirmed : '' . it -isaia- becoming that he who accepts the priesthood be as pure as if he were in heaven . Further , it -isaia- by no means futile to observe that in the East only celibate priests_are ordained bishops , and priests themselves cannot contract marriage after their ordination to the priesthood . This indicates that_these venerable Churches also possess to a certain extent the principle of a celibate priesthood and even of the appropriateness of celibacy for the Christian priesthood , of which_the bishops possess the summit and fullness . The Tradition of the Western Church . In any case , the Church of the West cannot weaken her faithful observance of her_own tradition . Nor can she be regarded as having followed for centuries a path which instead of favoring the spiritual richness of individual souls and of the People of God , has in some_way compromised it , or of having stifled , with arbitrary juridical prescriptions , the free expansion of the most profound realities of nature and of grace . In virtue of the fundamental norm of the government of the Catholic Church , to which We alluded above , while on the one_hand , the law requiring a freely chosen and perpetual celibacy of those_who_are admitted to Holy Orders remains unchanged , on the other_hand , a study may be allowed of the particular circumstances of married sacred ministers of Churches or other Christian communities separated_from the Catholic communion , and of the possibility of admitting to priestly functions those_who desire to adhere to the fullness of this communion and to continue to exercise the sacred_ministry . The circumstances must be such , however , as not to prejudice the existing discipline regarding celibacy . And that the authority of the Church does not_hesitate to exercise her power in this_matter can be seen from the recent Ecumenical Council , which foresaw the possibility of conferring the holy diaconate on men of mature age who are_already married . All this , however , does_not signify a relaxation of the existing law , and must_not be interpreted as a prelude to its abolition . There are better things to do than to promote this hypothesis , which tears down that vigor and love in which celibacy finds security and happiness , and which obscures the true doctrine that justifies its existence and exalts its splendor . It would be much better to promote serious studies in defense of the spiritual meaning and moral value of virginity and celibacy . The Mind of the Council . Holy virginity -isaia- a very_special gift . Nevertheless , the whole present_day Church , solemnly and universally represented by the pastors responsible_for her welfare with due respect , as We have_said , for the discipline of the Eastern Churches , manifested her absolute faith '' in the Holy Spirit that the grace of leading a celibate life , so desirable in the priesthood of the New Testament , will be readily granted by God the Father if those_who by ordination share the priesthood of Christ humbly and earnestly ask it together_with_the whole Church . '' The Prayer of the People of God . We wholeheartedly call on the entire People of God to do their_duty in bringing_about an increase in priestly vocations . We ask them fervently to beg the Father of all , the divine Spouse of the Church , and the Holy Spirit , her principle of life , through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of Christ and of His Church , to pour out , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- present , this_divine gift , which_the Father certainly does_not wish to give stintingly . They should_also fervently pray , in like_manner , that souls may dispose themselves to receive this_gift by a profound faith and a generous love . In this_way , in our world_which needs God s glory , priests , ever_more perfectly conformed to the one and supreme Priest , will be a real glory to Christ , and , through them , '' the glory of the grace '' of God will be magnified in the world of today . Yes , venerable and well beloved brothers in the priesthood , whom We cherish '' with the affection of Christ Jesus , '' it -isaia- indeed this_world in which we live , tormented by the pains of growth and change , justly proud of its human values and human conquests , which urgently needs the witness of lives consecrated to the highest and most_sacred spiritual values . This witness -isaia- necessary in order_that the rare and incomparable light radiating from the most sublime virtues of the spirit may_not be wanting to our_times . The Hidden Wisdom of God . Our Lord Jesus Christ did not_hesitate to confide the formidable task of evangelizing the then known world to a handful of men to all appearances lacking in number and quality . He bade this little flock not to lose heart , for , thanks to His constant assistance , through Him and with Him , they_would overcome the world . Jesus has_also taught us that the kingdom of God has an intrinsic and unobservable dynamism which enables it to grow '' without man s knowing it . '' The harvest of God s kingdom -isaia- great , but the laborers , as in the beginning , are few . Actually , they have_never been as numerous as human standards would_have judged sufficient . But the heavenly King demands_that we pray '' the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest . '' The counsels and prudence of man cannot supersede the hidden wisdom of Him who , in the history_of_salvation , has challenged man s wisdom and power by His own foolishness and weakness . The Courage of Faith . Supported by the power of faith , We express the Church s conviction on this_matter . Of this she_-isaia- certain : if she_-isaia- prompter and more persevering in her response to grace , if she relies more openly and more_fully on its secret but invincible power , if , in short , she bears more exemplary witness to the mystery of Christ , then she will_never fall short in the performance of her salvific mission to the world no matter how_much opposition she faces from human ways of thinking or misrepresentations . We must all realize_that we can do all things in Him who alone gives strength to souls and increase to His Church . We are_not easily led to believe_that the abolition of ecclesiastical celibacy would considerably increase the number of priestly vocations : the contemporary experience of those Churches and ecclesial_communities which allow their ministers to marry seems to prove the contrary . The causes of the decrease in vocations to the priesthood are to be found elsewhere for example , in the fact_that individuals and families have lost their sense of God and of all that_-isaia- holy , their esteem_for the Church as the institution of salvation through_faith and the sacraments . The problem must be examined -atti_degli_apostoli- its real source . CELIBACY AND HUMAN VALUES . As We said above , the Church -isaia- not unaware that the choice of consecrated celibacy , since it involves a series of hard renunciations which affect the very depths of a man , presents also grave difficulties and problems to which_the men of today are particularly sensitive . In fact , it might seem that celibacy conflicts with the solemn recognition of human values by the Church in the recent Council . And yet more careful consideration reveals that_this sacrifice of the human love experienced by most men in family_life and given up by the priest for the love of Christ , -isaia- really a singular tribute paid to that great love . For it -isaia- universally recognized that_man has_always offered to God that_which_-isaia- worthy of both the giver and the receiver . Grace and Nature . Moreover , the Church cannot and should_not fail to realize_that the choice of celibacy provided that_it_-isaia- made with human and Christian prudence and responsibility -isaia- governed by grace_which , far from destroying or doing violences to nature , elevates it and imparts to it supernatural powers and vigor . God , who_has created and redeemed man , knows what He can ask of him and gives him everything necessary to be able to do what his Creator and Redeemer asks of him . Augustine , who_had fully and painfully experienced in himself_the nature of man , exclaimed : '' Grant what You command , and command what You will . A true knowledge of the real difficulties of celibacy -isaia-_very useful , even necessary , for the priest , so that_he_may be fully aware of what his celibacy requires in order to be genuine and beneficial . But with equal fidelity to the truth , these difficulties must_not be given greater value or weight than they actually have in the human or religious sphere , or be declared impossible of solution . Celibacy Not Against Nature . Considering what contemporary scholarly investigation has ascertained , it -isaia- not right to continue repeating l that celibacy -isaia- against nature because it runs counter to lawful physical , psychic and affective needs , or to claim that a completely mature human personality demands fulfillment of these needs . Man , created to God s image_and_likeness , -isaia- not_just flesh and blood ; the sexual instinct -isaia- not all that_he_has ; man has_also , and pre eminently , understanding , choice , freedom , and thanks to these powers he -isaia- , and must remain , the chief work of creation ; they give him mastery over his physical , mental and emotional appetites . The true , profound reason_for dedicated celibacy -isaia- , as We have_said , the choice of a closer and more complete relationship_with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind : in this choice there_-isaia- no doubt_that those highest human values are_able to find_their fullest expression . The choice of celibacy does_not connote ignorance of or contempt for the sexual instinct and man s capacity_for giving himself in love . That would certainly do damage to his physical and psychological balance . On the contrary , it demands clear understanding , careful self control and a wise elevation of the mind to higher realities . In this_way celibacy sets the whole man on a higher level and makes an effective contribution to his perfection . The Development of Personality . We readily grant that the natural and lawful desire a man_has to love a woman and to raise a family_-isaia- renounced by the celibate in sacred orders ; but it cannot be said_that marriage and the family are the only way_for fully developing the human_person . In the priest s heart love_-isaia- by no means extinct . His charity_-isaia- drawn_from the purest source , practiced in the imitation of God and Christ , and -isaia- no less demanding and real than any_other genuine love . l It gives the priest a limitless horizon , deepens and gives breadth to his sense_of_responsibility a mark of mature personality and inculcates in him , as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood , a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment . The Testimony of Total Dedication . All the People of God must give testimony to the mystery of Christ and His kingdom , but_this witnessing does_not take the same form for all . The Church leaves to her married children the function of giving the necessary testimony of a genuinely and fully Christian married and family_life . She entrusts to her priests the testimony of a life wholly dedicated to pondering and seeking the new and delightful realities of God s kingdom . If this means_that the priest_-isaia- without a direct personal experience of married life , he nevertheless will_be_able through_his training , his_ministry and the grace of his office , to gain even deeper insights into every_human yearning . This will allow him to meet problems of this_kind -atti_degli_apostoli- their source and give solid support by his advice and assistance to married persons and Christian families . For the Christian family , the example of the priest who_-isaia- living his_life of celibacy to the full will underscore the spiritual dimension of every love worthy of the name , and his personal sacrifice will merit for the faithful united in the holy bond of matrimony the grace of a true union . The Priest and Solitude . By reason of his celibacy the priest_-isaia- a man alone : that_-isaia- true , but his solitude -isaia- not meaningless emptiness because_it_-isaia- filled_with God and the brimming riches of His kingdom . Moreover , he has prepared himself for_this solitude which_should be an internal and external plenitude of charity if he has chosen it with full understanding , and not through any proud desire to be different from the rest of men , or to withdraw himself from common responsibilities , or to alienate himself from his_brothers , or to show contempt for the world . Though set apart_from the world , the priest_-isaia- not separated_from the People of God , because he has_been '' appointed to act on behalf of men , '' since he -isaia- '' consecrated '' completely to charity and to the work for_which the Lord has chosen him . The Loneliness of Christ . At times loneliness will weigh heavily on the priest , but he will_not for that_reason regret having generously chosen it . Christ , too , in the most tragic hours of His life was alone abandoned by the very ones whom He had chosen as witnesses to , and companions of , His life , and whom He had loved '' to the end '' but He stated , '' I -amos- not alone , for the Father -isaia- with me . '' He who_has chosen to belong completely to Christ will_find , above all , in intimacy with Him and in His grace , the power of spirit necessary to banish sadness and regret and to triumph over discouragement . He will_not be lacking the protection of the Virgin Mother of . Jesus nor the motherly solicitude of the Church , to whom he has_given himself in service . He will_not be without_the kindly care of his_father in Christ , his bishop ; nor will the fraternal companionship of his fellow priests and the love of the entire People of God , most fruitful of consolations , be lacking to him . And if hostility , lack of confidence and the indifference of his fellow men make his solitude quite painful , he will thus be able to share , with dramatic clarity , the very experience of Christ , as an apostle who must_not be '' greater_than he who sent him , '' as a friend admitted to the most painful and most glorious secret of his_divine Friend who_has chosen him to bring forth the mysterious fruit of life in his own_life , which_-isaia- only apparently one of death . Our reflection on the beauty , importance and intimate fittingness of holy virginity for the ministers of Christ and His Church makes it incumbent on those_who hold the office of teacher and pastor of that Church to take steps to assure and promote its positive observance , from the first moment of preparation to receive such a precious gift . In fact , the difficulties and problems which_make the observance of chastity very painful or quite impossible for some , spring , not infrequently , from a type of priestly formation which , given the great changes of these last years , -isaia-_no_longer completely adequate for the formation of a personality worthy of a '' man of God . '' Carrying Out the Council s Norms . The Second Vatican Council has_already indicated wise criteria and guidelines to this_end . They are in conformity_with_the progress of psychology and pedagogy , as well as with the changed conditions of mankind and of contemporary society . It -isaia- Our wish_that appropriate instructions be drawn up with the help of truly qualified men , treating with all necessary detail the theme of chastity . They should be sent out as soon as possible to provide competent and timely assistance to those_who_have the great responsibility within_the Church of preparing future priests . Personal Response to the Divine Vocation . The priesthood -isaia- a ministry instituted by Christ for the service of His Mystical Body which_-isaia- the Church . To her belongs the authority to admit to that priesthood those_whom she judges qualified that_-isaia- , those_to_whom God has_given , along_with other signs of an ecclesiastical vocation , the gift of a consecrated celibacy . In virtue of such a gift , confirmed by canon_law , the individual -isaia- called to respond with free judgment and total dedication , adapting his_own mind and outlook to the will of God who calls him . Concretely , this_divine calling manifests itself in a given individual with_his own definite personality structure which_-isaia-_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all overpowered by grace . In candidates_for_the_priesthood , therefore , the sense of receiving this_divine gift should be cultivated ; so too , a sense_of_responsibility in their meeting with God , with the highest importance given to supernatural means . It -isaia- likewise necessary_that exact account be taken of the physical and psychological state of the candidate in order to guide and orient him toward_the priestly ideal ; so a truly adequate formation should harmoniously coordinate grace and nature in the man in whom one clearly sees the proper conditions and qualifications . These conditions should be ascertained as soon as signs of his holy vocation are first indicated not hastily or superficially , but carefully , with the assistance and aid of a doctor or a competent psychologist . A serious investigation of hereditary factors should_not be omitted . Those who_are discovered to be unfit for physical , psychological or moral reasons should be quickly removed from the path to the priesthood . Let educators appreciate that_this_-isaia- one of their_very grave duties . They must neither indulge in false hopes and dangerous illusions nor permit the candidate to nourish these hopes in any_way , with resultant damage to himself or to the Church . The life of the celibate priest , which engages the whole man so totally and so delicately , excludes in fact those of insufficient physical , psychic and moral qualifications . Nor should anyone pretend that grace supplies for the defects of nature in such a man . After the capability of a man has_been ascertained and he has_been admitted to the course of studies leading to the goal of the priesthood , care should be taken for the progressive development of a mature personality through physical , intellectual and moral education directed toward_the control and personal dominion of his temperament , sentiments and passions . The Necessity of Discipline . This will be proved by the firmness of the spirit with_which he accepts the personal and community type of discipline demanded by the priestly life . Such a regime , the lack or deficiency of which_-isaia- to be deplored because it exposes the candidate to grave disorders , should_not be borne only as an imposition from without . It should be inculcated and implanted as an indispensable component within_the context of the spiritual_life . The educator should skillfully stimulate the young_man to the evangelical virtue of sincerity and to spontaneity by approving every good personal initiative , so that the young_man will come to know and properly evaluate himself , wisely assume his_own responsibilities , and train himself to that self control which_-isaia- of such importance in priestly education . The exercise of authority , the principle of which_should be maintained firmly , will be animated by wise moderation and a pastoral attitude . It will be used in a climate of dialogue and will be implemented in a gradual way which_will afford the educator an ever deepening understanding of the psychology of the young_man , and will appeal to personal conviction . The complete education of the candidate for the priesthood should be directed to help him acquire a tranquil , convinced and free choice of the grave responsibilities which he must assume in conscience before God and the Church . Ardor and generosity are marvelous qualities of youth ; illuminated and supported , they merit , along_with the blessing of the Lord , the admiration and confidence of the whole Church as well as of all men . None of the real personal and social difficulties which their choice will_bring in its train should remain hidden to the young_men , so that_their enthusiasm will_not be superficial and illusory . At the same_time it will be right to highlight with -atti_degli_apostoli- least equal truth and clarity the sublimity of their choice , which , though it may lead on the one_hand to a certain physical and psychic void , nevertheless on the other brings with it an interior richness capable of elevating the person most profoundly . Young candidates_for_the_priesthood should be convinced_that they_cannot follow their difficult way without a special type of asceticism proper to themselves and more demanding than that_which_-isaia- required of the other faithful . It will be a demanding asceticism but_not a suffocating one_which consists in the deliberate and assiduous practice of those virtues which_make a man a priest : self denial in the highest degree an essential condition if one would follow Christ ; humility and obedience as expressions of internal truth and of an ordered liberty ; prudence , justice , courage and temperance virtues without which_it_-isaia- impossible for true and profound religious_life to exist ; a sense_of_responsibility , fidelity and loyalty in the acceptance of one s obligations ; a balance between contemplation and action ; detachment and a spirit of poverty , which_will give tone and vigor to evangelical freedom ; chastity , the result of a persevering struggle , harmonized with all the other natural and supernatural virtues ; a serene and secure contact_with_the world to whose service the young_man will dedicate himself for Christ and for His kingdom . In such_a_way the aspirant to the priesthood will acquire , with the help of a divine_grace , a strong , mature and balanced personality , a combination of inherited and acquired qualities , harmony of all his powers in the light of the faith and in intimate_union with Christ , whom he has chosen for_himself and for the ministry of salvation to the world . However , to judge with more certainty the young_man s fitness for the priesthood and to have successive proofs of his attained maturity on both the human and supernatural levels for '' it -isaia- more difficult to conduct oneself correctly in the service of souls because of dangers coming from outside '' it will be advisable to have a preliminary trial period before the observance of holy celibacy becomes something definitive and permanent through ordination to the priesthood . A Gift to the Lord and His Church . Once moral certainty has_been obtained that the maturity of the candidate -isaia- sufficiently guaranteed , he will be in a position to take on himself_the heavy and sweet burden of priestly chastity as a total gift of himself to the Lord and to His Church . In this_way , the obligation of celibacy , which_the Church makes a condition of Holy Orders , -isaia- accepted by the candidate through the influence of divine_grace and with full reflection and liberty , and , as -isaia- evident , not_without the wise and prudent advice of competent spiritual directors who are_concerned not to impose the choice , but_rather to dispose the candidate to make it more consciously . Hence , in that solemn moment when_the candidate will decide once and for his whole_life , he will_not feel the weight of an imposition from outside , but_rather the interior joy that accompanies a choice made for the love of Christ . THE PRIESTLY LIFE . The priest must_not think_that ordination makes everything easy for him and screens him once and for all from every temptation or danger . Chastity -isaia- not acquired all -atti_degli_apostoli- once but results from a laborious conquest and daily affirmation . Our world today stresses the positive values of love between_the sexes but has_also multiplied the difficulties and risks in this sphere . In order to safeguard his chastity with all care and affirm its sublime meaning , the priest must consider clearly and calmly his position as a man exposed to spiritual warfare against seductions of the flesh in himself and in the world , continually renewing his resolution to give an ever_increasing and ever better perfection to the irrevocable offering of himself which obliges him to a fidelity that_-isaia- complete , loyal and real . Christ s priest will daily receive new strength and joy as he deepens in meditation and prayer the motives for his gift and the conviction_that he has chosen the better part . He will ask humbly and perseveringly for the grace of fidelity , never denied to those_who ask it sincerely . At the same_time he will use the natural and supernatural means -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal . In particular he will_not disregard those ascetical norms which_have_been substantiated by the Church s experience and are no less necessary in modern circumstances than in former times . Intense Spiritual Life . The priest should apply himself above all else to developing , with all the love grace inspires in him , his close relationship_with Christ , and exploring this inexhaustible and enriching mystery ; he should_also acquire an ever deeper sense of the mystery of the Church . There would be the risk of his state of life seeming unreasonable and unfounded if it -isaia- viewed apart_from this_mystery . Priestly piety , nourished -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of God s word and the Holy Eucharist , lived within_the cycle of the liturgical year , inspired by a warm and enlightened devotion to the Virgin Mother of the supreme and eternal High Priest and Queen of the Apostles , will_bring him to the source of a true spiritual_life which alone provides a solid foundation for the observance of celibacy . The Spirit of the Priestly Ministry . In this_way the priest , with grace and peace in his_heart , will face with generosity the manifold tasks of his_life and ministry . If he performs these with_faith and zeal he will_find in them new occasions to show that he belongs entirely to Christ and His Mystical Body , for his_own sanctification and the sanctification of others . The charity of Christ which urges him on , will_help him not to renounce his higher feelings but to elevate and deepen them in a spirit of consecration in imitation of Christ the High Priest , who shared intimately in the life of men , loved and suffered for them , l and of Paul the Apostle who shared in the cares of all in order to bring_the light and power of the Gospel of God s grace to shine in the world . Rightly jealous of his full self_giving to the Lord , the priest should know_how to guard against emotional tendencies which give rise to desires not sufficiently enlightened or guided by the Spirit . He should beware of seeing spiritual or apostolic pretexts for_what are in fact dangerous inclinations of the heart . The priestly life certainly requires an authentic spiritual intensity in order to live by the Spirit ; it requires a truly virile asceticism both interior and exterior in one_who , belonging in a special_way to Christ , has in Him and through Him '' crucified the flesh with its passions and desires , '' not hesitating to face arduous and lengthy trials in order to do so . l In this_way Christ s minister will be the better able to show to the world_the fruits of the Spirit , which_are '' charity , joy , peace , patience , benignity , goodness , longanimity , mildness , faith , modesty , continency , chastity . '' l The Brotherhood of Priests . Moreover , priestly chastity -isaia- increased , guarded and defended by a way_of_life , surroundings and activity suited to a minister of God . For this_reason_the '' close sacramental brotherhood which all priests enjoy in virtue of their ordination must be fostered to the utmost . Our Lord Jesus Christ has taught the urgency of the new commandment of charity . He gave a wonderful example of it when He instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist and the Catholic priesthood , l and prayed to His Heavenly Father that the love the Father bore for Him from all eternity should be in His ministers and that He too should be in them . So the unity of spirit among priests should be active in their prayers , friendship and help of all kinds for one_another . Ore cannot sufficiently recommend to priests a life lived in common and directed entirely toward their sacred_ministry ; the practice of having frequent meetings with a fraternal exchange of ideas , counsel and experience with_their brother priests ; the movement to form associations which encourage priestly holiness . Charity For Fellow Priests . Priests should reflect on the advice of the Council , which reminds them of their common sharing in the priesthood so that_they_may feel a lively responsibility_for fellow priests troubled by difficulties which gravely endanger the divine gift they_have . They should_have a burning charity for those_who_have greater need of love , understanding and prayer , who_have need of prudent but effective help , and who_have a claim on their unbounded charity as those_who_are , and should be , their truest friends . Venerable brothers in the episcopacy , priest and ministers of the altar , by way of completing and leaving a remembrance of this written conversation with you , we should like to suggest this resolution to you : that on the anniversary of his ordination , or on Holy Thursday when all are_united in spirit commemorating the mystery of the institution of the priesthood , each one_should renew his total gift of himself to Christ our Lord ; reviving in this_way the awareness_that He has chosen you for His divine service , and repeating -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , humbly and courageously , the promise of our unswerving faithfulness to His love alone in your offering of perfect chastity . Now , with fatherly love and affection , Our heart turns anxiously and with deep sorrow to those unfortunate priests_who always remain Our dearly beloved brothers and whose absence We keenly regret . We speak of those_who , retaining the sacred character conferred by their priestly ordination , have nonetheless been sadly unfaithful to the obligations they accepted when ordained . Their sad state and its consequences to priests and to others move some to wonder if celibacy -isaia- not in some_way responsible_for such dramatic occurrences and for the scandals they inflict on God s People . In fact , the responsibility falls not on consecrated celibacy in itself but on a judgment of the fitness of the candidate of the priesthood which_was not_always adequate or prudent -atti_degli_apostoli- the proper time , or else it falls on the way_in_which sacred ministers live their_life of total consecration . Reasons for Dispensations . The Church -isaia-_very conscious of the sad state of these sons of hers and judges it necessary to make every_effort to avert or to remedy the wounds she suffers by their defection . Following the example of Our immediate predecessors , We also have , in cases concerning ordination to the priesthood , been prepared to allow inquiry to extend beyond_the provisions of the present canon_law l to other very grave reasons which give ground for really solid doubts regarding the full freedom and responsibility of the candidate for the priesthood and his fitness for the priestly state . This has_been done to free those_who , on careful judicial consideration of their case , are seen to be really unsuited . The Church s Concern . The dispensations which_are granted after such considerations a minimal percentage when_they_are compared with the great number of good , worthy priests provide in justice for the spiritual salvation of the individual and show -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Church s concern to safeguard celibacy and the complete fidelity of all her ministers . In granting such dispensations the Church always acts with heartfelt regret , especially in the particularly lamentable cases in which refusal to bear worthily this sweet yoke of Christ results from crises in faith , or moral weakness , and -isaia- thus frequently a failure in responsibility and a source of scandal to the Christian people . If these priests knew how_much sorrow , dishonor and unrest they bring to the holy Church of God , if they reflected on the seriousness and beauty of their obligations and on the dangers to which_they_are exposed in this_life and in the next , there_would be greater care and reflection in their decisions ; they_would pray more assiduously and show greater courage and logic in forestalling the causes of their_spiritual and moral collapse . Mother Church takes particular interest in what befalls young priests_who , no matter how_great the zeal and enthusiasm with which_they entered the sacred_ministry , have nevertheless been troubled later on in performing their_duties by feelings of hopelessness , doubt , desire , or folly . Hence , especially in these circumstances , it -isaia- the wish of the Church that_every persuasive means available be used to lead our_brothers from this wavering state and restore to them peace of soul , trust , penance , and their former zeal . It -isaia- only_when no other solution can be found for a priest in this unhappy condition that he should be relieved of his office . The Granting of Dispensations . There are_some whose priesthood cannot be saved , but whose serious dispositions nevertheless give promise of their being able to live as good Christian lay_people . To these the Holy See , having studied all the circumstances with_their bishops or with_their religious superiors , sometimes grants a dispensation , thus letting love conquer sorrow . In order , however_,_that her unhappy but always dear son may_have a salutary sign of her_maternal grief and a keener remembrance of the universal need of God s mercy , in these cases she imposes some works of piety and reparation . Encouragement and Warning . Inspiring this discipline , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once severe and merciful , are justice and truth , prudence and reserve . It -isaia- without_doubt a discipline which_will confirm good priests in their determination to live lives of purity and holiness . At the same_time it will be a warning to those aspiring to the priesthood . Guided by the wisdom of those_who educate them , they_will approach their priesthood fully aware of its obligations and entirely forgetfully of self , responding generously to divine_grace and the will of Christ and His Church . Finally , and with deep joy , We thank our Lord because many priests_who for a time had_been unfaithful to their obligations have again , with the grace of the High Priest , found the path and given joy to all by becoming anew exemplary pastors . With admirable good_will , they used all the means which_were helpful to ensure their return , especially an intense life of prayer , humility , persevering effort sustained by regular reception of the Sacrament of Penance . THE BISHOP S FATHERLINESS . There -isaia- an irreplaceable and very effective means to ensure for our dear priests an easier and happier way of being faithful to their obligations , and it -isaia- one which_they_have the right and duty to find in you_,_venerable brother bishops . It was you_who called them and destined them to be priests ; it was you_who placed your hands on their heads ; with you they_are one in sharing the honor of the priesthood by virtue of the Sacrament of Orders ; it -isaia- you whom they_make present in the community of the faithful ; with you they are_united in a spirit of trust and generosity since , in as far as -isaia- compatible with_their order , they take upon themselves your duties and concerns . In choosing a life dedicated to celibacy they follow_the ancient examples of the prelates of the East and West ; this provides a new motive for union between bishop and priest and a sound hope that_they_will live together more_closely . The love_which Jesus had for His Apostles showed itself very clearly when he made them ministers of His real and Mystical Body ; and even you in whose person '' Our Lord Jesus Christ , the high_priest , -isaia- present in the midst of those who_believe , '' know_that you owe the best part of your hearts and pastoral_care to your priests and to the young_men preparing to be priests . l In no other way can you better show this conviction than in the conscious responsibility and sincere and unconquerable love with_which you preside over the education of your seminarians , and help your priests in every way possible to remain faithful to their_vocation and their_duties . Your fraternal and kindly presence must fill up in advance the human loneliness of the priest , which_-isaia- so often the cause of his discouragement and temptations . Before being the superiors and judges of your priests , be their teachers , fathers , friends , their good and kind brothers always ready to understand , to sympathize and to help . Encourage your priests in every possible way to be your personal friends and to be very open with you . This will_not weaken the relationship of juridical obedience ; rather it will transform it into pastoral love so that_they_will obey more willingly , sincerely and securely . If they_have a filial trust in you , your priests will_be_able in time to open up their_souls and to confide their difficulties in you in the certainty_that they_can rely on your kindness to be protected from eventual defeat , without a servile fear of punishment , but in the filial expectation of correction , pardon and help , which_will inspire them to resume their difficult journey with a new confidence . Authority and Fatherliness . Venerable brothers , all of you_are certainly convinced_that to restore to the soul of a priest joy in and enthusiasm for his vocation , interior peace and salvation , -isaia- an urgent and glorious ministry which_has an incalculable influence on a multitude of souls . There will be times when_you must exercise your authority by showing a just severity toward those few who , after_having resisted your kindness , by their conduct cause scandal to the People of God ; but you will_take the necessary precautions to ensure their seeing the error of their ways . Following the example of our Lord Jesus , '' the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls , '' do not crush the '' bruised reed '' nor quench the '' smoldering wick '' ; l like Jesus , heal their wounds , save what_was lost ; with eagerness and love go in search of the lost sheep and bring him back to the warmth of the sheepfold and like Him , try until the end to call back the unfaithful friend . We are certain , venerable_brothers , that_you will leave nothing undone to foster , by your teaching , prudence and pastoral zeal , the ideal of consecrated celibacy among your_clergy . We are sure too that_you will_never neglect those priests_who have strayed from the house of God , their true home , no matter where their painful odyssey has led them ; for they still remain your sons . ROLE OF THE FAITHFUL . Priestly virtue -isaia- a treasure that belongs to the whole Church . It -isaia- an enrichment and a splendor above the ordinary , which redounds to the building up and the profit of the entire People of God . We wish therefore to address to all the faithful , Our children in Christ , an affectionate and urgent exhortation . We wish that_they too feel responsible_for the virtue of t ho se brothers of theirs who_have undertaken the mission of serving them in the priesthood for the salvation of their_souls . They should pray and work_for priestly vocations ; they_should help priests wholeheartedly , with filial love and ready collaboration ; they should_have the firm intention of offering them the consolation of a joyous response to their pastoral labors . They should encourage these , their fathers in Christ , to overcome the difficulties of every sort which_they encounter as they fulfill their_duties , with entire faithfulness , to the edification of all . In a spirit of faith and Christian love , they_should foster a deep respect and a delicate reserve in their dealings with priests , on account of their condition as men entirely consecrated to Christ and to the Church . Invitation to the Laity . Our invitation goes out specially to those lay_people who seek God with_greater earnestness and intensity , and strive after Christian perfection while living in the midst of their fellow men . By their devoted and warm friendship they_can be of great assistance to the Church s ministers since_it_-isaia- the laity , occupied with temporal affairs while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time aiming -atti_degli_apostoli- a more generous and perfect conformity to their baptismal vocation , who_are in a position , in many cases , to enlighten and encourage the priest . The integrity of his vocation , one_that plunges him into the mystery of Christ and the Church , can suffer harm from various circumstances and from contamination by a destructive worldliness . In this_way the whole People of God will honor Christ our Lord in those_who represent Him and of whom He has said : '' He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him_who sent me , '' promising an assured reward to anyone_who in any_way shows charity toward those_whom He has_sent . Venerable brothers , pastors of God s flock throughout_the_world , and dearly beloved priests , Our sons and brothers : as We come to the end of this_letter which We have addressed to you , We invite you , with a soul responsive to Christ s great love , to turn your eyes and heart with renewed confidence and filial hope to the most loving Mother of Jesus and Mother of the Church , and to invoke for the Catholic priesthood her powerful and maternal intercession . In her the People of God admire and venerate the image of the Church , and model of faith , charity and perfect union with Him . May Mary Virgin and Mother obtain for the Church , which also -isaia- hailed as virgin and mother , to rejoice always , though with due humility , in the faithfulness of her priests to the sublime gift of holy virginity they have_received , and to see it flourishing and appreciated ever more_and_more in every walk of life , so that the army of those_who '' follow_the divine Lamb wherever He goes '' may increase throughout_the earth . The Church proclaims her hope in Christ ; she_-isaia- conscious of the critical shortage of priests when compared with the spiritual necessities of the world s population ; but she_-isaia- confident in her expectation which_-isaia- founded on the infinite and mysterious power of grace , that the high spiritual quality of her ministers will bring_about an increase also in their numbers , for everything -isaia- possible to God . l In this faith and in this hope , may the apostolic_blessing which we impart with all Our heart be for all a pledge of heavenly graces and the testimony of Our fatherly affection .

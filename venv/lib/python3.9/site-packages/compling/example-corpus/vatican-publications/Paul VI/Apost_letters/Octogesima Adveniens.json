The eightieth anniversary of the publication of the encyclical Rerum Novarum , the message of which continues to inspire action for social_justice , prompts us to take up again and to extend the teaching of our_predecessors , in response to the new needs of a changing world . The Church , in fact , travels forward with humanity and shares its lot in the setting of history . At the same_time that_she announces to men the Good News of God s love and of salvation in Christ she clarifies their activity in the light of the Gospel and in this_way helps them to correspond to God s plan of love and to realize the fullness of their aspirations . It -isaia- with confidence that we see the Spirit of the Lord pursuing his_work in the hearts of men and in every place gathering together Christian communities conscious of their responsibilities in society . On all the continents , among all races , nations and cultures , and under all conditions the Lord continues to raise up authentic apostles of the Gospel . We have_had the opportunity to meet these_people , to admire them and to give_them our encouragement in the course of our recent journeys . We have gone into the crowds and have heard their appeals , cries of distress and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time cries of hope . Under these circumstances we have_seen in a new perspective the grave problems of our_time . These problems of course are particular to each part_of_the_world , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time they_are common to all mankind , which_-isaia- questioning itself about its future and about the tendency and the meaning of the changes taking place . Flagrant inequalities exist in the economic , cultural and political development of the nations : while some regions are heavily industrialized , others are_still -atti_degli_apostoli- the agricultural stage ; while some_countries enjoy prosperity , others are struggling against starvation ; while some peoples have a high standard of culture , others are_still engaged in eliminating illiteracy . From all sides there rises a yearning for more justice and a desire_for a better guaranteed peace in mutual respect among individuals and peoples . There -isaia- of course a wide diversity among the situations in which Christians willingly or unwillingly find_themselves according to regions , socio political systems and cultures . In some places they_are reduced to silence , regarded with suspicion and as it were kept on the fringe of society , enclosed without freedom in a totalitarian system . In other places they_are a weak minority whose voice makes itself heard with difficulty . In some other nations , where_the Church sees her place recognized , sometimes officially so , she too finds herself subjected to the repercussions of the crisis which_-isaia- unsettling society , some of her members are tempted by radical and violent solutions from which_they believe that_they_can expect a happier outcome . While some people , unaware of present injustices , strive to prolong the existing situations , others allow themselves to be beguiled by revolutionary ideologies which promise them , not_without delusion , a definitively better world . In the face of such widely varying situations it -isaia- difficult for us to utter a unified message and to put forward a solution which_has universal validity . Such -isaia- not our ambition , nor_-isaia- it our mission . It -isaia- up to the Christian communities to analyze with objectivity the situation which_-isaia- proper to their_own country , to shed on it the light of the Gospel s unalterable words and to draw principles of reflection , norms of judgment and directives for action from the social_teaching of the Church . This social_teaching has_been worked out in the course of history and notably , in this industrial era , since_the historic date of the message of Pope Leo XIII on '' the condition of the workers '' , and it -isaia- an honor and joy for us to celebrate today the anniversary of that message . It -isaia- up to these Christian communities , with the help of the Holy Spirit , in communion with the bishops_who hold responsibility and in dialogue_with other Christian brethren and all men of goodwill , to discern the options and commitments which are_called for in order to bring_about the social , political and economic changes seen in many cases to be urgently needed . In this search_for the changes which_should be promoted , Christians must first of all renew their confidence in the forcefulness and special character of the demands made by the Gospel . The Gospel -isaia- not out of date because it was proclaimed , written and lived in a different sociocultural context . Its inspiration , enriched by the living experience of Christian tradition over the centuries , remains ever_new for converting men : end for advancing the life of society . It -isaia- not however to be utilized for the profit of particular temporal options , to the neglect of its universal and eternal message . Specific message of the Church . Amid the disturbances and uncertainties of the present hour , the Church has a specific message to proclaim and a support to give to men in their_efforts to take in hand and give direction to their future . Since the period in which_the encyclical Rerum Novarum denounced in a forceful and imperative manner the scandal of the condition of the workers in the nascent industrial society , historical evolution has led to an awareness of other dimensions and other applications of social_justice . The encyclicals Quadragesimo Anno and Mater et Magistra already noted this_fact . The recent Council for its part took care to point them out , in particular in the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes . We ourself have_already continued these lines of thought in our_encyclical Populorum Progressio . '' Today '' , we said , '' the principal fact_that we must all recognize -isaia- that the social_question has become worldwide '' . '' A renewed consciousness of the demands of the Gospel makes it the Church s duty to put herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of all , to help_them grasp their serious problem in all its dimensions , and to convince them that solidarity in action -atti_degli_apostoli- this turning point in human_history -isaia-_a_matter of urgency '' . It will moreover be for the forthcoming Synod of Bishops itself to study more_closely and to examine in greater detail the Church s mission in the face of grave issues raised today by the question of justice in the world . But the anniversary of Rerum Novarum , venerable brother , gives us the opportunity today to confide our preoccupations and thoughts in the face of this problem to you as President of the Pontifical Commission Justice and Peace and of the Council of Laity . In this_way it -isaia-_also our wish to offer these bodies of the Holy See our encouragement in their ecclesial activity in the service of men . Extent of present_day changes . In so doing , our purpose without however forgetting the permanent problems already dealt_with by our_predecessors -isaia- to draw attention to a number of questions . These are questions which because_of_their urgency , extent and complexity must in the years to come take first_place among the preoccupations of Christians , so that with_other men the latter may dedicate themselves to solving the new difficulties which put the very future of man in jeopardy . It -isaia- necessary to situate the problems created by the modern economy in the wider context of a new civilization . These problems include human conditions of production , fairness in the exchange of goods and in the division of wealth , the significance of the increased needs of consumption and the sharing of responsibility . In the present changes , which_are so profound and so rapid , each_day man discovers himself anew , and he questions himself about the meaning of his_own being and of his collective survival . Reluctant to gather the lessons of a past that he considers over and done with and too different from the present , man nevertheless needs to have light shed upon his future a future which he perceives to be as uncertain as it -isaia- changing by permanent eternal truths . These are truths_which are certainly greater_than man but , if he so wills , he can himself find_their traces . New Social Problems Urbanization . A major phenomenon draws our attention , as much in the industrialized countries as in those_which are developing : urbanization . After long centuries , agrarian civilization -isaia- weakening . Is sufficient attention being devoted to the arrangement and improvement of the life of the country people , whose inferior and -atti_degli_apostoli- times miserable economic situation provokes the flight to the unhappy crowded conditions of the city outskirts , where neither employment nor housing awaits them ? This unceasing flight from the land , industrial growth , continual demographic expansion and the attraction of urban , centers bring_about concentrations of population , the extent of which_-isaia- difficult to imagine , for people are_already speaking in terms of a '' megalopolis '' grouping together tens of millions of persons . Of course there exist medium sized towns , the dimension of which ensures a better balance in the population . While being able to offer employment to those_that progress in agriculture makes available , they permit an adjustment of the human environment which better avoids the proletarianism and crowding of the great built up areas . The inordinate growth of these centers accompanies industrial expansion , without being identified with it . Based on technological research and the transformation of nature , industrialization constantly goes forward , giving proof of incessant creativity . While certain enterprises develop and are concentrated , others die or change their location . Thus new social problems are created : professional or regional unemployment , redeployment and mobility of persons , permanent adaptation of workers and disparity of conditions in the different branches of industry . Unlimited competition utilizing the modern means of publicity incessantly launches new products and tries to attract the consumer , while earlier industrial installations which are_still capable of functioning become useless . While very large areas of the population are unable to satisfy their primary needs , superfluous needs are ingeniously created . It can thus rightly be asked if , in spite of all his conquests , man Is not turning back against himself_the results of his activity . Having rationally endeavored to control nature , -isaia- he not now becoming the slave of the objects which he makes ? Christians in the City . Is not the rise of an urban civilization which accompanies the advance of industrial civilization a true challenge to the wisdom of man , to his capacity_for organization and to his farseeing imagination ? Within industrial society urbanization up '' sets both the ways of life and the habitual structures of existence : the family , the neighborhood , and the very framework of the Christian community . Man -isaia- experiencing a new loneliness ; it -isaia- not in the face of a hostile nature which it has_taken him centuries to subdue , but in an anonymous crowd which surrounds him and in which he feels himself a stranger . Urbanization , undoubtedly an irreversible stage in the development of human societies , confronts man with difficult problems . How -isaia- he to master its growth , regulate its organization , and successfully accomplish its animation for the good of all ? In this disordered growth , new proletariats are born . They install themselves in the heart of the cities sometimes abandoned by the rich ; they dwell on the outskirts which become a belt of misery besieging in a still silent protest the luxury which blatantly cries out from centers of consumption and waste . Instead of favoring fraternal encounter and mutual aid , the city fosters discrimination and also indifference . It lends itself to new_forms of exploitation and of domination whereby some people in speculating on the needs of others derive inadmissible profits . Behind the facades much misery -isaia- hidden , unsuspected even by the closest neighbors ; other_forms of misery spread where human_dignity founders : delinquency , criminality , abuse of drugs and eroticism . It -isaia-_in_fact the weakest who_are the victims of dehumanizing living conditions , degrading for con science and harmful for the family institution . The promiscuity of working people s housing makes a minimum of intimacy impossible ; young couples waiting in vain for a decent dwelling -atti_degli_apostoli- a price they_can afford are demoralized and their union can thereby even be endangered ; youth escape from a home which_-isaia- too confined and seek in the streets compensations and companionships which_cannot be supervised . It -isaia- the grave duty of those responsible to strive to control this_process and to give it direction . There -isaia- an urgent_need to remake -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the street , of the neighborhood or of the great agglomerative dwellings the social fabric whereby man may_be_able to develop the needs of his personality . Centers of special interest and of culture must be created or developed -atti_degli_apostoli- the community and parish levels with different_forms of associations , recreational centers , and spiritual and community gatherings where_the individual can escape from isolation and form anew fraternal relationships . To build up the city , the place_where men and their expanded communities exist , to create new modes of neighborliness and relationships , to perceive an original application of social_justice and to undertake responsibility_for this collective future , which_-isaia- foreseen as difficult , -isaia- a task in which Christians must share . To those_who_are heaped up in an urban promiscuity which becomes intolerable it -isaia- necessary to bring a message of hope . This can be done by brotherhood which_-isaia- lived and by concrete justice . Let Christians , conscious of this_new responsibility , not lose heart in view of the vast and faceless society ; let_them recall Jonah who traversed Niniveh , the great city , to proclaim therein the good_news of God s mercy and was upheld in his weakness by the sole strength of the word of Almighty God . In the Bible , the city -isaia-_in_fact often the place of sin and pride the pride of man_who feels secure enough to be able to build his_life without God and even to affirm that_he_-isaia- powerful against God . But there_-isaia-_also the example of Jerusalem , the Holy City , the place_where God -isaia- encountered , the promise of the city which_comes_from on high . Urban life and industrial change bring strongly to light questions which until now were poorly grasped . What place , for example , in this_world being brought to birth , should be given to youth ? Everywhere dialogue -isaia- proving to be difficult between youth , with its aspirations , renewal and also insecurity for the future , and the adult generations . It -isaia- obvious to all that here we have a source of serious conflicts , division and opting out , even within_the family , and a questioning of modes of authority , education for freedom and the handing on of values and beliefs , which strikes -atti_degli_apostoli- the deep roots of society . The role of women Similarly , in many countries a charter for women which_would put an end to an actual discrimination and would establish relationships of equality in rights and of respect_for their_dignity -isaia- the object of study and -atti_degli_apostoli- times of lively demands . We do not_have in mind_that false equality which_would deny the distinction with woman s proper role , which_-isaia- of such capital importance , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the family as well as within society . Developments in legislation should on the contrary be directed to protecting her proper vocation and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time recognizing her independence as a person , and her equal rights to participate in cultural , economic , social and political_life . As the Church solemnly reaffirmed in the recent Council , '' the beginning , the subject and the goal of all social institutions -isaia- and must be the human_person '' . Every man_has the right to work , to a chance to develop his qualities and his personality in the exercise of his profession , to equitable remuneration which will_enable him and his family '' to lead a worthy life on the material , social , cultural and spiritual level '' and to assistance in case of need arising from sickness or age . Although for the defense of these rights democratic societies accept today the principle of labor union rights , they_are_not always open to their exercise . The important role of union organizations must be admitted : their object -isaia- the representation of the various categories of workers , their lawful collaboration in the economic advance of society , and the development of the sense of their responsibility_for the realization of the common_good . Their activity , however , -isaia- not_without its difficulties . Here and there the temptation can arise of profiting from a position of force to impose , particularly by strikes the right to which as a final means of defense remains certainly recognized conditions which_are too burdensome for the overall economy and for the social body , or to desire to obtain in this_way demands of a directly political nature . When it -isaia-_a_question of public service , required_for the life of an entire nation , it -isaia- necessary to be able to assess the limit beyond which_the harm caused to society become inadmissible . In short , progress has_already_been made in introducing , in the area of human relationships , greater justice and greater sharing of responsibilities . But in this immense field much remains to be done . Further reflection , research and experimentation must be actively pursued , unless one_-isaia- to be late in meeting the legitimate aspirations of the workers aspirations which are_being increasingly asserted according as their education , their consciousness of their_dignity and the strength of their organizations increase . Egoism and domination are permanent temptations for men . Likewise an ever finer discernment -isaia- needed , in order to strike -atti_degli_apostoli- the roots of newly arising situations of injustice and to establish progressively a justice which_will be less and less imperfect . In industrial change , which demands speedy and constant adaptation , those_who will find_themselves injured will be more numerous and -atti_degli_apostoli- a greater disadvantage from the point_of_view of making their voices heard . The Church directs her attention to those new '' poor '' the handicapped and the maladjusted , the old , different groups of those on the fringe of society , and so on in order to recognize them , help_them ; defend their place and dignity in a society hardened by competition and the attraction of success . Among the victims of situations of injustice unfortunately no new phenomenon must be placed those_who_are discriminated against , in law or in fact , on account of their race , origin , color , culture , sex or religion . Racial discrimination possesses -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment a character of very great relevance by reason of the tension which it stirs up both within countries and on the international level . Men rightly consider unjustifiable and reject as inadmissible the tendency to maintain or introduce legislation or behavior systematically inspired by racialist prejudice . The members of mankind share the same basic rights_and_duties , as well as the same supernatural destiny . Within a country which belongs to each_one , all should be equal before the law , find equal admittance to economic , cultural , civic and social_life and benefit from a fair sharing of the nation s riches . We are thinking of the precarious situation of a great number of emigrant workers whose condition as foreigners makes it all the more difficult for them to make any sort of social vindication , in spite of their real participation in the economic effort of the country that receives them . It -isaia- urgently necessary_for people to go beyond a narrowly nationalist attitude in their regard and to give_them a charter which_will assure them a right to emigrate , favor their integration , facilitate their professional advancement and give_them access to decent housing where , if such_-isaia- the case , their_families can join them . Linked to this category are the people_who , to find work , or to escape a disaster or a hostile climate , leave their regions and find_themselves without roots among_other people . It -isaia- everyone s duty , but especially that of Christians , to work with energy for the establishment of universal brotherhood , the indispensable basis for authentic justice and the condition_for enduring peace : '' We cannot in truthfulness call_upon that God who_-isaia- the Father of all if we refuse to act in a brotherly way toward certain men , created to God s image . A man s relationship_with God the Father and his relationship_with his_brother men_are so linked together that Scripture says : He who_does_not love does_not know God I Jn . With demographic growth , which_-isaia- particularly pronounced in the young nations , the number of those failing to find work and driven to misery or parasitism will grow in the coming years unless the conscience of man rouses itself and gives_rise to a general movement of solidarity through an effective policy of investment and of organization of production and trade , as well as of education . We know_the attention given to these problems within international organizations , and it -isaia-_our lively wish that_their members will_not delay bringing their actions into line with_their declarations . It -isaia- disquieting in this_regard to note a kind of fatalism which_-isaia- gaining a hold even on people in positions of responsibility . This feeling sometimes leads to Malthusian solutions inculcated by active propaganda for contraception and abortion . In this critical situation , it must on the contrary be affirmed that the family , without_which no society can stand , has a right to the assistance which_will assure it of the conditions for a healthy development . '' It -isaia- certain '' , we said in our_encyclical Populorum Progressio , '' that public_authorities can intervene , within_the limit of their competence , by favoring the availability of appropriate information and by adopting suitable measures , provided_that these be in conformity_with_the moral_law and that_they respect the rightful freedom of married_couples . Where the inalienable right to marriage and procreation -isaia- lacking , human_dignity has ceased to exists '' . In no other age has the appeal to the imagination of society been so explicit . To this should be devoted enterprises of invention and capital as important as those invested for armaments or technological achievements . If man lets himself rush ahead without foreseeing in good time the emergence of new social problems , they will_become too grave for a peaceful solution to be hoped for . Media of social communication . Among the major changes of our_times , we do not wish to forget to emphasize the growing role being assumed by the media of social communication and their influence on the transformation of mentalities of knowledge , of organizations and of society itself . Certainly they_have many positive aspects . Thanks to them news from the entire world reaches us practically in an instant , establishing contacts which supersede distances and creating elements of unity among all men . A greater spread of education and culture -isaia- becoming possible . Nevertheless , by their_very action the media of social communication are reaching the point of representing as it were a new power . One cannot_but ask about those_who really hold this_power , the aims that_they pursue and the means they use , and finally , about the effect of their activity on the exercise of individual liberty , both in the political and ideological spheres and in social , economic and cultural life . The men_who hold this_power have a grave moral responsibility with_respect to the truth of the information that_they spread , the needs and the reactions that_they generate and the values_which they put forward . In the case of television , moreover , what_-isaia- coming into being -isaia- an original mode of knowledge and a new civilization : that of the image . Naturally , the public_authorities cannot ignore the growing power and influence of the media of social communication and the advantages and risks which their use involves for the civic community and for its development and real perfecting . Consequently they_are_called upon to perform their_own positive function for the common_good by encouraging every constructive expression , by supporting individual citizens and groups in defending the fundamental values of the person and of human_society , and also by taking suitable steps to prevent the spread of what would harm the common heritage of values on which orderly civil progress -isaia- based . While the horizon of man_-isaia- thus being modified according to the images that_are chosen for him , another transformation -isaia- making itself felt , one which_-isaia- the dramatic and unexpected consequence of human activity . Man -isaia- suddenly becoming aware_that by an ill considered exploitation of nature he risks destroying it and becoming in his turn the victim of this degradation . Not only -isaia- the material environment becoming a permanent menace pollution and refuse , new illness and absolute destructive capacity but the human framework -isaia-_no_longer under man s control , thus creating an environment for tomorrow which_may well be intolerable . This -isaia- a wide ranging social problem which concerns the entire human_family . The Christian must turn to these new perceptions in order to take on responsibility , together_with_the rest of men , for a destiny which from now on -isaia- shared by all . Fundamental Aspirations and Currents of Ideas . While scientific and technological progress continues to overturn man s surroundings , his patterns of knowledge , work , consumption and relationships , two aspirations persistently make themselves felt in these new contexts , and they grow stronger to the extent_that he becomes better informed and better educated : the aspiration to equality and the aspiration to participation , two forms of man s dignity and freedom . Advantages and limitations of juridical recognition . Through the statement of the rights of man and the seeking for international agreements for the application of these rights , progress has been_made towards inscribing these_two aspirations in deeds and structures . Nevertheless various_forms of discrimination continually reappear ethnic cultural , religious , political and so on . In fact , human_rights are_still too_often disregarded , if not scoffed -atti_degli_apostoli- , or else they receive only formal recognition . In many cases legislation does_not keep up with real situations . Legislation -isaia- necessary , but_it_-isaia- not sufficient for setting up true relationships of justice and equity . In teaching us charity , the Gospel instructs us in the preferential respect due to the poor and the special situation they_have in society : the more fortunate should renounce some of their_rights so as to place their goods more generously -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others . If , beyond legal rules , there_-isaia- really no deeper feeling of respect_for and service to others , then even equality before the law can serve as an alibi for flagrant discrimination , continued exploitation and actual contempt . Without a renewed education in solidarity , an overemphasis of equality can_give rise to an individualism in which_each one claims his_own rights without wishing to be answerable for the common_good . In this_field , everyone sees the highly important contribution of the Christian spirit , which moreover answers man s yearning to be loved . '' Love for_man , the prime value of the earthly order '' ensures the conditions for peace , both social peace and international peace , by affirming our universal brotherhood . The political society . The two aspirations , to equality and to participation , seek to promote a democratic type of society . Various models are proposed , some are tried out , none of them gives complete satisfaction , and the search goes on between ideological and pragmatic tendencies . The Christian has the duty to take_part in this search and in the organization and life of political society . As a social being , man builds his destiny within a series of particular groupings which demand , as their completion and as a necessary condition_for their development , a vaster society , one of a universal character , the political society . All particular activity must be placed within that wider society , and thereby it takes on the dimension of the common_good . This indicates the importance of education for life in society , in which_there are_called to mind , not_only information on each_one s rights , but_also their necessary correlative : the recognition of the duties of each_one in regard to others . and practice of duty are themselves conditioned by self mastery and by the acceptance of responsibility and of the limits placed upon the freedom of the individual or of the group . Political activity need one remark that_we_are dealing primarily with an activity , not an ideology ? should be the projection of a plan of society_which -isaia- consistent in its concrete means and in its inspiration , and which springs from a complete conception of man s vocation and of its differing social expressions . It -isaia- not_for the State or even_for political parties , which_would be closed unto themselves , to try to impose an ideology by means_that would lead to a dictatorship over minds , the worst kind of all . It -isaia- for cultural and religious groupings , in the freedom of acceptance which_they presume , to develop in the social body , disinterestedly and in their_own ways , those ultimate convictions on the nature , origin and end of man and society . In this_field , it -isaia- well to keep in mind the principle proclaimed -atti_degli_apostoli- the Second Vatican Council : '' The truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its_own truth , and it makes its entrance into the mind -atti_degli_apostoli- once quietly and with power '' . Ideologies and human liberty . Therefore the Christian who wishes to live his faith in a political activity which he thinks of as service cannot without contradicting himself adhere to ideological systems which radically or substantially go against his faith and his concept of man . He cannot adhere to the Marxist ideology , to its atheistic materialism , to its dialectic of violence and to the way it absorbs individual freedom in the collectivity , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time denying all transcendence to man and his personal and collective history ; nor_can be adhere to the liberal ideology which believes it exalts individual freedom by with drawing it from every limitation , by stimulating it through exclusive seeking of interest and power , and by considering social solidarities as more_or_less automatic consequences of individual initiatives , not as an aim and a major criterion of the value of the social organization . Is there need to stress the possible ambiguity of every social ideology ? Sometimes it leads political or social activity to be simply the application of an abstract , purely theoretical idea ; -atti_degli_apostoli- other times it -isaia- thought which becomes a mere instrument -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of activity as a simple means of a strategy . In both cases -isaia- it not man that risks finding himself alienated ? The Christian faith_-isaia- above and -isaia- sometimes opposed to the ideologies , in that it recognizes God , who_-isaia- transcendent and the Creator , and who , through all the levels of creation , calls on man as endowed_with responsibility and freedom . There would also be the danger of giving adherence to an ideology which_does_not rest on a true and organic doctrine , to take refuge in it as a final and sufficient explanation of everything , and thus to build a new idol , accepting , -atti_degli_apostoli- times without being aware of doing so , its totalitarian and coercive character . And people imagine they find in it a justification for their activity , even violent activity , and an adequate response to a generous desire to serve . The desire remains but it allows itself to be consumed by an ideology which , even if it suggests certain paths to man s liberation , ends up by making him a slave . It has_been possible today to speak of a retreat of ideologies . In this respect the present_time may be favorable for an openness to the concrete transcendence of Christianity . It may also be a more accentuated sliding towards a new positivism : universalized technology as the dominant form of activity , as the overwhelming pattern of existence , even as a language , without_the question of its meaning being really asked . But outside of this positivism which reduces man to a single dimension even if it be an important one today and by so doing mutilates him , the Christian encounters in his activity concrete historical movements sprung from ideologies and in part distinct from them . Our venerated predecessor Pope John XXIII in Pacem in Terris already showed that_it_-isaia- possible to make a distinction : '' Neither can false philosophical teachings regarding the nature , origin and destiny of the universe and of man be identified with historical movements that_have economic , social . cultural or political ends , not even_when these movements have originated from those teachings and have drawn and still draw inspiration therefrom . Because the teachings , once they_are drawn up and defined , remain always the same , while the movements , being concerned_with historical situations in constant evolution , cannot_but be influenced by these latter and cannot avoid , therefore , being subject to changes , even of a profound nature . Besides , who_can deny that_those movements , in so far as they conform to the dictates of right_reason and are interpreters of the lawful aspirations of the human_person , contain elements that_are positive and deserving of approval ? '' . Attraction of socialist currents . Some Christians are today attracted by socialist currents and their various developments . They try to recognize therein a certain number of aspirations which_they carry within themselves in the name of their_faith . They feel that_they_are part of that historical current and wish to play a part within it . Now this historical current takes on , under the same name , different_forms according to different continents and cultures , even if it drew its inspiration , and still does in many cases , from ideologies incompatible with_faith . Careful judgment -isaia- called_for . Too often Christians attracted by socialism tend to idealize it in terms which , apart_from anything else , are_very general : a will for_justice , solidarity and equality . They refuse to recognize_the limitations of the historical socialist movements , which remain conditioned by the ideologies from which_they originated . Distinctions must be made to guide concrete choices between_the various levels of expression of socialism : a generous aspiration and a seeking for a more just society , historical movements with a political organization and aim , and an ideology which claims to give a complete and self sufficient picture of man . Nevertheless , these distinctions must_not lead one to consider such levels as completely separate and independent . The concrete link which , according to circumstances , exists between_them must be clearly marked out . This insight will_enable Christians to see the degree of commitment possible along these lines , while safeguarding the values , especially_those of liberty , responsibility and openness to the spiritual , which guarantee the integral development of man . Historical evolution of Marxism . Other Christians even ask whether an historical development of Marxism might not authorize certain concrete rapprochements . They note in fact a certain splintering of Marxism , which until now showed itself to be a unitary ideology which explained in atheistic terms the whole of man and the world since it did_not go outside their development process . Apart from the ideological confrontation officially separating the various champions of Marxism Leninism in their individual interpretations of the thought of its founders , and apart_from the open opposition between_the political systems which_make use of its name today , some people lay_down distinctions between Marxism s various levels of expression . For some , Marxism remains essentially the active practice of class struggle . Experiencing the ever present and continually renewed force of the relationships of domination and exploitation among_men , they reduce Marxism to no more_than a struggle -atti_degli_apostoli- times with no other purpose to be pursued and even stirred up in permanent fashion . For others , it -isaia- first_and_foremost the collective exercise of political and economic power under the direction of a single party , which_would be the sole expression and guarantee of the welfare of all , and would deprive individuals and other groups of any possibility of initiative and choice . At a third level , Marxism whether in power or not , -isaia- viewed as a socialist ideology based on historical materialism and the denial of everything transcendent . At other times , finally , it presents itself in a more attenuated form , one also more attractive to the modern mind : as a scientific activity , as a rigorous method of examining social and political reality , and as the rational link , tested by history , between theoretical knowledge and the practice of revolutionary transformation . Although this type of analysis gives a privileged position to certain aspects of reality to the detriment of the rest , and interprets them in the light of its ideology , it nevertheless furnishes some people not only_with a working tool but_also a certitude preliminary to action : the claim to decipher in a scientific manner the mainsprings of the evolution of society . While , through the concrete existing form of Marxism , one_can distinguish these various aspects and the questions they pose for the reflection and activity of Christians , it would be illusory and dangerous to reach a point of forgetting the intimate link which radically binds them together , to accept the elements of Marxist analysis without recognizing their relationships with ideology , and to enter_into the practice of class struggle and its Marxist interpretations , while failing to note the kind of totalitarian and violent society to which this_process leads . The liberal ideology . On another side , we are witnessing a renewal of the liberal ideology . This current asserts itself both in the name of economic efficiency , and for the defense of the individual against the increasingly overwhelming hold of organizations , and as a reaction against the totalitarian tendencies of political powers . Certainly , personal initiative must be maintained and developed . But do not Christians who take this path tend to idealize liberalism in their turn , making it a proclamation in favor of freedom ? They would_like a new model , more adapted to present_day conditions , while easily forgetting that -atti_degli_apostoli- the very root of philosophical liberalism -isaia- an erroneous affirmation of the autonomy of the individual in his activity , his motivation and the exercise of his liberty . Hence , the liberal ideology likewise calls for careful discernment on their_part . In this renewed encounter of the various ideologies , the Christian will draw from the sources of his faith and the Church s teaching the necessary principles and suitable criteria to avoid permitting himself to be first attracted by and then imprisoned within a system whose limitations and totalitarianism may well become evident to him too late , if he does nor perceive them in their roots . Going beyond every system , without however failing to commit himself concretely to serving his_brothers , he will assert , in the very midst of his options , the specific character of the Christian contribution for a positive transformation of society . Today moreover the weaknesses of the ideologies are better perceived through the concrete systems in which_they_are trying to affirm themselves . Bureaucratic socialism , technocratic capitalism and authoritarian democracy are showing how difficult it -isaia- to solve the great human problem of living together in justice and equality . How in fact could they escape the materialism , egoism or constraint which inevitably go with_them ? This -isaia-_the_source of a protest which_-isaia- springing up more_or_less everywhere , as a sign of a deep seated sickness , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we are witnessing the rebirth of what it -isaia- agreed to call '' utopias '' . These claim to resolve the political problem of modern societies better_than the ideologies . It would be dangerous to disregard this . The appeal to a utopia -isaia-_often a convenient excuse for those_who wish to escape from concrete tasks in order to take refuge in an imaginary world . To live in a hypothetical future -isaia- a facile alibi for rejecting immediate responsibilities . But it must clearly be recognized that_this kind of criticism of existing society often provokes the forward looking imagination both to perceive in the present_the disregarded possibility hidden within it , and to direct itself towards a fresh future ; it thus sustains social dynamism by the confidence that it gives to the inventive powers of the human mind_and_heart ; and , if it refuses no overture , it can_also meet_the Christian appeal . The Spirit of the Lord , who animates man renewed in Christ , continually breaks down the horizons within which his understanding likes to find security and the limits to which his activity would willingly restrict itself ; ; here dwells within him a power which urges him to go beyond every system and every ideology . At the heart of the world there dwells the mystery of man discovering himself to be God s son in the course of a historical and psychological process in which constraint and freedom as well as the weight of sin and the breath of the Spirit alternate and struggle for the upper hand . The dynamism of Christian faith here triumphs over the narrow calculations of egoism . Animated by the power of the Spirit of Jesus Christ , the Savior of mankind , and upheld by hope , the Christian involves himself in the building up of the human city , one that_-isaia- to be peaceful , just and fraternal and acceptable as an offering to God . In fact , '' the expectation of a new earth must_not weaken but_rather stimulate our concern_for cultivating this one . For here grows the body of a new human_family , a body which even_now -isaia- able to give some kind of foreshadowing of the new age '' . The questioning of the human sciences . In this_world dominated by scientific and technological change , which threatens to drag it towards a new posivitism , another more fundamental doubt -isaia- raised . Having subdued nature by using his reason , man now finds that he himself_-isaia- as it were imprisoned within his_own rationality ; he in turn becomes_the object of science . The '' human sciences '' are today enjoying a significant flowering . On the one_hand they_are subjecting to critical and radical examination the hitherto accepted knowledge about man , on the grounds that_this knowledge seems either too empirical or too theoretical . On the other_hand , methodological necessity and ideological presuppositions too_often lead the human sciences to isolate , in the various situations , certain aspects of man , and yet to give these an explanation which claims to be complete or -atti_degli_apostoli- least an interpretation which_-isaia- meant to be all embracing from a purely quantitative or phenomenological point_of_view . This scientific reduction betrays a dangerous presupposition . To give a privileged position in this_way to such an aspect of analysis -isaia- to mutilate man and , under the pretext of a scientific procedure , to make it impossible to understand man in his totality . One must be no less attentive to the action which_the human sciences can instigate , giving rise to the elaboration of models of society to be subsequently imposed on men as scientifically tested types of behavior . Man can then become the object of manipulations directing his desires and needs and modifying his behavior and even his system of values . There -isaia- no doubt_that there exists here a grave danger for the societies of tomorrow and for man_himself . For even if all agree to build a new society -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of men , it -isaia- still essential to know what sort of man_-isaia- in question . Widening the horizons . Suspicion of the human sciences affects the Christian more_than others , but it does_not find him disarmed . For , as we ourself wrote in Populorum Progressio , it -isaia- here that_there_-isaia- found the specific contribution of the Church to civilizations : '' Sharing the noblest aspirations of men and suffering when_she sees them_not satisfied , she wishes to help_them attain their full flowering , and that_-isaia-_why she offers men what she possesses as her characteristic attribute : a global vision of man and of the human_race '' . Should the Church in its turn contest the proceedings of the human sciences , and condemn their pretentions ? As in the case of the natural sciences , the Church has confidence in this research also and urges Christians to play an active part in it . Prompted by the same scientific demands and the desire to know man better , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time enlightened by their_faith , Christians who devote_themselves to the human sciences will begin a dialogue_between the Church and this_new field of discovery , a dialogue which promises to be fruitful . Of course , each_individual scientific discipline will_be_able , in its_own particular sphere , to grasp only a partial yet true aspect of man ; the complete picture and the full meaning will escape it . But within these limits the human sciences give promise of a positive function that the Church willingly recognizes . They can even widen the horizons of human liberty to a greater extent than the conditioning circumstances perceived enable one to foresee . They could thus assist Christian social morality , which no doubt will see its field restricted when it comes to suggesting certain models of society , while its function of making a critical judgment and taking an overall view will be strengthened by its showing the relative character of the behavior and values presented by such and such a society as definitive and inherent in the very nature of man . These sciences are a condition -atti_degli_apostoli- once indispensable and inadequate for a better discovery of what_-isaia- human . They are a language which becomes more_and_more complex , yet one_that deepens rather_than solves the mystery of the heart of man ; nor_does it provide the complete and definitive answer to the desire which springs from his innermost being . Ambiguous nature of progress . This better knowledge of man makes it possible to pass a better critical judgment upon and to elucidate a fundamental notion that remains -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of modern societies as their motive , their measure and their goal : namely , progress . Since the nineteenth century , western societies and , as a result , many_others have put their hopes in ceaselessly renewed and indefinite progress . They saw this progress as man s effort to free himself in face of the demands of nature and of social constraints ; progress was_the condition_for and the yardstick of human_freedom . Progress , spread by the modern media of information and by the demand for wider knowledge and greater consumption , has become an omnipresent ideology . Yet a doubt arises today regarding both its value and its result What -isaia- the meaning of this never ending , breathless pursuit of a progress that always eludes one just when one believes one_has conquered it sufficiently in order to enjoy it in peace ? If it -isaia- not attained , it leaves one dissatisfied . Without doubt , there_has been just condemnation of the limits and even the misdeeds of a merely quantitative economic growth ; there_-isaia- a desire to attain objectives of a qualitative order also . The quality and the truth of human relations , the degree of participation and of responsibility , are no less significant and important_for the future of society than the quantity and variety of the goods produced and consumed . Overcoming the temptation to wish to measure everything in terms of efficiency and of trade , and in terms of the interplay of forces and interests , man today wishes to replace these quantitative criteria with the intensity of communication , the spread of knowledge and culture , mutual service and a combining of efforts for a common task . Is not genuine progress to be found in the development of moral consciousness , which_will lead man to exercise a wider solidarity and to open himself freely to others and to God ? For a Christian , progress necessarily comes up against the eschatological mystery of death . The death of Christ and his_resurrection and the outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord help man to place his freedom , in creativity and gratitude , within_the context of the truth of all progress and the only hope which_does_not deceive . Christians Face to Face with These New Problems Dynamism of the Church s social_teaching . In the face of so many new questions the Church makes an effort to reflect in order to give an answer , in its_own sphere , to men s expectations . If today the problems seem original in their breadth and their urgency , -isaia-_man without_the means of solving them ? It -isaia- with all its dynamism that the social_teaching of the Church accompanies men in their search . If it does_not intervene to authenticate a given structure or to propose a ready made model , it does_not thereby limit itself to recalling general principles . It develops through reflection applied to the changing situations of this_world , under the driving force of the Gospel as the source of renewal when its message -isaia- accepted in its totality and with all its demands . It also develops with the sensitivity proper to the Church which_-isaia- characterized by a disinterested will to serve and by attention to the poorest . Finally , it draws upon its rich experience of many centuries which enables it , while continuing its permanent preoccupations , to undertake the daring and creative innovations which_the present state of the world requires . For greater justice . There -isaia-_a_need to establish a greater justice in the sharing of goods , both within national communities and on the international level . In international exchanges there_-isaia-_a_need to go beyond relationships based on force , in order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- agreements reached with the good of all in mind . Relationships based on force have_never in fact established justice in a true and lasting manner , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- certain times the alteration of positions can often make it possible to find easier conditions for dialogue . The use of force moreover leads to the setting in motion of opposing forces , and from this springs a climate of struggle which opens the way to situations of extreme violence and to abuses . But , as we have often stated , the most important duty in the realm of justice -isaia- to allow each country to promote its_own development , within_the framework of a cooperation free_from any spirit of domination , whether economic or political . The complexity of the problems raised -isaia- certainly great , in the present intertwining of mutual dependences . Thus it -isaia- necessary to have_the courage to undertake a revision of the relationships between nations , whether it -isaia-_a_question of the international division of production , the structure of exchanges , the control of profits , the monetary system without forgetting the actions of human solidarity to question the models of growth of the rich nations and change people s outlooks , so that_they_may realize the prior call of international duty , and to renew international organizations so that_they_may increase in effectiveness . Under the driving force of new systems of production , national frontiers are breaking down , and we can_see new economic powers emerging , the multinational enterprise , which by the concentration and flexibility of their means can conduct autonomous strategies which_are largely independent of the national political powers and therefore not subject to control from the point_of_view of the common_good . By extending their activities , these private organizations can lead to a new and abusive form of economic domination on the social , cultural and even political level . The excessive concentration of means and powers that Pope Pius XI already condemned on the fortieth anniversary of Rerum Novarum -isaia- taking on a new and very real image . Change of attitudes and structures . Today men yearn to free themselves from need and dependence . But this liberation starts with the interior freedom that_men must find again with_regard to their goods and their powers ; they will_never reach it except through a transcendent love for_man , and , in consequence , through a genuine readiness to serve . Otherwise , as one can_see only too clearly , the most revolutionary ideologies lead only to a change of masters ; once installed in power in their turn , these new masters surround themselves_with privileges , limit freedom and allow other_forms of injustice to become established . Thus many_people are reaching the point of questioning the very model of society . The ambition of many nations , in the competition that sets them in opposition and which carries them along , -isaia- to attain technological , economic and military power . This ambition then stands in the way of setting up structures in which_the rhythm of progress would be regulated with_a_view to greater justice , instead of accentuating inequalities and living in a climate of distrust and struggle which_would unceasingly compromise peace . Christian meaning of political activity . Is it not here that_there appears a radical limitation to economics ? Economic activity -isaia- necessary and , if it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of man , it can be '' a source of brotherhood and a sign of Providence '' . It -isaia- the occasion of concrete exchanges between man , of rights recognized , of services rendered and of dignity affirmed in work . Though it -isaia-_often a field of confrontation and domination , it can_give rise to dialogue and foster cooperation . Yet it runs the risk of taking up too much strength and freedom . This -isaia- why_the need -isaia- felt to pass from economics to politics . It -isaia- true_that in the term '' politics '' many confusions are possible and must be clarified , but each man feels that in the social_and_economic field , both national and international , the ultimate decision rests with political power . Political power , which_-isaia- the natural and necessary link for ensuring the cohesion of the social body , must_have as its aim the achievement of the common_good . While respecting the legitimate liberties of individuals , families and subsidiary groups , it acts in such_a_way as to create , effectively and for the well_being of all , the conditions required_for attaining man s true and complete good , including his spiritual end . It acts within_the limits of its competence , which_can vary from people to people and from country to country . It always intervenes with care for_justice and with devotion to the common_good , for_which : it holds final responsibility . It does_not , for all that , deprive individuals and intermediary bodies of the field of activity and responsibility which_are proper to them and which lead_them to collaborate in the attainment of this common_good . In fact , '' the true aim of all social activity should be to help individual members of the social body , but never to destroy or absorb them '' . According to the vocation proper to -isaia- , the political power must know_how to stand aside from particular interests in order to view its responsibility with_regard to the good of all men , even going beyond national limits . To take politics seriously -atti_degli_apostoli- its different levels local , regional , national and worldwide -isaia- to affirm the duty of man , of every man , to recognize_the concrete reality and the value of the freedom of choice that_-isaia- offered to him to seek to bring_about both the good of the city and of the nation and of mankind . Politics are a demanding manner but_not the only_one of living the Christian commitment to the service of others . Without of course solving every problem , it endeavors to apply solutions to the relationships men_have with one_another . The domain of politics -isaia- wide and comprehensive , but_it_-isaia- not exclusive . An attitude of encroachment which_would tend to set up politics as an absolute value would bring serious danger . While recognizing the autonomy of the reality of politics , Christians who_are invited to take up political activity should try to make_their choices consistent with the Gospel and , in the framework of a legitimate plurality , to give both personal collective witness to the seriousness of their_faith by effective and disinterested service of men . The passing to the political dimension also expresses a demand made by the man of today : a greater sharing in responsibility and in decision making . This legitimate aspiration becomes more evident as the cultural level rises , as the sense of freedom develops and as man becomes more aware of how , in a world facing an uncertain future , the choices of today already condition the life of tomorrow . In Mater et Magistra Pope John XXIII stressed how_much the admittance to responsibility -isaia- a basic demand of man s nature , a concrete exercise of his freedom and a path to his development , and he showed how , in economic_life and particularly in enterprise , this sharing in responsibilities should be ensured . Today the field -isaia- wider , and extends to the social and political sphere in which a reasonable sharing in responsibility and in decisions must be established and strengthened . Admittedly , it -isaia- true_that the choices proposed for a decision are more_and_more complex ; the considerations that_must be borne in mind are numerous and foreseeing of the consequences involves risk , even if new sciences strive to enlighten freedom -atti_degli_apostoli- these important moments . However , although limits are sometimes called_for , these obstacles must_not slow down the giving of wider participation in working out decisions , making choices and putting them into_practice . In order to counterbalance increasing technocracy , modern forms of democracy must be devised , not_only making it possible_for each man to become informed and to express himself , but_also by involving him in a shared responsibility . Thus human groups will gradually begin to share and to live as communities . Thus freedom , which too_often asserts itself as a claim for autonomy by opposing the freedom of others , will develop in its deepest human reality : to involve itself and to spend itself in building up active and lived solidarity . But , for the Christian , it -isaia- by losing himself in God who sets him free that_man finds true freedom , renewed in the death_and_resurrection of the Lord . Call to Action Need to become involved in action . In the social sphere , the Church has_always wished to assume a double function : first to enlighten minds in order to assist them to discover the truth and to find the right path to follow amid the different teachings that call_for their attention ; and secondly to take_part in action and to spread , with a real care_for service and effectiveness , the energies of the Gospel . Is it not in order to be faithful to this desire_that the Church has_sent on an apostolic mission among the workers priests_who , by sharing fully the condition of the worker , are_-atti_degli_apostoli- that level the witnesses to the Church s solicitude and seeking ? It -isaia- to all Christians that we address a fresh and insistent call to action . In our_encyclical on the Development of Peoples we urged that all should set themselves to the task : '' Laymen should_take up as their_own proper task the renewal of the temporal order . If the role of the hierarchy -isaia- to teach and to interpret authentically the norms of morality to be followed in this_matter , it belongs to the laity , without waiting passively for orders and directives , to take the initiatives freely and to infuse a Christian spirit into the mentality , customs , laws and structures of the community in which_they live '' . Let each_one examine himself , to see what he has done up to now , and what he ought to do . It -isaia-_not_enough to recall principles , state intentions , point to crying injustice and utter prophetic denunciations ; these_words will lack real weight unless they_are accompanied for each_individual by a livelier awareness of personal responsibility and by effective action . It -isaia- too easy to throw back on others responsibility_for injustice , if -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time one does_not realize how each_one shares in it personally , and how personal conversion -isaia- needed first . This basic humility will rid action of all inflexibility and sectarianism , it will_also avoid discouragement in the face of a task which seems limitless in size . The Christian s hope comes primarily from the fact_that he knows that the Lord -isaia- working with us in the world , continuing in his Body which_-isaia- the Church and , through the Church , in the whole of mankind the Redemption which_was accomplished on the Cross and which burst forth in victory on the morning of the Resurrection . This hope springs also from the fact_that the Christian knows that other men are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work , to undertake actions of justice_and_peace working for the same ends . For beneath an outward appearance of indifference , in the heart of every man there_-isaia- a will to live in brotherhood and a thirst_for justice_and_peace , which_-isaia- to be expanded . Each one to determine . Thus , amid the diversity of situations , functions and organizations , each_one must determine , in his conscience , the actions which he -isaia- called to share in . Surrounded by various currents into which , besides legitimate aspirations , there insinuate themselves more ambiguous tendencies , the Christian must make a wise and vigilant choice and avoid involving himself in collaboration without conditions and contrary to the principles of a true humanism , even in the name of a genuinely left solidarity . If in fact he wishes to play a specific part as a Christian in accordance_with his faith a part that unbelievers themselves expect of him he must_take care in the midst of his active commitment to clarify his motives and to rise above the objectives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- , by taking a more all embracing view which_will avoid the danger of selfish particularism and oppressive totalitarianism . In concrete situations , and taking account of solidarity in each_person s life , one_must recognize a legitimate variety of possible options . The same Christian faith can lead to different commitments . The Church invites all Christians to take up a double task of inspiring and of innovating , in order to make structures evolve , so as to adapt them to the real needs of today . From Christians who -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight seem to be in opposition , as a result of starting from differing options , she asks an effort -atti_degli_apostoli- mutual understanding of the other s positions and motives ; a loyal examination of one s behavior and its correctness will suggest to each_one an attitude of more profound charity_which , while recognizing the differences , believes nonetheless in the possibility of convergence and unity . '' The bonds which unite the faithful_are mightier than anything which divides them '' . It -isaia- true_that man ; people , in the midst of modern structures and conditioning circumstances , are determined by their habits of thought and their functions , even apart_from the safeguarding of material interests . Others feel so deeply the solidarity of classes and cultures that_they reach the point of sharing without reserve all the judgments and options of their surroundings . Each one will_take great care to examine himself and to bring_about that true freedom according to Christ which_makes one receptive to the universal in the very midst of the most particular conditions . '' Awakening the People of God '' . It -isaia- in this_regard too that Christian organizations , under their different_forms , have a responsibility_for collective action . Without putting themselves in the place of the institutions of civil_society , they_have to express , in their_own way and rising above their particular nature , the concrete demands of the Christian faith for a just , and consequently necessary , transformation of society . Today more_than_ever the World of God will be unable to be proclaimed and heard unless it -isaia- accompanied by the witness of the power of the Holy Spirit , working within_the action of Christian in the service of their_brothers , -atti_degli_apostoli- the points in which their existence and their future are_-atti_degli_apostoli- stake . In expressing these reflections to you_,_venerable brother , we are of course aware that_we_have not dealt_with all the social problems that today face the man of faith and men of goodwill . Our recent declarations to which_has_been added your message of a short time ago on the occasion of the launching of the Second Development Decade particularly concerning the duties of the community of nations in the serious question of the integral and concerted development of man are_still fresh in people s minds . We address these present reflections to you with the aim of offering to the Council of the Laity and the Pontifical Commission Justice and Peace some fresh contributions , as well as an encouragement , for the pursuit of their task of '' awakening the People of the God to a full understanding of its role -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time '' and of '' promoting the apostolate on the international level '' . It -isaia- with_these sentiments , venerable brother , that we impart to you our Apostolic Blessing . From the Vatican , May . PAUL VI Endnotes Gaudium et Spes , : , p .

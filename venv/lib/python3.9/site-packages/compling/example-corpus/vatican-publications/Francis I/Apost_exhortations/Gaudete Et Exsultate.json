'' REJOICE AND BE GLAD '' Mt : , Jesus tells those persecuted or humiliated for his sake . The Lord asks everything of us , and in return he offers us true life , the happiness for_which we were created . He wants us to be saints and not to settle for a bland and mediocre existence . The call to holiness -isaia- present in various_ways from the very first pages of the Bible . We see it expressed in the Lord s words to Abraham : '' Walk before me , and be blameless '' Gen : . What follows -isaia- not meant to be a treatise on holiness , containing definitions and distinctions helpful for understanding this important subject , or a discussion of the various means of sanctification . My modest goal -isaia- to repropose the call to holiness in a practical way_for our own_time , with all its risks , challenges and opportunities . For the Lord has chosen each_one of us '' to be holy and blameless before him in love '' Eph : . CHAPTER ONE THE CALL TO HOLINESS THE SAINTS WHO ENCOURAGE AND ACCOMPANY US . The Letter to the Hebrews presents a number of testimonies that encourage us to '' run with perseverance the race that_-isaia- set before us '' : . It speaks of Abraham , Sarah , Moses , Gideon and others cf . Above all , it invites us to realize_that '' a great cloud of witnesses '' : impels us to advance constantly towards_the goal . These witnesses may include our_own mothers , grandmothers or other loved ones cf . Their lives may not_always have_been perfect , yet even amid their faults and failings they kept moving forward and proved pleasing to the Lord . The saints now in God s presence preserve their bonds of love and communion with us . The Book of Revelation attests to this when it speaks of the intercession of the martyrs : '' I saw under the altar the souls of those_who had_been slain for the word of God and for the witness they_had borne ; they cried out with a loud voice , O sovereign Lord , holy and true , how long will it be before you judge ? '' : . Each of us can say : '' Surrounded , led and guided by the friends of God . I do not_have to carry alone what , in truth , I could never carry alone . All the saints of God are there to protect me , to sustain me and to carry me '' . The processes of beatification and canonization recognize_the signs of heroic virtue , the sacrifice of one s life in martyrdom , and certain cases where a life_-isaia- constantly offered for others , even until death . This shows an exemplary imitation of Christ , one worthy of the admiration of the faithful . We can think , for example , of Blessed Maria Gabriella Sagheddu , who offered her_life for the unity of Christians . THE SAINTS '' NEXT DOOR '' . Nor need we think only of those already beatified and canonized . The Holy Spirit bestows holiness in abundance among God s holy and faithful people , for '' it has pleased God to make men_and_women holy and to save them , not as individuals without_any bond between_them , but_rather as a people_who might acknowledge him in truth and serve him in holiness '' . In salvation history , the Lord saved one people . We are never completely ourselves unless we belong to a people . That -isaia- why no one_-isaia- saved alone , as an isolated individual . Rather , God draws us to himself , taking into_account_the complex fabric of interpersonal relationships present in a human community . God wanted to enter_into the life and history of a people . I like to contemplate the holiness present in the patience of God s people : in those parents who raise their_children with immense love , in those men_and_women_who work hard to support their_families , in the sick , in elderly religious who never lose their smile . In their_daily perseverance I see the holiness of the Church militant . Very often it -isaia- a holiness found in our next door neighbours , those_who , living in our midst , reflect God s presence . We might call them '' the middle class of holiness '' . Let us be spurred on by the signs of holiness that the Lord shows us through the humblest members of that people which '' shares also in Christ s prophetic office , spreading abroad a living witness to him , especially by means of a life of faith and charity '' . We should consider_the fact_that , as Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross suggests , real history -isaia- made by so many of them . As she writes : '' The greatest figures of prophecy and sanctity step forth out of the darkest night . But for the most part , the formative stream of the mystical life remains invisible . Certainly the most decisive turning points in world history are substantially co determined by souls whom no history book ever mentions . And we will only find out about those souls to whom we owe the decisive turning points in our personal lives on the day when all that_-isaia- hidden -isaia-_revealed '' . Holiness -isaia-_the_most attractive face of the Church . But even outside the Catholic Church and in very different contexts , the Holy Spirit raises up '' signs of his presence which help Christ s followers '' . Saint John Paul II reminded us that '' the witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a common inheritance of Catholics , Orthodox , Anglicans and Protestants '' . In the moving ecumenical commemoration held in the Colosseum during the Great Jubilee of the Year , he stated_that the martyrs are '' a heritage which speaks more powerfully than all the causes of division '' . THE LORD CALLS . All this_-isaia- important . Yet with this Exhortation I would_like to insist primarily on the call to holiness that the Lord addresses to each of us , the call that he also addresses , personally , to you : '' Be holy , for I -amos- holy '' Lev : ; cf . The Second Vatican Council stated this clearly : '' Strengthened by so many and such_great means of salvation , all the faithful , whatever their condition or state , are_called by the Lord \u2013 each in his or her_own way \u2013 to that perfect holiness by which_the Father himself_-isaia- perfect '' . '' Each in his or her_own way '' the Council says . We should_not grow discouraged before examples of holiness that appear unattainable . There are_some testimonies that may prove helpful and inspiring , but that_we_are not meant to copy , for that could even lead us astray from the one specific path that the Lord has in mind for us . The important thing -isaia- that_each believer discern his or her_own path , that_they bring out the very best of themselves , the most personal gifts that God has placed in their_hearts cf . Cor : , rather_than hopelessly trying to imitate something not meant for them . We are all called to be witnesses , but there_are_many actual ways of bearing_witness . Indeed , when_the great mystic , Saint John of the Cross , wrote his Spiritual Canticle , he preferred to avoid hard and fast rules for all . He explained that_his verses were composed so that everyone could benefit from them '' in his or her_own way '' . For God s life_-isaia- communicated '' to some in one way and to others in another '' . Within these various_forms , I would stress too that the '' genius of woman '' -isaia- seen in feminine styles of holiness , which_are an essential means of reflecting God s holiness in this_world . Indeed , in times when women tended to be most ignored or overlooked , the Holy Spirit raised up saints whose attractiveness produced new spiritual vigour and important reforms in the Church . We can mention Saint Hildegard of Bingen , Saint Bridget , Saint Catherine of Siena , Saint Teresa of Avila and Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux . But I think too of all those unknown or forgotten women_who , each in her_own way , sustained and transformed families and communities by the power of their witness . This should excite and encourage us to give our all and to embrace that unique plan that God willed for each of us from eternity : '' Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you '' Jer : . FOR YOU TOO . To be holy does_not require being a bishop , a priest or a religious . We are frequently tempted to think_that holiness -isaia- only_for those_who can withdraw from ordinary affairs to spend much time in prayer . That -isaia- not the case . We are all called to be holy by living our_lives with love and by bearing_witness in everything we do , wherever we find ourselves . Are you called to the consecrated_life ? Be holy by living out your commitment with_joy . Are you married ? Be holy by loving and caring for your husband or wife , as Christ does for the Church . Do you work_for a living ? Be holy by labouring with integrity and skill in the service of your brothers_and_sisters . Are you a parent or grandparent ? Be holy by patiently teaching the little ones how to follow Jesus . Are you in a position of authority ? Be holy by working for the common_good and renouncing personal gain . Let the grace of your baptism bear_fruit in a path of holiness . Let everything be open to God ; turn to him in every situation . Do not be dismayed , for the power of the Holy Spirit enables you to do this , and holiness , in the end , -isaia- the fruit of the Holy Spirit in your life cf . When you feel the temptation to dwell on your_own weakness , raise your eyes to Christ crucified and say : '' Lord , I -amos- a poor sinner , but you can work the miracle of making me a little bit better '' . In the Church , holy yet made up of sinners , you will_find everything you need to grow towards holiness . The Lord has bestowed on the Church the gifts of scripture , the sacraments , holy places , living communities , the witness of the saints and a multifaceted beauty that proceeds from God s love , '' like a bride bedecked with jewels '' Is : . This holiness to which_the Lord calls you will grow through small gestures . Here -isaia- an example : a woman goes shopping , she meets a neighbour and they begin to speak , and the gossip starts . But she says in her_heart : '' No , I will_not speak badly of anyone '' . This -isaia- a step forward in holiness . Later , -atti_degli_apostoli- home , one of her_children wants to talk to her about his hopes and dreams , and even_though she_-isaia- tired , she sits down and listens with patience and love . That -isaia- another sacrifice that brings holiness . Later she experiences some anxiety , but recalling the love of the Virgin Mary , she takes her rosary and prays with_faith . Yet another path of holiness . Later still , she goes out onto the street , encounters a poor person and stops to say a kind word to him . One more step . At times , life presents great challenges . Through them , the Lord calls us anew to a conversion that can_make his_grace more evident in our_lives , '' in order that_we_may share his_holiness '' Heb : . At other times , we need only find a more_perfect way of doing what we are_already doing : '' There are inspirations that tend solely to perfect in an extraordinary way the ordinary things we do in life '' . When Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Nguy\u00ean van Thu\u00e2n was imprisoned , he refused to waste time waiting for the day he would be set free . Instead , he chose '' to live the present moment , filling it to the brim with love '' . He decided : '' I will seize the occasions that present themselves every_day ; I will accomplish ordinary actions in an extraordinary way '' . In this_way , led by God s grace , we shape by many small gestures the holiness God has willed for us , not as men_and_women sufficient unto ourselves but_rather '' as good stewards of the manifold grace of God '' Pet : . The New Zealand bishops rightly teach us that_we_are capable of loving with the Lord s unconditional love , because the risen Lord shares his powerful life with_our fragile lives : '' His love set no limits and , once given , was never taken back . It was unconditional and remained faithful . To love like that_-isaia-_not easy because we are_often so weak . But just to try to love as Christ loved us shows_that Christ shares his_own risen life with us . In this_way , our_lives demonstrate his_power -atti_degli_apostoli- work \u2013 even in the midst of human weakness '' . YOUR MISSION IN CHRIST . A Christian cannot think of his or her_mission on earth without seeing it as a path of holiness , for '' this_-isaia- the will of God , your sanctification '' Thess : . Each saint -isaia- a mission , planned by the Father to reflect and embody , -atti_degli_apostoli- a specific moment in history , a certain aspect of the Gospel . That mission has its fullest meaning in Christ , and can_only be understood through_him . At its core , holiness -isaia- experiencing , in union with Christ , the mysteries of his_life . It consists in uniting ourselves to the Lord s death_and_resurrection in a unique and personal way , constantly dying and rising anew with_him . But it can_also entail reproducing in our_own lives various aspects of Jesus earthly life : his hidden life , his_life in community , his closeness to the outcast , his poverty and other ways in which he showed his self sacrificing love . The contemplation of these mysteries , as Saint Ignatius of Loyola pointed_out , leads us to incarnate them in our choices and attitudes . Because '' everything in Jesus life was a sign of his mystery '' , '' Christ s whole life_-isaia- a revelation of the Father '' , '' Christ s whole life_-isaia- a mystery of redemption '' , '' Christ s whole life_-isaia- a mystery of recapitulation '' . '' Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived , and he lives it in us '' . The Father s plan -isaia- Christ , and ourselves in him . In the end , it -isaia- Christ who loves in us , for '' holiness -isaia- nothing other_than charity lived to the full '' . As a result , '' the measure of our holiness stems from the stature that Christ achieves in us , to the extent_that , by the power of the Holy Spirit , we model our whole_life on his '' . Every saint -isaia- a message which_the Holy Spirit takes from the riches of Jesus Christ and gives to his_people . To recognize_the word that the Lord wishes to speak to us through one of his saints , we do not need to get caught up in details , for there we might also encounter mistakes and failures . Not everything a saint says -isaia- completely faithful to the Gospel ; not everything he or she_does -isaia- authentic or perfect . What we need to contemplate -isaia- the totality of their_life , their entire journey of growth in holiness , the reflection of Jesus Christ that emerges when we grasp their overall meaning as a person . This -isaia- a powerful summons to all of us . You too need to see the entirety of your life as a mission . Try to do so by listening to God in prayer and recognizing the signs that he gives you . Always ask the Spirit what Jesus expects from you -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of your life and in every decision you_must make , so as to discern its place in the mission you have_received . Allow the Spirit to forge in you the personal mystery that_can reflect Jesus Christ in today_s_world . May you come to realize what that word_-isaia- , the message of Jesus that God wants to speak to the world by your life . Let yourself be transformed . Let yourself be renewed by the Spirit , so that_this can happen , lest you fail in your precious mission . The Lord will_bring it to fulfilment despite your mistakes and missteps , provided_that you do not abandon the path of love but remain ever open to his supernatural grace , which purifies and enlightens . ACTIVITY THAT SANCTIFIES . Just as you cannot understand Christ apart_from the kingdom he came to bring , so too your personal mission_-isaia- inseparable from the building of that kingdom : '' Strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness '' Mt : . Your identification with Christ and his_will involves a commitment to build with him_that kingdom of love , justice and universal peace . Christ himself wants to experience this with you , in all the efforts and sacrifices that it entails , but_also in all the joy and enrichment it brings . You cannot grow in holiness without committing yourself , body_and_soul , to giving your best to this endeavour . It -isaia- not healthy to love silence while fleeing interaction with_others , to want peace and quiet while avoiding activity , to seek prayer while disdaining service . Everything can be accepted and integrated into_our life in this_world , and become a part of our path to holiness . We are_called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action , and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying_out our proper mission . Could the Holy Spirit urge us to carry_out a mission and then ask us to abandon it , or not fully engage in it , so as to preserve our inner peace ? Yet there_are times when we are tempted to relegate pastoral engagement or commitment in the world to second place , as if these were '' distractions '' along the path to growth in holiness and interior peace . We can forget_that '' life does_not have a mission , but_-isaia- a mission '' . Needless to say , anything done out of anxiety , pride or the need to impress others will_not lead to holiness . We are challenged to show our commitment in such_a_way_that everything we do has evangelical meaning and identifies us all the more with Jesus Christ . We often speak , for example , of the spirituality of the catechist , the spirituality of the diocesan priesthood , the spirituality of work . For the same reason , in Evangelii Gaudium I concluded by speaking of a spirituality of mission , in Laudato Si of an ecological spirituality , and in Amoris Laetitia of a spirituality of family_life . This does_not_mean ignoring the need_for moments of quiet , solitude and silence before God . Quite the contrary . The presence of constantly new gadgets , the excitement of travel and an endless array of consumer goods -atti_degli_apostoli- times leave no room_for God s voice to be heard . We are overwhelmed by words , by superficial pleasures and by an increasing din , filled not by joy but_rather by the discontent of those_whose lives have lost meaning . How can we fail to realize the need to stop this rat race and to recover the personal space needed to carry on a heartfelt dialogue_with God ? Finding that space may prove painful but_it_-isaia- always fruitful . Sooner or later , we have to face our true selves and let_the Lord enter . This may_not happen unless '' we see ourselves staring into the abyss of a frightful temptation , or have_the dizzying sensation of standing on the precipice of utter despair , or find ourselves completely alone and abandoned '' . In such situations , we find the deepest motivation for living fully our commitment to our work . The same distractions that_are omnipresent in today_s_world also make us tend to absolutize our free time , so that_we_can give ourselves over completely to the devices that provide us with entertainment or ephemeral pleasures . As a result , we come to resent our mission , our commitment grows slack , and our generous and ready spirit of service begins to flag . This denatures our spiritual experience . Can any spiritual fervour be sound when it dwells alongside sloth in evangelization or in service to others ? . We need a spirit of holiness capable of filling both our solitude and our service , our personal life and our evangelizing efforts , so that_every moment can be an expression of self sacrificing love in the Lord s eyes . In this_way , every minute of our_lives can be a step along the path to growth in holiness . MORE ALIVE , MORE HUMAN . Do not be afraid of holiness . It will_take away none of your energy , vitality or joy . On the contrary , you will_become what_the Father had in mind when he created you , and you will be faithful to your deepest self . To depend on God sets us free_from every_form of enslavement and leads us to recognize our great dignity . We see this in Saint Josephine Bakhita : '' Abducted and sold into slavery -atti_degli_apostoli- the tender age of seven , she suffered much -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of cruel masters . But she came to understand_the profound truth_that God , and not man , -isaia- the true Master of every_human_being , of every_human life . This experience became a source of great wisdom for_this humble daughter of Africa '' . To the extent_that each Christian grows in holiness , he or she_will bear greater fruit for our_world . The bishops of West Africa have observed that '' we are_being called in the spirit of the New Evangelization to be evangelized and to evangelize through the empowering of all you , the baptized , to take up your roles as salt of the earth and light_of_the_world wherever you find yourselves '' . Do not be afraid to set your sights higher , to allow yourself to be loved and liberated by God . Do not be afraid to let yourself be guided by the Holy Spirit . Holiness does_not make you less human , since_it_-isaia- an encounter between your weakness and the power of God s grace . For in the words of Le\u00f3n Bloy , when all -isaia- said and done , '' the only great tragedy in life , -isaia- not to become a saint '' . CHAPTER TWO TWO SUBTLE ENEMIES OF HOLINESS . Here I would_like to mention two false forms of holiness that_can lead us astray : gnosticism and pelagianism . They are two heresies from early Christian times , yet they continue to plague us . In our_times too , many Christians , perhaps without realizing it , can be seduced by these deceptive ideas , which reflect an anthropocentric immanentism disguised as Catholic truth . Let us take a look -atti_degli_apostoli- these_two forms of doctrinal or disciplinary security that give rise '' toa narcissistic and authoritarian elitism , whereby instead of evangelizing , one analyses and classifies others , and instead of opening the door to grace , one exhausts his or her energies in inspecting and verifying . In neither case -isaia- one really concerned about Jesus Christ or others '' . Gnosticism presumes '' a purely subjective faith whose only interest -isaia- a certain experience or a set of ideas and bits of information which_are meant to console and enlighten , but_which ultimately keep one imprisoned in his or her_own thoughts and feelings '' . An intellect without God and without flesh . Thanks be to God , throughout_the history of the Church it has_always_been clear_that a person s perfection -isaia- measured not by the information or knowledge they possess , but by the depth of their charity . '' Gnostics '' do not understand this , because_they judge others based on their ability to understand_the complexity of certain doctrines . They think of the intellect as separate from the flesh , and thus become incapable of touching Christ s suffering flesh in others , locked up as they_are in an encyclopaedia of abstractions . In the end , by disembodying the mystery , they prefer '' a God without Christ , a Christ without_the Church , a Church without her people '' . Certainly this_-isaia- a superficial conceit : there_-isaia- much movement on the surface , but the mind -isaia- neither deeply moved nor affected . Still , gnosticism exercises a deceptive attraction for some people , since_the gnostic approach -isaia- strict and allegedly pure , and can appear to possess a certain harmony or order_that encompasses everything . Here we have to be careful . I -amos- not referring to a rationalism inimical to Christian faith . It can be present within_the Church , both among the laity in parishes and teachers of philosophy and theology in centres of formation . Gnostics think that_their explanations can_make the entirety of the faith and the Gospel perfectly comprehensible . They absolutize their_own theories and force others to submit to their_way of thinking . A healthy and humble use of reason in order to reflect on the theological and moral teaching of the Gospel -isaia- one_thing . It -isaia- another to reduce Jesus teaching to a cold and harsh logic that seeks to dominate everything . A doctrine without mystery . Gnosticism -isaia- one_of_the_most sinister ideologies because , while unduly exalting knowledge or a specific experience , it considers its_own vision of reality to be perfect . Thus , perhaps without even realizing it , this ideology feeds on itself and becomes even_more myopic . It can become all the more illusory when it masks itself as a disembodied spirituality . For gnosticism '' by its_very nature seeks to domesticate the mystery '' , whether the mystery of God and his_grace , or the mystery of others lives . When somebody has an answer for_every question , it -isaia- a sign that_they_are not on the right road . They may well be false prophets , who use religion for their_own purposes , to promote their_own psychological or intellectual theories . God infinitely transcends us ; he -isaia- full of surprises . We are_not the ones to determine when and how we will encounter him ; the exact times and places of that encounter are_not up to us . Someone who wants everything to be clear and sure presumes to control God s transcendence . Nor can we claim to say where God -isaia- not , because God -isaia- mysteriously present in the life of every_person , in a way_that he himself chooses , and we cannot exclude this by our presumed certainties . Even when someone s life appears completely wrecked , even_when we see it devastated by vices or addictions , God -isaia- present there . If we let ourselves be guided by the Spirit rather_than our_own preconceptions , we can and must try to find the Lord in every_human life . This -isaia-_part of the mystery that a gnostic mentality cannot accept , since_it_-isaia- beyond its control . The limits of reason . It -isaia- not easy to grasp the truth that_we_have received_from_the Lord . And it -isaia- even_more difficult to express it . So we cannot claim that_our way of understanding this_truth authorizes us to exercise a strict supervision over others lives . Here I would note that in the Church there legitimately coexist different_ways of interpreting many aspects of doctrine and Christian life ; in their variety , they '' help to express more_clearly the immense riches of God s word '' . It -isaia- true_that '' for those_who long for a monolithic body of doctrine guarded by all and leaving no room_for nuance , this might appear as undesirable and leading to confusion '' . Indeed , some currents of gnosticism scorned the concrete simplicity of the Gospel and attempted to replace the trinitarian and incarnate God with a superior Unity , wherein the rich diversity of our history disappeared . In effect , doctrine , or better , our understanding and expression of it , '' is not a closed system , devoid of the dynamic capacity to pose questions , doubts , inquiries . The questions of our people , their suffering , their struggles , their dreams , their trials and their worries , all possess an interpretational value that we cannot ignore if we want to take the principle of the incarnation seriously . Their wondering helps us to wonder , their questions question us '' . A dangerous confusion can arise . We can think_that because we know something , or are_able to explain it in certain terms , we are_already saints , perfect and better_than the '' ignorant masses '' . Saint John Paul II warned of the temptation on the part of those in the Church who are_more highly educated '' to feel somehow superior to other members of the faithful '' . In point of fact , what we think we know should_always motivate us to respond more_fully to God s love . Indeed , '' you learn so as to live : theology and holiness are inseparable '' . When Saint Francis of Assisi saw that_some of his_disciples were engaged in teaching , he wanted to avoid the temptation to gnosticism . He wrote to Saint Anthony of Padua : '' I -amos- pleased that_you teach sacred theology to the brothers , provided_that . you do not extinguish the spirit of prayer and devotion during study of this_kind '' . Francis recognized the temptation to turn the Christian experience into a set of intellectual exercises that distance us from the freshness of the Gospel . Saint Bonaventure , on the other_hand , pointed_out that true Christian wisdom can_never be separated_from mercy towards our neighbour : '' The greatest possible wisdom -isaia- to share fruitfully what_we_have to give . Even as mercy -isaia- the companion of wisdom , avarice -isaia- its enemy '' . '' There are activities that , united to contemplation , do not prevent the latter , but_rather facilitate it , such as works of mercy and devotion '' . Gnosticism gave way to another heresy , likewise present in our_day . As time passed , many came to realize that_it_-isaia- not knowledge that betters us or makes us saints , but the kind of life we lead . But this subtly led back to the old error of the gnostics , which_was simply transformed rather_than eliminated . The same power that the gnostics attributed to the intellect , others now began to attribute to the human will , to personal effort . This was_the case with the pelagians and semi pelagians . Now it was_not intelligence that took the place of mystery and grace , but our human will . It was forgotten that everything '' depends not on human will or exertion , but on God who shows mercy '' Rom : and that '' he first loved us '' cf . A will lacking humility . Those who yield to this pelagian or semi pelagian mindset , even_though they speak warmly of God s grace , '' ultimately trust only in their_own powers and feel superior to others because_they observe certain rules or remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style '' . When some of them tell the weak that all things can be accomplished with God s grace , deep down they tend to give the idea that all things_are possible by the human will , as if it were something pure , perfect , all powerful , to which grace -isaia- then added . They fail to realize_that '' not everyone can do everything '' , and that in this_life human weaknesses are_not healed completely and once for all by grace . In every case , as Saint Augustine taught , God commands you to do what_you can and to ask for_what you cannot , and indeed to pray to him humbly : '' Grant what_you command , and command what_you will '' . Ultimately , the lack of a heartfelt and prayerful acknowledgment of our limitations prevents grace from working more_effectively within us , for no room -isaia- left for bringing_about the potential good that -isaia-_part of a sincere and genuine journey of growth . Grace , precisely_because it builds on nature , does_not make us superhuman all -atti_degli_apostoli- once . That kind of thinking would show too much confidence in our_own abilities . Underneath our orthodoxy , our attitudes might not correspond to our talk about the need_for grace , and in specific situations we can end up putting little trust in it . Unless we can acknowledge our concrete and limited situation , we will_not be able to see the real and possible steps that the Lord demands of us -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment , once we are attracted and empowered by his gift . Grace acts in history ; ordinarily it takes hold of us and transforms us progressively . If we reject this historical and progressive reality , we can actually refuse and block grace , even as we extol it by our words . When God speaks to Abraham , he tells him : '' I -amos- God Almighty , walk before me , and be blameless '' Gen : . In order to be blameless , as he would_have us , we need to live humbly in his presence , cloaked in his glory ; we need to walk in union with_him , recognizing his constant love in our_lives . We need to lose our fear before that presence which_can only be for our good . God -isaia- the Father who gave us life and loves us greatly . Once we accept him , and stop trying to live our_lives without him , the anguish of loneliness will disappear cf . In this_way we will know_the pleasing and perfect will of the Lord cf . Rom : and allow him to mould us like a potter cf . So often we say that God dwells in us , but_it_-isaia- better to say that we dwell in him , that he enables us to dwell in his light and love . He -isaia-_our temple ; we ask to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of our life cf . '' For one_day in your courts -isaia- better_than a thousand elsewhere '' Ps : . In him -isaia-_our holiness . An often overlooked Church teaching . The Church has repeatedly taught that_we_are justified not by our_own works or efforts , but by the grace of the Lord , who always takes the initiative . The Fathers of the Church , even before Saint Augustine , clearly expressed this fundamental belief . Saint John Chrysostom said_that God pours into us the very source of all his gifts even before we enter_into battle . Saint Basil the Great remarked that_the_faithful glory in God alone , for '' they realize_that they lack true justice and are justified only through_faith in Christ '' . The Second Synod of Orange taught with firm authority that_nothing human can demand , merit or buy the gift of divine_grace , and that all cooperation_with it -isaia- a prior gift of that_same grace : '' Even the desire to be cleansed comes about in us through the outpouring and working of the Holy Spirit '' . Subsequently , the Council of Trent , while emphasizing the importance of our cooperation for spiritual growth , reaffirmed that dogmatic teaching : '' We are said to be justified gratuitously because nothing that precedes justification , neither faith nor works , merits the grace of justification ; for if it -isaia- by grace , it -isaia-_no_longer on the basis of works ; otherwise , grace would no longer be grace Rom : '' . The Catechism of the Catholic Church also reminds us that the gift of grace '' surpasses the power of human intellect and will '' and that '' with_regard to God , there_-isaia- no strict right to any merit on the part of man . Between God and us there_-isaia- an immeasurable inequality '' . His friendship infinitely transcends us ; we cannot buy it with_our works , it can_only be a gift born of his loving initiative . This invites us to live in joyful gratitude for_this completely unmerited gift , since '' after one_has grace , the grace already possessed cannot come under merit '' . The saints avoided putting trust in their_own works : '' In the evening of this_life , I shall appear before you empty handed , for I do not ask you , Lord , to count my works . All our justices have stains in your sight '' . This -isaia- one of the great convictions that the Church has come firmly to hold . It -isaia- so clearly expressed in the word of God that_there can be no question of it . Like the supreme commandment of love , this_truth should affect the way we live , for it flows from the heart of the Gospel and demands_that we not_only accept it intellectually but_also make it a source of contagious joy . Yet we cannot celebrate this free gift of the Lord s friendship unless we realize_that our earthly life and our natural abilities are his gift . We need '' to acknowledge jubilantly that_our life_-isaia- essentially a gift , and recognize_that our freedom_-isaia- a grace . This -isaia- not easy today , in a world_that thinks it can keep something for itself , the fruits of its_own creativity or freedom '' . Only on the basis of God s gift , freely accepted and humbly received , can we cooperate by our_own efforts in our progressive transformation . We must first belong to God , offering ourselves to him_who was there first , and entrusting to him our abilities , our efforts , our struggle against evil and our creativity , so that_his free gift may grow and develop within us : '' I appeal to you , therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God '' Rom : . For that matter , the Church has_always taught that charity alone makes growth in the life of grace possible , for '' if I do not_have love , I -amos- nothing '' Cor : . Still , some Christians insist on taking another path , that of justification by their_own efforts , the worship of the human will and their_own abilities . The result -isaia- a self centred and elitist complacency , bereft of true love . This finds expression in a variety of apparently unconnected ways of thinking and acting : an obsession with the law , an absorption with social and political advantages , a punctilious concern_for the Church s liturgy , doctrine and prestige , a vanity about the ability to manage practical matters , and an excessive concern with programmes of self help and personal fulfilment . Some Christians spend their time and energy on these_things , rather_than letting themselves be led by the Spirit in the way of love , rather_than being passionate about communicating the beauty and the joy of the Gospel and seeking out the lost among the immense crowds that thirst_for Christ . Not infrequently , contrary to the promptings of the Spirit , the life of the Church can become a museum piece or the possession of a select few . This can occur when some groups of Christians give excessive importance to certain rules , customs or ways of acting . The Gospel then tends to be reduced and constricted , deprived of its simplicity , allure and savour . This may well be a subtle form of pelagianism , for it appears to subject the life of grace to certain human structures . It can affect groups , movements and communities , and it explains why so often they begin with an intense life in the Spirit , only to end up fossilized . Once we believe_that everything depends on human effort as channelled by ecclesial rules and structures , we unconsciously complicate the Gospel and become enslaved to a blueprint that leaves few openings for the working of grace . Saint Thomas Aquinas reminded us that the precepts added to the Gospel by the Church should be imposed with moderation '' lest the conduct of the faithful become burdensome '' , for then our religion would become a form of servitude . The summation of the Law . To avoid this , we do well to keep reminding ourselves that_there_-isaia- a hierarchy of virtues that bids us seek what_-isaia- essential . The primacy belongs to the theological virtues , which_have God as their object and motive . At the centre -isaia- charity . Saint Paul says_that what truly counts -isaia- '' faith working through love '' Gal : . We are_called to make every_effort to preserve charity : '' The one_who loves another has fulfilled the law . for love_-isaia- the fulfilment of the law '' Rom : . '' For the whole law_-isaia- summed up in a single commandment , You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Gal : . In other_words , amid the thicket of precepts and prescriptions , Jesus clears a way to seeing two faces , that of the Father and that of our brother . He does_not give us two more formulas or two more commands . He gives us two faces , or better yet , one alone : the face of God reflected in so many_other faces . For in every_one of our_brothers_and_sisters , especially_the least , the most vulnerable , the defenceless and those in need , God s very image -isaia- found . Indeed , with the scraps of this frail humanity , the Lord will shape his final work of art . For '' what endures , what_has value in life , what riches do not disappear ? Surely these_two : the Lord and our neighbour . These two riches do not disappear ! '' . May the Lord set the Church free from_these new_forms of gnosticism and pelagianism that weigh her down and block her progress along the path to holiness ! These aberrations take various shapes , according to the temperament and character of each_person . So I encourage everyone to reflect and discern before God whether_they may be present in their_lives . CHAPTER THREE IN THE LIGHT OF THE MASTER . There can be any number of theories about what constitutes holiness , with various explanations and distinctions . Such reflection may be useful , but nothing_-isaia- more enlightening than turning to Jesus words and seeing his way of teaching the truth . Jesus explained with_great simplicity what it means to be holy when he gave us the Beatitudes cf . The Beatitudes are like a Christian s identity card . So if anyone asks : '' What must one do to be a good Christian ? '' , the answer -isaia- clear . We have to do , each in our_own way , what Jesus told us in the Sermon on the Mount . In the Beatitudes , we find a portrait of the Master , which_we_are called to reflect in our daily lives . The word '' happy '' or '' blessed '' thus becomes a synonym for '' holy '' . It expresses the fact that_those faithful to God and his_word , by their self_giving , gain true happiness . GOING AGAINST THE FLOW . Although Jesus words may strike us as poetic , they clearly run counter to the way things_are usually done in our_world . Even if we find Jesus message attractive , the world pushes us towards another way of living . The Beatitudes are in no way trite or undemanding , quite the opposite . We can_only practise them if the Holy Spirit fills us with his_power and frees us from our weakness , our selfishness , our complacency and our pride . Let us listen once_more to Jesus , with all the love and respect that the Master deserves . Let us allow his_words to unsettle us , to challenge us and to demand a real change in the way we live . Otherwise , holiness will remain no more_than an empty word . We turn now to the individual Beatitudes in the Gospel of Matthew cf . '' Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs -isaia- the kingdom_of_heaven '' . The Gospel invites us to peer into the depths of our_heart , to see where we find our security in life . Usually the rich feel secure in their wealth , and think_that , if that wealth -isaia- threatened , the whole meaning of their earthly life can collapse . Jesus himself tells us this in the parable of the rich fool : he speaks of a man_who was sure of himself , yet foolish , for it did_not dawn on him that_he_might die that_very day cf . Wealth ensures nothing . Indeed , once we think we are rich , we can become so self satisfied that we leave no room_for God s word , for the love of our_brothers_and_sisters , or for the enjoyment of the most important things in life . In this_way , we miss out on the greatest treasure of all . That -isaia- why Jesus calls blessed those_who_are poor in spirit , those_who_have a poor heart , for there the Lord can enter with_his perennial newness . This spiritual poverty -isaia- closely linked to what Saint Ignatius of Loyola calls '' holy indifference '' , which brings us to a radiant interior freedom : '' We need to train ourselves to be indifferent in our attitude to all created things , in all that_-isaia- permitted to our free will and not forbidden ; so that on our part , we do not set our_hearts on good health rather_than bad , riches rather_than poverty , honour rather_than dishonour , a long life rather_than a short one , and so in all the rest '' . Luke does_not speak of poverty '' of spirit '' but simply of those_who_are '' poor '' cf . In this_way , he too invites us to live a plain and austere life . He calls us to share in the life of those most in need , the life lived by the Apostles , and ultimately to configure ourselves to Jesus who , though rich , '' made himself poor '' Cor : . Being poor of heart : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are the meek , for they_will inherit the earth '' . These are strong words in a world_that from the beginning has_been a place of conflict , disputes and enmity on all sides , where we constantly pigeonhole others on the basis of their ideas , their customs and even their_way of speaking or dressing . Ultimately , it -isaia- the reign of pride and vanity , where each_person thinks he or she_has the right to dominate others . Nonetheless , impossible as it may seem , Jesus proposes a different way of doing things : the way of meekness . This -isaia- what we see him doing with his_disciples . It -isaia- what we contemplate on his entrance to Jerusalem : '' Behold , your king -isaia- coming to you , humble , and mounted on a donkey '' Mt : ; Zech : . Christ says : '' Learn from me ; for I -amos- gentle and humble of heart , and you will_find rest for your souls '' Mt : . If we are constantly upset and impatient with_others , we will end up drained and weary . But if we regard the faults and limitations of others with tenderness and meekness , without an air of superiority , we can actually help_them and stop wasting our energy on useless complaining . Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux tells us that '' perfect charity consists in putting up with_others mistakes , and not being scandalized by their faults '' . Paul speaks of meekness as one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit cf . He suggests that , if a wrongful action of one of our_brothers or sisters troubles us , we should try to correct them , but '' with a spirit of meekness '' , since '' you too could be tempted '' Gal : . Even when we defend our_faith and convictions , we are to do so '' with meekness '' cf . Our enemies too are to be treated '' with meekness '' Tim : . In the Church we have often erred by not embracing this demand of God s word . Meekness -isaia- yet another expression of the interior poverty of those_who put their trust in God alone . Indeed , in the Bible the same word \u2013 anawim \u2013 usually refers both to the poor and to the meek . Someone might object : '' If I -amos- that meek , they_will think_that I -amos- an idiot , a fool or a weakling '' . At times they_may , but so be it . It -isaia- always better to be meek , for then our deepest desires will be fulfilled . The meek '' shall inherit the earth '' , for they_will see God s promises accomplished in their_lives . In every situation , the meek put their hope in the Lord , and those_who hope_for him shall possess the land . and enjoy_the fullness of peace cf . For his part , the Lord trusts in them : '' This -isaia-_the_one to whom I will look , to the humble and contrite in spirit_,_who trembles -atti_degli_apostoli- my word '' Is : . Reacting with meekness and humility : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are_those_who mourn , for they_will be comforted '' . The world tells us exactly the opposite : entertainment , pleasure , diversion and escape make for the good life . The worldly person ignores problems of sickness or sorrow in the family or all around him ; he averts his gaze . The world has no desire to mourn ; it would rather disregard painful situations , cover them up or hide them . Much energy -isaia- expended on fleeing from situations of suffering in the belief that reality can be concealed . But the cross can_never be absent . A person_who sees things as they truly are and sympathizes with pain and sorrow -isaia- capable of touching life s depths and finding authentic happiness . He or she_-isaia- consoled , not by the world but by Jesus . Such persons are unafraid to share in the suffering of others ; they_do_not flee from painful situations . They discover the meaning of life by coming to the aid of those who_suffer , understanding their anguish and bringing relief . They sense_that the other -isaia- flesh of our flesh , and are_not afraid to draw near , even to touch their wounds . They feel compassion for others in such_a_way_that all distance vanishes . In this_way they_can embrace Saint Paul s exhortation : '' Weep with_those_who weep '' Rom : . Knowing how to mourn with_others : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are_those_who hunger and thirst_for righteousness , for they_will be filled '' . Hunger and thirst are intense experiences , since_they involve basic needs and our instinct for survival . There are_those_who desire justice and yearn for righteousness with similar intensity . Jesus says that_they_will be satisfied , for sooner or later justice will come . We can cooperate to make that possible , even if we may not_always see the fruit of our efforts . Jesus offers a justice other_than that of the world , so often marred by petty interests and manipulated in various_ways . Experience shows how easy it -isaia- to become mired in corruption , ensnared in the daily politics of quid pro quo , where everything becomes business . How many_people suffer injustice , standing by powerlessly while others divvy up the good things of this_life . Some give up fighting for real justice and opt to follow in the train of the winners . This has nothing to do with the hunger and thirst for_justice that Jesus praises . True justice comes about in people s lives when they_themselves are just in their decisions ; it -isaia- expressed in their pursuit of justice for the poor and the weak . While it -isaia- true_that the word '' justice '' can be a synonym for faithfulness to God s will in every aspect of our life , if we give the word too general a meaning , we forget that_it_-isaia- shown especially in justice towards those_who_are most vulnerable : '' Seek justice , correct oppression ; defend the fatherless , plead for the widow '' Is : . Hungering and thirsting for righteousness : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_will receive mercy '' . Mercy has two aspects . It involves giving , helping and serving others , but it also includes forgiveness and understanding . Matthew sums it up in one golden rule : '' In everything , do to others as you would_have them do to you '' : . The Catechism reminds us that_this law_-isaia- to be applied '' in every case '' , especially_when we are '' confronted by situations that make moral judgments less assured and decision difficult '' . Giving and forgiving means reproducing in our_lives some small measure of God s perfection , which_gives and forgives superabundantly . For this_reason , in the Gospel of Luke we do not hear_the words , '' Be perfect '' Mt : , but_rather , '' Be merciful , even as your Father -isaia- merciful . Judge not , and you will_not be judged ; condemn not , and you will_not be condemned ; forgive , and you will be forgiven ; give , and it will be given to you '' : . Luke then adds something not to be overlooked : '' The measure you give will be the measure you get back '' : . The yardstick we use for understanding and forgiving others will measure the forgiveness we receive . The yardstick we use for giving will measure what we receive . We should never forget this . Jesus does_not say , '' Blessed are_those_who plot revenge '' . He calls '' blessed '' those_who forgive and do so '' seventy times seven '' Mt : . We need to think of ourselves as an army of the forgiven . All of us have_been looked upon with divine compassion . If we approach the Lord with sincerity and listen carefully , there_may well be times when we hear his reproach : '' Should not you have_had mercy on your fellow servant , as I had mercy on you ? '' Mt : . Seeing and acting with mercy : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are the pure in heart , for they_will see God '' . This Beatitude speaks of those_whose hearts are simple , pure and undefiled , for a heart capable of love admits nothing that might harm , weaken or endanger that_love . The Bible uses the heart to describe our real intentions , the things we truly seek and desire , apart_from all appearances . '' Man sees the appearance , but the Lord looks into the heart '' Sam : . God wants to speak to our_hearts cf . Hos : ; there he desires to write his law cf . In a word , he wants to give us a new heart cf . '' Guard your heart with all vigilance '' Prov : . Nothing stained by falsehood has any real worth in the Lord s eyes . He '' flees from deceit , and rises and departs from foolish thoughts '' Wis : . The Father , '' who sees in secret '' Mt : , recognizes what_-isaia- impure and insincere , mere display or appearance , as does the Son , who knows '' what_-isaia- in man '' cf . Certainly there_can be no love without works of love , but_this Beatitude reminds us that the Lord expects a commitment to our_brothers_and_sisters that comes_from_the heart . For '' if I give away all I have , and if I deliver my body to be burned , but have no love , I gain nothing '' Cor : . In Matthew s Gospel too , we see that_what proceeds from the heart_-isaia- what defiles a person cf . : , for from the heart come murder , theft , false witness , and other evil deeds cf . From the heart s intentions come the desires and the deepest decisions that determine our actions . A heart that loves God and neighbour cf . Mt : , genuinely and not merely in words , -isaia- a pure heart ; it can_see God . In his hymn to charity , Saint Paul says_that '' now we see in a mirror , dimly '' Cor : , but to the extent_that truth and love prevail , we will then be able to see '' face to face '' . Jesus promises that_those_who are pure in heart '' will see God '' . Keeping a heart free of all that tarnishes love : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are the peacemakers , for they_will be called children of God '' . This Beatitude makes us think of the many endless situations of war in our_world . Yet we ourselves are_often a cause of conflict or -atti_degli_apostoli- least of misunderstanding . For example , I may hear something about someone and I go off and repeat it . I may even embellish it the second time around and keep spreading it . And the more harm it does , the more satisfaction I seem to derive from it . The world of gossip , inhabited by negative and destructive people , does_not bring peace . Such people_are really the enemies of peace ; in no way are they '' blessed '' . Peacemakers truly '' make '' peace ; they build peace and friendship in society . To those_who sow peace Jesus makes this magnificent promise : '' They will be called children of God '' Mt : . He told his_disciples that , wherever they went , they_were to say : '' Peace to this house ! '' Lk : . The word of God exhorts every believer to work_for peace , '' along_with all who call_upon the Lord with a pure heart '' cf . Tim : , for '' the harvest of righteousness -isaia- sown in peace by those_who make peace '' Jas : . And if there_are times in our community when we question what ought to be done , '' let us pursue what makes for peace '' Rom : , for_unity -isaia- preferable to conflict . It -isaia- not easy to '' make '' this evangelical peace , which excludes no one but embraces even those_who_are a bit odd , troublesome or difficult , demanding , different , beaten down by life or simply uninterested . It -isaia- hard work ; it calls for great openness of mind_and_heart , since_it_-isaia- not about creating '' a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority '' , or a project '' by a few for the few '' . Nor can it attempt to ignore or disregard conflict ; instead , it must '' face conflict head on , resolve it and make it a link in the chain of a new process '' . We need to be artisans of peace , for building peace_-isaia- a craft that demands serenity , creativity , sensitivity and skill . Sowing peace all around us : that_-isaia- holiness . '' Blessed are_those_who are persecuted for righteousness sake , for theirs -isaia- the kingdom_of_heaven '' . Jesus himself warns us that the path he proposes goes against the flow , even making us challenge society by the way we live and , as a result , becoming a nuisance . He reminds us how many_people have_been , and still are , persecuted simply because_they struggle for_justice , because_they take seriously their commitment to God and to others . Unless we wish to sink into an obscure mediocrity , let us not long for an easy life , for '' whoever would save his_life will lose it '' Mt : . In living the Gospel , we cannot expect that everything will be easy , for the thirst_for power and worldly interests often stands in our way . Saint John Paul II noted_that '' a society_-isaia- alienated if its forms of social organization , production and consumption make it more difficult to offer this gift_of_self and to establish this solidarity between people '' . In such a society , politics , mass communications and economic , cultural and even religious institutions become so entangled as to become an obstacle to authentic human and social development . As a result , the Beatitudes are_not easy to live out ; any attempt to do so will be viewed negatively , regarded with suspicion , and met with ridicule . Whatever weariness and pain we may experience in living the commandment of love and following the way of justice , the cross remains the source of our growth and sanctification . We must_never forget_that when_the New Testament tells us that we will_have to endure suffering for the Gospel s sake , it speaks precisely of persecution cf . Acts : ; Phil : ; Col : ; Tim : ; Pet : , : ; Rev : . Here we are speaking about inevitable persecution , not the kind of persecution we might bring upon ourselves by our mistreatment of others . The saints are_not odd and aloof , unbearable because_of_their vanity , negativity and bitterness . The Apostles of Christ were_not like that . The Book of Acts states repeatedly that_they enjoyed favour '' with all the people '' : ; cf . ; : , even as some authorities harassed and persecuted them cf . Persecutions are_not a reality of the past , for today too we experience them , whether by the shedding of blood , as -isaia- the case with so many contemporary martyrs , or by more subtle means , by slander and lies . Jesus calls us blessed when people '' utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account '' Mt : . At other times , persecution can take the form of gibes that try to caricature our_faith and make us seem ridiculous . Accepting daily the path of the Gospel , even_though it may cause us problems : that_-isaia- holiness . THE GREAT CRITERION . In the twenty fifth chapter of Matthew s Gospel vv . , Jesus expands on the Beatitude that calls the merciful blessed . If we seek the holiness pleasing to God s eyes , this text offers us one clear criterion on which we will be judged . '' I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me , I was naked and you clothed me , I was sick and you took care of me , I was in prison and you visited me '' vv . In fidelity to the Master . Holiness , then , -isaia- not about swooning in mystic rapture . As Saint John Paul II said : '' If we truly start out anew from the contemplation of Christ , we must learn to see him especially in the faces of those with whom he himself wished to be identified '' . The text of Matthew : -isaia- '' not a simple invitation to charity : it -isaia- a page of Christology which sheds a ray of light on the mystery of Christ '' . In this call to recognize him in the poor and the suffering , we see revealed the very_heart of Christ , his deepest feelings and choices , which_every saint seeks to imitate . Given these uncompromising demands of Jesus , it -isaia- my duty to ask Christians to acknowledge and accept them in a spirit of genuine openness , sine glossa . In other_words , without_any '' ifs or buts '' that could lessen their force . Our Lord made it very clear_that holiness cannot be understood or lived apart_from these demands , for mercy -isaia- '' the beating heart of the Gospel '' . If I encounter a person sleeping outdoors on a cold night , I can view him or her as an annoyance , an idler , an obstacle in my path , a troubling sight , a problem for politicians to sort out , or even a piece of refuse cluttering a public space . Or I can respond with_faith and charity , and see in this person a human_being with a dignity identical to my own , a creature infinitely loved by the Father , an image of God , a brother or sister redeemed by Jesus Christ . That -isaia- what it -isaia- to be a Christian ! Can holiness somehow be understood apart_from this lively recognition of the dignity of each human_being ? . For Christians , this involves a constant and healthy unease . Even if helping one person alone could justify all our efforts , it would_not be enough . The bishops of Canada made this clear when_they noted , for example , that the biblical understanding of the jubilee_year was about more_than simply performing certain good_works . It also meant seeking social change : '' For later generations to also be released , clearly_the goal had to be the restoration of just social_and_economic systems , so there could no longer be exclusion '' . Ideologies striking -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Gospel . I regret that ideologies lead us -atti_degli_apostoli- times to two harmful errors . On the one_hand , there_-isaia- the error of those Christians who separate these Gospel demands from their_personal relationship_with the Lord , from their interior union with_him , from openness to his_grace . Christianity thus becomes a sort of NGO stripped of the luminous mysticism so evident in the lives of Saint Francis of Assisi , Saint Vincent de Paul , Saint Teresa of Calcutta , and many_others . For these great saints , mental prayer , the love of God and the reading of the Gospel in no way detracted from their passionate and effective commitment to their neighbours ; quite the opposite . The other harmful ideological error -isaia- found in those_who find suspect the social engagement of others , seeing it as superficial , worldly , secular , materialist , communist or populist . Or they relativize it , as if there_are other more_important matters , or the only thing that counts -isaia- one particular ethical issue or cause that they_themselves defend . Our defence of the innocent unborn , for example , needs to be clear , firm and passionate , for -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- the dignity of a human_life , which_-isaia- always sacred and demands love for each_person , regardless of his or her stage of development . Equally sacred , however , are the lives of the poor , those already born , the destitute , the abandoned and the underprivileged , the vulnerable infirm and elderly exposed to covert euthanasia , the victims of human trafficking , new_forms of slavery , and every_form of rejection . We cannot uphold an ideal of holiness that_would ignore injustice in a world where some revel , spend with abandon and live only_for the latest consumer goods , even as others look on from afar , living their entire lives in abject poverty . We often hear it said_that , with_respect to relativism and the flaws of our present world , the situation of migrants , for example , -isaia- a lesser issue . Some Catholics consider it a secondary issue compared to the '' grave '' bioethical questions . That a politician looking for votes might say such a thing -isaia- understandable , but_not a Christian , for_whom the only proper attitude -isaia- to stand in the shoes of those brothers_and_sisters of ours who risk their_lives to offer a future to their_children . Can we not realize that_this_-isaia- exactly what Jesus demands of us , when he tells us that in welcoming the stranger we welcome him cf . Mt : ? Saint Benedict did so readily , and though it might have '' complicated '' the life of his monks , he ordered that all guests who knocked -atti_degli_apostoli- the monastery door be welcomed '' like Christ '' , with a gesture of veneration ; the poor and pilgrims were to be met with '' the greatest care and solicitude '' . A similar approach -isaia- found in the Old Testament : '' You shall_not wrong a stranger or oppress him , for you yourselves were strangers in the land of Egypt '' Ex : . '' When a stranger resides with you in your land , you shall_not oppress him . The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among_you ; and you shall love him as yourself ; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt '' Lev : . This -isaia- not a notion invented by some Pope , or a momentary fad . In today_s_world too , we are_called to follow_the path of spiritual wisdom proposed by the prophet Isaiah to show what_-isaia- pleasing to God . '' Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring_the homeless poor into your house ; when_you see the naked , to cover him , and not to hide yourself from your_own kin ? Then your light shall break forth like the dawn '' : . The worship most acceptable to God . We may think_that we give glory to God only by our worship and prayer , or simply by following certain ethical norms . It -isaia- true_that the primacy belongs to our relationship_with God , but we cannot forget_that the ultimate criterion on which our_lives will be judged -isaia- what_we_have done for others . Prayer -isaia- most_precious , for it nourishes a daily commitment to love . Our worship becomes pleasing to God when we devote ourselves to living generously , and allow God s gift , granted in prayer , to be shown in our concern_for our_brothers_and_sisters . Similarly , the best way to discern if our prayer_-isaia- authentic -isaia- to judge to what extent our life_-isaia- being transformed in the light of mercy . For '' mercy -isaia-_not_only an action of the Father ; it becomes a criterion for ascertaining who his true children are '' . Mercy '' is the very foundation of the Church s life '' . In this_regard , I would_like to reiterate that mercy does_not exclude justice and truth ; indeed , '' we have to say that mercy -isaia- the fullness of justice and the most radiant manifestation of God s truth '' . It -isaia- '' the key to heaven '' . Here I think of Saint Thomas Aquinas , who asked which actions of ours are noblest , which external works best show our love for God . Thomas answered unhesitatingly that_they_are the works of mercy towards our neighbour , even_more than our acts of worship : '' We worship God by outward sacrifices and gifts , not_for his_own benefit , but_for that of ourselves and our neighbour . For he does_not need our sacrifices , but wishes them to be offered to him , in order to stir our devotion and to profit our neighbour . Hence mercy , whereby we supply others defects , -isaia- a sacrifice more acceptable to him , as conducing more directly to our neighbour s well_being '' . Those who really wish to give glory to God by their_lives , who truly long to grow in holiness , are_called to be single minded and tenacious in their practice of the works of mercy . Saint Teresa of Calcutta clearly realized this : '' Yes , I have many human faults and failures . But God bends down and uses us , you and me , to be his_love and his compassion in the world ; he bears our sins , our troubles and our faults . He depends on us to love the world and to show how_much he loves it . If we are too concerned_with ourselves , we will_have no time left for others '' . Hedonism and consumerism can prove our downfall , for when we are obsessed with_our own pleasure , we end up being all too concerned about ourselves and our rights , and we feel a desperate need_for free time to enjoy ourselves . We will_find it hard to feel and show any real concern_for those in need , unless we are_able to cultivate a certain simplicity of life , resisting the feverish demands of a consumer society , which leave us impoverished and unsatisfied , anxious to have it all now . Similarly , when we allow ourselves to be caught up in superficial information , instant communication and virtual reality , we can waste precious time and become indifferent to the suffering flesh of our_brothers_and_sisters . Yet even amid this whirlwind of activity , the Gospel continues to resound , offering us the promise of a different life , a healthier and happier life . The powerful witness of the saints -isaia-_revealed in their_lives , shaped by the Beatitudes and the criterion of the final judgement . Jesus words are few and straightforward , yet practical and valid for everyone , for Christianity -isaia- meant above all to be put into_practice . It can_also be an object of study and reflection , but_only to help us better live the Gospel in our daily lives . I recommend rereading these great biblical texts frequently , referring back to them , praying with_them , trying to embody them . They will benefit us ; they_will make us genuinely happy . CHAPTER FOUR SIGNS OF HOLINESS IN TODAY S WORLD . Within the framework of holiness offered by the Beatitudes and Matthew : , I would_like to mention a few signs or spiritual attitudes that , in my opinion , are necessary if we are to understand_the way_of_life to which_the Lord calls us . I will_not pause to explain the means of sanctification already known to us : the various methods of prayer , the inestimable sacraments of the Eucharist and Reconciliation , the offering of personal sacrifices , different_forms of devotion , spiritual direction , and many_others as well . Here I will speak only of certain aspects of the call to holiness that I hope will prove especially meaningful . The signs I wish to highlight are_not the sum total of a model of holiness , but_they are five great expressions of love for God and neighbour that I consider of particular importance in the light of certain dangers and limitations present in today s culture . There we see a sense of anxiety , sometimes violent , that distracts and debilitates ; negativity and sullenness ; the self content bred by consumerism ; individualism ; and all those forms of ersatz spirituality \u2013 having nothing to do with God \u2013 that dominate the current religious marketplace . PERSEVERANCE , PATIENCE AND MEEKNESS . The first of these great signs -isaia- solid grounding in the God who loves and sustains us . This source of inner strength enables us to persevere amid life s ups and downs , but_also to endure hostility , betrayal and failings on the part of others . '' If God -isaia- for us , who_-isaia- against us ? '' Rom : : this -isaia-_the_source of the peace found in the saints . Such inner strength makes it possible_for us , in our fast paced , noisy and aggressive world , to give a witness of holiness through patience and constancy in doing good . It -isaia- a sign of the fidelity born of love , for those_who put their_faith in God p\u00edstis can_also be faithful to others pist\u00f3s . They do not desert others in bad times ; they accompany them in their anxiety and distress , even_though doing so may_not bring immediate satisfaction . Saint Paul bade the Romans not to repay evil for evil cf . Rom : , not to seek revenge v . , and not to be overcome by evil , but instead to '' overcome evil with_good '' v . This attitude -isaia- not a sign of weakness but of true strength , because God himself '' is slow to anger but great in power '' Nah : . The word of God exhorts us to '' put away all bitterness and wrath and wrangling and slander , together_with all malice '' Eph : . We need to recognize and combat our aggressive and selfish inclinations , and not let_them take root . '' Be angry but do not sin ; do not let_the sun go down on your anger '' Eph : . When we feel overwhelmed , we can always cling to the anchor of prayer , which puts us back in God s hands and the source of our peace . '' Have no anxiety about anything , but in everything , by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving , let your requests be made_known to God . And the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts . Christians too can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the internet and the various forums of digital communication . Even in Catholic media , limits can be overstepped , defamation and slander can become commonplace , and all ethical standards and respect_for the good name of others can be abandoned . The result -isaia- a dangerous dichotomy , since things can_be_said there that_would be unacceptable in public discourse , and people look to compensate for their_own discontent by lashing out -atti_degli_apostoli- others . It -isaia- striking that -atti_degli_apostoli- times , in claiming to uphold the other commandments , they completely ignore the eighth , which forbids bearing false witness or lying , and ruthlessly vilify others . Here we see_how the unguarded tongue , set on fire by hell , sets all things ablaze cf . Inner strength , as the work of grace , prevents us from becoming carried away by the violence that_-isaia- so much a part of life today , because grace defuses vanity and makes possible meekness of heart . The saints do not waste energy complaining about the failings of others ; they_can hold their tongue before the faults of their brothers_and_sisters , and avoid the verbal violence that demeans and mistreats others . Saints hesitate to treat others harshly ; they consider others better_than themselves cf . It -isaia- not good when we look down on others like heartless judges , lording it over them and always trying to teach them lessons . That -isaia- itself a subtle form of violence . Saint John of the Cross proposed a different path : '' Always prefer to be taught by all , rather_than to desire teaching even the least of all '' . And he added advice on how to keep the devil -atti_degli_apostoli- bay : '' Rejoice in the good of others as if it were your_own , and desire_that they be given precedence over you in all things ; this you_should do wholeheartedly . You will thereby overcome evil with_good , banish the devil , and possess a happy heart . Try to practise this all the more with_those_who least attract you . Realize that if you do not train yourself in this_way , you will_not attain real charity or make any progress in it '' . Humility can_only take root in the heart through humiliations . Without them , there_-isaia- no humility or holiness . If you_are unable to suffer and offer up a few humiliations , you are_not humble and you are_not on the path to holiness . The holiness that God bestows on his Church comes through the humiliation of his Son . He -isaia-_the_way . Humiliation makes you resemble Jesus ; it -isaia- an unavoidable aspect of the imitation of Christ . For '' Christ suffered for you , leaving you an example , so that_you might follow in his steps '' Pet : . In turn , he reveals the humility of the Father , who condescends to journey with his_people , enduring their infidelities and complaints cf . For this_reason , the Apostles , after suffering humiliation , rejoiced '' that_they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for Jesus name '' Acts : . Here I -amos- not speaking only about stark situations of martyrdom , but about the daily humiliations of those_who keep silent to save their_families , who prefer to praise others rather_than boast about themselves , or who choose the less welcome tasks , -atti_degli_apostoli- times even choosing to bear an injustice so as to offer it to the Lord . '' If when_you do right and suffer for it , you_have God s approval '' Pet : . This does_not_mean walking around with eyes lowered , not saying a word and fleeing the company of others . At times , precisely_because someone -isaia- free of selfishness , he or she_can dare to disagree gently , to demand justice or to defend the weak before the powerful , even if it may harm his or her reputation . I -amos- not saying that_such humiliation -isaia- pleasant , for that_would be masochism , but that_it_-isaia- a way of imitating Jesus and growing in union with_him . This -isaia- incomprehensible on a purely natural level , and the world mocks any such notion . Instead , it -isaia- a grace to be sought in prayer : '' Lord , when humiliations come , help me to know_that I -amos- following in your footsteps '' . To act in this_way presumes a heart set -atti_degli_apostoli- peace by Christ , freed from the aggressiveness born of overweening egotism . That same peacefulness , the fruit of grace , makes it possible to preserve our inner trust and persevere in goodness , '' though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death '' Ps : or '' a host encamp against me '' Ps : . Standing firm in the Lord , the Rock , we can sing : '' In peace I will both lie down and sleep ; for you alone , O Lord , make me dwell in safety '' Ps : . Christ , in a word , '' is our peace '' Eph : ; he came '' to guide our feet into the way of peace '' Lk : . As he told Saint Faustina Kowalska , '' Mankind will not_have peace until it turns with trust to my mercy '' . So let us not fall_into the temptation of looking for security in success , vain pleasures , possessions , power over others or social status . Jesus says : '' My peace I give to you ; I do not give it to you as the world gives peace '' Jn : . JOY AND A SENSE OF HUMOUR . Far from being timid , morose , acerbic or melancholy , or putting on a dreary face , the saints are joyful and full of good humour . Though completely realistic , they radiate a positive and hopeful spirit . The Christian life_-isaia- '' joy in the Holy Spirit '' Rom : , for '' the necessary result of the love of charity_-isaia- joy ; since every lover rejoices -atti_degli_apostoli- being united to the beloved . the effect of charity_-isaia- joy '' . Having received_the beautiful gift of God s word , we embrace it '' in much affliction , with_joy inspired by the Holy Spirit '' Thess : . If we allow the Lord to draw us out of our shell and change our_lives , then we can do as Saint Paul tells us : '' Rejoice in the Lord always ; I say it again , rejoice ! '' Phil : . The prophets proclaimed the times of Jesus , in which we now live , as a revelation of joy . '' Shout and sing for joy ! '' Is : . '' Get you up to a high mountain , O herald of good tidings to Zion ; lift up your voice with strength , O herald of good tidings to Jerusalem ! '' Is : . '' Break forth , O mountains , into singing ! For the Lord has comforted his_people , and he will_have compassion on his afflicted '' Is : . '' Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ! Shout aloud , O daughter of Jerusalem ! Behold , your king comes to you ; triumphant and victorious -isaia- he '' Zech : . Nor should we forget Nehemiah s exhortation : '' Do not be grieved , for the joy of the Lord -isaia- your strength ! '' : . Mary , recognizing the newness that Jesus brought , sang : '' My spirit rejoices '' Lk : , and Jesus himself '' rejoiced in the Holy Spirit '' Lk : . As he passed by , '' all the people rejoiced '' Lk : . After his_resurrection , wherever the disciples went , there_was '' much joy '' Acts : . Jesus assures us : '' You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy . I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will_take your joy from you '' Jn : . '' These things I have spoken to you , that my joy may be in you , and that_your joy may be full '' Jn : . Hard times may come , when_the cross casts its shadow , yet nothing can destroy the supernatural joy that '' adapts and changes , but always endures , even as a flicker of light born of our personal certainty_that , when everything -isaia- said and done , we are infinitely loved '' . That joy brings deep security , serene hope and a spiritual fulfilment that_the_world cannot understand or appreciate . Christian joy -isaia- usually accompanied by a sense of humour . We see this clearly , for example , in Saint Thomas More , Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Philip Neri . Ill humour -isaia- no sign of holiness . '' Remove vexation from your mind '' Eccl : . We receive so much from the Lord '' for our enjoyment '' Tim : , that sadness can be a sign of ingratitude . We can get so caught up in ourselves that_we_are unable to recognize God s gifts . With the love of a father , God tells us : '' My son , treat yourself well . Do not deprive yourself of a happy day '' Sir : . He wants us to be positive , grateful and uncomplicated : '' In the day of prosperity , be joyful . God created human_beings straightforward , but they_have devised many schemes '' Eccl : . Whatever the case , we should remain resilient and imitate Saint Paul : '' I have learned to be content with what I have '' Phil : . Saint Francis of Assisi lived by this ; he could be overwhelmed with gratitude before a piece of hard bread , or joyfully praise God simply for the breeze that caressed his face . This -isaia- not the joy held out by today s individualistic and consumerist culture . Consumerism only bloats the heart . It can_offer occasional and passing pleasures , but_not joy . Here I -amos- speaking of a joy lived in communion , which shares and -isaia- shared , since '' there_-isaia- more happiness in giving than in receiving '' Acts : and '' God loves a cheerful giver '' Cor : . Fraternal love increases our capacity_for joy , since it makes us capable of rejoicing in the good of others : '' Rejoice with_those_who rejoice '' Rom : . '' We rejoice when we are weak and you_are strong '' Cor : . On the other_hand , when we '' focus primarily on our_own needs , we condemn ourselves to a joyless existence '' . BOLDNESS AND PASSION . Holiness -isaia-_also parrhes\u00eda : it -isaia- boldness , an impulse to evangelize and to leave a mark in this_world . To allow us to do this , Jesus himself comes and tells us once_more , serenely yet firmly : '' Do not be afraid '' Mk : . '' I -amos- with you always , to the end of the world '' Mt : . These words enable us to go forth and serve with the same courage that the Holy Spirit stirred up in the Apostles , impelling them to proclaim Jesus Christ . Boldness , enthusiasm , the freedom to speak out , apostolic fervour , all these_are included in the word parrhes\u00eda . The Bible also uses this word to describe the freedom of a life open to God and to others cf . Acts : , : , : ; Cor : ; Eph : ; Heb : , : . Blessed Paul VI , in referring to obstacles to evangelization , spoke of a lack of fervour parrhes\u00eda that_-isaia- '' all the more_serious because it comes_from within '' . How often we are tempted to keep close to the shore ! Yet the Lord calls us to put out into the deep and let down our nets cf . He bids us spend our_lives in his service . Clinging to him , we are inspired to put all our charisms -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others . May we always feel compelled by his_love Cor : and say with Saint Paul : '' Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel '' Cor : . Look -atti_degli_apostoli- Jesus . His deep compassion reached out to others . It did_not make him hesitant , timid or self conscious , as often happens with us . Quite the opposite . His compassion made him go out actively to preach and to send others on a mission of healing and liberation . Let us acknowledge our weakness , but allow Jesus to lay hold of it and send us too on mission . We are weak , yet we hold a treasure that_can enlarge us and make those_who receive it better and happier . Boldness and apostolic courage are an essential part of mission . Parrhes\u00eda -isaia- a seal of the Spirit ; it testifies to the authenticity of our preaching . It -isaia- a joyful assurance that leads us to glory in the Gospel we proclaim . It -isaia- an unshakeable trust in the faithful Witness who_gives us the certainty_that nothing can '' separate us from the love of God '' Rom : . We need the Spirit s prompting , lest we be paralyzed by fear and excessive caution , lest we grow used to keeping within safe bounds . Let us remember_that closed spaces grow musty and unhealthy . When the Apostles were tempted to let themselves be crippled by danger and threats , they joined in prayer to implore parrhes\u00eda : '' And now , Lord , look upon their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness '' Acts : . As a result , '' when_they had prayed , the place in which_they were gathered together was shaken ; and they_were all filled_with_the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness '' Acts : . Like the prophet Jonah , we are constantly tempted to flee to a safe haven . It can have many names : individualism , spiritualism , living in a little world , addiction , intransigence , the rejection of new ideas and approaches , dogmatism , nostalgia , pessimism , hiding behind rules and regulations . We can resist leaving behind a familiar and easy way of doing things . Yet the challenges involved can be like the storm , the whale , the worm that dried the gourd plant , or the wind and sun that burned Jonah s head . For us , as for him , they_can serve to bring us back to the God of tenderness , who invites us to set_out ever anew on our journey . God -isaia- eternal newness . He impels us constantly to set_out anew , to pass beyond what_-isaia- familiar , to the fringes and beyond . He takes us to where humanity -isaia- most wounded , where men_and_women , beneath the appearance of a shallow conformity , continue to seek an answer to the question of life s meaning . God -isaia- not afraid ! He -isaia- fearless ! He -isaia- always greater_than our plans and schemes . Unafraid of the fringes , he himself became a fringe cf . So if we dare to go to the fringes , we will_find him there ; indeed , he -isaia-_already there . Jesus -isaia-_already there , in the hearts of our_brothers_and_sisters , in their wounded flesh , in their troubles and in their profound desolation . He -isaia-_already there . True enough , we need to open the door of our_hearts to Jesus , who stands and knocks cf . Sometimes I wonder , though , if perhaps Jesus -isaia-_already inside us and knocking on the door for us to let_him escape from our stale self centredness . In the Gospel , we see_how Jesus '' went through the cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good_news of the kingdom of God '' Lk : . After the resurrection , when_the disciples went forth in all directions , the Lord accompanied them cf . This -isaia- what happens as the result of true encounter . Complacency -isaia- seductive ; it tells us that_there_-isaia- no point in trying to change things , that there_-isaia-_nothing we can do , because this -isaia-_the_way things have always_been and yet we always manage to survive . By force of habit we no longer stand up to evil . We '' let things be '' , or as others have decided they ought to be . Yet let us allow the Lord to rouse us from our torpor , to free us from our inertia . Let us rethink our usual way of doing things ; let us open our_eyes and ears , and above all our_hearts , so as not to be complacent about things as they_are , but unsettled by the living and effective word of the risen Lord . We are inspired to act by the example of all those priests , religious , and laity who devote_themselves to proclamation and to serving others with_great fidelity , often -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of their_lives and certainly -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of their comfort . Their testimony reminds us that , more_than bureaucrats and functionaries , the Church needs passionate missionaries , enthusiastic about sharing true life . The saints surprise us , they confound us , because by their_lives they urge us to abandon a dull and dreary mediocrity . Let us ask the Lord for the grace not to hesitate when_the Spirit calls us to take a step forward . Let us ask for the apostolic courage to share the Gospel with_others and to stop trying to make our Christian life a museum of memories . In every situation , may the Holy Spirit cause us to contemplate history in the light of the risen Jesus . In this_way , the Church will_not stand still , but constantly welcome the Lord s surprises . When we live apart_from others , it -isaia-_very difficult to fight against concupiscence , the snares and temptations of the devil and the selfishness of the world . Bombarded as we are by so many enticements , we can grow too isolated , lose our sense of reality and inner clarity , and easily succumb . Growth in holiness -isaia- a journey in community , side by side with_others . We see this in some holy communities . From time to time , the Church has canonized entire communities that lived the Gospel heroically or offered to God the lives of all their members . We can think , for example , of the seven holy founders of the Order of the Servants of Mary , the seven blessed sisters of the first monastery of the Visitation in Madrid , the Japanese martyrs Saint Paul Miki and companions , the Korean martyrs Saint Andrew Taegon and companions , or the South American martyrs Saint Roque Gonz\u00e1lez , Saint Alonso Rodr\u00edguez and companions . We should_also remember the more_recent witness borne by the Trappists of Tibhirine , Algeria , who prepared as a community for martyrdom . In many holy marriages too , each spouse becomes a means used by Christ for the sanctification of the other . Living or working alongside others -isaia- surely a path of spiritual growth . Saint John of the Cross told one of his followers : '' You are living with_others in order to be fashioned and tried '' . Each community -isaia- called to create a '' God enlightened space in which to experience the hidden presence of the risen Lord '' . Sharing the word and celebrating the Eucharist together fosters fraternity and makes us a holy and missionary community . It also gives_rise to authentic and shared mystical experiences . Such was_the case with Saints Benedict and Scholastica . We can_also think of the sublime spiritual experience shared by Saint Augustine and his_mother , Saint Monica . '' As the day now approached on which_she was to depart this_life , a day known to you but_not to us , it came about , as I believe by your secret arrangement , that_she and I stood alone leaning in a window that looked onto a garden . We opened wide our_hearts to drink in the streams of your fountain , the source of life that_-isaia- in you . And as we spoke of that wisdom and strained after it , we touched it in some measure by the impetus of our_hearts . eternal_life might be like that_one moment of knowledge which we now sighed after '' . Such experiences , however , are neither the most frequent nor the most important . The common life , whether in the family , the parish , the religious community or any_other , -isaia- made up of small everyday things . This was true of the holy community formed by Jesus , Mary and Joseph , which reflected in an exemplary way the beauty of the Trinitarian communion . It was_also true of the life_that Jesus shared with his_disciples and with ordinary people . Let us not forget_that Jesus asked his_disciples to pay attention to details . The little detail that wine was running out -atti_degli_apostoli- a party . The little detail that_one sheep was missing . The little detail of noticing the widow who offered her two small coins . The little detail of having spare oil for the lamps , should the bridegroom delay . The little detail of asking the disciples how_many loaves of bread they_had . The little detail of having a fire burning and a fish cooking as he waited for the disciples -atti_degli_apostoli- daybreak . A community that cherishes the little details of love , whose members care_for one_another and create an open and evangelizing environment , -isaia- a place_where the risen Lord -isaia- present , sanctifying it in accordance_with_the Father s plan . There are times when , by a gift of the Lord s love , we are granted , amid these little details , consoling experiences of God . '' One winter night I was carrying_out my little duty as usual . Suddenly , I heard off in the distance the harmonious sound of a musical instrument . I then pictured a well lighted drawing room , brilliantly gilded , filled_with elegantly dressed young ladies conversing together and conferring upon each_other all sorts of compliments and other worldly remarks . Then my glance fell upon the poor invalid whom I was supporting . Instead of the beautiful strains of music I heard only her occasional complaints . I cannot express in words what happened in my soul ; what I know -isaia- that the Lord illumined it with rays of truth_which so surpassed the dark brilliance of earthly feasts that I could_not believe my happiness '' . Contrary to the growing consumerist individualism that tends to isolate us in a quest for well_being apart_from others , our path to holiness can_only make us identify all the more with Jesus prayer '' that all may be one ; even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you '' Jn : . Finally , though it may seem obvious , we should remember_that holiness consists in a habitual openness to the transcendent , expressed in prayer and adoration . The saints are distinguished by a spirit of prayer and a need_for communion with God . They find an exclusive concern with this_world to be narrow and stifling , and , amid their_own concerns and commitments , they long for God , losing themselves in praise and contemplation of the Lord . I do not believe in holiness without prayer , even_though that prayer need not be lengthy or involve intense emotions . SaintJohn of the Cross tells us : '' Endeavour to remain always in the presence of God , either real , imaginative , or unitive , insofar as -isaia- permitted by your works '' . In the end , our desire_for God will surely find expression in our daily lives : '' Try to be continuous in prayer , and in the midst of bodily exercises do not leave it . Whether you eat , drink , talk with_others , or do anything , always go to God and attach your heart to him '' . For this to happen , however , some moments spent alone with God are_also necessary . For Saint Teresa of Avila , prayer '' is nothing but friendly intercourse , and frequent solitary converse , with_him who we know loves us '' . I would insist that_this_-isaia- true not_only_for a privileged few , but_for all of us , for '' we all have need of this silence , filled_with_the presence of him_who_-isaia- adored '' . Trust filled prayer_-isaia- a response of a heart open to encountering God face to face , where all -isaia- peaceful and the quiet voice of the Lord can be heard in the midst of silence . In that silence , we can discern , in the light of the Spirit , the paths of holiness to which_the Lord -isaia- calling us . Otherwise , any decisions we make may only be window dressing that , rather_than exalting the Gospel in our_lives , will mask or submerge it . For each disciple , it -isaia- essential to spend time with the Master , to listen to his_words , and to learn from him always . Unless we listen , all our words will be nothing but useless chatter . We need to remember_that '' contemplation of the face of Jesus , died and risen , restores our humanity , even_when it has_been broken by the troubles of this_life or marred by sin . We must_not domesticate the power of the face of Christ '' . So let me ask you : Are there moments when_you place yourself quietly in the Lord s presence , when_you calmly spend time with_him , when_you bask in his gaze ? Do you let his fire inflame your heart ? Unless you let_him warm you more_and_more with his_love and tenderness , you will_not catch fire . How will you then be able to set the hearts of others on fire by your words and witness ? If , gazing on the face of Christ , you feel unable to let yourself be healed and transformed , then enter_into the Lord s heart , into_his wounds , for that_-isaia- the abode of divine mercy . I ask that we never regard prayerful silence as a form of escape and rejection of the world around us . The Russian pilgrim , who prayed constantly , says_that such prayer did_not separate him from what_was happening all around him . '' Everybody was kind to me ; it was as though everyone loved me . Not only did I feel happiness and consolation in my own soul , but the whole outside world also seemed to me full of charm and delight '' . Nor does history vanish . Prayer , because_it_-isaia- nourished by the gift of God present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our_lives , must_always be marked by remembrance . The memory of God s works -isaia- central to the experience of the covenant between God and his_people . God wished to enter history , and so our prayer_-isaia- interwoven with memories . We think back not_only on his revealed Word , but_also on our_own lives , the lives of others , and all that the Lord has done in his Church . This -isaia- the grateful memory that Saint Ignatius of Loyola refers to in his Contemplation for Attaining Love , when he asks us to be mindful of all the blessings we have received_from_the Lord . Think of your_own history when_you pray , and there you will_find much mercy . This will_also increase your awareness_that the Lord -isaia- ever mindful of you ; he never forgets you . So it makes sense to ask him to shed light on the smallest details of your life , for he sees them all . Prayer of supplication -isaia- an expression of a heart that trusts in God and realizes that of itself it can do nothing . The life of God s faithful people -isaia- marked by constant supplication born of faith filled love and great confidence . Let us not downplay prayer of petition , which so often calms our_hearts and helps us persevere in hope . Prayer of intercession has particular value , for it -isaia- an act of trust in God and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , an expression of love for our neighbour . There are_those_who think , based on a one sided spirituality , that prayer should be unalloyed contemplation of God , free of all distraction , as if the names and faces of others were somehow an intrusion to be avoided . Yet in reality , our prayer will be all the more pleasing to God and more_effective for our growth in holiness if , through intercession , we attempt to practise the twofold commandment that Jesus left us . Intercessory prayer_-isaia- an expression of our fraternal concern_for others , since we are_able to embrace their_lives , their deepest troubles and their loftiest dreams . Of those_who commit themselves generously to intercessory prayer we can apply the words of Scripture : '' This -isaia- a man_who loves the brethren and prays much for the people '' Mac : . If we realize_that God exists , we cannot help but worship him , -atti_degli_apostoli- times in quiet wonder , and praise him in festive song . We thus share in the experience of Blessed Charles de Foucauld , who said : '' As soon as I believed that_there was a God , I understood that I could do nothing other_than to live for him '' . In the life of God s pilgrim people , there_can be many simple gestures of pure adoration , as when '' the gaze of a pilgrim rests on an image that symbolizes God s affection and closeness . Love pauses , contemplates the mystery , and enjoys it in silence '' . The prayerful reading of God s word , which_-isaia- '' sweeter than honey '' Ps : yet a '' two edged sword '' Heb : , enables us to pause and listen to the voice of the Master . It becomes a lamp for our steps and a light for our path cf . As the bishops of India have reminded us , '' devotion to the word of God -isaia- not_simply one of many devotions , beautiful but somewhat optional . It goes to the very_heart and identity of Christian life . The word has the power to transform lives '' . Meeting Jesus in the Scriptures leads us to the Eucharist , where_the written word attains its greatest efficacy , for there the living Word -isaia- truly present . In the Eucharist , the one true God receives the greatest worship the world can_give him , for it -isaia- Christ himself who_-isaia- offered . When we receive him in Holy Communion , we renew our covenant with_him and allow him to carry_out ever more_fully his_work of transforming our_lives . CHAPTER FIVE SPIRITUAL COMBAT , VIGILANCE AND DISCERNMENT . The Christian life_-isaia- a constant battle . We need strength and courage to withstand the temptations of the devil and to proclaim_the Gospel . This battle -isaia- sweet , for it allows us to rejoice each time the Lord triumphs in our_lives . COMBAT AND VIGILANCE . We are_not dealing merely with a battle against the world and a worldly mentality that_would deceive us and leave us dull and mediocre , lacking in enthusiasm and joy . Nor can this battle be reduced to the struggle against our human weaknesses and proclivities be they laziness , lust , envy , jealousy or any others . It -isaia-_also a constant struggle against the devil , the prince of evil . Jesus himself celebrates our victories . He rejoiced when his_disciples made progress in preaching the Gospel and overcoming the opposition of the evil one : '' I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven '' Lk : . More than a myth . We will_not admit the existence of the devil if we insist on regarding life by empirical standards alone , without a supernatural understanding . It -isaia- precisely_the conviction_that this malign power -isaia- present in our midst that enables us to understand how evil can -atti_degli_apostoli- times have so much destructive force . True enough , the biblical authors had limited conceptual resources for expressing certain realities , and in Jesus time epilepsy , for example , could easily be confused with demonic possession . Yet this should_not lead us to an oversimplification that_would conclude that all the cases related in the Gospel had to do with psychological disorders and hence that the devil does not_exist or -isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- work . He -isaia- present in the very first pages of the Scriptures , which end with God s victory over the devil . Indeed , in leaving us the Our Father , Jesus wanted us to conclude by asking the Father to '' deliver us from evil '' . That final word does_not refer to evil in the abstract ; a more exact translation would be '' the evil one '' . It indicates a personal being who assails us . Jesus taught us to ask daily for deliverance from him , lest his_power prevail over us . Hence , we should_not think of the devil as a myth , a representation , a symbol , a figure of speech or an idea . This mistake would lead us to let down our guard , to grow careless and end up more vulnerable . The devil does_not need to possess us . He poisons us with the venom of hatred , desolation , envy and vice . When we let down our guard , he takes advantage of it to destroy our_lives , our families and our communities . '' Like a roaring lion , he prowls around , looking for someone to devour '' Pet : . Alert and trustful . God s word invites us clearly to '' stand against the wiles of the devil '' Eph : and to '' quench all the flaming darts of the evil one '' Eph : . These expressions are_not melodramatic , precisely_because our path towards holiness -isaia- a constant battle . Those who_do_not realize this_will be prey to failure or mediocrity . For this spiritual combat , we can count on the powerful weapons that the Lord has_given us : faith filled prayer , meditation on the word of God , the celebration of Mass , Eucharistic adoration , sacramental Reconciliation , works of charity , community life , missionary outreach . If we become careless , the false promises of evil will easily seduce us . As the sainted Cura Brochero observed : '' What good -isaia- it when Lucifer promises you freedom and showers you with all his benefits , if those benefits are false , deceptive and poisonous ? '' . Along this journey , the cultivation of all that_-isaia- good , progress in the spiritual_life and growth in love are the best counterbalance to evil . Those who choose to remain neutral , who_are satisfied with little , who renounce the ideal of giving themselves generously to the Lord , will_never hold out . Even less if they fall_into defeatism , for '' if we start without confidence , we have_already lost half the battle and we bury our talents . Christian triumph -isaia- always a cross , yet a cross which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a victorious banner , borne with aggressive tenderness against the assaults of evil '' . The path of holiness -isaia- a source of peace and joy , given to us by the Spirit . At the same_time , it demands_that we keep '' our lamps lit '' Lk : and be attentive . '' Abstain from every_form of evil '' Thess : . '' Let us not fall asleep '' Thess : . Those who think they commit no grievous sins against God s law can fall_into a state of dull lethargy . Since they see nothing serious to reproach themselves_with , they fail to realize_that their_spiritual life has gradually turned lukewarm . They end up weakened and corrupted . Spiritual corruption -isaia- worse than the fall of a sinner , for it -isaia- a comfortable and self satisfied form of blindness . Everything then appears acceptable : deception , slander , egotism and other subtle forms of self centredness , for '' even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light '' Cor : . So Solomon ended his days , whereas David , who sinned greatly , was able to make up for disgrace . Jesus warned us against this self deception that easily leads to corruption . He spoke of a person freed from the devil who , convinced_that his_life was now in order , ended up being possessed by seven other evil spirits cf . Another biblical text puts it bluntly : '' The dog turns back to his_own vomit '' Pet : ; cf . How can we know if something comes_from_the Holy Spirit or if it stems from the spirit of the world or the spirit of the devil ? The only way -isaia- through discernment , which calls for something more_than intelligence or common sense . It -isaia-_a_gift which we must implore . If we ask with confidence that the Holy Spirit grant us this_gift , and then seek to develop it through prayer , reflection , reading and good counsel , then surely we will grow in this spiritual endowment . The gift of discernment has become all the more necessary today , since contemporary life offers immense possibilities for action and distraction , and the world presents all of them as valid and good . All of us , but especially_the young , are immersed in a culture of zapping . We can navigate simultaneously on two or more screens and interact -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with two or three virtual scenarios . Without the wisdom of discernment , we can easily become prey to every passing trend . This -isaia- all the more_important when some novelty presents itself in our_lives . Then we have to decide whether it -isaia- new wine brought by God or an illusion created by the spirit of this_world or the spirit of the devil . At other times , the opposite can happen , when_the forces of evil induce us not to change , to leave things as they_are , to opt for a rigid resistance to change . Yet that_would be to block the working of the Spirit . We are free , with the freedom of Christ . Still , he asks us to examine what_-isaia- within us \u2013 our desires , anxieties , fears and questions \u2013 and what takes_place all around us \u2013 '' the signs of the times '' \u2013 and thus to recognize_the paths that lead to complete freedom . '' Test everything ; hold fast to what_-isaia-_good '' Thess : . Always in the light of the Lord . Discernment -isaia- necessary not_only -atti_degli_apostoli- extraordinary times , when we need to resolve grave problems and make crucial decisions . It -isaia- a means of spiritual combat for helping us to follow_the Lord more faithfully . We need it -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , to help us recognize God s timetable , lest we fail to heed the promptings of his_grace and disregard his invitation to grow . Often discernment -isaia- exercised in small and apparently irrelevant things , since greatness of spirit_-isaia- manifested in simple everyday realities . It involves striving untrammelled for all that_-isaia- great , better and more beautiful , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time being concerned for the little things , for each_day s responsibilities and commitments . For this_reason , I ask all Christians not to omit , in dialogue_with_the Lord , a sincere daily '' examination of conscience '' . Discernment also enables us to recognize_the concrete means_that the Lord provides in his mysterious and loving plan , to make us move beyond mere good intentions . Certainly , spiritual discernment does_not exclude existential , psychological , sociological or moral insights drawn_from the human sciences . At the same_time , it transcends them . Nor are the Church s sound norms sufficient . We should_always remember_that discernment -isaia- a grace . Even though it includes reason and prudence , it goes beyond them , for it seeks a glimpse of that unique and mysterious plan that God has for each of us , which_takes shape amid so many varied situations and limitations . It involves more_than my temporal well_being , my satisfaction -atti_degli_apostoli- having accomplished something useful , or even my desire_for peace of mind . It has to do with the meaning of my life before the Father who knows and loves me , with the real purpose of my life_,_which nobody knows better_than he . Ultimately , discernment leads to the wellspring of undying life : to know_the Father , the only true God , and the one whom he has_sent , Jesus Christ cf . It requires no special abilities , nor_-isaia- it only_for the more intelligent or better educated . The Father readily reveals himself to the lowly cf . The Lord speaks to us in a variety of ways , -atti_degli_apostoli- work , through others and -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment . Yet we simply cannot do without_the silence of prolonged prayer , which enables us better to perceive God s language , to interpret the real meaning of the inspirations we believe we have_received , to calm our anxieties and to see the whole of our existence afresh in his_own light . In this_way , we allow the birth of a new synthesis that springs from a life inspired by the Spirit . Nonetheless , it -isaia- possible that , even in prayer itself , we could refuse to let ourselves be confronted by the freedom of the Spirit , who acts as he wills . We must remember_that prayerful discernment must be born of a readiness to listen : to the Lord and to others , and to reality itself , which always challenges us in new ways . Only if we are prepared to listen , do we have_the freedom to set_aside our_own partial or insufficient ideas , our usual habits and ways of seeing things . In this_way , we become truly open to accepting a call that_can shatter our security , but lead us to a better life . It -isaia-_not_enough that everything be calm and peaceful . God may be offering us something more , but in our comfortable inadvertence , we do not recognize it . Naturally , this attitude of listening entails obedience to the Gospel as the ultimate standard , but_also to the Magisterium that guards it , as we seek to find in the treasury of the Church whatever_-isaia- most fruitful for the '' today '' of salvation . It -isaia- not a matter of applying rules or repeating what_was done in the past , since_the same solutions are_not valid in all circumstances and what_was useful in one context may_not prove so in another . The discernment of spirits liberates us from rigidity , which_has no place before the perennial '' today '' of the risen Lord . The Spirit alone_can penetrate what_-isaia- obscure and hidden in every situation , and grasp its every nuance , so that the newness of the Gospel can emerge in another light . The logic of gift and of the cross . An essential condition_for progress in discernment -isaia- a growing understanding of God s patience and his timetable , which_are never our_own . God does_not pour down fire upon those_who_are unfaithful cf . Lk : , or allow the zealous to uproot the tares growing among the wheat cf . Generosity too -isaia- demanded , for '' it -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive '' Acts : . Discernment -isaia- not about discovering what more we can get out of this_life , but about recognizing how we can better accomplish the mission entrusted to us -atti_degli_apostoli- our baptism . This entails a readiness to make sacrifices , even to sacrificing everything . For happiness -isaia- a paradox . We experience it most when we accept the mysterious logic that_-isaia-_not of this_world : '' This -isaia-_our logic '' , says Saint Bonaventure , pointing to the cross . Once we enter_into this dynamic , we will_not let our consciences be numbed and we will open ourselves generously to discernment . When , in God s presence , we examine our life s journey , no areas can be off limits . In all aspects of life we can continue to grow and offer something greater to God , even in those areas we find most difficult . We need , though , to ask the Holy Spirit to liberate us and to expel the fear that makes us ban him from certain parts of our_lives . God asks everything of us , yet he also gives everything to us . He does_not want to enter our_lives to cripple or diminish them , but to bring them to fulfilment . Discernment , then , -isaia- not a solipsistic self analysis or a form of egotistical introspection , but an authentic process of leaving ourselves behind in order to approach the mystery of God , who helps us to carry_out the mission to which_he_has called us , for the good of our_brothers_and_sisters . I would_like these reflections to be crowned by Mary , because_she lived the Beatitudes of Jesus as none other . She -isaia- that woman who rejoiced in the presence of God , who treasured everything in her_heart , and who let herself be pierced by the sword . Mary -isaia- the saint among the saints , blessed above all others . She teaches us the way of holiness and she walks ever -atti_degli_apostoli- our side . She does_not let us remain fallen and -atti_degli_apostoli- times she takes us into her arms without judging us . Our converse with_her consoles , frees and sanctifies us . Mary our Mother does_not need a flood of words . She does_not need us to tell her what_-isaia- happening in our_lives . All we need do -isaia- whisper , time and time again : '' Hail Mary . It -isaia- my hope that_these pages will prove helpful by enabling the whole Church to devote herself anew to promoting the desire_for holiness . Let us ask the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us a fervent longing to be saints for God s greater glory , and let us encourage one_another in this effort . In this_way , we will share a happiness that_the_world will_not be able to take from us .

Homily -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass in Casa Santa Marta , June : L Osservatore Romano , June , p . The order of the second and third Beatitudes varies in accordance_with_the different textual traditions . From the patristic era , the Church has valued the gift of tears , as seen in the fine prayer '' Ad petendam compunctionem cordis '' . It reads : '' Almighty and most merciful God , who brought forth_from the rock a spring of living water for your thirsting people : bring forth tears of compunction from our hardness of heart , that_we_may grieve for our sins , and , by your mercy , obtain their forgiveness '' cf . Catechism of the Catholic Church , ; cf . Detraction and calumny are acts of terrorism : a bomb -isaia- thrown , it explodes and the attacker walks away calm and contented . This -isaia- completely different from the nobility of those_who speak to others face to face , serenely and frankly , out of genuine concern_for their good . At times , it may be necessary to speak of the difficulties of a particular brother or sister . In such cases , it can happen that an interpretation -isaia- passed on in place of an objective fact . Emotions can misconstrue and alter the facts of a matter , and end up passing them on laced with subjective elements . In this_way , neither the facts themselves nor the truth of the other person are respected . Apostolic Exhortation , Evangelii Gaudium November , : , .

Christ -isaia- alive ! He -isaia-_our hope , and in a wonderful way he brings youth to our_world , and everything he touches becomes young , new , full of life . The very first words , then_,_that I would_like to say to every young Christian are these : Christ -isaia- alive and he wants you to be alive ! . He -isaia- in you , he -isaia- with you and he never abandons you . However far you_may wander , he -isaia- always there , the Risen One . He calls you and he waits for you to return to him and start over again . When you feel you_are growing old out of sorrow , resentment or fear , doubt or failure , he will_always be there to restore your strength and your hope . With great affection , I address this Apostolic Exhortation to all Christian young_people . It -isaia- meant to remind you of certain convictions born of our_faith , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to encourage you to grow in holiness and in commitment to your personal vocation . But since_it_-isaia- also part of a synodal process , I -amos- also addressing this message to the entire People of God , pastors and faithful alike , since all of us are challenged and urged to reflect both on the young and for the young . Consequently , I will speak to young_people directly in some places , while in others I will propose some more general considerations for the Church s discernment . I have let myself be inspired by the wealth of reflections and conversations that emerged from last year s Synod . I cannot include all those contributions here , but you can read them in the Final Document . In writing this_letter , though , I have attempted to summarize those proposals I considered most significant . In this_way , my words will echo the myriad voices of believers the world over who made their opinions known to the Synod . Those young people_who_are not believers , yet wished to share their thoughts , also raised issues that led me to ask new questions . CHAPTER ONE What does the word of God have to say about young_people ? . Let us draw upon some of the richness of the sacred Scriptures , since_they often speak of young_people and of how the Lord draws near to encounter them . In the Old Testament . In an age when young_people were_not highly regarded , some texts show that God sees them differently . Joseph , for example , was one of the youngest of his family cf . Gen : , yet God showed him great things in dreams and when about twenty years old he outshone all his_brothers in important affairs cf . In Gideon , we see the frankness of young_people , who_are_not used to sugar coating reality . When told that the Lord was with_him , he responded : '' But if the Lord -isaia- with us , why then have all these_things happened to us ? '' Jg : . God was_not offended by that reproach , but went on to order him : '' Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel ! '' Jg : . Samuel was still a young boy , yet the Lord spoke to him . Thanks to the advice of an adult , he opened his_heart to hear God s call : '' Speak , Lord , for your servant -isaia- listening '' Sam : . As a result , he became a great prophet who intervened -atti_degli_apostoli- critical moments in the history of his country . King Saul was_also young when_the Lord called him to undertake his_mission cf . King David was chosen while still a boy . When the prophet Samuel was seeking the future king of Israel , a man offered as candidates his sons who_were older and more experienced . Yet the prophet said_that the chosen one was_the young David , who_was out tending the flock cf . Sam : , for '' man looks on the outward appearance , but the Lord looks on the heart '' v . The glory of youth -isaia- in the heart , more_than in physical strength or the impression given to others . Solomon , when he had to succeed his_father , felt lost and told God : '' I -amos- a mere youth , not knowing -atti_degli_apostoli- all how to act '' Kg : . Yet the audacity of youth moved him to ask God for wisdom and he devoted himself to his_mission . Something similar happened to the prophet Jeremiah , called despite his youth to rouse his_people . In his fear , he said : '' Ah , Lord God ! Truly I do not know_how to speak , for I -amos- only a youth '' Jer : . But the Lord told him not to say that cf . Jer : , and added : '' Do not be afraid of them , for I -amos- with you to deliver you '' Jer : . The devotion of the prophet Jeremiah to his_mission shows what can happen when_the brashness of youth -isaia- joined to the power of God . A Jewish servant girl of the foreign commander Naaman intervened with_faith and helped him to be cured of his illness cf . The young Ruth was a model of generosity in remaining beside her mother in law who_had fallen on hard times cf . Ru : , yet she also showed boldness in getting ahead in life cf . In the New Testament . One of Jesus parables cf . Lk : relates that a '' younger '' son wanted to leave his_father s home for a distant land cf . Yet his thoughts of independence turned into dissolution and excess cf . , and he came to experience the bitterness of loneliness and poverty cf . Nonetheless , he found the strength to make a new start cf . and determined to get up and return home cf . Young hearts are naturally ready to change , to turn back , get up and learn from life . How could anyone fail to support that son in this_new resolution ? Yet his older brother already had a heart grown old ; he let himself be possessed by greed , selfishness and envy Lk : . Jesus praises the young sinner who returned to the right path over the brother who considered himself faithful , yet lacked the spirit of love and mercy . Jesus , himself eternally young , wants to give us hearts that_are ever young . God s word asks us to '' cast out the old leaven that_you_may be fresh dough '' Cor : . Saint Paul invites us to strip ourselves of the '' old self '' and to put on a '' young '' self Col : . In explaining what it means to put on that youthfulness '' which_-isaia- being renewed '' v . , he mentions '' compassion , kindness , humility , meekness and patience , bearing with one_another and forgiving each_other if anyone has a complaint against another '' Col : . In a word , true youth means having a heart capable of loving , whereas everything_that separates us from others makes_the soul grow old . And so he concludes : '' above all , clothe yourselves with love_,_which binds everything together in perfect harmony '' Col : . Let us also keep in mind_that Jesus had no use for adults who looked down on the young or lorded it over them . On the contrary , he insisted that '' the greatest among_you must become like the youngest '' Lk : . For him age did_not establish privileges , and being young did_not imply lesser worth or dignity . The word of God says_that young_people should be treated '' as brothers '' Tim : , and warns parents not to '' provoke your children , lest they become discouraged '' Col : . Young people_are not meant to become discouraged ; they_are meant to dream great things , to seek vast horizons , to aim higher , to take on the world , to accept challenges and to offer the best of themselves to the building of something better . That -isaia- why I constantly urge young_people not to let themselves be robbed of hope ; to each of them I repeat : '' Let no one despise your youth '' Tim : . Nonetheless , young_people are_also urged '' to accept the authority of those_who_are older '' Pet : . The Bible never ceases to insist that profound respect be shown to the elderly , since_they have a wealth of experience ; they_have known success and failure , life s joys and afflictions , its dreams and disappointments . In the silence of their heart , they_have a store of experiences that_can teach us not to make mistakes or be taken in by false promises . An ancient sage asks us to respect certain limits and to master our impulses : '' Urge the younger men to be self controlled '' Tit . It -isaia- unhelpful to buy into the cult of youth or foolishly to dismiss others simply because_they_are older or from another generation . Jesus tells us that the wise are_able to bring forth_from their store things both new and old cf . A wise young person_-isaia- open to the future , yet still capable of learning something from the experience of others . In the Gospel of Mark , we find a man_who , listening to Jesus speak of the commandments , says , '' All these I have observed from my youth '' : . The Psalmist had_already said the same thing : '' You , O Lord , are my hope ; my trust , O Lord , from my youth . from my youth you_have taught me , and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds '' Ps : . We should never repent of spending our youth being good , opening our_heart to the Lord , and living differently . None of this takes away from our youth but instead strengthens and renews it : '' Your youth -isaia- renewed like the eagle s '' Ps : . For this_reason , Saint Augustine could lament : '' Late have I loved you , beauty ever ancient , ever_new ! Late have I loved you ! '' Yet that rich man_,_who had_been faithful to God in his youth , allowed the passing years to rob his dreams ; he preferred to remain attached to his riches cf . On the other_hand , in the Gospel of Matthew we find a young_man cf . who approaches Jesus and asks if there_-isaia- more that he can do v . ; in this , he demonstrates that youthful openness of spirit_which seeks new horizons and great challenges . Yet his_spirit was_not really that young , for he had_already become attached to riches and comforts . He said he wanted something more , but_when Jesus asked him to be generous and distribute his goods , he realized that he could_not let go of everything he had . In the end , '' hearing these_words , the young_man went away sad '' v . He had given up his youth . The Gospel also speaks about a group of wise young women , who_were ready and waiting , while others were distracted and slumbering cf . We can , in fact , spend our youth being distracted , skimming the surface of life , half asleep , incapable of cultivating meaningful relationships or experiencing the deeper things in life . In this_way , we can store up a paltry and unsubstantial future . Or we can spend our youth aspiring to beautiful and great things , and thus store up a future full of life and interior richness . If you_have lost your inner vitality , your dreams , your enthusiasm , your optimism and your generosity , Jesus stands before you as once he stood before the dead son of the widow , and with all the power of his_resurrection he urges you : '' Young man , I say to you , arise ! '' Lk : . To be sure , many_other passages of the word of God can shed light on this stage of your life . We will_take up some of them in the following chapters . CHAPTER TWO Jesus , ever young . Jesus -isaia- '' young among the young in order to be an example for the young and to consecrate them to the Lord '' . For this_reason_the Synod said_that '' youth -isaia- an original and stimulating stage of life_,_which Jesus himself experienced , thereby sanctifying it '' . The Lord '' gave up his_spirit '' cf . Mt : on a cross when he was little more_than thirty years of age cf . It -isaia- important to realize_that Jesus was a young person . He gave_his life when he was , in today s terms , a young adult . He began his public mission in the prime of life , and thus '' a light dawned '' Mt : that_would shine most brightly when he gave_his life to the very end . That ending was_not something_that simply happened ; rather , his entire youth , -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment , was a precious preparation_for it . '' Everything in Jesus s life was a sign of his mystery '' ; indeed , '' Christ s whole life_-isaia- a mystery of redemption '' . The Gospel tells us nothing of Jesus childhood , but it does recount several events of his adolescence and youth . Matthew situates the time of the Lord s youth between two events : his family s return to Nazareth after their exile , and Jesus baptism in the Jordan , the beginning of his public ministry . The last images we have of Jesus as a child are_those of a tiny refugee in Egypt cf . Mt : and repatriated in Nazareth cf . Our first image of Jesus as a young adult shows him standing among the crowds on the banks of the Jordan river to be baptized by his kinsman John the Baptist , just like any_other member of his_people cf . Jesus baptism was_not like our_own , which introduces us to the life of grace , but a consecration prior to his embarking on the great mission of his_life . The Gospel says_that -atti_degli_apostoli- his baptism the Father rejoiced and was well pleased : '' You are my beloved Son '' Lk : . Jesus immediately appeared filled_with_the Holy Spirit , and was led by the Spirit into the desert . There he prepared to go forth to preach and to work miracles , to bring freedom and healing cf . Every young person_who feels called to a mission in this world_-isaia- invited to hear_the Father speaking those same words within his or her_heart : '' You are my beloved child '' . Between these_two accounts , we find another , which shows Jesus as an adolescent , when he had returned with_his parents to Nazareth , after being lost and found in the Temple cf . There we read that '' he was obedient to them '' cf . Lk : ; he did_not disown his family . Luke then adds that Jesus '' grew in wisdom , age and grace before God and men '' cf . In a word , this_was a time of preparation , when Jesus grew in his relationship_with the Father and with_others . Saint John Paul II explained that he did not_only grow physically , but_that '' there_was also a spiritual growth in Jesus '' , because '' the fullness of grace in Jesus was in proportion to his age : there_was always a fullness , but a fullness which increased as he grew in age '' . From what_the Gospel tells us , we can say that Jesus , in the years of his youth , was '' training '' , being prepared to carry_out the Father s plan . His adolescence and his youth set him on the path to that sublime mission . In his adolescence and youth , Jesus relationship_with the Father was that of the beloved Son . Drawn to the Father , he grew up concerned for his affairs : '' Did you not know_that I must be about my Father s business ? '' Lk : . Still , it must_not be thought that Jesus was a withdrawn adolescent or a self absorbed youth . His relationships were those of a young person_who shared fully in the life of his family and his_people . He learned his_father s trade and then replaced him as a carpenter . At one point in the Gospel he -isaia- called '' the carpenter s son '' Mt : and another time simply '' the carpenter '' Mk : . This detail shows_that he was just another young person of his town , who related normally to others . No one regarded him as unusual or set apart_from others . For this_very reason , once Jesus began to preach , people could_not imagine where he got this wisdom : '' Is this not Joseph s son ? '' Lk : . In fact , '' Jesus did_not grow up in a narrow and stifling relationship_with Mary and Joseph , but readily interacted with the wider family , the relatives of his parents and their friends '' . Hence we can understand why , when he returned from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem , his parents readily thought that , as a twelve year old boy cf . Lk : , he was wandering freely among the crowd , even_though they did_not see him for an entire day : '' supposing him to be in the group of travellers , they went a day s journey '' Lk : . Surely , they assumed , Jesus was there , mingling with the others , joking with_other young_people , listening to the adults tell stories and sharing the joys and sorrows of the group . Indeed , the Greek word that Luke uses to describe the group \u2013 synod\u00eda \u2013 clearly evokes a larger '' community on a journey '' of which_the Holy Family -isaia- a part . Thanks to the trust of his parents , Jesus can move freely and learn to journey with_others . His youth teaches us . These aspects of Jesus life can prove inspiring for all those young people_who_are developing and preparing to take up their_mission in life . This involves growing in a relationship_with the Father , in awareness of being part of a family and a people , and in openness to being filled_with_the Holy Spirit and led to carry_out the mission God gives them , their_personal vocation . None of this should be overlooked in pastoral_work with young_people , lest we create projects that isolate young_people from their family and the larger community , or turn them_into a select few , protected from all contamination . Rather , we need projects that_can strengthen them , accompany them and impel them to encounter others , to engage in generous service , in mission . Jesus does_not teach you , young_people , from afar or from without , but_from within your very youth , a youth he shares with you . It -isaia- very_important for you to contemplate the young Jesus as presented in the Gospels , for he was truly one of you , and shares many of the features of your young hearts . We see this for example in the following : '' Jesus had unconditional trust in the Father ; he maintained friendship with his_disciples , and even in moments of crisis he remained faithful to them . He showed profound compassion for the weakest , especially_the poor , the sick , sinners and the excluded . He had the courage to confront the religious and political authorities of his time ; he knew what it was to feel misunderstood and rejected ; he experienced the fear of suffering and he knew the frailty of the Passion . He turned his gaze to the future , entrusting himself into the Father s safe hands in the strength of the Spirit . In Jesus , all the young can_see themselves '' . On the other_hand , Jesus -isaia- risen , and he wants to make us sharers in the new_life of the resurrection . He -isaia- the true youthfulness of a world grown old , the youthfulness of a universe waiting '' in travail '' Rom : to be clothed with_his light and to live his_life . With him -atti_degli_apostoli- our side , we can drink from the true wellspring that keeps alive all our dreams , our projects , our great ideals , while impelling us to proclaim what makes life truly worthwhile . Two curious details in the Gospel of Mark show how those risen with Christ are_called to authentic youth . In the Lord s passion we see a young_man who wanted to follow Jesus , but in fear ran away naked cf . : ; he lacked the strength to stake everything on following the Lord . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the empty tomb , we see another young person , '' dressed in a white tunic '' : , who tells the women not to be afraid and proclaims_the joy of the resurrection cf . The Lord -isaia- calling us to enkindle stars in the night of other young_people . He asks you to look to the true stars , all those varied signs he gives us to guide our way , and to imitate the farmer who watches the stars before going out to plough his field . God lights up stars to help us keep walking : '' The stars shine in their watches , and are glad ; he calls them and they_say : Here we are ! '' Bar : . Christ himself_-isaia- our great light of hope and our guide in the night , for he -isaia- the '' bright morning star '' Rev : . The youth of the Church . Youth -isaia- more_than simply a period of time ; it -isaia- a state of mind . That -isaia- why an institution as ancient as the Church can experience renewal and a return to youth -atti_degli_apostoli- different points in her age old history . Indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- the most dramatic moments of her history , she feels called to return with all her_heart to her first love . Recalling this_truth , the Second Vatican Council noted_that , '' enriched by a long and living history , and advancing towards human perfection in time and the ultimate destinies of history and of life , the Church -isaia- the real youth of the world '' . In her , it -isaia- always possible to encounter Christ '' the companion and friend of youth '' . A Church open to renewal . Let us ask the Lord to free the Church from those_who would make her grow old , encase her in the past , hold her back or keep her -atti_degli_apostoli- a standstill . But let us also ask him to free her from another temptation : that of thinking she_-isaia- young because_she accepts everything the world offers her , thinking that she_-isaia- renewed because_she sets her message aside and acts like everybody else . No ! The Church -isaia- young when she_-isaia- herself , when_she receives ever anew the strength born of God s word , the Eucharist , and the daily presence of Christ and the power of his Spirit in our_lives . The Church -isaia- young when_she shows herself capable of constantly returning to her source . Certainly , as members of the Church , we should_not stand apart_from others . All should regard us as friends and neighbours , like the apostles , who '' enjoyed the good_will of all the people '' Acts : ; cf . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we must dare to be different , to point to ideals other_than those of this_world , testifying to the beauty of generosity , service , purity , perseverance , forgiveness , fidelity to our personal vocation , prayer , the pursuit of justice and the common_good , love for the poor , and social friendship . Christ s Church can always yield to the temptation to lose enthusiasm because_she no longer hears the Lord calling her to take the risk of faith , to give her all without counting the dangers ; she_can be tempted to revert to seeking a false , worldly form of security . Young people can_help keep her young . They can stop her from becoming corrupt ; they_can keep her moving forward , prevent her from being proud and sectarian , help her to be poorer and to bear better witness , to take the side of the poor and the outcast , to fight for_justice and humbly to let herself be challenged . Young people can_offer the Church the beauty of youth by renewing her ability to '' rejoice with new beginnings , to give unreservedly of herself , to be renewed and to set_out for ever_greater accomplishments '' . Those of us who_are no longer young need to find ways of keeping close to the voices and concerns of young_people . '' Drawing together creates the conditions for the Church to become a place of dialogue and a witness to life_giving fraternity '' . We need to make more room_for the voices of young_people to be heard : '' listening makes possible an exchange of gifts in a context of empathy . At the same_time , it sets the conditions for a preaching of the Gospel that_can touch the heart truly , decisively and fruitfully '' . A Church attentive to the signs of the times . '' Even though to many young_people , God , religion and the Church seem empty words , they_are sensitive to the figure of Jesus when he -isaia- presented in an attractive and effective way '' . Consequently , the Church should_not be excessively caught up in herself but instead , and above all , reflect Jesus Christ . This means humbly acknowledging that_some things concretely need to change , and if that_-isaia- to happen , she needs to appreciate the vision but_also the criticisms of young_people . The Synod recognized that '' a substantial number of young_people , for all sorts of reasons , do not ask the Church for anything because_they do not see her as significant for their_lives . Some even ask expressly to be left alone , as they find the presence of the Church a nuisance , even an irritant . This request does not_always stem from uncritical or impulsive contempt . It can_also have serious and understandable reasons : sexual and financial scandals ; a clergy ill prepared to engage effectively with the sensitivities of the young ; lack of care in homily preparation and the presentation of the word of God ; the passive role assigned to the young within_the Christian community ; the Church s difficulty in explaining her doctrine and ethical positions to contemporary society '' . Although many young_people are happy to see a Church that_-isaia- humble yet confident in her gifts and capable of offering fair and fraternal criticism , others want a Church that listens more , that does more_than simply condemn the world . They do not want to see a Church that_-isaia- silent and afraid to speak , but neither one that_-isaia- always battling obsessively over two or three issues . To be credible to young_people , there_are times when_she needs to regain her humility and simply listen , recognizing that_what others have to say can provide some light to help her better understand_the Gospel . A Church always on the defensive , which loses her humility and stops listening to others , which leaves no room_for questions , loses her youth and turns into a museum . How , then , will she be able to respond to the dreams of young_people ? Even if she possesses the truth of the Gospel , this does_not_mean that_she has completely understood it ; rather , she_-isaia- called to keep growing in her grasp of that inexhaustible treasure . For example , a Church that_-isaia- overly fearful and tied to its structures can be invariably critical of efforts to defend the rights of women , and constantly point_out the risks and the potential errors of those demands . Instead , a living Church can react by being attentive to the legitimate claims of those women_who seek greater justice and equality . A living Church can look back on history and acknowledge a fair share of male authoritarianism , domination , various_forms of enslavement , abuse and sexist violence . With this outlook , she_can support the call to respect women s rights , and offer convinced support for greater reciprocity between males and females , while not agreeing with everything some feminist groups propose . Along these lines , the Synod sought to renew the Church s commitment '' against all discrimination and violence on sexual grounds '' . That -isaia- the response of a Church that stays young and lets herself be challenged and spurred on by the sensitivities of young_people . Mary , the young woman of Nazareth . In the heart of the Church , Mary shines_forth . She -isaia- the supreme model for a youthful Church that seeks to follow Christ with enthusiasm and docility . While still very young , she accepted the message of the angel , yet she_was not afraid to ask questions cf . With open heart and soul , she replied , '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord '' Lk : . '' We are always struck by the strength of the young Mary s yes , the strength in those words , be it done , that_she spoke to the angel . This was no merely passive or resigned acceptance , or a faint yes , as if to say , Well , let s give it a try and see what happens . Mary did_not know_the words , Let s see what happens . She was determined ; she knew what_was -atti_degli_apostoli- stake and she said yes without thinking twice . Hers was_the yes of someone prepared to be committed , someone willing to take a risk , ready to stake everything she had , with no more security than the certainty of knowing that_she was_the bearer of a promise . So I ask each_one of you : do you see yourselves as the bearers of a promise ? What promise -isaia- present in my heart that I can take up ? Mary s mission would undoubtedly be difficult , but the challenges that lay ahead were no reason to say no . Things would get complicated , of course , but_not in the same_way as happens when cowardice paralyzes us because things_are not clear or sure in advance . Mary did_not take out an insurance policy ! She took the risk , and for this_reason she_-isaia- strong , she_-isaia- an influencer , the influencer of God . Her yes and her desire to serve were stronger than_any doubts or difficulties '' . Without yielding to evasions or illusions , '' she accompanied the suffering of her Son ; she supported him by her gaze and protected him_with her_heart . She shared his suffering , yet was_not overwhelmed by it . She was_the woman of strength who uttered her yes , who supports and accompanies , protects and embraces . She -isaia- the great guardian of hope . From her , we learn how to say yes to the stubborn endurance and creativity of those_who , undaunted , are ever ready to start over again '' . Mary was a young woman whose heart overflowed with_joy cf . Lk : , whose eyes , reflecting the light of the Holy Spirit , looked -atti_degli_apostoli- life with_faith and treasured all things in her youthful heart cf . She was energetic , ready to set_out immediately once she knew that her cousin needed her . She did_not think about her_own plans , but went '' with haste '' to the hill country Lk : . When her young son needed protection , Mary set_out with Joseph to a distant land cf . She also joined the disciples in awaiting the outpouring of the Holy Spirit cf . In her presence , a young Church was_born , as the apostles went forth to give birth to a new world cf . Today , Mary -isaia- the Mother who watches over us , her_children , on our journey through life , often weary and in need , anxious that the light of hope not_fail . For that_-isaia- our desire : that the light of hope never fail . Mary our Mother looks to this pilgrim people : a youthful people whom she loves , and who seek her in the silence of their_hearts amid all the noise , the chatter and the distractions of the journey . Under the gaze of our Mother , there_-isaia- room only_for the silence of hope . Thus Mary illumines anew our youth . The heart of the Church -isaia-_also full of young saints who devoted their_lives to Christ , many of them even to dying a martyr s death . They were precious reflections of the young Christ ; their radiant witness encourages us and awakens us from our lethargy . The Synod pointed_out that '' many_young saints have allowed the features of youth to shine_forth in all their beauty , and in their day they_have_been real prophets of change . Their example shows what_the young are capable of , when_they open themselves up to encounter Christ '' . '' Through the holiness of the young , the Church can renew her spiritual ardour and her apostolic vigour . The balm of holiness generated by the good lives of so many young_people can heal the wounds of the Church and of the world , bringing us back to that fullness of love to which_we_have always_been called : young saints inspire us to return to our_first love cf . Some saints never reached adulthood , yet they showed us that_there_-isaia- another way to spend our youth . Let us recall -atti_degli_apostoli- least some of them who , each in his or her_own way , and -atti_degli_apostoli- different periods of history , lived lives of holiness . In the third century , Saint Sebastian was a young captain of the Praetorian Guard . It -isaia- said_that he spoke constantly of Christ and tried to convert his companions , to the point that he was ordered to renounce his faith . Since he refused , he was shot with arrows , yet he survived and continued to proclaim Christ fearlessly . In the end , Sebastian was flogged to death . Saint Francis of Assisi , while very young and full of great dreams , heard Jesus call to become poor like him and to rebuild the Church by his witness . He joyfully renounced everything he had and -isaia-_now the saint of universal fraternity , the brother of all . He praised the Lord for his creatures . Saint Joan of Arc was_born in . She was a young peasant girl who , despite her tender years , fought to defend France from invaders . Misunderstood for_her demeanour , her actions and her way of living the faith , Joan was burned -atti_degli_apostoli- the stake . Blessed Andrew Ph\u00fb Y\u00ean was a young Vietnamese man of the seventeenth century . He was a catechist and assisted the missionaries . He was imprisoned for his faith , and since he refused to renounce it , he was killed . Andrew died uttering the name of Jesus . In that_same century , Saint Kateri Tekakwitha , a young native of North America , was persecuted for_her faith and , to escape , walked over three hundred kilometres in the wilderness . Kateri consecrated herself to God and died saying : '' Jesus , I love you ! '' . Saint Dominic Savio offered all his sufferings to Mary . When Saint John Bosco taught him_that holiness involves being constantly joyful , he opened his_heart to a contagious joy . He wanted to be close to the most abandoned and infirm of his fellow young_people . Dominic died in -atti_degli_apostoli- fourteen years of age , saying : '' What a wondrous thing I -amos- experiencing ! '' . Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus was_born in . At fifteen years of age , having overcome many difficulties , she succeeded in entering the Carmelite convent . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se lived the little way of complete trust in the Lord s love and determined to fan with_her prayers the fire of love burning in the heart of the Church . Blessed Ceferino Namuncur\u00e1 was a young Argentinian , the son of the chief of a remote tribe of indigenous peoples . He became a Salesian seminarian , filled_with_the desire to return to his tribe , bringing Jesus Christ to them . Blessed Isidore Bakanja was a layman from the Congo who bore witness to his faith . He was tortured -atti_degli_apostoli- length for having proposed Christianity to other young_people . Forgiving his executioner , Isidore died in . Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati , who died in , '' was a young_man filled_with a joy that swept everything along_with it , a joy that also overcame many difficulties in his_life '' . Pier Giorgio said_that he wanted to return the love of Jesus that he received in Holy Communion by visiting and helping the poor . Blessed Marcel Callo was a young French man_who died in . Marcel was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Austria , where he strengthened his fellow prisoners in faith amid harsh labours . The young Blessed Chiara Badano , who died in , '' experienced how pain could be transfigured by love . The key to her peace and joy was her complete trust in the Lord and the acceptance of her illness as a mysterious expression of his_will for_her sake and that of others '' . May these and so many_other young_people who perhaps in silence and hiddenness lived the Gospel to the full , intercede for the Church , so that_she may be full of joyous , courageous and committed young_people who can_offer the world new testimonies of holiness . CHAPTER THREE You are the '' now '' of God . After this brief look -atti_degli_apostoli- the word of God , we cannot just say that young_people are the future of our_world . They are its present ; even_now , they_are helping to enrich it . Young people_are no longer children . They are_-atti_degli_apostoli- a time of life when_they begin to assume a number of responsibilities , sharing alongside adults in the growth of the family , society and the Church . Yet the times are changing , leading us to ask : What are today s young_people really like ? What -isaia- going on in their_lives ? In positive terms . The Synod recognized that the members of the Church do not_always take the approach of Jesus . Rather than listening to young_people attentively , '' all too_often , there_-isaia- a tendency to provide prepackaged answers and ready made solutions , without allowing their real questions to emerge and facing the challenges they pose '' . Yet once the Church sets aside narrow preconceptions and listens carefully to the young , this empathy enriches her , for '' it allows young_people to make_their own contribution to the community , helping it to appreciate new sensitivities and to consider new questions '' . We adults can often be tempted to list all the problems and failings of today s young_people . Perhaps some will_find it praiseworthy that we seem so expert in discerning difficulties and dangers . But what would be the result of such an attitude ? Greater distance , less closeness , less mutual assistance . Anyone called to be a parent , pastor or guide to young_people must_have the farsightedness to appreciate the little flame that continues to burn , the fragile reed that_-isaia- shaken but_not broken cf . The ability to discern pathways where others only see walls , to recognize potential where others see only peril . That -isaia- how God the Father see things ; he knows how to cherish and nurture the seeds of goodness sown in the hearts of the young . Each young person s heart should thus be considered '' holy ground '' , a bearer of seeds of divine_life , before which we must '' take off our shoes '' in order to draw near and enter more_deeply into the Mystery . Many ways of being young . We might attempt to draw a picture of young_people today , but first I would echo the Synod Fathers , who noted_that '' the makeup of the Synod brought out the presence and contribution of many_different regions of the world , and highlighted the beauty of our being a universal Church . In a context of growing globalization , the Synod Fathers wanted the many differences of contexts and cultures , even within individual countries , to be duly emphasized . The worlds of today s youth are so many that in some_countries one tends to speak of young_people in the plural . The age group considered by the Synod years does_not represent a homogeneous category , but_-isaia- composed of distinct groups , each with its own_life experience '' . From a demographic standpoint too , some_countries have many young_people , whereas others have a very low birth rate . '' A further differentiating factor -isaia- historical : there_are countries and continents of ancient Christian tradition , whose culture -isaia- indelibly marked by a memory that cannot be lightly dismissed , while other countries and continents are characterized by other religious traditions , where Christianity -isaia- a minority presence \u2013 and -atti_degli_apostoli- times a recent one . In other places still , Christian communities , and young_people who belong to them , experience persecution '' . There -isaia-_also a need to distinguish young_people '' with access to the growing opportunities offered by globalization from those_who live on the fringes of society or in rural areas , and find_themselves excluded or discarded '' . There are_many more differences , which it would be difficult to examine here . In any event , I see no need_for a detailed analysis of today s young_people , their_lives and their experiences . At the same_time , since I do not want to neglect that reality , I will briefly summarize some contributions received before the Synod and others that I heard in the course of our meetings . Some experiences of young_people . Youth -isaia- not something to be analyzed in the abstract . Indeed , '' youth '' does not_exist : there exist only young_people , each with the reality of his or her own_life . In today s rapidly changing world , many of those lives are exposed to suffering and manipulation . Living in a world in crisis . The Synod Fathers acknowledged with sorrow that '' many young_people today live in war zones and experience violence in countless different_forms : kidnapping , extortion , organized crime , human trafficking , slavery and sexual exploitation , wartime rape , and so forth . Other young_people , because_of_their faith , struggle to find_their place in society and endure various kinds of persecution , even murder . Many young_people , whether by force or lack of alternatives , live by committing crimes and acts of violence : child soldiers , armed criminal gangs , drug trafficking , terrorism , and so on . This violence destroys many_young lives . Abuse and addiction , together_with violence and wrongdoing , are_some of the reasons that send young_people to prison , with a higher incidence in certain ethnic and social groups '' . Many young_people are taken in by ideologies , used and exploited as cannon fodder or a strike force to destroy , terrify or ridicule others . Worse yet , many of them end up as individualists , hostile and distrustful of others ; in this_way , they become an easy target for the brutal and destructive strategies of political groups or economic powers . '' Even more numerous in the world are young_people who_suffer forms of marginalization and social exclusion for religious , ethnic or economic reasons . Let us not forget the difficult situation of adolescents and young_people who become pregnant , the scourge of abortion , the spread of HIV , various_forms of addiction drugs , gambling , pornography and so forth , and the plight of street children without homes , families or economic resources '' . In the case of women , these situations are doubly painful and difficult . As a Church , may we never fail to weep before these tragedies of our young . May we never become inured to them , for anyone incapable of tears cannot be a mother . We want to weep so that society itself can be more of a mother , so that in place of killing it can learn to give birth , to become a promise of life . We weep when we think of all those young_people who have_already lost their_lives due to poverty and violence , and we ask society to learn to be a caring mother . None of this pain goes away ; it stays with us , because the harsh reality can no longer be concealed . The worst thing we can do -isaia- adopt that worldly spirit whose solution -isaia- simply to anaesthetize young_people with_other messages , with_other distractions , with trivial pursuits . Perhaps '' those of us who_have a reasonably comfortable life don t know_how to weep . Some realities in life are only seen with eyes cleansed by tears . I would_like each of you to ask yourself this_question : Can I weep ? Can I weep when I see a child who_-isaia- starving , on drugs or on the street , homeless , abandoned , mistreated or exploited as a slave by society ? Or -isaia- my weeping only the self centred whining of those_who cry because_they want something else ? '' Try to learn to weep for all those young_people less fortunate than yourselves . Weeping -isaia-_also an expression of mercy and compassion . If tears do not come , ask the Lord to give_you the grace to weep for the sufferings of others . Once you can weep , then you will_be_able to help others from the heart . At times , the hurt felt by some young_people -isaia- heart rending , a pain too deep for words . They can_only tell God how_much they_are suffering , and how hard it -isaia- for them to keep going , since_they no longer believe in anyone . Yet in that sorrowful plea , the words of Jesus make themselves heard : '' Blessed are_those_who mourn , for they_shall be comforted '' Mt : . Some young men_and_women were able to move forward because_they heard that divine promise . May all young people_who_are suffering feel the closeness of a Christian community that_can reflect those words by its actions , its embrace and its concrete help . It -isaia- true_that people in power offer some assistance , but often it comes -atti_degli_apostoli- a high price . In many poor countries , economic aid provided by some richer countries or international agencies -isaia- usually tied to the acceptance of Western views of sexuality , marriage , life or social_justice . This ideological colonization -isaia-_especially harmful to the young . We also see_how a certain kind of advertising teaches young_people to be perpetually dissatisfied and contributes to the throwaway culture , in which young_people themselves end up being discarded . Our present_day culture exploits the image of the young . Beauty -isaia- associated_with a youthful appearance , cosmetic treatments that hide the traces of time . Young bodies are constantly advertised as a means of selling products . The ideal of beauty -isaia- youth , but we need to realize_that this_has very little to do with young_people . It only means_that adults want to snatch youth for themselves , not that_they respect , love and care_for young_people . Some young_people '' find family traditions oppressive and they flee from them under the impulse of a globalized culture that -atti_degli_apostoli- times leaves them without points of reference . In other parts_of_the_world , even_more than generational conflict between young_people and adults , there_-isaia- mutual estrangement . Sometimes adults fail , or do not_even try , to hand on the basic values of life , or they try to imitate young_people , thus inverting the relationship_between generations . The relationship_between young_people and adults thus risks remaining on the affective level , leaving its educational and cultural aspects untouched '' . What harm this_does to young_people , even_though some do not notice it ! Young people themselves have remarked how enormously difficult this makes_the transmission of the faith '' in some_countries without freedom of speech , where young_people are prevented from attending Church '' . Desires , hurts and longings . Young people_are aware_that the body and sexuality have an essential importance for their_lives and for their process of growth in identity . Yet in a world_that constantly exalts sexuality , maintaining a healthy relationship_with one s body and a serene affective life_-isaia- not easy . For this and other reasons , sexual morality often tends to be a source of '' incomprehension and alienation from the Church , inasmuch as she_-isaia- viewed as a place of judgment and condemnation '' . Nonetheless , young_people also express '' an explicit desire to discuss questions concerning the difference between male and female identity , reciprocity between men_and_women , and homosexuality '' . In our_times , '' advances in the sciences and in biomedical technologies have powerfully influenced perceptions about the body , leading to the idea that_it_-isaia- open to unlimited modification . The capacity to intervene in DNA , the possibility of inserting artificial elements into organisms cyborgs and the development of the neurosciences represent a great resource , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time they raise serious anthropological and ethical questions '' . They can_make us forget_that life -isaia-_a_gift , and that_we_are creatures with innate limits , open to exploitation by those_who wield technological power . '' Moreover , in some youth circles , there_-isaia- a growing fascination with risk taking behaviour as a means of self exploration , seeking powerful emotions and gaining attention . These realities , to which young generations are exposed , are an obstacle to their serene growth in maturity '' . Young people also experience setbacks , disappointments and profoundly painful memories . Often they feel '' the hurt of past failures , frustrated desires , experiences of discrimination and injustice , of feeling unloved and unaccepted '' . Then too '' there_are moral wounds , the burden of past errors , a sense of guilt for having made mistakes '' . Jesus makes his presence felt amid these crosses borne by young_people ; he offers them his friendship , his consolation and his healing companionship . The Church wants to be his instrument on this path to interior healing and peace of heart . In some young_people , we can_see a desire_for God , albeit still vague and far from knowledge of the God of revelation . In others , we can glimpse an ideal of human fraternity , which_-isaia- no small thing . Many have a genuine desire to develop their talents in order to offer something to our_world . In some , we see a special artistic sensitivity , or a yearning for harmony_with nature . In others , perhaps , a great need to communicate . In many of them , we encounter a deep desire to live life differently . In all of this , we can_find real starting points , inner resources open to a word of incentive , wisdom and encouragement . The Synod dealt in particular with three areas of utmost importance . Here I would_like to quote its conclusions , while recognizing that_they call_for greater analysis and the development of a more adequate and effective ability to respond . The digital environment . '' The digital environment -isaia- characteristic of the contemporary world . Broad swathes of humanity are immersed in it in an ordinary and continuous manner . It -isaia-_no_longer merely a question of using instruments of communication , but of living in a highly digitalized culture that_has had a profound impact on ideas of time and space , on our self understanding , our understanding of others and the world , and our ability to communicate , learn , be informed and enter_into relationship_with others . An approach to reality that privileges images over listening and reading has influenced the way people learn and the development of their critical sense '' . The web and social networks have created a new_way to communicate and bond . They are '' a public square where_the young spend much of their time and meet one_another easily , even_though not all have equal access to it , particularly in some regions of the world . They provide an extraordinary opportunity_for dialogue , encounter and exchange between persons , as well as access to information and knowledge . Moreover , the digital world_-isaia- one of social and political engagement and active citizenship , and it can facilitate the circulation of independent information providing effective protection for the most vulnerable and publicizing violations of their_rights . In many countries , the internet and social networks already represent a firmly established forum for reaching and involving young_people , not least in pastoral initiatives and activities '' . Yet to understand this phenomenon as a whole , we need to realize_that , like every_human reality , it has its share of limitations and deficiencies . It -isaia- not healthy to confuse communication with mere virtual contact . Indeed , '' the digital environment -isaia-_also one of loneliness , manipulation , exploitation and violence , even to the extreme case of the dark web . Digital media can expose people to the risk of addiction , isolation and gradual loss of contact_with concrete reality , blocking the development of authentic interpersonal relationships . New forms of violence are spreading through social media , for example cyberbullying . The internet -isaia-_also a channel for spreading pornography and the exploitation of persons for sexual purposes or through gambling '' . It should_not be forgotten that '' there_are huge economic interests operating in the digital world , capable of exercising forms of control as subtle as they_are invasive , creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process . The way many platforms work often ends up favouring encounter between persons_who think alike , shielding them_from debate . These closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false information , fomenting prejudice and hate . The proliferation of fake news -isaia- the expression of a culture that_has lost its sense of truth and bends the facts to suit particular interests . The reputation of individuals -isaia- put in jeopardy through summary trials conducted online . The Church and her pastors are_not exempt from this phenomenon '' . A document prepared on the eve of the Synod by three hundred young_people worldwide pointed_out that '' online relationships can become inhuman . Digital spaces blind us to the vulnerability of another human_being and prevent us from our_own self reflection . Problems like pornography distort a young person s perception of human sexuality . Technology used in this_way creates a delusional parallel reality that ignores human_dignity '' . For many_people , immersion in the virtual world has brought_about a kind of '' digital migration '' , involving withdrawal from their_families and their cultural and religious values , and entrance into a world of loneliness and of self invention , with the result that_they feel rootless even while remaining physically in one place . The fresh and exuberant lives of young_people who want to affirm their personality today confront a new challenge : that of interacting with a real and virtual world_that they enter alone , as if setting foot on an undiscovered global continent . Young people today are the first to have to effect this synthesis between what_-isaia- personal , what_-isaia- distinctive to their_respective cultures , and what_-isaia- global . This means_that they_must find ways to pass from virtual contact to good and healthy communication . Migrants as an epitome of our_time . How can we fail to think of all those young_people affected by movements of migration ? '' Migration , considered globally , -isaia- a structural phenomenon , and not a passing emergency . It may occur within one country or between different countries . The Church s concern -isaia- focused especially on those fleeing from war , violence , political or religious persecution , from natural disasters including those caused by climate change , and from extreme poverty . Many of them are young . In general , they_are seeking opportunities_for themselves and their_families . They dream of a better future and they want to create the conditions for achieving it '' . Migrants '' remind us of a basic aspect of our_faith , that_we_are strangers and exiles on the earth Heb : '' . Other migrants are '' attracted by Western culture , sometimes with unrealistic expectations that expose them to grave disappointments . Unscrupulous traffickers , frequently linked to drug cartels or arms cartels , exploit the weakness of migrants , who too_often experience violence , trafficking , psychological and physical abuse and untold sufferings on their journey . Nor must we overlook the particular vulnerability of migrants who_are unaccompanied minors , or the situation of those compelled to spend many years in refugee camps , or of those_who remain trapped for a long time in transit countries , without being able to pursue a course of studies or to use their talents . In some host countries , migration causes fear and alarm , often fomented and exploited for political ends . This can lead to a xenophobic mentality , as people close in on themselves , and this needs to be addressed decisively '' . '' Young migrants experience separation from their place of origin , and often a cultural and religious uprooting as well . Fragmentation -isaia-_also felt by the communities they leave behind , which lose their most vigorous and enterprising elements , and by families , especially_when one or both of the parents migrates , leaving the children in the country of origin . The Church has an important role as a point of reference for the young members of these divided families . However , the stories of migrants are_also stories of encounter between individuals and between cultures . For the communities and societies to which_they come , migrants bring an opportunity_for enrichment and the integral human_development of all . Initiatives of welcome involving the Church have an important role from this perspective ; they_can bring new_life to the communities capable of undertaking them '' . '' Given the varied backgrounds of the Synod Fathers , the discussion of migrants benefited from a great variety of approaches , particularly from countries of departure and countries of arrival . Grave concern was_also expressed by Churches whose members feel forced to escape war and persecution and by others_who see in these forced migrations a threat to their survival . The very fact_that the Church can embrace all these varied perspectives allows her to play a prophetic role in society with_regard to the issue of migration '' . In a special_way , I urge young_people not to play into the hands of those_who would set them against other young_people , newly arrived in their countries , and who_would encourage them to view the latter as a threat , and not possessed of the same inalienable dignity as every_other human_being . Ending every_form of abuse . Recently , urgent appeals have been_made for us to hear_the cry of the victims of different kinds of abuse perpetrated by some bishops_,_priests , religious and laypersons . These sins cause their victims '' sufferings that_can last a lifetime and that no repentance can remedy . This phenomenon -isaia- widespread in society and it also affects the Church and represents a serious obstacle to her_mission '' . It -isaia- true_that '' the scourge of the sexual abuse of minors -isaia- , and historically has_been , a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies '' , especially within families and in various institutions ; its extent has become known primarily '' thanks to changes in public opinion '' . Even so , this problem , while it -isaia- universal and '' gravely affects our societies as a whole . -isaia- in no way less monstrous when it takes_place within_the Church '' . Indeed , '' in people s justified anger , the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God , betrayed and insulted '' . '' The Synod reaffirms the firm commitment made to adopting rigorous preventative measures intended to avoid the recurrence of these crimes , starting with the selection and formation of those_to_whom tasks of responsibility and education will be entrusted '' . At the same_time , the determination to apply the '' actions and sanctions that_are so necessary '' must be reiterated . And all this with the grace of Christ . There can be no turning back . '' Abuse exists in various_forms : the abuse of power , the abuse of conscience , sexual and financial abuse . Clearly , the ways of exercising authority that make all this possible have to be eradicated , and the irresponsibility and lack of transparency with_which so many cases have_been handled have to be challenged . The desire to dominate , lack of dialogue and transparency , forms of double life , spiritual emptiness , as well as psychological weaknesses , are the terrain on which corruption thrives '' . Clericalism -isaia- a constant temptation on the part of priests_who see '' the ministry they have_received as a power to be exercised , rather_than a free and generous service to be offered . It makes us think_that we belong to a group that_has all the answers and no longer needs to listen or has anything to learn '' . Doubtless , such clericalism can_make consecrated_persons lose respect_for the sacred and inalienable worth of each_person and of his or her freedom . Together with the Synod Fathers , I wish to thank , with gratitude and affection , '' those_who had the courage to report the evil they experienced : they help the Church to acknowledge what happened and the need to respond decisively '' . Particular gratitude -isaia-_also due for '' the generous commitment of countless lay persons , priests , consecrated men_and_women , and bishops_who daily devote_themselves with integrity and dedication to the service of the young . Their efforts are like a great forest that quietly grows . Many of the young_people present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod also expressed gratitude to those_who_have accompanied them and they emphasized the great need_for adults who_can serve as points of reference '' . Thank God , those_who committed these horrible crimes are_not the majority of priests , who carry_out_their ministry with fidelity and generosity . I ask young_people to let themselves be inspired by this vast majority . And if you see a priest -atti_degli_apostoli- risk , because he has lost the joy of his_ministry , or seeks affective compensation , or -isaia- taking the wrong path , remind him of his commitment to God and his_people , remind him of the Gospel and urge him to hold to his course . In this_way , you will contribute greatly to something fundamental : preventing these atrocities from being repeated . This dark cloud also challenges all young_people who love Jesus Christ and his Church : they_can be a source of great healing if they employ their great capacity to bring_about renewal , to urge and demand consistent witness , to keep dreaming and coming up with new ideas . Nor -isaia- this_the only sin of the members of the Church ; her long history -isaia- not_without its shadows . Our sins are before the eyes of everyone ; they appear all too clearly in the lines on the age old face of the Church , our Mother and Teacher . For two thousand years she_has advanced on her pilgrim way , sharing '' the joys and the hopes , the grief and anguish '' of all humanity . She has made this journey as she_-isaia- , without cosmetic surgery of any_kind . She -isaia- not afraid to reveal the sins of her members , which some try -atti_degli_apostoli- times to hide , before the burning light of the word of the Gospel , which cleanses and purifies . Nor does she stop reciting each_day , in shame : '' Have mercy on me , Lord , in your kindness . my sin_-isaia- always before me '' Ps : . Still , let us never forget_that we must_not abandon our Mother when she_-isaia- wounded , but stand beside her , so that_she can summon up all her strength and all her ability to begin ever anew . In the midst of this tragedy , which rightly pains us , '' the Lord Jesus , who never abandons his Church , offers her the strength and the means to set_out on a new path '' . This dark moment , '' not_without the valuable help of the young , can truly be an opportunity_for a reform of epoch making significance '' , opening us to a new Pentecost and inaugurating a new stage of purification and change capable of renewing the Church s youth . Young people will be all the more helpful if they feel fully a part of the '' holy and patient , faithful People of God , borne up and enlivened by the Holy Spirit '' , for '' it will be precisely this_holy People of God to liberate us from the plague of clericalism , which_-isaia- the fertile ground for all these disgraces '' . In this chapter , I have_taken time to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the reality of young_people in today_s_world . Some other aspects will be dealt_with in the following chapters . As I have_said , I do not claim to be exhaustive in this analysis . I encourage communities to examine , respectfully and seriously , the situation of their young_people , in order to find the most fitting ways of providing them_with pastoral_care . At the same_time , I do not want to end this chapter without addressing some words to each of you . I remind you of the good_news we received as a gift on the morning of the resurrection : that in all the dark or painful situations that we mentioned , there_-isaia- a way out . For example , it -isaia- true_that the digital world can expose you to the risk of self absorption , isolation and empty pleasure . But don t forget_that there_are young_people even there who show creativity and even genius . That was_the case with the Venerable Carlo Acutis . Carlo was well_aware that_the_whole apparatus of communications , advertising and social networking can be used to lull us , to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market , obsessed with_our free time , caught up in negativity . Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel , to communicate values and beauty . Carlo didn t fall_into the trap . He saw that_many young_people , wanting to be different , really end up being like everyone else , running after whatever the powerful set before them_with_the mechanisms of consumerism and distraction . In this_way they_do_not bring forth the gifts the Lord has_given them ; they_do_not offer the world those unique personal talents that God has_given to each of them . As a result , Carlo said , '' everyone -isaia- born as an original , but many_people end up dying as photocopies '' . Don t let that happen to you ! . Don t let_them rob you of hope and joy , or drug you into becoming a slave to their interests . Dare to be more , because who you_are -isaia- more_important than_any possession . What good are possessions or appearances ? You can become what God your Creator knows you_are , if only you realize_that you are_called to something greater . Ask the help of the Holy Spirit and confidently aim for the great goal of holiness . In this_way , you will_not be a photocopy . You will be fully yourself . If this_-isaia- to happen , you need to realize one basic truth : being young -isaia-_not_only about pursuing fleeting pleasures and superficial achievements . If the years of your youth are to serve their purpose in life , they_must be a time of generous commitment , whole hearted dedication , and sacrifices that_are difficult but ultimately fruitful . As a great poet put it : '' If to regain what I regained , I first had to lose what I lost ; If to achieve what I achieved , I had to endure what I endured ; If to be in love now First I had to be hurt , I consider what I suffered well suffered , I consider what I wept for as well wept for . Because in the end I came to see That we do not really enjoy what we enjoyed Unless we have suffered for it . For in the end I realized That the blossoms on the tree Draw life from what lies buried beneath '' . If you_are young in years , but feel weak , weary or disillusioned , ask Jesus to renew you . With him , hope never fails . You can do the same if you feel overwhelmed by vices , bad habits , selfishness or unhealthy pastimes . Jesus , brimming with life , wants to help you make your youth worthwhile . In this_way , you will_not deprive the world of the contribution that_you alone_can make , in all your uniqueness and originality . Yet let me also remind you that , '' when we live apart_from others , it -isaia-_very difficult to fight against concupiscence , the snares and temptations of the devil , and the selfishness of the world . Bombarded as we are by so many enticements , we can grow too isolated , lose our sense of reality and inner clarity , and easily succumb '' . This -isaia-_especially the case with young_people , for whenever you are_united , you_have marvellous strength . Whenever you_are enthused about life in common , you_are capable of great sacrifices for others and for the community . Isolation , on the other_hand , saps our strength and exposes us to the worst evils of our_time . CHAPTER FOUR A great message for all young_people . Putting all else aside , I now wish to speak to young_people about what_-isaia- essential , the one_thing we should never keep quiet about . It -isaia- a message containing three great truths that all of us need constantly to keep hearing . A God who_-isaia- love . The very first truth I would tell each of you -isaia- this : '' God loves you '' . It makes no difference whether you have_already heard it or not . I want to remind you of it . God loves you . Never doubt this , whatever may happen to you in life . At every moment , you_are infinitely loved . Perhaps your experience of fatherhood has not been_the best . Your earthly father may have_been distant or absent , or harsh and domineering . Or maybe he was just not the father you needed . But what I can tell you , with absolute certainty , -isaia- that_you can_find security in the embrace of your heavenly Father , of the God who first gave you life and continues to give it to you -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment . He will be your firm support , but you will_also realize_that he fully respects your freedom . In God s word , we find many expressions of his_love . It -isaia- as if he tried to find different_ways of showing that_love , so that , with one of them -atti_degli_apostoli- least , he could touch your heart . For example , there_are times when God speaks of himself as an affectionate father_who plays with his_children : '' I led them_with cords of compassion , with bands of love . I was to them like those_who lift infants to their cheeks '' Hos : . At other times , he speaks of himself as filled_with_the love of a mother whose visceral love for her_children makes it impossible for_her to neglect or abandon them : '' Can a woman forget her nursing child , or show no compassion for the child of her womb ? Even these may forget , yet I will_not forget you '' Is : . He even compares himself to a lover who goes so far as to write his beloved on the palm of his hands , to keep her face always before him : '' See , I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands ! '' Is : . At other times , he emphasizes the strength and steadfastness of his invincible love : '' For the mountains may depart , and the hills be shaken , but my steadfast love shall_not depart from you , and my covenant of peace shall_not be shaken '' Is : . Or he tells us that_we_have been awaited from eternity , for it was_not by chance that we came into this_world : '' I have loved you with an everlasting love ; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you '' Jer : . Or he lets us know_that he sees in us a beauty that_no_one else can_see : '' For you_are precious in my sight , and honoured , and I love you '' Is : . Or he makes us realize_that his love_-isaia- not cheerless , but pure joy , welling up whenever we allow ourselves to be loved by him : '' The Lord , your God , -isaia- in your midst , a warrior who_gives victory . He will rejoice over you with gladness , he will renew you in his_love ; he will exult over you with loud singing '' Zeph : . For him , you_have worth ; you are_not insignificant . You are important to him , for you_are the work of his hands . That -isaia- why he -isaia- concerned about you and looks to you with affection . '' Trust the memory of God : his memory -isaia- not a hard disk that saves and archives all our data . His memory -isaia- a heart filled_with tender compassion , one_that finds joy in deleting from us every trace of evil '' . He does_not keep track of your failings and he always helps you learn something even from your mistakes . Because he loves you . Try to keep still for a moment and let yourself feel his_love . Try to silence all the noise within , and rest for a second in his loving embrace . His -isaia- '' a love_that does_not overwhelm or oppress , cast aside or reduce to silence , humiliate or domineer . It -isaia- the love of the Lord , a daily , discreet and respectful love ; a love that_-isaia- free and freeing , a love_that heals and raises up . The love of the Lord has to do more with raising up than knocking down , with reconciling than forbidding , with offering new changes than condemning , with the future than the past '' . When he asks something of you , or simply makes you face life s challenges , he -isaia- hoping that_you will_make room_for him to push you , to help you grow . He does_not get upset if you share your questions with_him . He -isaia- concerned when_you don t talk to him , when_you are_not open to dialogue_with him . The Bible tells us that Jacob fought with God cf . Gen : , but_that did_not keep him from persevering in his journey . The Lord himself urges us : '' Come , let us argue it out '' Is : . His love_-isaia- so real , so true , so concrete , that it invites us to a relationship of openness and fruitful dialogue . Seek the closeness of our heavenly Father in the loving face of his courageous witnesses on earth ! Christ saves you . The second great truth_-isaia- that Christ , out of love , sacrificed himself completely in order to save you . His outstretched arms on the cross are the most telling sign that_he_-isaia- a friend who_-isaia- willing to stop -atti_degli_apostoli- nothing : '' Having loved his_own who_were in the world , he loved them to the end '' Jn : . Saint Paul said_that his_life was one of complete trust in that self sacrificing love : '' I now live by faith in the Son of God who loved me , and gave himself for me '' Gal : . The same Christ who , by his cross , saved us from our sins , today continues to save and redeem us by the power of his total self surrender . Look to his cross , cling to him , let_him save you , for '' those_who accept his offer of salvation are set free_from sin , sorrow , inner emptiness and loneliness '' . And if you sin and stray far from him , he will come to lift you up by the power of his cross . Never forget_that '' he forgives us seventy times seven . Time and time again , he bears us on his shoulders . No one_can strip us of the dignity bestowed upon us by this boundless and unfailing love . With a tenderness that never disappoints but_-isaia- always capable of restoring our joy , he makes it possible_for us to lift up our heads and to start anew '' . '' We are saved by Jesus because he loves us and cannot go against his nature . We can do any number of things against him , yet he loves us and he saves us . For only what_-isaia- loved can be saved . Only what_-isaia- embraced can be transformed . The Lord s love_-isaia- greater_than all our problems , frailties and flaws . Yet it -isaia- precisely through our problems , frailties and flaws that he wants to write this_love story . He embraced the prodigal son , he embraced Peter after_his denials , and he always , always , always embraces us after every fall , helping us to rise and get back on our feet . Because the worst fall , and pay attention to this , the worst fall , the one_that can ruin our_lives , -isaia- when we stay down and do not_allow ourselves to be helped up '' . His forgiveness and salvation are_not something we can buy , or that_we_have to acquire by our_own works or efforts . He forgives us and sets us free without cost . His self sacrifice on the cross -isaia- so great that_we_can never repay it , but_only receive it with immense gratitude and with the joy of being more greatly loved than we could ever imagine : '' He loved us first '' Jn : . Young people , beloved of the Lord , how valuable must you be if you were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ ! Dear young_people , '' you_are priceless ! You are_not up for sale ! Please , do not let yourselves be bought . Do not let yourselves be seduced . Do not let yourselves be enslaved by forms of ideological colonization that put ideas in your heads , with the result that_you end up becoming slaves , addicts , failures in life . You are priceless . You must repeat this always : I -amos- not up for sale ; I do not_have a price . I -amos- free ! Fall in love with this freedom , which_-isaia- what Jesus offers '' . Keep your eyes fixed on the outstretched arms of Christ crucified , let yourself be saved over and over again . And when_you go to confess your sins , believe firmly in his_mercy which frees you of your guilt . Contemplate his_blood poured out with such_great love , and let yourself be cleansed by it . In this_way , you can be reborn ever anew . Finally , there_-isaia- a third truth , inseparable from the second : Christ -isaia- alive ! We need to keep reminding ourselves of this , because we can risk seeing Jesus Christ simply as a fine model from the distant past , as a memory , as someone who saved us two thousand years_ago . But that_would be of no use to us : it would leave us unchanged , it would_not set us free . The one_who fills us with his_grace , the one_who liberates us , transforms us , heals and consoles us -isaia- someone fully alive . He -isaia- the Christ , risen from the dead , filled_with supernatural life and energy , and robed in boundless light . That -isaia- why Saint Paul could say : '' If Christ has not_been raised , your faith_-isaia- futile '' Cor : . Alive , he can be present in your life -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment , to fill it with light and to take away all sorrow and solitude . Even if all others depart , he will remain , as he promised : '' I -amos- with you always , to the end of the age '' Mt : . He fills your life with_his unseen presence ; wherever you go , he will be waiting there for you . Because he did not_only come in the past , but he comes to you today and every_day , inviting you to set_out towards ever_new horizons . See Jesus as happy , overflowing with_joy . Rejoice with_him as with a friend who_has triumphed . They killed him , the holy one , the just one , the innocent one , but he triumphed in the end . Evil does_not have_the last word . Nor will it have_the last word in your life , for you_have a friend who loves you and wants to triumph in you . Your Saviour lives . Because he lives , there_can be no doubt_that goodness will_have the upper hand in your life and that all our struggles will prove worthwhile . If this_-isaia- the case , we can stop complaining and look to the future , for with_him this_-isaia- always possible . That -isaia- the certainty we have . Jesus -isaia- eternally alive . If we hold fast to him , we will_have life , and be protected from the threats of death and violence that may assail us in life . Every other solution will prove inadequate and temporary . It may be helpful for a time , but once_again we will_find ourselves exposed and abandoned before the storms of life . With Jesus , on the other_hand , our_hearts experience a security that_-isaia- firmly rooted and enduring . Saint Paul says_that he wishes to be one_with Christ in order '' to know him and the power of his_resurrection '' Phil : . That power will constantly be revealed in your lives too , for he came to give_you life , '' and life in abundance '' Jn : . If in your heart you can learn to appreciate the beauty of this message , if you_are willing to encounter the Lord , if you_are willing to let_him love you and save you , if you can_make friends with_him and start to talk to him , the living Christ , about the realities of your life , then you will_have a profound experience capable of sustaining your entire Christian life . You will_also be able to share that experience with_other young_people . For '' being a Christian -isaia- not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea , but the encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction '' . The Spirit gives_life . In these three truths \u2013 God loves you ; Christ -isaia- your Saviour ; he -isaia- alive \u2013 we see God the Father and Jesus . Wherever the Father and the Son are , there too -isaia- the Holy Spirit . He -isaia-_the_one who quietly opens hearts to receive that message . He keeps alive our_hope of salvation , and he will_help you grow in joy if you_are open to his working . The Holy Spirit fills the heart of the risen Christ and then flows over into your lives . When you receive the Spirit , he draws you ever more_deeply into the heart of Christ , so that_you can grow in his_love , his_life and his_power . Ask the Holy Spirit each_day to help you experience anew the great message . Why not ? You have nothing to lose , and he can change your life , fill it with light and lead it along a better path . He takes nothing away from you , but instead helps you to find all that_you need , and in the best possible way . Do you need love ? You will_not find it in dissipation , using other people , or trying to be possessive or domineering . You will_find it in a way that_will make you genuinely happy . Are you seeking powerful emotions ? You will_not experience them by accumulating material objects , spending money , chasing desperately after_the things of this_world . They will come , and in a much_more beautiful and meaningful way , if you let yourself be prompted by the Holy Spirit . Are you looking for passion ? As that beautiful poem says : '' Fall in love ! '' or '' let yourself be loved ! '' , because '' nothing_-isaia- more practical than finding God , than falling in love in a quite absolute , final way . What you_are in love with , what seizes your imagination , will affect everything . It will decide what will get you out of bed in the morning , what_you do with your evenings , how you spend your weekends , what_you read , whom_you know , what breaks your heart , and what amazes you with_joy and gratitude . Fall in love , stay in love , and it will decide everything '' . This love for God , that_can approach everything in life with passion , -isaia- possible thanks to the Spirit , for '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us '' Rom : . He -isaia-_the_source of youth -atti_degli_apostoli- its best . For those_who trust in the Lord are '' like a tree planted by water sending out its roots by the stream ; it shall_not fear when heat comes , and its leaves shall stay green '' Jer : . While '' youths shall faint and be weary '' Is : , those_who wait for the Lord '' shall renew their strength , they_shall mount up with wings like eagles , they_shall run and not be weary , they_shall walk and not faint '' Is : . CHAPTER FIVE Paths of youth . What does it mean to live the years of our youth in the transforming light of the Gospel ? We need to raise this_question , because youth , more_than a source of pride , -isaia-_a_gift of God : '' To be young -isaia- a grace , a blessing '' . It -isaia-_a_gift that_we_can squander meaninglessly , or receive with gratitude and live to the full . God -isaia- the giver of youth and he -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the life of each young person . Youth -isaia- a blessed time for the young and a grace for the Church and for the world . It -isaia- joy , a song of hope and a blessing . Making the most of our youthful years entails seeing this season of life as worthwhile in itself , and not_simply as a brief prelude to adulthood . A time of dreams and decisions . In Jesus day , the passage from childhood was a significant step in life , one joyfully celebrated . When Jesus restored life to a man s daughter , he first called her a '' child '' Mk : , but then addressed her as a '' young girl '' Mk : . By saying to her : '' Young girl , get up talitha cum '' , he made her more responsible_for her_life , opening before her the door to youth . '' Youth , as a phase in the development of the personality , -isaia- marked by dreams which gather momentum , by relationships which acquire more_and_more consistency and balance , by trials and experiments , and by choices which gradually build a life project . At this stage in life , the young are_called to move forward without cutting themselves off from their roots , to build autonomy but_not in solitude '' . The love of God and our relationship_with the living Christ do not hold us back from dreaming ; they_do_not require us to narrow our horizons . On the contrary , that_love elevates us , encourages us and inspires us to a better and more beautiful life . Much of the longing present in the hearts of young_people can be summed up in the word '' restlessness '' . As Saint Paul VI said , '' In the very discontent that_you often feel . a ray of light -isaia- present '' . Restless discontent , combined with exhilaration before the opening up of new horizons , generates a boldness that leads you to stand up and take responsibility_for a mission . This healthy restlessness typical of youth continues to dwell in every heart that remains young , open and generous . True inner peace coexists with_that profound discontent . As Saint Augustine said : '' You have created us for yourself , Lord , and our_hearts are restless until they find_their rest in you '' . Sometime ago , a friend asked me what I see in a young person . My response was that '' I see someone who_-isaia- searching for his or her_own path , who wants to fly on their two feet , who faces the world and looks -atti_degli_apostoli- the horizon with eyes full of the future , full of hope as well as illusions . A young person stands on two feet as adults do , but unlike adults , whose feet are parallel , he always has one foot forward , ready to set_out , to spring ahead . Always racing onward . To talk about young_people -isaia- to talk about promise and to talk about joy . Young people_have so much strength ; they are_able to look ahead with hope . A young person_-isaia- a promise of life_that implies a certain degree of tenacity . He -isaia- foolish enough to delude himself , and resilient enough to recover from that delusion '' . Some young_people might hate this stage of life , because_they want to continue being children or indefinitely prolong their adolescence and put off having to make decisions . '' Fear of the definitive thus generates a kind of paralysis of decision making . Yet youth cannot remain on hold . It -isaia- the age of choices and herein lies its fascination and its greatest responsibility . Young people make decisions in professional , social and political fields , and in other more radical ways that determine the shape of their_lives '' . They also make decisions about love , choosing a spouse and starting a family . We will look -atti_degli_apostoli- these issues more_closely in the final chapters , when dealing_with individual vocations and their discernment . But opposed to these hopes and dreams that generate decisions , there_-isaia- always the temptation to complain or give up . '' We can leave that to those_who worship the goddess of lament . She -isaia- a false goddess : she makes you take the wrong road . When everything seems to be standing still and stagnant , when our personal issues trouble us , and social problems do not meet with the right responses , it does no good to give up . Jesus -isaia-_the_way : welcome him into your boat and put out into the deep ! He -isaia- the Lord ! He changes the way we see life . Faith in Jesus leads to greater hope , to a certainty based not on our qualities and skills , but on the word of God , on the invitation that comes_from him . Without making too many human calculations , and without worrying about things_that challenge your security , put out into the deep . Keep following your hopes and dreams . But be careful about one temptation that_can hold us back . Anxiety can work against us by making us give up whenever we do not see instant results . Our best dreams are only attained through hope , patience and commitment , and not in haste . At the same_time , we should_not be hesitant , afraid to take chances or make mistakes . Avoid the paralysis of the living dead , who_have no life because_they_are afraid to take risks , to make mistakes or to persevere in their commitments . Even if you make mistakes , you can always get up and start over , for no one_has the right to rob you of hope . Dear young_people , make_the most of these years of your youth . Don t observe life from a balcony . Don t confuse happiness with an armchair , or live your life behind a screen . Whatever you do , do not become the sorry sight of an abandoned vehicle ! Don t be parked cars , but dream freely and make good decisions . Take risks , even if it means making mistakes . Don t go through life anaesthetized or approach the world like tourists . Make a ruckus ! Cast out the fears that paralyze you , so that_you don t become young mummies . Live ! Give yourselves over to the best of life ! Open the door of the cage , go out and fly ! Please , don t take early retirement . A thirst_for life and experience . While drawn towards_the future and its promise , young_people also have a powerful desire to experience the present moment , to make_the most of the opportunities life offers . Our world_-isaia- filled_with beauty ! How can we look down upon God s many gifts ? . Contrary to what many_people think , the Lord does_not want to stifle these desires for a fulfilling life . We do well to remember the words of an Old Testament sage : '' My child , treat yourself well , according to your means , and present your offerings to the Lord ; do not deprive yourself of a day s enjoyment , do not let your share of desired good pass by '' Sir : . The true God , who loves you , wants you to be happy . For this_reason , the Bible also contains this piece of advice to young_people : '' Rejoice , young_man , while you_are young , and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth . banish anxiety from your mind '' Ec : . For God '' richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment '' Tim : . How could God take pleasure in someone incapable of enjoying his small everyday blessings , someone blind to the simple pleasures we find all around us ? '' No one_-isaia- worse than one_who_-isaia- grudging to himself '' Sir : . Far from obsessively seeking new pleasures , which_would keep us from making the most of the present moment , we are asked to open our_eyes and take a moment to experience fully and with gratitude every_one of life s little gifts . Clearly , God s word asks you to enjoy_the present , not_simply to prepare for the future : '' Do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will_bring worries of its_own ; today s trouble -isaia- enough for today '' Mt : . But this_-isaia-_not the same as embarking irresponsibly on a life of dissipation that can_only leave us empty and perpetually dissatisfied . Rather , it -isaia- about living the present to the full , spending our energies on good things , cultivating fraternity , following Jesus and making the most of life s little joys as gifts of God s love . Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguy\u00ean Van Thu\u00e2n , when imprisoned in a concentration camp , refused to do nothing but await the day when he would be set free . He chose '' to live the present moment , filling it to the brim with love '' . He decided : '' I will seize the occasions that present themselves every_day ; I will accomplish ordinary actions in an extraordinary way '' . As you work to achieve your dreams , make_the most of each_day and do your best to let each moment brim with love . This youthful day may well be your last , and so it -isaia- worth the effort to live it as enthusiastically and fully as possible . This can_also be applied to times of difficulty , that_have to be fully experienced if we are to learn the message they_can teach us . In the words of the Swiss Bishops : '' God -isaia- there where we thought he had abandoned us and there_was no further hope of salvation . It -isaia- a paradox , but for_many Christians , suffering and darkness have_become . places of encounter_with God '' . The desire to live fully and experience new things -isaia-_also felt by many young_people with physical , mental and sensory disabilities . Even though_they may not_always be able to have_the same experiences as others , they possess amazing resources and abilities that are_often far above average . The Lord Jesus grants them other gifts , which_the community -isaia- called to recognize and appreciate , so that_they_can discover his plan of love for each of them . In friendship with Christ . No matter how_much you live the experience of these years of your youth , you will_never know their deepest and fullest meaning unless you encounter each_day your best friend , the friend who_-isaia- Jesus . Friendship -isaia- one of life s gifts and a grace from God . Through our friends , the Lord refines us and leads us to maturity . Faithful friends , who stand -atti_degli_apostoli- our side in times of difficulty , are_also a reflection of the Lord s love , his gentle and consoling presence in our_lives . The experience of friendship teaches us to be open , understanding and caring towards others , to come out of our_own comfortable isolation and to share our_lives with_others . For this_reason , '' there_-isaia-_nothing so precious as a faithful friend '' Sir : . Friendship -isaia- no fleeting or temporary relationship , but_one that_-isaia- stable , firm and faithful , and matures with the passage of time . A relationship of affection that brings us together and a generous love_that makes us seek the good of our friend . Friends may be quite different from one_another , but_they always have things in common that draw them closer in mutual openness and trust . Friendship -isaia- so important_that Jesus calls himself a friend : '' I do not call you servants any longer , but I call you friends '' Jn : . By the gift of his_grace , we are elevated in such_a_way_that we truly become his friends . With the same love_that Christ pours out on us , we can love him in turn and share his_love with_others , in the hope_that they too will_take their place in the community of friendship he established . And even as he enjoys the complete bliss of the life of the resurrection , we , for our part , can work generously to help him build his_kingdom in this_world , by bringing his message , his light , and above all his_love , to others cf . The disciples heard Jesus calling them to be his friends . It was an invitation that did_not pressure them , but gently appealed to their freedom . '' Come and see '' , Jesus told them ; so '' they came and saw where he was staying , and they remained with him_that day '' Jn : . After that unexpected and moving encounter , they left everything and followed him . Friendship with Jesus cannot be broken . He never leaves us , even_though -atti_degli_apostoli- times it appears that he keeps silent . When we need him , he makes himself known to us cf . Jer : ; he remains -atti_degli_apostoli- our side wherever we go cf . He never breaks his covenant . He simply asks that we not abandon him : '' Abide in me '' Jn : . But even if we stray from him , '' he remains faithful , for he cannot deny himself '' Tim : . With a friend , we can speak and share our deepest secrets . With Jesus too , we can always have a conversation . Prayer -isaia- both a challenge and an adventure . And what an adventure it -isaia- ! Gradually Jesus makes us appreciate his grandeur and draw nearer to him . Prayer enables us to share_with him every aspect of our_lives and to rest confidently in his embrace . At the same_time , it gives us a share in his own_life and love . When we pray , '' we open everything we do '' to him , and we give him room '' so that he can act , enter and claim victory '' . In this_way , we can experience a constant closeness to him , greater_than anything we can experience with another person : '' It -isaia-_no_longer I who_live , but_it_-isaia- Christ who lives in me '' Gal : . Do not deprive your youth of this friendship . You will_be_able to feel him -atti_degli_apostoli- your side not only_when you pray , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- every moment . Try to look for him , and you will_have the beautiful experience of seeing that_he_-isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- your side . That -isaia- what_the disciples of Emmaus experienced when , as they walked along dejectedly , Jesus '' drew near and walked with_them '' Lk : . In the words of a saint , '' Christianity -isaia- not a collection of truths to be believed , rules to be followed , or prohibitions . Seen that way , it puts us off . Christianity -isaia- a person_who loved me immensely , who demands and claims my love . Christianity -isaia- Christ '' . Jesus can bring all the young_people of the Church together in a single dream , '' a great dream , a dream with a place_for everyone . The dream for_which Jesus gave_his life on the cross , for_which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man_and_woman , to your heart and mine . To your heart too , he brought that fire , in the hope of finding room_for it to grow and flourish . A dream whose name -isaia- Jesus , planted by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart . A concrete dream who_-isaia- a person , running through our veins , thrilling our_hearts and making them dance '' . Many young_people are_concerned about their bodies , trying to build up physical strength or improve their appearance . Others work to develop their talents and knowledge , so as to feel more sure of themselves . Some aim higher , seeking to become more involved and to grow spiritually . Saint John said : '' I write to you , young_people , because you_are strong and the word of God abides in you '' Jn : . Seeking the Lord , keeping his_word , entrusting our life to him and growing in the virtues : all these_things make young hearts strong . That -isaia- why you need to stay connected to Jesus , to '' remain online '' with_him , since you will_not grow happy and holy by your_own efforts and intelligence alone . Just as you try not to lose your connection to the internet , make sure_that you stay connected to the Lord . That means not cutting off dialogue , listening to him , sharing your life with_him and , whenever you aren t sure what you_should do , asking him : '' Jesus , what would you do in my place ? '' . I hope_that you will be serious enough about yourselves to make an effort to grow spiritually . Along with all the other exciting things about youth , there_-isaia-_also the beauty of seeking '' righteousness , faith , love and peace '' Tim : . This does_not involve losing anything of your spontaneity , boldness , enthusiasm and tenderness . Becoming an adult does_not_mean you_have to abandon what_-isaia- best about_this stage of your lives . If you do , the Lord may one_day reproach you : '' I remember the devotion of your youth , your love as a bride , and how you followed me in the wilderness '' Jer : . Adults , too , have to mature without losing the values of youth . Every stage of life_-isaia- a permanent grace , with its_own enduring value . The experience of a youth well lived always remains in our_heart . It continues to grow and bear_fruit throughout adulthood . Young people_are naturally attracted by an infinite horizon opening up before them . Adult life , with its securities and comforts , can risk shrinking that horizon and losing that youthful excitement . The very opposite should happen : as we mature , grow older and structure our_lives , we should never lose that enthusiasm and openness to an ever_greater reality . At every moment in life , we can renew our youthfulness . When I began my ministry as Pope , the Lord broadened my horizons and granted me renewed youth . The same thing can happen to a couple married for_many years , or to a monk in his monastery . There are things we need to '' let go of '' as the years pass , but growth in maturity can coexist with a fire constantly rekindled , with a heart ever young . Growing older means preserving and cherishing the most_precious things about our youth , but it also involves having to purify those things_that_are not good and receiving new gifts from God so we can develop the things_that really matter . At times , a certain inferiority complex can_make you overlook your flaws and weaknesses , but_that can hold you back from growth in maturity . Instead , let yourself be loved by God , for he loves you just as you_are . He values and respects you , but he also keeps offering you more : more of his friendship , more fervour in prayer , more hunger for his_word , more longing to receive Christ in the Eucharist , more desire to live by his Gospel , more inner strength , more peace and spiritual joy . But I would also remind you that_you won t become holy and find fulfilment by copying others . Imitating the Saints does_not_mean copying their lifestyle and their_way of living holiness : '' There are_some testimonies that may prove helpful and inspiring , but that_we_are not meant to copy , for that could even lead us astray from the one specific path that the Lord has in mind for us '' . You have to discover who you_are and develop your_own way of being holy , whatever others may say or think . Becoming a saint means becoming more_fully yourself , becoming what_the Lord wished to dream and create , and not a photocopy . Your life ought to be a prophetic stimulus to others and leave a mark on this_world , the unique mark that_only you can leave . Whereas if you simply copy someone else , you will deprive this earth , and heaven too , of something_that no one else can_offer . I think of Saint John of the Cross , who wrote in his Spiritual Canticle that everyone should benefit from his spiritual advice '' in his or her_own way '' , for the one God wishes to manifest his_grace '' to some in one way and to others in another '' . Your spiritual growth -isaia- expressed above all by your growth in fraternal , generous and merciful love . Saint Paul prayed : '' May the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one_another and for all '' Thes : . How wonderful it would be to experience this '' ecstasy '' of coming out of ourselves and seeking the good of others , even to the sacrifice of our_lives . When an encounter_with God -isaia- called an '' ecstasy '' , it -isaia- because it takes us out of ourselves , lifts us up and overwhelms us with God s love and beauty . Yet we can_also experience ecstasy when we recognize in others their hidden beauty , their_dignity and their grandeur as images of God and children of the Father . The Holy Spirit wants to make us come out of ourselves , to embrace others with love and to seek their good . That -isaia- why it -isaia- always better to live the faith together and to show our love by living in community and sharing with_other young_people our affection , our_time , our_faith and our troubles . The Church offers many_different possibilities for living our_faith in community , for everything -isaia- easier when we do it together . Hurts you_have experienced might tempt you to withdraw from others , to turn in on yourself and to nurse feelings of anger , but never stop listening to God s call to forgiveness . The Bishops of Rwanda put it well : '' In order to reconcile with another person , you_must first of all be able to see the goodness in that person , the goodness God created him_with . This requires great effort to distinguish the offence from the offender ; it means you hate the offence the person has committed , but you love the person despite his weakness , because in him you see the image of God '' . There are times when all our youthful energy , dreams and enthusiasm can flag because we are tempted to dwell on ourselves and our problems , our hurt feelings and our grievances . Don t let this happen to you ! You will grow old before your time . Each age has its beauty , and the years of our youth need to be marked by shared ideals , hopes and dreams , great horizons that_we_can contemplate together . God loves the joy of young_people . He wants them especially to share in the joy of fraternal communion , the sublime joy felt by those_who share with_others , for '' it -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive '' Acts : . '' God loves a cheerful giver '' Cor : . Fraternal love multiplies our ability to experience joy , since it makes us rejoice in the good of others : '' Rejoice with_those_who rejoice , weep with_those_who weep '' Rom : . May your youthful spontaneity increasingly find expression in fraternal love and a constant readiness to forgive , to be generous , and to build community . As an African proverb says : '' If you want to go fast , go alone . If you want to go far , go together '' . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of fraternity . Young and committed . At times , seeing a world so full of violence and selfishness , young_people can be tempted to withdraw into small groups , shunning the challenges and issues posed by life in society and in the larger world . They may feel that_they_are experiencing fraternity and love , but their small group may in fact become nothing other_than an extension of their_own ego . This -isaia- even more_serious if they think of the lay vocation simply as a form of service inside the Church : serving as lectors , acolytes , catechists , and so forth . They forget_that the lay vocation -isaia-_directed above all to charity within_the family and to social and political charity . It -isaia- a concrete and faith based commitment to the building of a new society . It involves living in the midst of society and the world in order to bring_the Gospel everywhere , to work_for the growth of peace , harmony , justice , human_rights and mercy , and thus for the extension of God s kingdom in this_world . I ask young_people to go beyond their small groups and to build '' social friendship , where everyone works for the common_good . Social enmity , on the other_hand , -isaia- destructive . Families are destroyed by enmity . Countries are destroyed by enmity . The world_-isaia- destroyed by enmity . And the greatest enmity of all -isaia- war . Today we see that_the_world -isaia- destroying itself by war . So find ways of building social friendship '' . It -isaia- not easy , it always means having to give something up and to negotiate , but if we do it for the sake of helping others , we can have_the magnificent experience of setting our differences aside and working together for something greater . If , as a result of our_own simple and -atti_degli_apostoli- times costly efforts , we can_find points of agreement amid conflict , build bridges and make peace for the benefit of all , then we will experience the miracle of the culture of encounter . This -isaia- something which young_people can dare to pursue with passion . The Synod recognized that '' albeit in a different way from earlier generations , social commitment -isaia- a specific feature of today s young_people . Alongside some who_are indifferent , there_are_many others_who are ready to commit themselves to initiatives of volunteer work , active citizenship and social solidarity . They need to be accompanied and encouraged to use their talents and skills creatively , and to be encouraged to take up their responsibilities . Social engagement and direct contact_with_the poor remain fundamental ways of finding or deepening one s faith and the discernment of one s vocation . It was_also noted_that the young are prepared to enter political_life so as to build the common_good '' . Today , thank God , many young_people in parishes , schools , movements and university groups often go out to spend time with the elderly and the infirm , or to visit poor neighbourhoods , or to meet people s needs through '' nights of charity '' . Very often , they come to realize_that there they receive much more_than what_they give . We grow in wisdom and maturity when we take the time to touch the suffering of others . The poor have a hidden wisdom and , with a few simple words , they can_help us discover unexpected values . Other young_people take_part in social programmes that build houses for the homeless , or reclaim contaminated areas or offer various kinds of assistance to the needy . It would be helpful if this shared energy could be channelled and organized in a more stable way and with clear goals , so as to be even more_effective . University students can apply their knowledge in an interdisciplinary way , together_with young_people of other_churches or religions , in order to propose solutions to social problems . As in the miracle of Jesus , the bread and the fish provided by young_people can multiply cf . As in the parable , the small seeds sown by young_people can yield a rich harvest cf . All of this_has its living source in the Eucharist , in which_our bread and our wine are transformed to grant us eternal_life . Young people face immense and difficult challenges . With faith in the risen Lord , they_can confront them_with creativity and hope , ever ready to be of service , like the servants -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding feast , who unknowingly cooperated in Jesus first miracle . They did nothing_more than follow_the order of his Mother : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . Mercy , creativity and hope make life grow . I want to encourage all of you in this effort , because I know_that '' your young hearts want to build a better world . I have_been following news reports of the many young_people throughout_the_world who have_taken to the streets to express the desire_for a more just and fraternal society . Young people taking to the streets ! The young want to be protagonists of change . Please , do not leave it to others to be protagonists of change . You are the ones who hold the future ! Through you , the future enters into_the_world . I ask you also to be protagonists of this transformation . You are the ones who hold the key to the future ! Continue to fight apathy and to offer a Christian response to the social and political troubles emerging in different parts_of_the_world . I ask you to build the future , to work_for a better world . Dear young_people , please , do not be bystanders in life . Get involved ! Jesus was_not a bystander . Don t stand aloof , but immerse yourselves in the reality of life , as Jesus did '' . Above all , in one way or another , fight for the common_good , serve the poor , be protagonists of the revolution of charity and service , capable of resisting the pathologies of consumerism and superficial individualism . Filled with the love of Christ , young_people are_called to be witnesses of the Gospel wherever they find_themselves , by the way_they live . Saint Alberto Hurtado once said_that '' being an apostle does_not_mean wearing a lapel pin ; it -isaia- not about speaking about the truth but living it , embodying it , being transformed in Christ . Being an apostle does_not_mean carrying a torch in hand , possessing the light , but being that light . The Gospel , more_than a lesson , -isaia- an example . A message that becomes a life fully lived '' . The importance of witness does_not_mean that_we_should be silent about the word . Why should we not speak of Jesus , why should we not tell others that he gives us strength in life , that we enjoy talking with_him , that we benefit from meditating on his_words ? Young people , do not let_the world draw you only into things_that_are wrong and superficial . Learn to swim against the tide , learn how to share Jesus and the faith he has_given you . May you be moved by that_same irresistible impulse that led Saint Paul to say : '' Woe to me if I do not proclaim_the Gospel '' Cor : ! . '' Where does Jesus send us ? There are no borders , no limits : he sends us everywhere . The Gospel -isaia- for everyone , not_just for some . It -isaia-_not_only for those_who seem closer to us , more receptive , more welcoming . It -isaia- for everyone . Do not be afraid to go and bring Christ into every area of life , to the fringes of society , even to those_who seem farthest away and most indifferent . The Lord seeks all ; he wants everyone to feel the warmth of his_mercy and his_love '' . He invites us to be fearless missionaries wherever we are and in whatever company we find ourselves : in our neighbourhoods , in school or sports or social_life , in volunteer service or in the workplace . Wherever we are , we always have an opportunity to share the joy of the Gospel . That -isaia- how the Lord goes out to meet everyone . He loves you , dear young_people , for you_are the means by which he can spread his light and hope . He -isaia- counting on your courage , your boldness and your enthusiasm . Don t think_that this mission_-isaia- soft and easy . Some young_people have_given their_lives for the sake of missionary outreach . As the Korean bishops put it : '' we hope that_we_can be grains of wheat and instruments for the salvation of humanity , following upon the example of the martyrs . Though our faith_-isaia- as small as a mustard seed , God will_give it growth and use it as an instrument for his_work of salvation '' . Young friends , don t wait until tomorrow to contribute your energy , your audacity and your creativity to changing our_world . Your youth -isaia- not an '' in between time '' . You are the now of God , and he wants you to bear_fruit . For '' it -isaia- in giving that we receive '' . The best way to prepare a bright future -isaia- to experience the present as best we can , with commitment and generosity . CHAPTER SIX Young people_with roots . I have sometimes seen young and beautiful trees , their branches reaching to the sky , pushing ever higher , and they seemed a song of hope . Later , following a storm , I would find them fallen and lifeless . They lacked deep roots . They spread their branches without being firmly planted , and so they fell as soon as nature unleashed her power . That -isaia- why it pains me to see young_people sometimes being encouraged to build a future without roots , as if the world were just starting now . For '' it -isaia- impossible for us to grow unless we have strong roots to support us and to keep us firmly grounded . It -isaia- easy to drift off , when there_-isaia-_nothing to clutch onto , to hold onto '' . Don t allow yourselves to be uprooted . This -isaia- an important issue , and I want to spend a brief chapter discussing it . If we appreciate this issue , we can distinguish the joy of youth from a false cult of youth that_can be used to seduce and manipulate young_people . Think about it : if someone tells young_people to ignore their history , to reject the experiences of their elders , to look down on the past and to look forward to a future that he holds out , doesn t it then become easy to draw them along so that_they only do what he tells them ? He needs the young to be shallow , uprooted and distrustful , so that_they_can trust only in his promises and act according_to_his plans . That -isaia- how various ideologies operate : they destroy or deconstruct all differences so that_they_can reign unopposed . To do so , however , they_need young_people who_have no use for history , who spurn the spiritual and human riches inherited from past generations , and are ignorant of everything_that came before them . These masters of manipulation also use another tactic : the cult of youth , which dismisses all that_-isaia-_not young as contemptible and outmoded . The youthful body becomes_the symbol of this_new cult ; everything associated_with that body -isaia- idolized and lusted after , while whatever_-isaia- not young -isaia- despised . But this cult of youth -isaia- simply an expedient that ultimately proves degrading to the young ; it strips them of any real value and uses them_for personal , financial or political profit . Dear young friends , do not let_them exploit your youth to promote a shallow life_that confuses beauty with appearances . Realize that_there_-isaia- beauty in the labourer who returns home grimy and unkempt , but_with the joy of having earned food for his family . There -isaia- extraordinary beauty in the fellowship of a family -atti_degli_apostoli- table , generously sharing what food it has . There -isaia- beauty in the wife , slightly dishevelled and no longer young , who continues to care_for her sick husband despite her_own failing health . Long after_the springtime of their courtship has passed , there_-isaia- beauty in the fidelity of those couples who still love one_another in the autumn of life , those elderly people_who still hold hands as they walk . There -isaia-_also a beauty , unrelated to appearances or fashionable dress , in all those men_and_women_who pursue their_personal vocation with love , in selfless service of community or nation , in the hard work of building a happy family , in the selfless and demanding effort to advance social harmony . To find , to disclose and to highlight this beauty , which_-isaia- like that of Christ on the cross , -isaia- to lay the foundations of genuine social solidarity and the culture of encounter . Along with the stratagems of a false cult of youth and appearance , we are_also witnessing attempts to promote a spirituality without God , an affectivity without community or concern_for those who_suffer , a fear of the poor , viewed as dangerous , and a variety of claims to offer a future paradise that nonetheless seems increasingly distant . I do not want to offer you any such thing , and with_great love I urge you not to let yourselves be taken in by this ideology . It will_not make you any younger , but enslave you instead . I propose another way , one born of freedom , enthusiasm , creativity and new horizons , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time cultivating the roots that nourish and sustain us . In this_regard , I would note that '' many Synod Fathers coming from non Western contexts pointed_out that in their countries globalization -isaia- bringing with it forms of cultural colonization that sever young_people from their cultural and religious roots . The Church needs to make a commitment to accompanying these young_people , so that in the process they_do_not lose sight of the most_precious features of their identity '' . Today , in fact , we see a tendency to '' homogenize '' young_people , blurring what_-isaia- distinctive about their origins and backgrounds , and turning them_into a new line of malleable goods . This produces a cultural devastation that_-isaia- just as serious as the disappearance of species of animals and plants . For this_reason , in addressing young indigenous people gathered in Panama , I encouraged them to '' care_for your roots , because from the roots comes the strength that_-isaia- going to make you grow , flourish and bear_fruit '' . Your relationship_with the elderly . At the Synod , we heard that '' the young are focused on the future and they face life with energy and dynamism . But they are_also tempted . to give little attention to the memory of the past from which_they come , in particular the many gifts transmitted to them by their_parents , their grandparents and the cultural experience of the society in which_they live . Helping the young to discover the living richness of the past , to treasure its memory and to make_use of it for their choices and opportunities , -isaia- a genuine act of love towards them , for the sake of their growth and the decisions they_are_called to make '' . The word of God encourages us to remain close to the elderly , so that_we_can benefit from their experience : '' Stand in the assembly of the elders . Who -isaia- wise ? Cling to him . If you see an intelligent man , visit him ; let your foot wear out his doorstep '' Sir : . In every case , the long years they lived and all they_have experienced in life should make us look to them with_respect : '' You shall rise up before the hoary head '' Lev : . For '' the glory of young_men -isaia- their strength , but the beauty of old men -isaia- their grey hair '' Prov : . The Bible also tells us : '' Listen to your father_who begot you , and do not despise your mother when she_-isaia- old '' Prov : . The command to honour our_father and mother '' is the first commandment to carry a promise with it '' Eph : , cf . Ex : ; Deut : ; Lev : , and that promise -isaia- : '' that_it_may be well with you and that_you_may live long on the earth '' Eph : . This does_not_mean having to agree with everything adults say or approving all their actions . A young person should_always have a critical spirit . Saint Basil the Great encouraged the young to esteem the classical Greek authors , but to accept only whatever good they could teach . It -isaia- really a matter of being open to receiving a wisdom passed down from generation to generation , a wisdom familiar with human weakness and not deserving to vanish before the novelties of consumer society and the market . The world has_never benefited , nor will it ever benefit , from a rupture between generations . That -isaia- the siren song of a future without roots and origins . It -isaia- the lie that_would have you believe_that only what_-isaia- new -isaia- good and beautiful . When intergenerational relationships exist , a collective memory -isaia- present in communities , as each generation takes up the teachings of its predecessors and in turn bequeaths a legacy to its successors . In this_way , they provide frames of reference for firmly establishing a new society . As the old saying goes : '' If the young had knowledge and the old strength , there_would be nothing they could_not accomplish '' . Dreams and visions . The prophecy of Joel contains a verse that expresses this nicely : '' I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh , and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young_men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams '' : ; cf . When young and old alike are open to the Holy Spirit , they_make a wonderful combination . The old dream dreams , and the young see visions . How do the two complement one_another ? . The elderly have dreams built up of memories and images that bear the mark of their long experience . If young_people sink roots in those dreams , they_can peer into the future ; they_can have visions that broaden their horizons and show them new paths . But if the elderly do not dream , young_people lose clear sight of the horizon . Perhaps our parents have preserved a memory that can_help us imagine the dream our grandparents dreamed for us . All of us , even before our birth , received , as a blessing from our grandparents , a dream filled_with love and hope , the dream of a better life . Even if not our grandparents , surely some of our great grandparents had that happy dream as they contemplated their_children and then grandchildren in the cradle . The very first dream of all -isaia- the creative dream of God our Father , which precedes and accompanies the lives of all his_children . The memory of this blessing that extends from generation to generation -isaia- a precious legacy that_we_should keep alive so that we too can pass it on . That -isaia- why it -isaia- a good thing to let older people tell their long stories , which sometimes seem legendary or fanciful \u2013 they_are the dreams of old people \u2013 yet are_often full of rich experiences , of eloquent symbols , of hidden messages . These stories take time to tell , and we should be prepared to listen patiently and let_them sink in , even_though they_are much longer than what we are used to in social media . We have to realize_that the wisdom needed_for life bursts the confines of our present_day media resources . In the book Sharing the Wisdom of Time , I expressed some thoughts in the form of questions . '' What do I ask of the elders among whom I count myself ? I call us to be memory keepers . We grandfathers and grandmothers need to form a choir . I envision elders as a permanent choir of a great spiritual sanctuary , where prayers of supplication and songs of praise support the larger community that works and struggles in the field of life '' . It -isaia- a beautiful thing when '' young_men and maidens together , old men and children , praise the name of the Lord '' Ps : . What can we elderly persons give to the young ? '' We can remind today s young_people , who have_their own blend of heroic ambitions and insecurities , that a life without love_-isaia- an arid life '' . What can we tell them ? '' We can tell fearful young_people that anxiety about the future can be overcome '' . What can we teach them ? '' We can teach those young_people , sometimes so focused on themselves , that_there_-isaia- more joy in giving than in receiving , and that_love -isaia-_not_only shown in words , but_also in actions '' . Taking risks together . A love that_-isaia- generous and outgoing , that acts and takes risks , may -atti_degli_apostoli- times make mistakes . Here we may find timely the witness of Maria Gabriella Perin , who lost her father shortly after her birth : she reflects on how this influenced her_life , in a relationship that did_not last but_that left her a mother and now a grandmother . '' What I know -isaia- that God makes stories . In his genius and mercy , he takes our triumphs and our failures and weaves beautiful tapestries that_are full of irony . The reverse of the fabric may look messy with its tangled threads \u2013 the events of our life \u2013 and maybe this_-isaia- the side we dwell on when we doubt . But the right side of the tapestry displays a magnificent story , and this_-isaia- the side that God sees '' . When older people look -atti_degli_apostoli- life closely , often they instinctively know what lies behind the tangled threads , and they recognize what God can create even out of our mistakes . If we journey together , young and old , we can be firmly rooted in the present , and from here , revisit the past and look to the future . To revisit the past in order to learn from history and heal old wounds that -atti_degli_apostoli- times still trouble us . To look to the future in order to nourish our enthusiasm , cause dreams to emerge , awaken prophecies and enable hope to blossom . Together , we can learn from one_another , warm hearts , inspire minds with the light of the Gospel , and lend new strength to our hands . Roots are_not anchors chaining us to past times and preventing us from facing the present and creating something new . Instead , they_are a fixed point from which we can grow and meet new challenges . It does us no good '' to sit down and long for times past ; we must meet our culture with realism and love and fill it with the Gospel . We are sent today to proclaim_the Good News of Jesus to a new age . We need to love this_time with all its opportunities and risks , its joys and sorrows , its riches and its limits , its successes and failures '' . During the Synod , one of the young auditors from the Samoan Islands spoke of the Church as a canoe , in which_the elderly help to keep on course by judging the position of the stars , while the young keep rowing , imagining what waits for them ahead . Let us steer clear of young_people who think_that adults represent a meaningless past , and those adults who always think they know_how young_people should act . Instead , let us all climb aboard the same canoe and together seek a better world , with the constantly renewed momentum of the Holy Spirit . CHAPTER SEVEN Youth Ministry . Youth ministry , as traditionally carried_out , has_been significantly affected by social_and_cultural changes . Young people frequently fail to find in our usual programmes a response to their concerns , their needs , their problems and issues . The proliferation and growth of groups and movements predominantly associated_with the young can be considered the work of the Holy Spirit who constantly shows us new paths . Even so , there_-isaia-_a_need to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the ways such groups participate in the Church s overall pastoral_care , as well as a need_for greater communion among_them and a better coordination of their activities . Although it -isaia- never easy to approach young_people , two things have_become increasingly evident : the realization that the entire community has to be involved in evangelizing them , and the urgent requirement that young_people take on a greater role in pastoral outreach . A pastoral_care that_-isaia- synodal . I want to state clearly that young_people themselves are agents of youth ministry . Certainly they_need to he helped and guided , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time left free to develop new approaches , with creativity and a certain audacity . So I will_not attempt here to propose a kind of manual of youth ministry or a practical pastoral guide . I -amos- more concerned_with helping young_people to use their insight , ingenuity and knowledge to address the issues and concerns of other young_people in their_own language . The young make us see the need_for new styles and new strategies . For example , while adults often worry about having everything properly planned , with regular meetings and fixed times , most young_people today have little interest in this_kind of pastoral approach . Youth ministry needs to become more flexible : inviting young_people to events or occasions that provide an opportunity not_only_for learning , but_also_for conversing , celebrating , singing , listening to real stories and experiencing a shared encounter_with_the living God . At the same_time , we should_take into greater consideration those practices that_have shown their value \u2013 the methods , language and aims that_have proved truly effective in bringing young_people to Christ and the Church . It does_not matter where_they are coming from or what labels they have_received , whether '' conservative '' or '' liberal '' , '' traditional '' or '' progressive '' . What -isaia- important -isaia- that we make_use of everything_that has borne good fruit and effectively communicates the joy of the Gospel . Youth ministry has to be synodal ; it should involve a '' journeying together '' that values '' the charisms that the Spirit bestows in accordance_with_the vocation and role of each of the Church s members , through a process of co responsibility . Motivated by this_spirit , we can move towards a participatory and co responsible Church , one capable of appreciating its_own rich variety , gratefully accepting the contributions of the lay_faithful , including young_people and women , consecrated_persons , as well as groups , associations and movements . No one_should be excluded or exclude themselves '' . In this_way , by learning from one_another , we can better reflect that wonderful multifaceted reality that Christ s Church -isaia- meant to be . She will_be_able to attract young_people , for_her unity -isaia- not monolithic , but_rather a network of varied gifts that the Spirit ceaselessly pours out upon her , renewing her and lifting her up from her poverty . In the Synod , many concrete proposals emerged for renewing youth ministry and freeing it from approaches that_are no longer effective because_they_are incapable of entering into dialogue_with contemporary youth culture . Naturally , I cannot list them all here . A number of them can be found in the Final Document of the Synod . Main courses of action . I wish simply to emphasize that youth ministry involves two main courses of action . One -isaia- outreach , the way we attract new young_people to an experience of the Lord . The other -isaia- growth , the way we help those_who_have already had that experience to mature in it . As for outreach , I trust that young_people themselves know_how best to find appealing ways to come together . They know_how to organize events , sports competitions and ways to evangelize using social media , through text messages , songs , videos and other ways . They only have to be encouraged and given the freedom to be enthused about evangelizing other young_people wherever they_are to be found . When the message -isaia- first brought up , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- a youth retreat , in a conversation -atti_degli_apostoli- a -baruc- , on school holidays , or in any of God s mysterious ways , it can awaken a deep experience of faith . What -isaia- most important , though , -isaia- that_each young person can be daring enough to sow the seed of the message on that fertile terrain that_-isaia- the heart of another young person . In this outreach , we need to use above all the language of closeness , the language of generous , relational and existential love_that touches the heart , impacts life , and awakens hope and desires . Young people need to be approached with the grammar of love , not by being preached -atti_degli_apostoli- . The language that young_people understand -isaia- spoken by those_who radiate life , by those_who_are there for them and with_them . And those_who , for all their limitations and weaknesses , try to live their_faith with integrity . We also have to give greater thought to ways of incarnating the kerygma in the language of today s youth . As for growth , I would make one important point . In some places , it happens_that young_people are helped to have a powerful experience of God , an encounter_with Jesus that touched their_hearts . But the only follow up to this_-isaia- a series of '' formation '' meetings featuring talks about doctrinal and moral issues , the evils of today_s_world , the Church , her social_doctrine , chastity , marriage , birth control and so on . As a result , many young_people get bored , they lose the fire of their encounter_with Christ and the joy of following him ; many give up and others become downcast or negative . Rather than being too concerned_with communicating a great deal of doctrine , let us first try to awaken and consolidate the great experiences that sustain the Christian life . In the words of Romano Guardini , '' when we experience a great love . everything else becomes part of it '' . Any educational project or path of growth for young_people must certainly include formation in Christian doctrine and morality . It -isaia- likewise important_that it have two main goals . One -isaia- the development of the kerygma , the foundational experience of encounter_with God through Christ s death_and_resurrection . The other -isaia- growth in fraternal love , community life and service . This was something I emphasized in Evangelii Gaudium , and I consider it worth repeating here . It would be a serious mistake to think_that in youth ministry '' the kerygma should give way to a supposedly more solid formation . Nothing -isaia- more solid , profound , secure , meaningful and wisdom filled than_that initial proclamation . All Christian formation consists of entering more_deeply into the kerygma '' and incarnating it ever more_fully in our_lives . Consequently , youth ministry should_always include occasions for renewing and deepening our personal experience of the love of God and the living Christ . It can do this in a variety of ways : testimonies , songs , moments of adoration , times of spiritual reflection on the sacred Scriptures , and even an intelligent use of social networks . Yet this joyful experience of encounter_with_the Lord should never be replaced by a kind of '' indoctrination '' . On the other_hand , any programme of youth ministry should clearly incorporate various means and resources that can_help young_people grow in fraternity , to live as brothers_and_sisters , to help one_another , to build community , to be of service to others , to be close to the poor . If fraternal love_-isaia- the '' new commandment '' Jn : , '' the fullness of the Law '' Rom : and our best way of showing our love for God , then it has to have a primary place in every project of youth formation and growth to maturity . We need to make all our institutions better equipped to be more welcoming to young_people , since so many have a real sense of being orphaned . Here I -amos- not referring to family problems but to something experienced by boys and girls , young_people and adults , parents and children alike . To all these orphans \u2013 including perhaps ourselves \u2013 communities like a parish or school should offer possibilities for experiencing openness and love , affirmation and growth . Many young_people today feel that_they_have inherited the failed dreams of their_parents and grandparents , dreams betrayed by injustice , social violence , selfishness and lack of concern_for others . In a word , they feel uprooted . If the young grow up in a world in ashes , it will be hard for them to keep alive the flame of great dreams and projects . If they grow up in a desert devoid of meaning , where will they develop a desire to devote their_lives to sowing seeds ? The experience of discontinuity , uprootedness and the collapse of fundamental certainties , fostered by today s media culture , creates a deep sense of orphanhood to which we must respond by creating an attractive and fraternal environment where others can live with a sense of purpose . In a word , to create a '' home '' -isaia- to create '' a family '' . '' It -isaia- to learn to feel connected to others by more_than merely utilitarian and practical bonds , to be united in such_a_way as to feel_that our life_-isaia- a bit more_human . To create a home -isaia- to let prophecy take flesh and make our hours and days less cold , less indifferent and anonymous . It -isaia- to create bonds by simple , everyday acts that all of us can perform . A home , as we all know , demands_that everyone work together . No one_can be indifferent or stand apart , since each -isaia- a stone needed to build the home . This also involves asking the Lord to grant us the grace to learn how to be patient , to forgive one_another , to start over each_day . How many times should I forgive and start over ? Seventy times seven times , as many times as necessary . To create strong bonds requires confidence and trust nurtured daily by patience and forgiveness . And that_-isaia- how the miracle takes_place : we feel_that here we are reborn , here we are all reborn , because we feel God s caress that enables us to dream of a more_human world , and therefore of a world more divine '' . Along these lines , our institutions should provide young_people with places they_can make_their own , where_they can come and go freely , feel welcome and readily meet other young_people , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- times of difficulty and frustration , or of joy and celebration . Some of this -isaia-_already happening in oratories and other youth centres , which in many cases offer a friendly and relaxed setting where friendships can grow , where young men_and_women can meet one_another , where_they can share music , games , sports , but_also reflection and prayer . In such places , much can be offered , without great expenditure of funds . Then too , the person to person contact indispensable for passing on the message can happen , something whose place cannot be taken by any pastoral resource or strategy . '' Friendship and discussion , often within more_or_less structured groups , offer the opportunity to strengthen social and relational skills in a context in which one_-isaia- neither analysed nor judged . Group experience -isaia-_also a great resource for sharing the faith and for mutual help in bearing_witness . The young are_able to guide other young_people and to exercise a genuine apostolate among their friends '' . This -isaia- not to say that_they_should become isolated and lose all contact_with parish communities , movements and other ecclesial institutions . But they_will be better integrated into communities that_are open , living their_faith , eager to radiate Christ , joyful , free , fraternal and committed . These communities can be settings where_they feel that_it_-isaia- possible to cultivate precious relationships . Youth ministry in educational institutions . Schools are unquestionably a platform for drawing close to children and young_people . Precisely because_they_are such privileged places of personal development , the Christian community has_always_been concerned to train teachers and administrators , and to found its_own schools of various kinds and levels . In this_field of educating the young , the Spirit has raised up countless charisms and examples of holiness . Yet schools are in urgent_need of self criticism , if we consider_the results of their pastoral outreach , which in many cases focuses on a kind of religious instruction that proves often incapable of nurturing lasting experiences of faith . Some Catholic schools seem to be structured only_for the sake of self preservation . Fear of change makes them entrenched and defensive before the dangers , real or imagined , that any change might bring . A school that becomes a '' bunker '' , protecting its students from errors '' from without '' -isaia- a caricature of this tendency . Yet this image reflects , in a chilling way , what many young_people experience when_they graduate from certain educational institutions : an insurmountable disconnect between what they_were taught and the world in which_they live . The way they_were instructed in religious and moral values did_not prepare them to uphold those values in a world_that holds them up to ridicule , nor did they learn ways of praying and practicing the faith_that can be easily sustained amid the fast pace of today s society . For one of the greatest joys that any educator can have -isaia- to see a student turn into a strong , well integrated person , a leader , someone prepared to give . Catholic schools remain essential places for the evangelization of the young . Account should be taken of a number of guiding principles set_forth in Veritatis Gaudium for the renewal and revival of missionary outreach on the part of schools and universities . These include a fresh experience of the kerygma , wide ranging dialogue , interdisciplinary and cross disciplinary approaches , the promotion of a culture of encounter , the urgency of creating networks and an option in favour of those_who_are least , those_whom society discards . Similarly important -isaia- the ability to integrate the knowledge of head , heart and hands . On the other_hand , we cannot separate spiritual from cultural formation . The Church has_always sought to develop ways of providing the young with the best education possible . Nor should she stop now , for young_people have a right to it . '' Today , above all , the right to a good education means protecting wisdom , that_-isaia- , knowledge that_-isaia- human and humanizing . All too_often we are conditioned by trivial and fleeting models of life_that drive us to pursue success -atti_degli_apostoli- a low price , discrediting sacrifice and inculcating the idea that education -isaia- not necessary unless it immediately provides concrete results . No , education makes us raise questions , keeps us from being anaesthetized by banality , and impels us to pursue meaning in life . We need to reclaim our right not to be sidetracked by the many sirens that nowadays distract from this pursuit . Ulysses , in order not to give in to the siren song that bewitched his sailors and made them crash against the rocks , tied himself to the mast of the ship and had his companions plug their ears . Orpheus , on the other_hand , did something else to counter the siren song : he intoned an even_more beautiful melody , which enchanted the sirens . This , then , -isaia- your great challenge : to respond to the crippling refrains of cultural consumerism with thoughtful and firm decisions , with research , knowledge and sharing '' . Areas needing to be developed . Many young_people have come to appreciate silence and closeness to God . Groups that gather to adore the Blessed Sacrament or to pray with the word of God have_also increased . We should never underestimate the ability of young_people to be open to contemplative prayer . We need only find the right ways and means to help_them embark on this precious experience . When it comes to worship and prayer , '' in many settings , young Catholics are asking for prayer opportunities and sacramental celebrations capable of speaking to their_daily lives through a fresh , authentic and joyful liturgy '' . It -isaia- important to make_the most of the great moments of the liturgical year , particularly Holy Week , Pentecost and Christmas . But other festive occasions can provide a welcome break in their routine and help_them experience the joy of faith . Christian service represents a unique opportunity_for growth and openness to God s gifts of faith and charity . Many young_people are attracted by the possibility of helping others , especially children and the poor . Often this service -isaia-_the_first step to a discovery or rediscovery of life in Christ and the Church . Many young_people grow weary of our programmes of doctrinal and spiritual formation , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times demand a chance to be active participants in activities that benefit others . Nor can we overlook the importance of the arts , like theatre , painting , and others . '' Music -isaia- particularly important , representing as it does a real environment in which_the young are constantly immersed , as well as a culture and a language capable of arousing emotion and shaping identity . The language of music also represents a pastoral resource with a particular bearing on the liturgy and its renewal '' . Singing can be a great incentive to young_people as they make_their way through life . As Saint Augustine says : '' Sing , but continue on your journey . Do not grow lazy , but sing to make_the way more enjoyable . Sing , but keep going . If you make progress , you will_continue your journey , but be sure_that your progress -isaia- in virtue , true faith and right living . Sing then , and keep walking '' . '' Equally significant -isaia- the emphasis that young_people place on sports ; the Church should_not underestimate the potential of sports for education and formation , but instead maintain a strong presence there . The world of sport needs to be helped to overcome some of its problematic aspects , such as the idolization of champions , subservience to commercial interests and the ideology of success -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost '' . At the heart of the experience of sport -isaia- '' joy : the joy of exercising , of being together , of being alive and rejoicing in the gifts the Creator gives us each_day '' . Some Fathers of the Church used the example of the training of athletes to encourage the young to develop their strength and to overcome idleness and boredom . Saint Basil the Great , writing to young_people , used the effort demanded by athletics to illustrate the value of self sacrifice as a means of growth in virtue : '' These men endure sufferings beyond number , they use many means to build their strength , they sweat constantly as they train . in a word , they so discipline themselves that_their whole_life prior to the contest -isaia- but a preparation_for it . How then can we , who_have_been promised rewards so wondrous in number and in splendour that no tongue can recount them , even think of winning them if we do nothing other_than spend our_lives in leisure and make but half hearted efforts ? '' . Nature holds a special attraction for_many adolescents and young_people who recognize our need to care_for the environment . Such -isaia- the case with the scouting movement and other groups that encourage closeness to nature , camping trips , hiking , expeditions and campaigns to improve the environment . In the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi , these experiences can be a real initiation into the school of universal fraternity and contemplative prayer . These and various other opportunities_for evangelizing the young should_not make us forget_that , despite the changing times and sensibilities of young_people , there_are gifts of God that never grow old , for they contain a power transcending all times and places . There -isaia- the word of the Lord , ever living and effective , the nourishing presence of Christ in the Eucharist , and the sacrament of Reconciliation , which brings us freedom and strength . We can_also mention the inexhaustible spiritual riches preserved by the Church in the witness of her saints and the teaching of the great spiritual masters . Although we have to respect different stages of growth , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times need to wait patiently for the right moment , we cannot_fail to invite young_people to drink from_these wellsprings of new_life . We have no right to deprive them of this_great good . A '' popular '' youth ministry . In addition to the ordinary , well planned pastoral_ministry that parishes and movements carry_out , it -isaia-_also important to allow room_for a '' popular '' youth ministry , with a different style , schedule , pace and method . Broader and more flexible , it goes out to those places_where real young_people are active , and fosters the natural leadership qualities and the charisms sown by the Holy Spirit . It tries to avoid imposing obstacles , rules , controls and obligatory structures on these young believers who_are natural leaders in their neighbourhoods and in other settings . We need only to accompany and encourage them , trusting a little more in the genius of the Holy Spirit , who acts as he wills . We are speaking of truly '' popular '' leaders , not elitists or those closed off in small groups of select individuals . To be able to generate a '' popular '' ministry to youth , '' they_need to learn to listen to the sense of the people , to become their spokespersons and to work_for their promotion '' . When we speak of '' the people '' , we are_not speaking about the structures of society or the Church , but about all those persons_who journey , not as individuals , but as a closely bound community of all and for all , one_that refuses to leave the poor and the vulnerable behind . '' The people wants everyone to share in the common_good and thus agree to keep pace with its least members , so that all can arrive together '' . '' Popular '' leaders , then , are_those able to make everyone , including the poor , the vulnerable , the frail and the wounded , part of the forward march of youth . They do not shun or fear those young_people who_have experienced hurt or borne the weight of the cross . Similarly , especially in the case of young_people who_do_not come from Christian families or institutions , and are slowly growing to maturity , we have to encourage all the good that_we_can . Christ warned us not to see only the good grain cf . At times , in the attempt to develop a pure and perfect youth ministry , marked by abstract ideas , protected from the world and free of every flaw , we can turn the Gospel into a dull , meaningless and unattractive proposition . Such a youth ministry ends up completely removed from the world of young_people and suited only to an elite Christian youth that sees itself as different , while living in an empty and unproductive isolation . In rejecting the weeds , we also uproot or choke any number of shoots trying to spring up in spite of their limitations . Instead of '' overwhelming young_people with a body of rules that make Christianity seem reductive and moralistic , we are_called to invest in their fearlessness and to train them to take up their responsibilities , in the sure knowledge that error , failure and crisis are experiences that_can strengthen their humanity '' . The Synod called_for the development of a youth ministry capable of being inclusive , with room_for all kinds of young_people , to show that_we_are a Church with open doors . Nor does one have to accept fully all the teachings of the Church to take_part in certain of our activities for young_people . It -isaia- enough to have an open mind towards all those_who_have the desire and willingness to be encountered by God s revealed_truth . Some of our pastoral activities can assume that a journey of faith has_already begun , but we need a '' popular '' youth ministry that_can open doors and make room_for everyone , with_their doubts and frustrations , their problems and their_efforts to find_themselves , their past errors , their experiences of sin and all their difficulties . Room should_also be made for '' all those_who_have other visions of life , who belong to other_religions or who distance themselves from religion altogether . All the young , without exception , are in God s heart and thus in the Church s heart . We recognize frankly that_this statement on our lips does not_always find real expression in our pastoral actions : often we remain closed in our environments , where their voice does_not penetrate , or else we dedicate ourselves to less demanding and more enjoyable activities , suppressing that healthy pastoral restlessness that_would urge us to move out from our supposed security . The Gospel also asks us to be daring , and we want to be so , without presumption and without proselytizing , testifying to the love of the Lord and stretching out our hands to all the young_people in the world '' . Youth ministry , when it ceases to be elitist and -isaia- willing to be '' popular '' , -isaia- a process that_-isaia- gradual , respectful , patient , hopeful , tireless and compassionate . The Synod proposed the example of the disciples of Emmaus cf . Lk : as a model of what happens in youth ministry . '' Jesus walks with two disciples who did_not grasp the meaning of all that happened to him , and are leaving Jerusalem and the community behind . Wanting to accompany them , he joins them on the way . He asks them questions and listens patiently to their version of events , and in this_way he helps them recognize what they_were experiencing . Then , with affection and power , he proclaims_the word to them , leading them to interpret the events they_had experienced in the light of the Scriptures . He accepts their invitation to stay with_them as evening falls ; he enters into_their night . As they listen to him speak , their_hearts burn within them and their_minds are opened ; they then recognize him in the breaking of the bread . They themselves choose to resume their journey -atti_degli_apostoli- once in the opposite direction , to return to the community and to share the experience of their encounter_with_the risen Lord '' . Various manifestations of popular_piety , especially pilgrimages , attract young_people who_do_not readily feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home in ecclesial structures , and represent a concrete sign of their trust in God . These ways of seeking God are seen particularly in young people_who_are poor , but_also those in other sectors of society . They should_not be looked down on , but encouraged and promoted . Popular piety '' is a legitimate way of living the faith '' and '' an expression of the spontaneous missionary_activity of the People of God '' . Here I would point_out that it doesn t take much to make young_people missionaries . Even those_who_are most frail , limited and troubled can be missionaries in their_own way , for goodness can always be shared , even if it exists alongside many limitations . A young person_who makes a pilgrimage to ask Our Lady for help , and invites a friend or companion along , by that single gesture -isaia- being a good missionary . Inseparable from a '' popular '' youth ministry -isaia- an irrepressible '' popular '' missionary_activity that breaks through our customary models and ways of thinking . Let us accompany and encourage it , but_not presume to overly regulate it . If we can hear what_the Spirit -isaia- saying to us , we have to realize_that youth ministry -isaia- always missionary . Young people_are greatly enriched when_they overcome their reticence and dare to visit homes , and in this_way make contact_with people s lives . They learn how to look beyond their family and their group of friends , and they gain a broader vision of life . At the same_time , their_faith and their sense of being part of the Church grow stronger . Youth missions , which usually take_place during school holidays after a period of preparation , can lead to a renewed experience of faith and even serious thoughts about a vocation . Young people can_find new fields for mission in the most varied settings . For example , since_they are_already so familiar with social networks , they_should be encouraged to fill them_with God , fraternity and commitment . Young people need to have_their freedom respected , yet they_also need to be accompanied . The family should be the first_place of accompaniment . Youth ministry can present_the ideal of life in Christ as the process of building a house on rock cf . For most young_people , that house , their_life , will be built on marriage and married love . That -isaia- why youth ministry and the pastoral_care of families should be coordinated and integrated , with the aim of ensuring a continuous and suitable accompaniment of the vocational process . The community has an important role in the accompaniment of young_people ; it should feel collectively responsible_for accepting , motivating , encouraging and challenging them . All should regard young_people with understanding , appreciation and affection , and avoid constantly judging them or demanding of them a perfection beyond their years . At the Synod , '' many pointed to the shortage of qualified people devoted to accompaniment . Belief in the theological and pastoral value of listening entails rethinking and renewing the ways that priestly_ministry -isaia- ordinarily exercised , and reviewing its priorities . The Synod also recognized the need to train consecrated_persons and laypeople , male and female , to accompany young_people . The charism of listening that the Holy Spirit calls forth within_the communities might also receive institutional recognition as a form of ecclesial service '' . There -isaia-_also a special need to accompany young men_and_women showing leadership potential , so that_they_can receive training and the necessary qualifications . The young_people who met before the Synod called_for '' programmes for the formation and continued development of young leaders . Some young women feel that_there_-isaia- a lack of leading female role models within_the Church and they too wish to give their intellectual and professional gifts to the Church . We also believe_that seminarians and religious should_have an even greater ability to accompany young leaders '' . The same young_people described to us the qualities they hope to find in a mentor , and they expressed this with much clarity . '' The qualities of such a mentor include : being a faithful Christian who engages with the Church and the world ; someone who constantly seeks holiness ; someone who_-isaia- a confidant without judging . Similarly , someone who actively listens to the needs of young_people and responds in kind ; someone deeply loving and self aware ; someone who recognizes his or her limits and knows the joys and sorrows of the spiritual journey . An especially important quality in mentors -isaia- the acknowledgement of their_own humanity \u2013 the fact that_they_are human_beings who make mistakes : not perfect people but forgiven sinners . Sometimes mentors are put on a pedestal , and when_they fall , it may_have a devastating impact on young_people s ability to continue to engage with the Church . Mentors should_not lead young_people as passive followers , but walk alongside them , allowing them to be active participants in the journey . They should respect the freedom that comes with a young person s process of discernment and equip them_with tools to do so well . A mentor should believe wholeheartedly in a young person s ability to participate in the life of the Church . A mentor should therefore nurture the seeds of faith in young_people , without expecting to immediately see the fruits of the work of the Holy Spirit . This role -isaia- not and cannot be limited to priests and consecrated_life , but the laity should_also be empowered to take on such a role . All such mentors should benefit from being well formed , and engage in ongoing_formation '' . The Church s educational institutions are undoubtedly a communal setting for accompaniment ; they can_offer guidance to many young_people , especially_when they '' seek to welcome all young_people , regardless of their religious choices , cultural origins and personal , family or social situations . In this_way , the Church makes a fundamental contribution to the integral education of the young in various parts_of_the_world '' . They would curtail this role unduly were they to lay_down rigid criteria for students to enter and remain in them , since_they would deprive many young_people of an accompaniment that could help enrich their_lives . CHAPTER EIGHT Vocation . The word '' vocation '' can be understood in a broad sense as a calling from God , including the call to life , the call to friendship with_him , the call to holiness , and so forth . This -isaia- helpful , since it situates our whole_life in relation to the God who loves us . It makes us realize_that nothing_-isaia- the result of pure chance but_that everything in our_lives can become a way of responding to the Lord , who_has a wonderful plan_for us . In the Exhortation Gaudete et Exsultate , I spoke about the vocation of all to grow and mature for the glory of God ; I wanted '' to repropose the call to holiness in a practical way_for our own_time , with all its risks , challenges and opportunities '' . The Second Vatican Council helped us to recognize anew this call addressed to each of us : '' All the faithful , whatever their condition or state , are_called by the Lord , each in his or her_own way , to that perfect holiness by which_the Father himself_-isaia- perfect '' . God s call to friendship . The first thing we need to discern and discover -isaia- this : Jesus wants to be a friend to every young person . This discernment -isaia- the basis of all else . In the risen Lord s dialogue_with Simon Peter , his great question was : '' Simon , son of John , do you love me ? '' Jn : . In other_words , do you love me as a friend ? The mission that Peter received to shepherd Jesus flock will_always be linked to this gratuitous love , this_love of friendship . On the other_hand , there_was the unsuccessful encounter of Jesus and the rich young_man , which clearly shows_that the young_man failed to perceive the Lord s loving gaze cf . He went away sorrowful , despite his original good intentions , because he could_not turn his back on his many possessions cf . He missed the opportunity of what surely would_have been a great friendship . We will_never know what that_one young_man , upon whom Jesus gazed with love and to whom he stretched out his hand , might have_been for us , what he might have_done for mankind . '' The life_that Jesus gives us -isaia- a love story , a life history that wants to blend with ours and sink roots in the soil of our_own lives . That life_-isaia- not salvation up in the cloud and waiting to be downloaded , a new app to be discovered , or a technique of mental self improvement . Still less -isaia- that life a tutorial for finding out the latest news . The salvation that God offers us -isaia- an invitation to be part of a love story interwoven with_our personal stories ; it -isaia- alive and wants to be born in our midst so that_we_can bear_fruit just as we are , wherever we are and with everyone all around us . The Lord comes there to sow and to be sown '' . Being there for others . I would now like to speak of vocation in the strict sense , as a call to missionary service to others . The Lord calls us to share in his_work of creation and to contribute to the common_good by using the gifts we have_received . This missionary vocation thus has to do with service . For our life on earth reaches full stature when it becomes an offering . Here I would repeat that '' the mission of being in the heart of the people -isaia- not_just a part of my life or a badge I can take off ; it -isaia- not an extra or just another moment in life . Instead , it -isaia- something I cannot uproot from my being without destroying my very self . I -amos- a mission on this earth ; that_-isaia- the reason_why I -amos- here in this_world '' . It follows_that every_form of pastoral_activity , formation and spirituality should be seen in the light of our Christian vocation . Your own personal vocation does_not consist only in the work you do , though that_-isaia- an expression of it . Your vocation -isaia- something more : it -isaia- a path guiding your many efforts and actions towards service to others . So in discerning your vocation , it -isaia- important to determine if you see in yourself the abilities needed to perform that specific service to society . This gives greater value to everything you do . Your work stops being just about making money , keeping busy or pleasing others . It becomes your vocation because you are_called to it ; it -isaia- something more_than merely a pragmatic decision . In the end , it -isaia- a recognition of why I was_made , why I -amos- here on earth , and what_the Lord s plan -isaia- for my life . He will_not show me every place , time and detail , since I will_have to make my own prudent decisions about these . But he will show me a direction in life , for he -isaia- my Creator and I need to listen to his voice , so that , like clay in the hands of a potter , I can let myself be shaped and guided by him . Then I will_become what I was meant to be , faithful to my own reality . To respond to our vocation , we need to foster and develop all that_we_are . This has nothing to do with inventing ourselves or creating ourselves out of nothing . It has to do with finding our true selves in the light of God and letting our_lives flourish and bear_fruit . '' In God s plan , every man_and_woman -isaia- meant to seek self fulfilment , for every_human life_-isaia- called to some task by God '' . Your vocation inspires you to bring out the best in yourself for the glory of God and the good of others . It -isaia- not_simply a matter of doing things , but of doing them_with meaning and direction . Saint Alberto Hurtado told young_people to think very seriously about the direction their_lives should_take : '' If the helmsman of a ship becomes careless , he -isaia- fired straightaway for not taking his sacred responsibility seriously . As for our_lives , are we fully aware of the course they_are taking ? What course -isaia- your life taking ? If it -isaia- necessary to give this more thought , I would beg each_one of you to give it the highest consideration , because to get it right -isaia- tantamount to success ; to err -isaia- quite simply to fail '' . In the life of each young person , this '' being there for others '' normally has to do with two basic issues : forming a new family and working . Surveys of young_people repeatedly confirm that_these are the two major issues worrying them and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , exciting them . Both must be the object of particular discernment . Let us look briefly -atti_degli_apostoli- each of them . Love and family . Young people intensely feel the call to love ; they dream of meeting the right person with whom_they can form a family and build a life together . This -isaia- undoubtedly a vocation which God himself makes known to them through_their feelings , desires and dreams . I dwelt more_fully on this theme in the Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia . I would encourage all young_people to read especially_the fourth and fifth chapters of that Exhortation . I like to think_that '' two Christians who marry have recognized the call of the Lord in their_own love story , the vocation to form one flesh and one life from two , male and female . The Sacrament of Holy Matrimony envelops this_love in the grace of God ; it roots it in God himself . By this_gift , and by the certainty of this call , you can go forward with assurance ; you_have nothing to fear ; you can face everything together ! '' . Here , we need to remember_that God created us as sexual beings . He himself '' created sexuality , which_-isaia- a marvellous gift to his creatures '' . Within the vocation to marriage we should acknowledge and appreciate that '' sexuality , sex , -isaia-_a_gift from God . It -isaia- not taboo . It -isaia-_a_gift from God , a gift the Lord gives us . It has two purposes : to love and to generate life . It -isaia- passion , passionate love . True love_-isaia- passionate . Love between a man and a woman , when_it_-isaia- passionate , always leads to giving life . To give life with body_and_soul '' . The Synod insisted that '' the family continues to be the principal point of reference for young_people . Children appreciate the love and care of their_parents , they give importance to family bonds , and they hope to succeed in forming a family when_it_-isaia- their time . Without doubt , the increase of separation , divorce , second unions and single parent families can cause great suffering and a crisis of identity in young_people . Sometimes they must_take on responsibilities that_are not proportioned to their age and that force them to become adults before their time . Often , grandparents are a crucial aid in affection and religious education : with_their wisdom they_are a vital link in the relationship_between generations '' . It -isaia- true_that the difficulties they experience in their_own family can lead many young_people to ask whether it -isaia- worthwhile to start a new family , to be faithful , to be generous . I can tell you that it certainly -isaia- . It -isaia- worth your every_effort to invest in the family ; there you will_find the best incentives to mature and the greatest joys to experience and share . Don t let yourselves be robbed of a great love . Don t let yourselves be led astray by those_who propose a life of rampant individualism that in the end leads to isolation and the worst sort of loneliness . Today , a culture of the ephemeral dominates , but_it_-isaia- an illusion . To think that_nothing can be definitive -isaia- a deceptive lie . '' Today , there are_those_who say that marriage -isaia- out of fashion . In a culture of relativism and the ephemeral , many preach the importance of enjoying the present moment . They say that_it_-isaia- not worth making a lifelong commitment , making a definitive decision . I ask you , instead , to be revolutionaries , I ask you to swim against the tide ; yes , I -amos- asking you to rebel against this culture that sees everything as temporary and that ultimately believes you_are incapable of responsibility , incapable of true love '' . I have great confidence in you , and for this_very reason , I urge you to opt for marriage . Marriage requires preparation , and this calls for growing in self knowledge , developing the greater virtues , particularly love , patience , openness to dialogue and helping others . It also involves maturing in your_own sexuality , so that it can become less and less a means of using others , and increasingly a capacity to entrust yourself fully to another person in an exclusive and generous way . As the bishops of Colombia have taught , '' Christ knows that spouses are_not perfect and that_they need to overcome their weakness and lack of constancy so that_their love can grow and endure . For this_reason , he grants spouses his_grace , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once light and the strength enabling them to achieve progressively their ideal of married life in accordance_with God s plan '' . For those_who_are not called to marriage or the consecrated_life , it must_always be remembered that the first and most important vocation -isaia- the vocation we have_received in baptism . Those who_are single , even if not by their_own choice , can_offer a particular witness to that vocation through_their own path of personal growth . The bishops of the United States have pointed_out that '' young adulthood often signals a person s entrance into_the_world of work . What do you do for a living ? -isaia- a constant topic of conversation because work_-isaia- a major part of their_lives . For young adults , this experience -isaia- highly fluid because_they move from job to job and even from career to career . Work can dictate their use of time and can determine what_they can afford to do or buy . It can_also determine the quality and quantity of leisure time . Work defines and influences a young adult s identity and self concept and -isaia- a prime place_where friendships and other relationships develop because generally it -isaia- not done alone . Young men_and_women speak of work as fulfilling a function and providing meaning . Work allows young adults to meet their practical needs but even_more importantly to seek meaning and fulfilment of their dreams and visions . Although work may_not help achieve their dreams , it -isaia- important_for young adults to nurture a vision , learn how to work in a truly personal and life_giving way , and to continue to discern God s call '' . I ask young_people not to expect to live without working , depending on others for help . This -isaia- not good , because '' work_-isaia- a necessity , part of the meaning of life on this earth , a path to growth , human_development and personal fulfilment . In this_sense , helping the poor financially must_always be a provisional solution in the face of pressing needs '' . Hence , '' together_with_the awe filled contemplation of creation which we find in Saint Francis of Assisi , the Christian spiritual tradition has_also developed a rich and balanced understanding of the meaning of work , as , for example , in the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld and his followers '' . The Synod noted_that in the area of work , young_people can '' experience forms of exclusion and marginalization , of which_the first and most serious -isaia- youth unemployment , which in some_countries reaches exorbitant levels . Besides making them poor , the lack of work impacts negatively on young_people s capacity to dream and to hope , and it deprives them of the possibility of contributing to the development of society . In many countries , this situation depends on the fact_that some sectors of the young population lack adequate professional skills , perhaps because of deficiencies in the system of education and training . Often job insecurity among the young -isaia- linked to economic interests that exploit labour '' . This -isaia- a highly complex and sensitive issue that politics must make a priority , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- present , when_the speed of technological advances and the concern to reduce labour costs can lead quickly to the replacement of many jobs by machines . It -isaia-_also a crucial societal issue because employment for a young person_-isaia- not merely a means of making money . Work -isaia- an expression of human_dignity , a path of development and of social inclusion . It -isaia- a constant stimulus to grow in responsibility and creativity , a protection against the tendency towards individualism and personal gratification . At the same_time , it -isaia- an opportunity to give glory to God by developing one s abilities . Young people do not_always have_the chance to decide what kind of work they_will do , or how their energies and talents will be spent . Because , alongside their_own aspirations , abilities and choices , there_-isaia- the harsh reality of the job market . It -isaia- true_that you cannot live without working , and that sometimes you_have to accept whatever_-isaia- available , but I ask you never to give up on your dreams , never completely bury a calling , and never accept defeat . Keep seeking -atti_degli_apostoli- least partial or imperfect ways to live what_you have discerned to be your real calling . When we discover that God -isaia- calling us to something , that_this or that_-isaia- what we were made for \u2013 whether it be nursing , carpentry , communication , engineering , teaching , art or any_other kind of work \u2013 then we will_be_able to summon up our best capacities for sacrifice , generosity and dedication . Knowing that we don t do things just for the sake of doing them , but_rather we endow them_with meaning , as a response to a call that resounds in the depth of our being to offer something to others : that_-isaia- what makes these occupations bring a sense of deep fulfilment . As we read in the ancient biblical book of Ecclesiastes : '' I saw that there_-isaia-_nothing better_than that a man should enjoy his_work '' : . The vocation to special consecration . If we are indeed convinced_that the Holy Spirit continues to inspire vocations to the priesthood and the religious_life , we can '' once_more cast out the nets '' in the Lord s name , with complete confidence . We can dare , as we should , to tell each young person to ask whether this_-isaia- the path that_they_are meant to follow . Occasionally , I would bring this up with young_people , and they_would respond almost jokingly : '' No , that s not_for me ! '' Yet , a few years later , some of them were in the seminary . The Lord cannot_fail in his promise to provide the Church with shepherds , for without them she would_not be able to live and carry_out her_mission . If it -isaia- true that_some priests do not give good witness , that does_not_mean that the Lord stops calling . On the contrary , he doubles the stakes , for he never ceases to care_for his beloved Church . In discerning your vocation , do not dismiss the possibility of devoting yourself to God in the priesthood , the religious_life or in other_forms of consecration . Why not ? You can be sure_that , if you do recognize and follow a call from God , there you will_find complete fulfilment . Jesus -isaia- walking in our midst , as he did in Galilee . He walks through our streets , and he quietly stops and looks into_our eyes . His call -isaia- attractive and intriguing . Yet today the stress and quick pace of a world constantly bombarding us with stimuli can leave no room_for that interior silence in which we can perceive Jesus gaze and hear his call . In the meantime , many attractively packaged offers will come your way . They may seem appealing and exciting , although in time they_will only leave you feeling empty , weary and alone . Don t let this happen to you , because the maelstrom of this_world can drive you to take a route without real meaning , without direction , without clear goals , and thus thwart many of your efforts . It -isaia- better to seek out that calm and quiet that enable you to reflect , pray , look more_clearly -atti_degli_apostoli- the world around you , and then , with Jesus , come to recognize_the vocation that_-isaia- yours in this_world . CHAPTER NINE Discernment . In the Apostolic Exhortation Gaudete et Exsultate , I spoke in rather general terms about discernment . I would now like to take up some of those reflections and apply them to the way we discern our_own vocation in the world . I mentioned there that all of us , but '' especially_the young , are immersed in a culture of zapping . We can navigate simultaneously on two or more screens and interact -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with two or three virtual scenarios . Without the wisdom of discernment , we can easily become prey to every passing trend '' . Indeed , '' this_-isaia- all the more_important when some novelty presents itself in our_lives . Then we have to decide whether it -isaia- new wine brought by God or an illusion created by the spirit of this_world or the spirit of the devil '' . Such discernment , '' even_though it includes reason and prudence , goes beyond them , for it seeks a glimpse of that unique and mysterious plan that God has for each of us . It has to do with the meaning of my life before the Father who knows and loves me , and with the real purpose of my life_,_which nobody knows better_than he '' . Here we see the importance of the formation of conscience , which allows discernment to grow in depth and in fidelity to God : '' Forming our conscience -isaia- the work of a lifetime , in which we learn to cultivate the very sentiments of Jesus Christ , adopting the criteria behind his choices and the intentions behind his actions cf . In this_process of formation , we let ourselves be transformed by Christ , even as we develop '' the habit of doing good , which also -isaia- a part of our examination of conscience . We do not_simply identify sins , but_also recognize God s work in our daily lives , in the events of our personal history and the world around us , and in the witness of all those men_and_women_who have gone before us or accompany us with_their wisdom . This helps us to grow in the virtue of prudence and to give an overall direction to our life through concrete choices , in the serene awareness of both our gifts and our limitations '' . Discerning your vocation . A particular form of discernment involves the effort to discover our_own vocation . Since this_-isaia- a very personal decision that others cannot make for us , it requires a certain degree of solitude and silence . '' The Lord speaks to us in a variety of ways , -atti_degli_apostoli- work , through others and -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment . Yet we simply cannot do without_the silence of prolonged prayer , which enables us better to perceive God s language , to interpret the real meaning of the inspirations we believe we have_received , to calm our anxieties and to see the whole of our existence afresh in his_own light '' . Yet this silence does_not make us close in on ourselves . '' We must remember_that prayerful discernment has to be born of an openness to listening \u2013 to the Lord and to others , and to reality itself , which always challenges us in new ways . Only if we are prepared to listen , do we have_the freedom to set_aside our_own partial or insufficient ideas . In this_way , we become truly open to accepting a call that_can shatter our security , but lead us to a better life . It -isaia-_not_enough that everything be calm and peaceful . God may be offering us something more , but in our comfortable inadvertence , we do not recognize it '' . When seeking to discern our_own vocation , there_are certain questions we ought to ask . We should_not start with wondering where we could make more money , or achieve greater recognition and social status . Nor even by asking what kind of work would be most pleasing to us . If we are_not to go astray , we need a different starting point . We need to ask : Do I know myself , quite apart_from my illusions and emotions ? Do I know what brings joy or sorrow to my heart ? What are my strengths and weaknesses ? These questions immediately give rise to others : How can I serve people better and prove most helpful to our_world and to the Church ? What -isaia- my real place in this_world ? What can I offer to society ? Even more realistic questions then follow : Do I have_the abilities needed to offer this_kind of service ? Could I develop those abilities ? . These questions should be centred less on ourselves and our_own inclinations , but on others , so that_our discernment leads us to see our life in relation to their_lives . That -isaia- why I would remind you of the most important question of all . '' So often in life , we waste time asking ourselves : Who -amos- I ? You can keep asking , Who -amos- I ? for the rest of your lives . But the real question -isaia- : For whom -amos- I ? '' . Of course , you_are for God . But he has decided that_you should_also be for others , and he has_given you many qualities , inclinations , gifts and charisms that_are not_for you , but to share_with those around you . The call of Jesus our friend . To discern our personal vocation , we have to realize that_it_-isaia- a calling from a friend , who_-isaia- Jesus . When we give something to our friends , we give_them the best we have . It will_not necessarily be what_-isaia- most expensive or hard to obtain , but_what we know will make_them happy . Friends are so sensitive to this that_they_can already imagine the smile on their friend s face when he or she opens that gift . This sort of discernment that takes_place among friends -isaia- what I suggest you take as a model for trying to discover God s will for your lives . I want you to know_that , when_the Lord thinks of each of you and what he wants to give_you , he sees you as his close friend . And if he plans to grant you a grace , a charism that_will help you live to the full and become someone who benefits others , someone who leaves a mark in life , it will surely be a gift that will_bring you more joy and excitement than anything else in this_world . Not because that gift will be rare or extraordinary , but because it will perfectly fit you . It will be a perfect fit for your entire life . A vocation , while a gift , will undoubtedly also be demanding . God s gifts are interactive ; to enjoy them we have to be ready to take risks . Yet the demands they_make are_not an obligation imposed from without , but an incentive to let that gift grow and develop , and then become a gift for others . When the Lord awakens a vocation , he thinks not_only of what_you already are , but of what_you will one_day be , in his company and in that of others . Sheer vitality and strength of personality combine in the hearts of young_people to make_them constantly aim higher . This exuberance will be tempered by time and painful experiences , but_it_-isaia- important_for '' this youthful and still untested yearning for the infinite '' to encounter the unconditional friendship that Jesus offers us . More than rules and obligations , the choice that Jesus sets before us -isaia- to follow_him as friends follow one_another , seeking each_other s company and spending time together out of pure friendship . Everything else will come in time , and even failures in life can be an invaluable way of experiencing that friendship , which_will never be lost . Listening and accompaniment . There are_many priests , men_and_women_religious , lay and professional persons , and indeed qualified young_people , who can_help the young with_their vocational discernment . When we are called_upon to help others discern their path in life , what_-isaia- uppermost -isaia- the ability to listen . Listening calls for three distinct and complementary kinds of sensitivity . The first kind of sensitivity -isaia-_directed to the individual . It -isaia-_a_matter of listening to someone who_-isaia- sharing his_very self in what he says . A sign of this willingness to listen -isaia- the time we are ready to spare for others . More than the amount of time we spend , it -isaia- about making others feel_that my time -isaia- their time , that_they_have all the time they_need to say everything they want . The other person must sense_that I -amos- listening unconditionally , without being offended or shocked , tired or bored . We see an example of this_kind of listening in the Lord ; he walks alongside the disciples on the way to Emmaus , even_though they_are going in the wrong direction cf . When Jesus says he plans to go farther , they realize_that he has_given them the gift of his time , so they decide to give him theirs by offering their hospitality . Attentive and selfless listening -isaia- a sign of our respect_for others , whatever their ideas or their choices in life . The second kind of sensitivity -isaia- marked by discernment . It tries to grasp exactly where grace or temptation -isaia- present , for sometimes the things_that flit across our minds are mere temptations that_can distract us from our true path . I need to ask myself what_-isaia- it that the other person_-isaia- trying to tell me , what_they want me to realize -isaia- happening in their_lives . Asking such questions helps me appreciate their thinking and the effects it has on their emotions . This kind of listening seeks to discern the salutary promptings of the good Spirit who proposes to us the Lord s truth , but_also the traps laid by the evil spirit \u2013 his empty works and promises . It takes courage , warmth and tact to help others distinguish the truth from illusions or excuses . The third kind of sensitivity -isaia- the ability to perceive what_-isaia- driving the other person . This calls for a deeper kind of listening , one able to discern the direction in which that person truly wants to move . Apart from what_they are feeling or thinking right now , and whatever has happened up to this_point in their_lives , the real issue -isaia- what they_would like to be . This may demand_that they look not to their_own superficial wishes and desires , but_rather to what_-isaia- most pleasing to the Lord , to his plans for their_life . And that_-isaia- seen in a deeper inclination of the heart , beyond_the surface level of their likes and feelings . This kind of listening seeks to discern their ultimate intention , the intention that definitively decides the meaning of their_life . Jesus knows and appreciates this ultimate intention of the heart . He -isaia- always there , ready to help each of us to recognize it . We need but say to him : '' Lord , save me ! Have mercy on me ! '' . In this_way , discernment becomes a genuine means of spiritual combat , helping us to follow_the Lord more faithfully . The desire to know our personal vocation thus takes on a supreme intensity , a different quality and higher level , one_that better respects the dignity of our person and our life . In the end , good discernment -isaia- a path of freedom that brings to full fruit what_-isaia- unique in each_person , something so personal that_only God knows it . Others cannot fully understand or predict from the outside how it will develop . When we listen to others in this_way , -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain moment we ourselves have to disappear in order to let_the other person follow_the path he or she_has discovered . We have to vanish as the Lord did from the sight of his_disciples in Emmaus , leaving them alone with burning hearts and an irresistible desire to set_out immediately cf . When they returned to the community , those disciples heard the good_news that the Lord was indeed risen cf . Because '' time -isaia- greater_than space '' , we need to encourage and accompany processes , without imposing our_own roadmaps . For those processes have to do with persons_who remain always unique and free . There are no easy recipes , even_when all the signs seem positive , since '' positive factors themselves need to be subjected to a careful work of discernment , so that they_do_not become isolated and contradict one_another , becoming absolutes and -atti_degli_apostoli- odds with one_another . The same -isaia- true for the negative factors , which_are not to be rejected en bloc and without distinction , because in each_one there_may lie hidden some value which awaits liberation and restoration to its_full truth '' . If you_are to accompany others on this path , you_must be the first to follow it , day in and day out . That -isaia- what Mary did , in her_own youth , as she confronted her_own questions and difficulties . May she renew your youthfulness by the power of her prayers and accompany you always by her_maternal presence . Dear young_people , my joyful hope -isaia- to see you keep running the race before you , outstripping all those_who_are slow or fearful . Keep running , '' attracted by the face of Christ , whom we love so much , whom we adore in the Holy Eucharist and acknowledge in the flesh of our suffering brothers_and_sisters . May the Holy Spirit urge you on as you run this race . The Church needs your momentum , your intuitions , your faith . We need them ! And when_you arrive where we have_not yet reached , have_the patience to wait for us '' .

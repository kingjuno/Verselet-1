Jesus Christ -isaia- the face of the Father s mercy . These words might well sum up the mystery of the Christian faith . Mercy has become living and visible in Jesus of Nazareth , reaching its culmination in him . The Father , '' rich in mercy '' Eph : , after_having revealed his_name to Moses as '' a God merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness '' Ex : , has_never ceased to show , in various_ways throughout history , his_divine nature . In the '' fullness_of_time '' Gal : , when everything had_been arranged according_to_his plan of salvation , he sent his_only Son into_the_world , born of the Virgin Mary , to reveal his_love for us in a definitive way . Whoever sees Jesus sees the Father cf . Jesus of Nazareth , by his_words , his actions , and his entire person reveals the mercy of God . We need constantly to contemplate the mystery of mercy . It -isaia- a wellspring of joy , serenity , and peace . Our salvation depends on it . Mercy : the word reveals the very mystery of the Most Holy Trinity . Mercy : the ultimate and supreme act by which God comes to meet us . Mercy : the fundamental law that dwells in the heart of every_person who looks sincerely into the eyes of his brothers_and_sisters on the path of life . Mercy : the bridge that connects God and man , opening our_hearts to the hope of being loved forever despite our sinfulness . At times we are_called to gaze even_more attentively on mercy so that_we_may become a more_effective sign of the Father s action in our_lives . For this_reason I have proclaimed an Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy as a special time for the Church , a time_when the witness of believers might grow stronger and more_effective . The Holy Year will open on December , the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception . This liturgical feast day recalls God s action from the very_beginning of the history of mankind . After the sin of Adam and Eve , God did_not wish to leave humanity alone in the throes of evil . And so he turned his gaze to Mary , holy and immaculate in love cf . Eph : , choosing her to be the Mother of man s Redeemer . When faced_with the gravity of sin , God responds with the fullness of mercy . Mercy will_always be greater_than any sin , and no one_can place limits on the love of God who_-isaia- ever ready to forgive . I will_have the joy of opening the Holy Door on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception . On that day , the Holy Door will_become a Door of Mercy through_which anyone_who enters will experience the love of God who consoles , pardons , and instils hope . On the following Sunday , the Third Sunday of Advent , the Holy Door of the Cathedral of Rome \u2013 that_-isaia- , the Basilica of Saint John Lateran \u2013 will be opened . In the following weeks , the Holy Doors of the other Papal Basilicas will be opened . On the same Sunday , I will announce that in every local church , -atti_degli_apostoli- the cathedral \u2013 the mother church of the faithful in any particular area \u2013 or , alternatively , -atti_degli_apostoli- the co cathedral or another church of special significance , a Door of Mercy will be opened for the duration of the Holy Year . At the discretion of the local ordinary , a similar door may be opened -atti_degli_apostoli- any shrine frequented by large groups of pilgrims , since visits to these holy sites are so often grace filled moments , as people discover a path to conversion . Every Particular Church , therefore , will be directly involved in living out this Holy Year as an extraordinary moment of grace and spiritual renewal . Thus the Jubilee will be celebrated both in Rome and in the Particular Churches as a visible sign of the Church s universal communion . I have chosen the date of December because of its rich meaning in the recent history of the Church . In fact , I will open the Holy Door on the fiftieth anniversary of the closing of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council . The Church feels a great need to keep this event alive . With the Council , the Church entered a new phase of her history . The Council Fathers strongly perceived , as a true breath of the Holy Spirit , a need to talk about God to men_and_women of their time in a more accessible way . The walls which for too long had made the Church a kind of fortress were torn down and the time had come to proclaim_the Gospel in a new_way . It was a new phase of the same evangelization that had existed from the beginning . It was a fresh undertaking for all Christians to bear_witness to their_faith with_greater enthusiasm and conviction . The Church sensed a responsibility to be a living sign of the Father s love in the world . We recall_the poignant words of Saint John XXIII when , opening the Council , he indicated the path to follow : '' Now the Bride of Christ wishes to use the medicine of mercy rather_than taking up arms of severity . The Catholic Church , as she holds high the torch of Catholic truth -atti_degli_apostoli- this Ecumenical Council , wants to show herself a loving mother to all ; patient , kind , moved by compassion and goodness toward her separated children '' . Blessed Paul VI spoke in a similar vein -atti_degli_apostoli- the closing of the Council : '' We prefer to point_out how charity has been_the principal religious feature of this Council . the old story of the Good Samaritan has been_the model of the spirituality of the Council . a wave of affection and admiration flowed from the Council over the modern_world of humanity . Errors were condemned , indeed , because charity demanded this no less_than did truth , but_for individuals themselves there_was only admonition , respect and love . Instead of depressing diagnoses , encouraging remedies ; instead of direful predictions , messages of trust issued from the Council to the present_day world . The modern_world s values were not_only respected but honoured , its efforts approved , its aspirations purified and blessed . Another point we must stress -isaia- this : all this rich teaching_-isaia- channelled in one direction , the service of mankind , of every condition , in every weakness and need '' . With these sentiments of gratitude for everything the Church has_received , and with a sense_of_responsibility for the task that lies ahead , we shall cross the threshold of the Holy Door fully confident that the strength of the Risen Lord , who constantly supports us on our pilgrim way , will sustain us . May the Holy Spirit , who guides the steps of believers in cooperating with the work of salvation wrought by Christ , lead the way and support the People of God so that_they_may contemplate the face of mercy . The Jubilee year will close with the liturgical Solemnity of Christ the King on November . On that day , as we seal the Holy Door , we shall be filled , above all , with a sense of gratitude and thanksgiving to the Most Holy Trinity for having granted us an extraordinary time of grace . We will entrust the life of the Church , all humanity , and the entire cosmos to the Lordship of Christ , asking him to pour out his_mercy upon us like the morning dew , so that everyone may work together to build a brighter future . How much I desire_that the year to come will be steeped in mercy , so that_we_can go out to every man_and_woman , bringing the goodness and tenderness of God ! May the balm of mercy reach everyone , both believers and those far away , as a sign that the Kingdom of God -isaia-_already present in our midst ! . '' It -isaia- proper to God to exercise mercy , and he manifests his omnipotence particularly in this_way '' . Saint Thomas Aquinas words show that God s mercy , rather_than a sign of weakness , -isaia- the mark of his omnipotence . For this_reason_the liturgy , in one of its most ancient collects , has us pray : '' O God , who reveal your power above all in your mercy and forgiveness . '' Throughout the history of humanity , God will_always be the One who_-isaia- present , close , provident , holy , and merciful . '' Patient and merciful . '' These words often go together in the Old Testament to describe God s nature . His being merciful -isaia- concretely demonstrated in his many actions throughout_the history_of_salvation where his goodness prevails over punishment and destruction . In a special_way the Psalms bring to the fore the grandeur of his merciful action : '' He forgives all your iniquity , he heals all your diseases , he redeems your life from the pit , he crowns you with steadfast love and mercy '' Ps : . Another psalm , in an even_more explicit way , attests to the concrete signs of his_mercy : '' He executes justice for the oppressed ; he gives food to the hungry . The Lord sets the prisoners free ; the Lord opens the eyes of the blind . The Lord lifts up those_who_are bowed down ; the Lord loves the righteous . The Lord watches over the sojourners , he upholds the widow and the fatherless ; but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin '' Ps : . Here are_some other expressions of the Psalmist : '' He heals the brokenhearted , and binds up their wounds . The Lord lifts up the downtrodden , he casts the wicked to the ground '' Ps : , . In short , the mercy of God -isaia- not an abstract idea , but a concrete reality with_which he reveals his_love as of that of a father or a mother , moved to the very depths out of love for their child . It -isaia- hardly an exaggeration to say that_this_-isaia- a '' visceral '' love . It gushes forth_from the depths naturally , full of tenderness and compassion , indulgence and mercy . '' For his_mercy endures forever . '' This -isaia- the refrain that repeats after each verse in Psalm as it narrates the history of God s revelation . By virtue of mercy , all the events of the Old Testament are replete with profound salvific import . Mercy renders God s history with Israel a history_of_salvation . To repeat continually '' for his_mercy endures forever , '' as the psalm does , seems to break through the dimensions of space and time , inserting everything into the eternal mystery of love . It -isaia- as if to say that not_only in history , but_for all eternity man will_always be under the merciful gaze of the Father . It -isaia- no accident that the people of Israel wanted to include this psalm \u2013 the '' Great Hallel , '' as it -isaia- called \u2013 in its most important liturgical feast days . Before his Passion , Jesus prayed with this psalm of mercy . Matthew attests to this in his Gospel when he says_that , '' when_they had sung a hymn '' : , Jesus and his_disciples went out to the Mount of Olives . While he was instituting the Eucharist as an everlasting memorial of himself and his paschal sacrifice , he symbolically placed this supreme act of revelation in the light of his_mercy . Within the very same context of mercy , Jesus entered upon his_passion and death , conscious of the great mystery of love_that he would consummate on the Cross . Knowing that Jesus himself prayed this psalm makes it even more_important for us as Christians , challenging us to take up the refrain in our daily lives by praying these_words of praise : '' for his_mercy endures forever . With our_eyes fixed on Jesus and his merciful gaze , we experience the love of the Most Holy Trinity . The mission Jesus received_from_the Father was that of revealing the mystery of divine_love in its fullness . '' God -isaia- love '' Jn : , , John affirms for the first and only time in all of Holy Scripture . This love has now been_made visible and tangible in Jesus entire life . His person_-isaia- nothing but love , a love given gratuitously . The relationships he forms with the people_who approach him manifest something entirely unique and unrepeatable . The signs he works , especially in favour of sinners , the poor , the marginalized , the sick , and the suffering , are all meant to teach mercy . Everything in him speaks of mercy . Nothing in him -isaia- devoid of compassion . Jesus , seeing the crowds of people_who followed him , realized that_they were tired and exhausted , lost and without a guide , and he felt deep compassion for them cf . On the basis of this compassionate love he healed the sick who_were presented to him cf . Mt : , and with just a few loaves of bread and fish he satisfied the enormous crowd cf . What moved Jesus in all of these situations was nothing other_than mercy , with_which he read the hearts of those he encountered and responded to their deepest need . When he came upon the widow of Nain taking her_son out for burial , he felt great compassion for the immense suffering of this grieving mother , and he gave back her_son by raising him from the dead cf . After freeing the demoniac in the country of the Gerasenes , Jesus entrusted him_with this_mission : '' Go home to your friends , and tell them how_much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you '' Mk : . The calling of Matthew -isaia-_also presented within_the context of mercy . Passing by the tax collector s booth , Jesus looked intently -atti_degli_apostoli- Matthew . It was a look full of mercy that forgave the sins of that_man , a sinner and a tax collector , whom Jesus chose \u2013 against the hesitation of the disciples \u2013 to become one of the Twelve . Saint Bede the Venerable , commenting on this Gospel passage , wrote that Jesus looked upon Matthew with merciful love and chose him : miserando atque eligendo . This expression impressed me so much that I chose it for my episcopal motto . In the parables devoted to mercy , Jesus reveals the nature of God as that of a Father who never gives up until he has forgiven the wrong and overcome rejection with compassion and mercy . We know these parables well , three in particular : the lost sheep , the lost coin , and the father with two sons cf . In these parables , God -isaia- always presented as full of joy , especially_when he pardons . In them we find the core of the Gospel and of our_faith , because mercy -isaia- presented as a force that overcomes everything , filling the heart with love and bringing consolation through pardon . From another parable , we cull an important teaching for our Christian lives . In reply to Peter s question about how_many times it -isaia- necessary to forgive , Jesus says : '' I do not say seven times , but seventy times seven times '' Mt : . He then goes on to tell the parable of the '' ruthless servant , '' who , called by his master to return a huge amount , begs him on his knees for mercy . His master cancels his debt . But he then meets a fellow servant who owes him a few cents and who in turn begs on his knees for mercy , but the first servant refuses his request and throws him into jail . When the master hears of the matter , he becomes infuriated and , summoning the first servant back to him , says , '' Should not you have_had mercy on your fellow servant , as I had mercy on you ? '' Mt : . Jesus concludes , '' So also my heavenly Father will do to every_one of you , if you do not forgive your brother from your heart '' Mt : . This parable contains a profound teaching for all of us . Jesus affirms that mercy -isaia-_not_only an action of the Father , it becomes a criterion for ascertaining who his true children are . In short , we are_called to show mercy because mercy has first been shown to us . Pardoning offences becomes_the clearest expression of merciful love , and for us Christians it -isaia- an imperative from which we cannot excuse ourselves . At times how hard it seems to forgive ! And yet pardon -isaia- the instrument placed into_our fragile hands to attain serenity of heart . To let go of anger , wrath , violence , and revenge are necessary conditions to living joyfully . Let us therefore heed the Apostle s exhortation : '' Do not let_the sun go down on your anger '' Eph : . Above all , let us listen to the words of Jesus who made mercy an ideal of life and a criterion for the credibility of our_faith : '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_shall obtain mercy '' Mt : : the beatitude to which we should particularly aspire in this Holy Year . As we can_see in Sacred Scripture , mercy -isaia- a key word that indicates God s action towards us . He does_not limit himself merely to affirming his_love , but makes it visible and tangible . Love , after all , can_never be just an abstraction . By its_very nature , it indicates something concrete : intentions , attitudes , and behaviours that_are shown in daily living . The mercy of God -isaia-_his loving concern_for each_one of us . He feels responsible ; that_-isaia- , he desires our wellbeing and he wants to see us happy , full of joy , and peaceful . This -isaia- the path which_the merciful love of Christians must_also travel . As the Father loves , so do his_children . Just as he -isaia- merciful , so we are_called to be merciful to each_other . Mercy -isaia- the very foundation of the Church s life . All of her pastoral_activity should be caught up in the tenderness she makes present to believers ; nothing in her preaching and in her witness to the world can be lacking in mercy . The Church s very credibility -isaia- seen in how she shows merciful and compassionate love . The Church '' has an endless desire to show mercy '' . Perhaps we have long since forgotten how to show and live the way of mercy . The temptation , on the one_hand , to focus exclusively on justice made us forget that_this_-isaia- only the first , albeit necessary and indispensable step . But the Church needs to go beyond and strive for a higher and more_important goal . On the other_hand , sad to say , we must admit that the practice of mercy -isaia- waning in the wider culture . In some cases the word seems to have dropped out of use . However , without a witness to mercy , life becomes fruitless and sterile , as if sequestered in a barren desert . The time has come for the Church to take up the joyful call to mercy once_more . It -isaia- time to return to the basics and to bear the weaknesses and struggles of our_brothers_and_sisters . Mercy -isaia- the force that reawakens us to new_life and instils in us the courage to look to the future with hope . Let us not forget the great teaching offered by Saint John Paul II in his second Encyclical , Dives in Misericordia , which -atti_degli_apostoli- the time came unexpectedly , its theme catching many by surprise . There are two passages in particular to which I would_like to draw attention . First , Saint John Paul II highlighted the fact_that we had forgotten the theme of mercy in today s cultural milieu : '' The present_day mentality , more perhaps than_that of people in the past , seems opposed to a God of mercy , and in fact tends to exclude from life and to remove from the human_heart the very idea of mercy . The word and the concept of mercy seem to cause uneasiness in man_,_who , thanks to the enormous development of science and technology , never before known in history , has become the master of the earth and has subdued and dominated it cf . This dominion over the earth , sometimes understood in a one sided and superficial way , seems to have no room_for mercy . And this_-isaia-_why , in the situation of the Church and the world today , many individuals and groups guided by a lively sense of faith are turning , I would say almost spontaneously , to the mercy of God '' . Furthermore , Saint John Paul II pushed for a more urgent proclamation and witness to mercy in the contemporary world : '' It -isaia- dictated by love for_man , for all that_-isaia- human and which , according to the intuitions of many of our contemporaries , -isaia- threatened by an immense danger . The mystery of Christ . obliges me to proclaim mercy as God s merciful love , revealed in that_same mystery of Christ . It likewise obliges me to have_recourse to that mercy and to beg for it -atti_degli_apostoli- this difficult , critical phase of the history of the Church and of the world '' . This teaching_-isaia- more pertinent than_ever and deserves to be taken up once_again in this Holy Year . Let us listen to his_words once_more : '' The Church lives an authentic life when_she professes and proclaims mercy \u2013 the most stupendous attribute of the Creator and of the Redeemer \u2013 and when_she brings people close to the sources of the Saviour s mercy , of which she_-isaia- the trustee and dispenser '' . The Church -isaia- commissioned to announce the mercy of God , the beating heart of the Gospel , which in its_own way must penetrate the heart and mind of every_person . The Spouse of Christ must pattern her behaviour after_the Son of God who went out to everyone without exception . In the present_day , as the Church -isaia- charged with the task of the new_evangelization , the theme of mercy needs to be proposed again_and_again with new enthusiasm and renewed pastoral action . It -isaia- absolutely essential for the Church and for the credibility of her message that_she herself live and testify to mercy . Her language and her gestures must transmit mercy , so as to touch the hearts of all people and inspire them once_more to find the road that leads to the Father . The Church s first truth_-isaia- the love of Christ . The Church makes herself a servant of this_love and mediates it to all people : a love_that forgives and expresses itself in the gift of oneself . Consequently , wherever the Church -isaia- present , the mercy of the Father must be evident . In our parishes , communities , associations and movements , in a word , wherever there_are Christians , everyone should find an oasis of mercy . We want to live this Jubilee Year in light of the Lord s words : Merciful like the Father . The Evangelist reminds us of the teaching of Jesus who says , '' Be merciful just as your Father -isaia- merciful '' Lk : . It -isaia- a programme of life as demanding as it -isaia- rich with_joy and peace . Jesus s command -isaia-_directed to anyone willing to listen to his voice cf . In order to be capable of mercy , therefore , we must first of all dispose ourselves to listen to the Word of God . This means rediscovering the value of silence in order to meditate on the Word that comes to us . In this_way , it will be possible to contemplate God s mercy and adopt it as our lifestyle . The practice of pilgrimage has a special place in the Holy Year , because it represents the journey each of us makes in this_life . Life itself_-isaia- a pilgrimage , and the human_being -isaia- a viator , a pilgrim travelling along the road , making his way to the desired destination . Similarly , to reach the Holy Door in Rome or in any_other place in the world , everyone , each according_to_his or her ability , will_have to make a pilgrimage . This will be a sign that mercy -isaia-_also a goal to reach and requires dedication and sacrifice . May pilgrimage be an impetus to conversion : by crossing the threshold of the Holy Door , we will_find the strength to embrace God s mercy and dedicate ourselves to being merciful with_others as the Father has_been with us . The Lord Jesus shows us the steps of the pilgrimage to attain our goal : '' Judge not , and you will_not be judged ; condemn not , and you will_not be condemned ; forgive , and you will be forgiven ; give , and it will be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , will be put into your lap . For the measure you give will be the measure you get back '' Lk : . The Lord asks us above all not to judge and not to condemn . If anyone wishes to avoid God s judgement , he should_not make himself_the judge of his_brother or sister . Human beings , whenever they judge , look no farther than the surface , whereas the Father looks into the very depths of the soul . How much harm words do when_they_are motivated by feelings of jealousy and envy ! To speak ill of others puts them in a bad light , undermines their reputation and leaves them prey to the whims of gossip . To refrain from judgement and condemnation means , in a positive sense , to know_how to accept the good in every_person and to spare him any suffering that might be caused by our partial judgment , our presumption to know everything about him . But this_-isaia- still not sufficient to express mercy . Jesus asks us also to forgive and to give . To be instruments of mercy because it was we who first received mercy from God . To be generous with_others , knowing that God showers his goodness upon us with immense generosity . Merciful like the Father , therefore , -isaia- the '' motto '' of this Holy Year . In mercy , we find proof of how God loves us . He gives his entire self , always , freely , asking nothing in return . He comes to our aid whenever we call_upon him . What a beautiful thing that the Church begins her daily prayer with the words , '' O God , come to my assistance . O Lord , make haste to help me '' Ps : ! The assistance we ask for -isaia-_already the first step of God s mercy toward us . He comes to assist us in our weakness . And his help consists in helping us accept his presence and closeness to us . Day after day , touched by his compassion , we also can become compassionate towards others . In this Holy Year , we look forward to the experience of opening our_hearts to those living on the outermost fringes of society : fringes which modern society itself creates . How many uncertain and painful situations there_are in the world today ! How many are the wounds borne by the flesh of those_who_have no voice because their cry -isaia- muffled and drowned out by the indifference of the rich ! During this Jubilee , the Church will be called even_more to heal these wounds , to assuage them_with_the oil of consolation , to bind them_with mercy and cure them_with solidarity and vigilant care . Let us not fall_into humiliating indifference or a monotonous routine that prevents us from discovering what_-isaia- new ! Let us ward off destructive cynicism ! Let us open our_eyes and see the misery of the world , the wounds of our_brothers_and_sisters who_are denied their_dignity , and let us recognize_that we are compelled to heed their cry for help ! May we reach out to them and support them so they_can feel the warmth of our presence , our friendship , and our fraternity ! May their cry become our_own , and together may we break down the barriers of indifference that too_often reign supreme and mask our hypocrisy and egoism ! It -isaia- my burning desire_that , during_this Jubilee , the Christian people may reflect on the corporal and spiritual works of mercy . It will be a way to reawaken our conscience , too_often grown dull in the face of poverty . And let us enter more_deeply into the heart of the Gospel where_the poor have a special experience of God s mercy . Jesus introduces us to these works of mercy in his preaching so that_we_can know whether or not we are living as his_disciples . Let us rediscover these corporal works of mercy : to feed the hungry , give drink to the thirsty , clothe the naked , welcome the stranger , heal the sick , visit the imprisoned , and bury the dead . And let us not forget the spiritual works of mercy : to counsel the doubtful , instruct the ignorant , admonish sinners , comfort the afflicted , forgive offences , bear patiently those_who do us ill , and pray_for the living and the dead . We cannot escape the Lord s words to us , and they_will serve as the criteria upon which we will be judged : whether we have fed the hungry and given drink to the thirsty , welcomed the stranger and clothed the naked , or spent time with the sick and those in prison cf . Moreover , we will be asked if we have helped others to escape the doubt_that causes them to fall_into despair and which -isaia-_often a source of loneliness ; if we have helped to overcome the ignorance in which millions of people live , especially children deprived of the necessary means to free them_from the bonds of poverty ; if we have_been close to the lonely and afflicted ; if we have forgiven those_who_have offended us and have rejected all forms of anger and hate that lead to violence ; if we have_had the kind of patience God shows , who_-isaia- so patient with us ; and if we have commended our_brothers_and_sisters to the Lord in prayer . In each of these '' little ones , '' Christ himself_-isaia- present . His flesh becomes visible in the flesh of the tortured , the crushed , the scourged , the malnourished , and the exiled . to be acknowledged , touched , and cared for by us . Let us not forget the words of Saint John of the Cross : '' as we prepare to leave this_life , we will be judged on the basis of love '' . In the Gospel of Luke , we find another important element that_will help us live the Jubilee with_faith . Luke writes that Jesus , on the Sabbath , went back to Nazareth and , as was his custom , entered the synagogue . They called_upon him to read the Scripture and to comment on it . The passage was from the Book of Isaiah where it -isaia- written : '' The Spirit of the Lord God -isaia- upon me , because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted ; he has_sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and freedom to those in captivity ; to proclaim_the year of the Lord s favour '' Is : . A '' year of the Lord s favour '' or '' mercy '' : this_-isaia-_what the Lord proclaimed and this_-isaia-_what we wish to live now . This Holy Year will_bring to the fore the richness of Jesus mission echoed in the words of the prophet : to bring a word and gesture of consolation to the poor , to proclaim liberty to those bound by new_forms of slavery in modern society , to restore sight to those_who can_see no more because_they_are caught up in themselves , to restore dignity to all those from whom it has_been robbed . The preaching of Jesus -isaia- made visible once_more in the response of faith_which Christians are_called to offer by their witness . May the words of the Apostle accompany us : he who_does acts of mercy , let_him do them_with cheerfulness cf . The season of Lent during_this Jubilee Year should_also be lived more intensely as a privileged moment to celebrate and experience God s mercy . How many pages of Sacred Scripture are appropriate for meditation during the weeks of Lent to help us rediscover the merciful face of the Father ! We can repeat the words of the prophet Micah and make_them our_own : You , O Lord , are a God who takes away iniquity and pardons sin , who_does_not hold your anger forever , but are pleased to show mercy . You , Lord , will return to us and have pity on your_people . You will trample down our sins and toss them_into the depths of the sea cf . The pages of the prophet Isaiah can_also be meditated upon concretely during_this season of prayer , fasting , and works of charity : '' Is not this_the fast that I choose : to loosen the bonds of wickedness , to undo the thongs of the yoke , to let_the oppressed go free , and to break every yoke ? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry , and bring_the homeless poor into your house ; when_you see the naked , to cover him , and not to hide yourself from your_own flesh ? Then shall your light break forth like the dawn , and your healing shall spring up speedily ; your righteousness shall go before you , the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard . Then you shall call , and the Lord will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , here I -amos- . If you take away from the midst of you the yoke , the pointing of the finger , and speaking wickedness , if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted , then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday . And the Lord will guide you continually , and satisfy your desire with_good things , and make your bones strong ; and you shall be like a watered garden , like a spring of water , whose waters fail not '' : . The initiative of '' Hours for the Lord , '' to be celebrated on the Friday and Saturday preceding the Fourth Week of Lent , should be implemented in every diocese . So many_people , including young_people , are returning to the Sacrament of Reconciliation ; through_this experience they_are rediscovering a path back to the Lord , living a moment of intense prayer and finding meaning in their_lives . Let us place the Sacrament of Reconciliation -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre once_more in such_a_way_that it will_enable people to touch the grandeur of God s mercy with_their own hands . For every penitent , it will be a source of true interior peace . I will_never tire of insisting that confessors be authentic signs of the Father s mercy . We do not become good confessors automatically . We become good confessors when , above all , we allow ourselves to be penitents in search of his_mercy . Let us never forget_that to be confessors means to participate in the very mission of Jesus to be a concrete sign of the constancy of divine_love that pardons and saves . We priests have_received the gift of the Holy Spirit for the forgiveness of sins , and we are responsible_for this . None of us wields power over this Sacrament ; rather , we are faithful servants of God s mercy through it . Every confessor must accept the faithful as the father in the parable of the prodigal son : a father_who runs out to meet his_son despite the fact that_he_has squandered away his inheritance . Confessors are_called to embrace the repentant son who comes back home and to express the joy of having him back again . Let us never tire of also going out to the other son who stands outside , incapable of rejoicing , in order to explain to him_that his judgement -isaia- severe and unjust and meaningless in light of the father s boundless mercy . May confessors not ask useless questions , but like the father in the parable , interrupt the speech prepared ahead of time by the prodigal son , so that confessors will learn to accept the plea for help and mercy pouring from the heart of every penitent . In short , confessors are_called to be a sign of the primacy of mercy always , everywhere , and in every situation , no matter what . During Lent of this Holy Year , I intend to send out Missionaries of Mercy . They will be a sign of the Church s maternal solicitude for the People of God , enabling them to enter_the profound richness of this_mystery so fundamental to the faith . There will be priests to whom I will grant the authority to pardon even_those sins reserved to the Holy See , so that the breadth of their mandate as confessors will be even clearer . They will be , above all , living signs of the Father s readiness to welcome those in search of his pardon . They will be missionaries of mercy because_they will be facilitators of a truly human encounter , a source of liberation , rich with responsibility_for overcoming obstacles and taking up the new_life of Baptism again . They will be led in their_mission by the words of the Apostle : '' For God has consigned all men to disobedience , that_he_may have mercy upon all '' Rom : . Everyone , in fact , without exception , -isaia- called to embrace the call to mercy . May these Missionaries live this call with the assurance that_they_can fix their_eyes on Jesus , '' the merciful and faithful high_priest in the service of God '' Heb : . I ask my brother Bishops to invite and welcome these Missionaries so that_they_can be , above all , persuasive preachers of mercy . May individual dioceses organize '' missions to the people '' in such_a_way_that these Missionaries may be heralds of joy and forgiveness . Bishops are asked to celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation with their_people so that the time of grace made possible by the Jubilee year makes it possible_for many of God s sons_and_daughters to take up once_again the journey to the Father s house . May pastors , especially during the liturgical season of Lent , be diligent in calling back the faithful '' to the throne of grace , that_we_may receive mercy and find grace '' Heb : . May the message of mercy reach everyone , and may no one be indifferent to the call to experience mercy . I direct this invitation to conversion even_more fervently to those_whose behaviour distances them_from the grace of God . I particularly have in mind men_and_women belonging to criminal organizations of any_kind . For their_own good , I beg them to change their_lives . I ask them this in the name of the Son of God who , though rejecting sin , never rejected the sinner . Do not fall_into the terrible trap of thinking that life depends on money and that , in comparison with money , anything else -isaia- devoid of value or dignity . This -isaia- nothing but an illusion ! We cannot take money with us into the life beyond . Money does_not bring us happiness . Violence inflicted for the sake of amassing riches soaked in blood makes one neither powerful nor immortal . Everyone , sooner or later , will be subject to God s judgment , from which no one_can escape . The same invitation -isaia- extended to those_who either perpetrate or participate in corruption . This festering wound -isaia- a grave sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance , because it threatens the very foundations of personal and social_life . Corruption prevents us from looking to the future with hope , because its tyrannical greed shatters the plans of the weak and tramples upon the poorest of the poor . It -isaia- an evil that embeds itself into the actions of everyday life and spreads , causing great public scandal . Corruption -isaia- a sinful hardening of the heart that replaces God with the illusion that money -isaia- a form of power . It -isaia- a work of darkness , fed by suspicion and intrigue . Corruptio optimi pessima , saint Gregory the Great said with good_reason , affirming that_no_one can think himself immune from this temptation . If we want to drive it out from personal and social_life , we need prudence , vigilance , loyalty , transparency , together_with_the courage to denounce any wrongdoing . If it -isaia- not combated openly , sooner or later everyone will_become an accomplice to it , and it will end up destroying our very existence . This -isaia- the opportune moment to change our_lives ! This -isaia- the time to allow our_hearts to be touched ! When faced_with evil deeds , even in the face of serious crimes , it -isaia- the time to listen to the cry of innocent people_who_are deprived of their property , their_dignity , their feelings , and even their_very lives . To stick to the way of evil will only leave one deluded and sad . True life_-isaia- something entirely different . God never tires of reaching out to us . He -isaia- always ready to listen , as I -amos- too , along_with my brother bishops and priests . All one needs to do -isaia- to accept the invitation to conversion and submit oneself to justice during_this special time of mercy offered by the Church . It would_not be out of place -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point to recall_the relationship_between justice and mercy . These are_not two contradictory realities , but two dimensions of a single reality that unfolds progressively until it culminates in the fullness of love . Justice -isaia- a fundamental concept for civil_society , which_-isaia- meant to be governed by the rule of law . Justice -isaia-_also understood as that_which_-isaia- rightly due to each_individual . In the Bible , there_are_many references to divine justice and to God as '' judge '' . In these passages , justice -isaia- understood as the full observance of the Law and the behaviour of every good Israelite in conformity_with God s commandments . Such a vision , however , has not infrequently led to legalism by distorting the original meaning of justice and obscuring its profound value . To overcome this legalistic perspective , we need to recall that in Sacred Scripture , justice -isaia- conceived essentially as the faithful abandonment of oneself to God s will . For his part , Jesus speaks several times of the importance of faith over and above the observance of the law . It -isaia- in this sense_that we must understand his_words when , reclining -atti_degli_apostoli- table with Matthew and other tax collectors and sinners , he says to the Pharisees raising objections to him , '' Go and learn the meaning of I desire mercy not sacrifice . I have come not to call the righteous , but sinners '' Mt : . Faced with a vision of justice as the mere observance of the law that judges people simply by dividing them_into two groups \u2013 the just and sinners \u2013 Jesus -isaia- bent on revealing the great gift of mercy that searches out sinners and offers them pardon and salvation . One can_see why , on the basis of such a liberating vision of mercy as a source of new_life , Jesus was rejected by the Pharisees and the other teachers of the law . In an attempt to remain faithful to the law , they merely placed burdens on the shoulders of others and undermined the Father s mercy . The appeal to a faithful observance of the law must_not prevent attention from being given to matters that touch upon the dignity of the person . The appeal Jesus makes to the text from the book of the prophet Hosea \u2013 '' I desire love and not sacrifice '' : \u2013 -isaia- important in this_regard . Jesus affirms that , from that_time onward , the rule of life_for his_disciples must place mercy -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre , as Jesus himself demonstrated by sharing meals with sinners . Mercy , once_again , -isaia-_revealed as a fundamental aspect of Jesus mission . This -isaia- truly challenging to his hearers , who_would draw the line -atti_degli_apostoli- a formal respect_for the law . Jesus , on the other_hand , goes beyond_the law ; the company he keeps with_those the law considers sinners makes us realize the depth of his_mercy . The Apostle Paul makes a similar journey . Prior to meeting Jesus on the road to Damascus , he dedicated his_life to pursuing the justice of the law with zeal cf . His conversion to Christ led him to turn that vision upside down , to the point that he would write to the Galatians : '' We have believed in Christ Jesus , in order to be justified by faith in Christ , and not by works of the law , because by works of the law shall no one be justified '' : . Paul s understanding of justice changes radically . He now places faith first , not justice . Salvation comes not through the observance of the law , but through_faith in Jesus Christ , who in his death_and_resurrection brings salvation together_with a mercy that justifies . God s justice now becomes_the liberating force for those oppressed by slavery to sin and its consequences . God s justice -isaia-_his mercy cf . Mercy -isaia- not opposed to justice but_rather expresses God s way of reaching out to the sinner , offering him a new chance to look -atti_degli_apostoli- himself , convert , and believe . The experience of the prophet Hosea can_help us see the way_in_which mercy surpasses justice . The era in which_the prophet lived was one_of_the_most dramatic in the history of the Jewish people . The kingdom was tottering on the edge of destruction ; the people had not remained faithful to the covenant ; they_had wandered from God and lost the faith of their forefathers . According to human logic , it seems reasonable for God to think of rejecting an unfaithful people ; they_had not observed their pact with God and therefore deserved just punishment : in other_words , exile . The prophet s words attest to this : '' They shall_not return to the land of Egypt , and Assyria shall be their king , because_they have refused to return to me '' Hos : . And yet , after this invocation of justice , the prophet radically changes his speech and reveals the true face of God : '' How can I give_you up , O Ephraim ! How can I hand you over , O Israel ! How can I make you like Admah ! How can I treat you like Zeboiim ! My heart recoils within me , my compassion grows warm and tender . I will_not execute my fierce anger , I will_not again destroy Ephraim ; for I -amos- God and not man , the Holy One in your midst , and I will_not come to destroy '' : . Saint Augustine , almost as if he were commenting on these_words of the prophet , says : '' It -isaia- easier for God to hold back anger than mercy '' . God s anger lasts but a moment , his_mercy forever . If God limited himself to only justice , he would cease to be God , and would instead be like human_beings who ask merely that the law be respected . But mere justice -isaia-_not_enough . Experience shows_that an appeal to justice alone will result in its destruction . This -isaia- why God goes beyond justice with his_mercy and forgiveness . Yet this does_not_mean that justice should be devalued or rendered superfluous . On the contrary : anyone_who makes a mistake must pay the price . However , this_-isaia- just the beginning of conversion , not its end , because one begins to feel the tenderness and mercy of God . God does_not deny justice . He rather envelopes it and surpasses it with an even greater event in which we experience love as the foundation of true justice . We must pay close attention to what Saint Paul says if we want to avoid making the same mistake for_which he reproaches the Jews of his time : '' For , being ignorant of the righteousness that comes_from God , and seeking to establish their_own , they did_not submit to God s righteousness . For Christ -isaia- the end of the law , that_every one_who has faith may be justified '' Rom : . God s justice -isaia-_his mercy given to everyone as a grace that flows from the death_and_resurrection of Jesus Christ . Thus the Cross of Christ -isaia- God s judgement on all of us and on the whole_world , because through it he offers us the certitude of love and new_life . A Jubilee also entails the granting of indulgences . This practice will acquire an even more_important meaning in the Holy Year of Mercy . God s forgiveness knows no bounds . In the death_and_resurrection of Jesus Christ , God makes even_more evident his_love and its power to destroy all human sin . Reconciliation with God -isaia- made possible through the paschal_mystery and the mediation of the Church . Thus God -isaia- always ready to forgive , and he never tires of forgiving in ways that_are continually new and surprising . Nevertheless , all of us know well the experience of sin . We know that_we_are called to perfection cf . Mt : , yet we feel the heavy burden of sin . Though we feel the transforming power of grace , we also feel the effects of sin typical of our fallen state . Despite being forgiven , the conflicting consequences of our sins remain . In the Sacrament of Reconciliation , God forgives our sins , which he truly blots out ; and yet sin leaves a negative effect on the way we think and act . But the mercy of God -isaia- stronger even than_this . It becomes indulgence on the part of the Father who , through the Bride of Christ , his Church , reaches the pardoned sinner and frees him from every residue left by the consequences of sin , enabling him to act with charity , to grow in love rather_than to fall back into sin . The Church lives within_the communion of the saints . In the Eucharist , this communion , which -isaia-_a_gift from God , becomes a spiritual union binding us to the saints and blessed ones whose number -isaia- beyond counting cf . Their holiness comes to the aid of our weakness in a way_that enables the Church , with her_maternal prayers and her way_of_life , to fortify the weakness of some with the strength of others . Hence , to live the indulgence of the Holy Year means to approach the Father s mercy with the certainty_that his forgiveness extends to the entire life of the believer . To gain an indulgence -isaia- to experience the holiness of the Church , who bestows upon all the fruits of Christ s redemption , so that God s love and forgiveness may extend everywhere . Let us live this Jubilee intensely , begging the Father to forgive our sins and to bathe us in his merciful '' indulgence . There -isaia- an aspect of mercy that goes beyond_the confines of the Church . It relates us to Judaism and Islam , both of which consider mercy to be one of God s most important attributes . Israel was_the first to receive this revelation which continues in history as the source of an inexhaustible richness meant to be shared with all mankind . As we have_seen , the pages of the Old Testament are steeped in mercy , because_they narrate the works that the Lord performed in favour of his_people -atti_degli_apostoli- the most trying moments of their history . Among the privileged names that Islam attributes to the Creator are '' Merciful and Kind '' . This invocation -isaia-_often on the lips of faithful Muslims who feel themselves accompanied and sustained by mercy in their_daily weakness . They too believe_that no one_can place a limit on divine mercy because its doors are always open . I trust that_this Jubilee year celebrating the mercy of God will foster an encounter_with these religions and with_other noble religious traditions ; may it open us to even_more fervent dialogue so that we might know and understand one_another better ; may it eliminate every_form of closed mindedness and disrespect , and drive out every_form of violence and discrimination . My thoughts now turn to the Mother of Mercy . May the sweetness of her countenance watch over us in this Holy Year , so that all of us may rediscover the joy of God s tenderness . No one_has penetrated the profound mystery_of_the_incarnation like Mary . Her entire life was patterned after_the presence of mercy made_flesh . The Mother of the Crucified and Risen One has entered the sanctuary of divine mercy because_she participated intimately in the mystery of His love . Chosen to be the Mother of the Son of God , Mary , from the outset , was prepared by the love of God to be the Ark of the Covenant between God and man . She treasured divine mercy in her_heart in perfect harmony_with her Son Jesus . Her hymn of praise , sung -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the home of Elizabeth , was dedicated to the mercy of God which extends from '' generation to generation '' Lk : . We too were included in those prophetic words of the Virgin Mary . This will be a source of comfort and strength to us as we cross the threshold of the Holy Year to experience the fruits of divine mercy . At the foot of the Cross , Mary , together_with John , the disciple of love , witnessed the words of forgiveness spoken by Jesus . This supreme expression of mercy towards those_who crucified him show us the point to which_the mercy of God can reach . Mary attests that the mercy of the Son of God knows no bounds and extends to everyone , without exception . Let us address her in the words of the Salve Regina , a prayer ever ancient and ever_new , so that_she may never tire of turning her merciful eyes upon us , and make us worthy to contemplate the face of mercy , her Son Jesus . Our prayer also extends to the saints and blessed ones who made divine mercy their_mission in life . I think especially of the great apostle of mercy , Saint Faustina Kowalska . May she , who_was called to enter_the depths of divine mercy , intercede for us and obtain for us the grace of living and walking always according to the mercy of God and with an unwavering trust in his_love . I present , therefore , this Extraordinary Jubilee Year dedicated to living out in our daily lives the mercy which_the Father constantly extends to all of us . In this Jubilee Year , let us allow God to surprise us . He never tires of casting open the doors of his_heart and of repeating that he loves us and wants to share his_love with us . The Church feels the urgent_need to proclaim God s mercy . Her life_-isaia- authentic and credible only_when she becomes a convincing herald of mercy . She knows that her primary task , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment full of great hopes and signs of contradiction , -isaia- to introduce everyone to the great mystery of God s mercy by contemplating the face of Christ . The Church -isaia- called above all to be a credible witness to mercy , professing it and living it as the core of the revelation of Jesus Christ . From the heart of the Trinity , from the depths of the mystery of God , the great river of mercy wells up and overflows unceasingly . It -isaia- a spring that will_never run dry , no matter how many_people draw from it . Every time someone -isaia- in need , he or she_can approach it , because the mercy of God never ends . The profundity of the mystery surrounding it -isaia- as inexhaustible as the richness which springs up from it . In this Jubilee Year , may the Church echo the word of God that resounds strong and clear as a message and a sign of pardon , strength , aid , and love . May she never tire of extending mercy , and be ever patient in offering compassion and comfort . May the Church become the voice of every man_and_woman , and repeat confidently without end : '' Be mindful of your mercy , O Lord , and your steadfast love , for they_have_been from of old '' Ps : .

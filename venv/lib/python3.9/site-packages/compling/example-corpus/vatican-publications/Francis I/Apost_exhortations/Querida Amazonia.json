The beloved Amazon region stands before the world in all its splendour , its drama and its mystery . God granted us the grace of focusing on that region during the Synod held in Rome from October last , which concluded by issuing its Final Document , The Amazon : New Paths for the Church and for an Integral Ecology . The significance of this Exhortation . During the Synod , I listened to the presentations and read with interest the reports of the discussion groups . In this Exhortation , I wish to offer my own response to this_process of dialogue and discernment . I will_not go into all of the issues treated -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the final document . Nor do I claim to replace that text or to duplicate it . I wish merely to propose a brief framework for reflection that_can apply concretely to the life of the Amazon region a synthesis of some of the larger concerns that I have expressed in earlier documents , and that can_help guide us to a harmonious , creative and fruitful reception of the entire synodal process . At the same_time , I would_like to officially present_the Final Document , which sets forth the conclusions of the Synod , which profited from the participation of many_people who know better_than myself or the Roman Curia the problems and issues of the Amazon region , since_they live there , they experience its suffering and they love it passionately . I have preferred not to cite the Final Document in this Exhortation , because I would encourage everyone to read it in full . May God grant that the entire Church be enriched and challenged by the work of the synodal_assembly . May the pastors , consecrated men_and_women and lay_faithful of the Amazon region strive to apply it , and may it inspire in some_way every_person of good_will . Dreams for the Amazon region . The Amazon region -isaia- a multinational and interconnected whole , a great biome shared by nine countries : Brazil , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Peru , Surinam , Venezuela and the territory of French Guiana . Yet I -amos- addressing the present Exhortation to the whole_world . I -amos- doing so to help awaken their affection and concern_for that land which_-isaia- also '' ours '' , and to invite them to value it and acknowledge it as a sacred mystery . But also_because the Church s concern_for the problems of this area obliges us to discuss , however briefly , a number of other important issues that_can assist other areas of our_world in confronting their_own challenges . Everything that the Church has to offer must become incarnate in a distinctive way in each part_of_the_world , so that the Bride of Christ can take on a variety of faces that better manifest the inexhaustible riches of God s grace . Preaching must become incarnate , spirituality must become incarnate , ecclesial structures must become incarnate . For this_reason , I humbly propose in this brief Exhortation to speak of four great dreams that the Amazon region inspires in me . I dream of an Amazon region that fights for the rights of the poor , the original peoples and the least of our_brothers_and_sisters , where their voices can be heard and their_dignity advanced . I dream of an Amazon region that_can preserve its distinctive cultural riches , where_the beauty of our humanity shines_forth in so many varied ways . I dream of an Amazon region that_can jealously preserve its overwhelming natural beauty and the superabundant life teeming in its rivers and forests . I dream of Christian communities capable of generous commitment , incarnate in the Amazon region , and giving the Church new faces with Amazonian features . CHAPTER ONE A SOCIAL DREAM . Our dream -isaia- that of an Amazon region that_can integrate and promote all its inhabitants , enabling them to enjoy '' good living '' . But this calls for a prophetic plea and an arduous effort on behalf of the poor . For though it -isaia- true_that the Amazon region -isaia- facing an ecological disaster , it also_has to be made clear_that '' a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach ; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment , so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor '' . We do not need an environmentalism '' that_-isaia- concerned for the biome but ignores the Amazonian peoples '' . Injustice and crime . The colonizing interests that_have continued to expand \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 the timber and mining industries , and have expelled or marginalized the indigenous peoples , the river people and those of African descent , are provoking a cry that rises up to heaven : '' Many are the trees where torture dwelt , and vast are the forests purchased with a thousand deaths '' . '' The timber merchants have members of parliament , while our Amazonia has no one to defend her . They exiled the parrots and the monkeys . the chestnut harvests will_never be the same '' . This encouraged the more_recent migrations of the indigenous peoples to the outskirts of the cities . There they find no real freedom from their troubles , but_rather the worst forms of enslavement , subjection and poverty . Those cities , marked by great inequality , where_the majority of the population of the Amazon region now live , are witnessing an increase of xenophobia , sexual exploitation and human trafficking . The cry of the Amazon region does_not rise up from the depths of the forests alone , but_from the streets of its cities as well . There -isaia- no need_for me to repeat here_the ample diagnoses presented before and during the Synod . Yet let us -atti_degli_apostoli- least listen to one of the voices that_was heard : '' We are_being affected by the timber merchants , ranchers and other third parties . Threatened by economic actors who import a model alien to our territories . The timber industries enter_the territory in order to exploit the forest , whereas we protect the forest for the sake of our children , for there we have meat , fish , medicinal plants , fruit trees . The construction of hydroelectric plants and the project of waterways has an impact on the river and on the land . We are a region of stolen territories '' . My predecessor Benedict XVI condemned '' the devastation of the environment and the Amazon basin , and the threats against the human_dignity of the peoples living in that region '' . I would add that_many of these tragic situations were related to a false '' mystique of the Amazon '' . It -isaia- well_known that , ever since_the final decades of the last century , the Amazon region has_been presented as an enormous empty space to be filled , a source of raw resources to be developed , a wild expanse to be domesticated . None of this recognizes the rights of the original peoples ; it simply ignores them as if they did not_exist , or acts as if the lands on which_they live do not belong to them . Even in the education of children and young_people , the indigenous were viewed as intruders or usurpers . Their lives , their concerns , their ways of struggling to survive were of no interest . They were considered more an obstacle needing to be eliminated than as human_beings with the same dignity as others and possessed of their_own acquired rights . Certain slogans contributed to this mistaken notion , including the slogan '' Don t give it away ! '' , as if this_sort of takeover could only come from other countries , whereas in fact local powers , using the excuse of development , were also party to agreements aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- razing the forest \u2013 together_with_the life forms that it shelters \u2013 with impunity and indiscriminately . The original peoples often witnessed helplessly the destruction of the natural surroundings that enabled them to be nourished and kept healthy , to survive and to preserve a way_of_life in a culture which gave them identity and meaning . The imbalance of power -isaia- enormous ; the weak have no means of defending themselves , while the winners take it all , and '' the needy nations grow more destitute , while the rich nations become even richer '' . The businesses , national or international , which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the original peoples to the land and its boundaries , and to self determination and prior consent , should be called_for what_they are : injustice and crime . When certain businesses out for quick profit appropriate lands and end up privatizing even potable water , or when local authorities give free access to the timber companies , mining or oil projects , and other businesses that raze the forests and pollute the environment , economic relationships are unduly altered and become an instrument of death . They frequently resort to utterly unethical means such as penalizing protests and even taking the lives of indigenous peoples who oppose projects , intentionally setting forest fires , and suborning politicians and the indigenous people themselves . All this accompanied by grave violations of human_rights and new_forms of slavery affecting women in particular , the scourge of drug trafficking used as a way of subjecting the indigenous peoples , or human trafficking that exploits those expelled from their cultural context . We cannot allow globalization to become '' a new version of colonialism '' . To feel outrage and to beg forgiveness . We need to feel outrage , as Moses did cf . Mk : , as God does in the face of injustice cf . It -isaia- not good for us to become inured to evil ; it -isaia- not good when our social consciousness -isaia- dulled before '' an exploitation that_-isaia- leaving destruction and even death throughout our region . jeopardizing the lives of millions of people and especially_the habitat of peasants and indigenous peoples '' . The incidents of injustice and cruelty that took_place in the Amazon region even in the last century ought to provoke profound abhorrence , but_they should_also make us more sensitive to the need to acknowledge current forms of human exploitation , abuse and killing . With regard to the shameful past , let us listen , for example , to an account of the sufferings of the indigenous people during the '' rubber age '' in the Venezuelan Amazon region : '' They gave no money to the indigenous people , but_only merchandise , for which_they charged dearly and the people never finished paying for it . They would pay for it but they_were told , '' You are racking up a debt '' and the indigenous person would_have to go back to work . More than twenty ye kuana towns were entirely razed to the ground . The ye kuana women were raped and their breasts amputated , pregnant women had their_children torn from the womb , men had their fingers or hands cut off so they could_not sail . along_with other scenes of the most absurd sadism '' . Such a history of suffering and contempt does_not heal easily . Nor has colonization ended ; in many places , it has_been changed , disguised and concealed , while losing none of its contempt for the life of the poor and the fragility of the environment . As the bishops of the Brazilian Amazon have noted , '' the history of the Amazon region shows that_it_was always a minority that profited from the poverty of the majority and from the unscrupulous plundering of the region s natural riches , God s gift to the peoples who_have lived there for millennia and to the immigrants who arrived in centuries past '' . Yet even as we feel this healthy sense of indignation , we are reminded that_it_-isaia- possible to overcome the various colonizing mentalities and to build networks of solidarity and development . '' The challenge , in short , -isaia- to ensure a globalization in solidarity , a globalization without marginalization '' . Alternatives can be sought for sustainable herding and agriculture , sources of energy that do not pollute , dignified means of employment that do not entail the destruction of the natural environment and of cultures . At the same_time , the indigenous peoples and the poor need to be given an education suited to developing their abilities and empowering them . These are the goals to which_the genuine talent and shrewdness of political leaders should be directed . Not as a way of restoring to the dead the life taken from them , or even of compensating the survivors of that carnage , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- least today to be authentically human . It -isaia- encouraging to remember_that amid the grave excesses of the colonization of the Amazon region , so full of '' contradictions and suffering '' , many missionaries came to bring_the Gospel , leaving their homes and leading an austere and demanding life alongside those_who were most defenceless . We know_that not all of them were exemplary , yet the work of those_who remained faithful to the Gospel also inspired '' a legislation like the Laws of the Indies , which defended the dignity of the indigenous peoples from violence against their peoples and territories '' . Since it was often the priests_who protected the indigenous peoples from their plunderers and abusers , the missionaries recounted that '' they begged insistently that we not abandon them and they extorted from us the promise that we would return '' . Today the Church can be no less committed . She -isaia- called to hear_the plea of the Amazonian peoples and '' to exercise with transparency her prophetic mission '' . At the same_time , since we cannot deny that the wheat was mixed with the tares , and that the missionaries did not_always take the side of the oppressed , I express my shame and once_more '' I humbly ask forgiveness , not_only_for the offenses of the Church herself , but_for the crimes committed against the native peoples during the so called conquest of America '' as well as for the terrible crimes that followed throughout_the history of the Amazon region . I thank the members of the original peoples and I repeat : '' Your lives cry out . You are living memory of the mission that God has_entrusted to us all : the protection of our_common home '' . Efforts to build a just society require a capacity_for fraternity , a spirit of human fellowship . Hence , without diminishing the importance of personal freedom , it -isaia- clear_that the original peoples of the Amazon region have a strong sense of community . It permeates '' their_work , their rest , their relationships , their rites and celebrations . Everything -isaia- shared ; private areas \u2013 typical of modernity \u2013 are minimal . Life -isaia- a communal journey where tasks and responsibilities are apportioned and shared on the basis of the common_good . There -isaia- no room_for the notion of an individual detached from the community or from the land '' . Their relationships are steeped in the surrounding nature , which_they feel and think of as a reality that integrates society and culture , and a prolongation of their bodies , personal , familial and communal : '' The morning star draws near , the wings of the hummingbirds flutter ; my heart pounds louder than the cascade : with your lips I will water the land as the breeze softly blows among us '' . All this makes even_more unsettling the sense of bewilderment and uprootedness felt by those indigenous people_who feel forced to migrate to the cities , as they attempt to preserve their_dignity amid more individualistic urban habitats and a hostile environment . How do we heal all these hurts , how do we bring serenity and meaning to these uprooted lives ? Given situations like these , we ought to appreciate and accompany the efforts made by many of those groups to preserve their values and way_of_life , and to integrate in new situations without losing them , but instead offering them as their_own contribution to the common_good . Christ redeemed the whole person , and he wishes to restore in each of us the capacity to enter_into relationship_with others . The Gospel proposes the divine charity welling up in the heart of Christ and generating a pursuit of justice that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a hymn of fraternity and of solidarity , an impetus to the culture of encounter . The wisdom of the way_of_life of the original peoples \u2013 for all its limitations \u2013 encourages us to deepen this desire . In view of this , the bishops of Ecuador have appealed for '' a new social_and_cultural system which privileges fraternal relations within a framework of acknowledgment and esteem_for the different_cultures and ecosystems , one capable of opposing every_form of discrimination and oppression between human_beings '' . In the Encyclical Laudato Si , I noted_that '' if everything -isaia- related , then the health of the society s institutions has consequences for the environment and the quality of human_life . Within each social stratum , and between_them , institutions develop to regulate human relationships . Anything which weakens those institutions has negative consequences , such as injustice , violence and loss of freedom . A number of countries have a relatively low level of institutional effectiveness , which results in greater problems for their_people '' . Where do the institutions of civil_society in the Amazon region stand ? The Synod s Instrumentum Laboris , which synthesizes contributions made by numerous individuals and groups from the Amazon region , speaks of '' a culture that poisons the state and its institutions , permeating all social strata , including the indigenous communities . We are talking about a true moral scourge ; as a result , there_-isaia- a loss of confidence in institutions and their representatives , which totally discredits politics and social organizations . The Amazonian peoples are_not immune to corruption , and they end up being its principal victims '' . Nor can we exclude the possibility that members of the Church have_been part of networks of corruption , -atti_degli_apostoli- times to the point of agreeing to keep silent in exchange for economic assistance for ecclesial works . Precisely for this_reason , proposals were made -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod to insist that '' special_attention be paid to the provenance of donations or other kinds of benefits , as well as to investments made by ecclesiastical institutions or individual Christians '' . The Amazon region ought to be a place of social dialogue , especially between_the various original peoples , for the sake of developing forms of fellowship and joint struggle . The rest of us are_called to participate as '' guests '' and to seek out with_great respect paths of encounter that_can enrich the Amazon region . If we wish to dialogue , we should do this in the first_place with the poor . They are not_just another party to be won over , or merely another individual seated -atti_degli_apostoli- a table of equals . They are our principal dialogue partners , those from whom we have_the most to learn , to whom we need to listen out of a duty of justice , and from whom we must ask permission before presenting our proposals . Their words , their hopes and their fears should be the most authoritative voice -atti_degli_apostoli- any table of dialogue on the Amazon region . And the great question -isaia- : '' What -isaia- their idea of good living for themselves and for those_who will come after them ? '' . Dialogue must_not only favour the preferential option on behalf of the poor , the marginalized and the excluded , but_also respect them as having a leading role to play . Others must be acknowledged and esteemed precisely as others , each with_his or her_own feelings , choices and ways of living and working . Otherwise , the result would be , once_again , '' a plan drawn up by the few for the few '' , if not '' a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority '' . Should this be the case , '' a prophetic voice must be raised '' , and we as Christians are_called to make it heard . This gives_rise to the following dream . CHAPTER TWO A CULTURAL DREAM . The important thing -isaia- to promote the Amazon region , but this_does_not imply colonizing it culturally but instead helping it to bring out the best of itself . That -isaia-_in_fact what education -isaia- meant to do : to cultivate without uprooting , to foster growth without weakening identity , to be supportive without being invasive . Just as there_are potentialities in nature that could be lost forever , something similar could happen with cultures that_have a message yet to be heard , but are_now more_than_ever under threat . The Amazonian polyhedron . The Amazon region -isaia- host to many peoples and nationalities , and over indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation IPVI . Their situation -isaia-_very tenuous and many feel that_they_are the last bearers of a treasure doomed to disappear , allowed to survive only if they_make no trouble , while the postmodern colonization advances . They should_not be viewed as '' uncivilized '' savages . They are simply heirs to different_cultures and other_forms of civilization that in earlier times were quite developed . Prior to the colonial period , the population was concentrated on the shores of the rivers and lakes , but the advance of colonization drove the older inhabitants into the interior of the forest . Today , growing desertification once_more drives many of them_into the outskirts and sidewalks of the cities , -atti_degli_apostoli- times in dire poverty but_also in an inner fragmentation due to the loss of the values that had previously sustained them . There they usually lack the points of reference and the cultural roots that provided them_with an identity and a sense of dignity , and they swell the ranks of the outcast . This disrupts the cultural transmission of a wisdom that had_been passed down for centuries from generation to generation . Cities , which_should be places of encounter , of mutual enrichment and of exchange between different_cultures , become a tragic scenario of discarded lives . Each of the peoples that_has survived in the Amazon region possesses its_own cultural identity and unique richness in our multicultural universe , thanks to the close relationship established by the inhabitants with_their surroundings in a non deterministic symbiosis which_-isaia- hard to conceive using mental categories imported from without : '' Once there_was a countryside , with its river , its animals , its clouds and its trees . But sometimes , when_the countryside , with its river and trees , was nowhere to be seen , those_things had to spring up in the mind of a child '' . '' Make the river your blood . Then plant yourself , blossom and grow : let your roots sink into the ground forever and ever , and then -atti_degli_apostoli- last become a canoe , a skiff , a raft , soil , a jug , a farmhouse and a man '' . Human groupings , their lifestyles and their worldviews , are as varied as the land itself , since_they have_had to adapt themselves to geography and its possibilities . Fishers are_not the same as hunters , and the gatherers of the interior are_not the same as those_who cultivate the flood lands . Even now , we see in the Amazon region thousands of indigenous communities , people of African descent , river people and city dwellers , who differ from one_another and embrace a great human diversity . In each land and its features , God manifests himself and reflects something of his inexhaustible beauty . Each distinct group , then , in a vital synthesis with its surroundings , develops its_own form of wisdom . Those of us who observe this from without should avoid unfair generalizations , simplistic arguments and conclusions drawn only on the basis of our_own mindsets and experiences . Caring for roots . Here I would_like to point_out that '' a consumerist vision of human_beings , encouraged by the mechanisms of today s globalized economy , has a leveling effect on cultures , diminishing the immense variety which_-isaia- the heritage of all humanity '' . This especially affects young_people , for it has a tendency to '' blur what_-isaia- distinctive about their origins and backgrounds , and turn them_into a new line of malleable goods '' . In order to prevent this_process of human impoverishment , there_-isaia-_a_need to care lovingly for our roots , since_they are '' a fixed point from which we can grow and meet new challenges '' . I urge the young_people of the Amazon region , especially_the indigenous peoples , to '' take charge of your roots , because from the roots comes the strength that_will make you grow , flourish and bear_fruit '' . For those of them who_are baptized , these roots include the history of the people of Israel and the Church up to our_own day . Knowledge of them can bring joy and , above all , a hope capable of inspiring noble and courageous actions . For centuries , the Amazonian peoples passed down their cultural wisdom orally , with myths , legends and tales , as in the case of '' those primitive storytellers who traversed the forests bringing stories from town to town , keeping alive a community which , without_the umbilical cord of those stories , distance and lack of communication would_have fragmented and dissolved '' . That -isaia- why it -isaia- important '' to let older people tell their long stories '' and for young_people to take the time to drink deeply from that source . Although there_-isaia- a growing risk that_this cultural richness will be lost ; thanks be to God , in recent_years some peoples have_taken to writing down their stories and describing the meaning of their customs . In this_way , they_themselves can explicitly acknowledge that_they possess something more_than an ethnic identity and that_they_are bearers of precious personal , family and collective memories . I -amos- pleased to see_that people_who have lost contact_with their roots are trying to recover their damaged memory . Then too , the professional sectors have_seen a growing sense of Amazonian identity ; even_for people_who_are the descendants of immigrants , the Amazon region has become a source of artistic , literary , musical and cultural inspiration . The various arts , and poetry in particular , have found inspiration in its water , its forests , its seething life , as well as its cultural diversity and its ecological and social challenges . Like all cultural realities , the cultures of the interior Amazon region have_their limits . Western urban cultures have them as well . Factors like consumerism , individualism , discrimination , inequality , and any number of others represent the weaker side of supposedly more developed cultures . The ethnic groups that , in interaction with nature , developed a cultural treasure marked by a strong sense of community , readily notice our darker aspects , which we do not recognize in the midst of our alleged progress . Consequently , it will prove beneficial to listen to their experience of life . Starting from our roots , let us sit around_the common table , a place of conversation and of shared hopes . In this_way our differences , which_could seem like a banner or a wall , can become a bridge . Identity and dialogue are_not enemies . Our own cultural identity -isaia- strengthened and enriched as a result of dialogue_with those unlike ourselves . Nor -isaia-_our authentic identity preserved by an impoverished isolation . Far be it from me to propose a completely enclosed , a historic , static '' indigenism '' that_would reject any_kind of blending mestizaje . A culture can grow barren when it '' becomes inward looking , and tries to perpetuate obsolete ways of living by rejecting any exchange or debate with_regard to the truth_about man '' . That would be unrealistic , since_it_-isaia- not easy to protect oneself from cultural invasion . For this_reason , interest and concern_for the cultural values of the indigenous groups should be shared by everyone , for their richness -isaia-_also our_own . If we ourselves do not increase our sense of co responsibility_for the diversity that embellishes our humanity , we can hardly demand_that the groups from the interior forest be uncritically open to '' civilization '' . In the Amazon region , even between_the different original peoples , it -isaia- possible to develop '' intercultural relations where diversity does_not_mean threat , and does_not justify hierarchies of power of some over others , but dialogue_between different cultural visions , of celebration , of interrelationship and of revival of hope '' . Endangered cultures , peoples -atti_degli_apostoli- risk . The globalized economy shamelessly damages human , social_and_cultural richness . The disintegration of families that comes about as a result of forced migrations affects the transmission of values , for '' the family_-isaia- and has_always_been the social institution that_has most contributed to keeping our cultures alive '' . Furthermore , '' faced_with a colonizing invasion of means of mass communication '' , there_-isaia-_a_need to promote for the original peoples '' alternative forms of communication based on their_own languages and cultures '' and for '' the indigenous subjects themselves to become present in already existing means of communication '' . In any project for the Amazon region , '' there_-isaia-_a_need to respect the rights of peoples and cultures and to appreciate that the development of a social group presupposes an historical process which takes_place within a cultural context and demands the constant and active involvement of local people from within their_own culture . Nor can the notion of the quality of life be imposed from without , for quality of life must be understood within_the world of symbols and customs proper to each human group '' . If the ancestral cultures of the original peoples arose and developed in intimate contact_with_the natural environment , then it will be hard for them to remain unaffected once that environment -isaia- damaged . This leads us to the next dream . CHAPTER THREE AN ECOLOGICAL DREAM . In a cultural reality like the Amazon region , where there_-isaia- such a close relationship_between human_beings and nature , daily existence -isaia- always cosmic . Setting others free_from their forms of bondage surely involves caring for the environment and defending it , but , even_more , helping the human_heart to be open with trust to the God who not_only has created all that exists , but has_also given us himself in Jesus Christ . The Lord , who -isaia-_the_first to care_for us , teaches us to care_for our_brothers_and_sisters and the environment which he daily gives us . This -isaia-_the_first ecology that we need . In the Amazon region , one better understands the words of Benedict XVI when he said_that , '' alongside the ecology of nature , there exists what can be called a human ecology which in turn demands a social ecology . All this means_that humanity . must be increasingly conscious of the links between natural ecology , or respect_for nature , and human ecology '' . This insistence that '' everything -isaia- connected '' -isaia- particularly true of a territory like the Amazon region . If the care of people and the care of ecosystems are inseparable , this becomes especially important in places_where '' the forest -isaia- not a resource to be exploited ; it -isaia- a being , or various beings , with which_we_have to relate '' . The wisdom of the original peoples of the Amazon region '' inspires care and respect_for creation , with a clear consciousness of its limits , and prohibits its abuse . To abuse nature_-isaia- to abuse our ancestors , our_brothers_and_sisters , creation and the Creator , and to mortgage the future '' . When the indigenous peoples '' remain on their land , they_themselves care_for it best '' , provided_that they_do_not let themselves be taken in by the siren songs and the self serving proposals of power groups . The harm done to nature affects those peoples in a very direct and verifiable way , since , in their words , '' we are water , air , earth and life of the environment created by God . For this_reason , we demand an end to the mistreatment and destruction of mother Earth . The land has blood , and it -isaia- bleeding ; the multinationals have cut the veins of our_mother Earth '' . This dream made of water . In the Amazon region , water -isaia- queen ; the rivers and streams are like veins , and water determines every_form of life : '' There , in the dead of summer , when_the last gusts from the East subside in the still air , the hydrometer takes the place of the thermometer in determining the weather . Lives depend on a painful alternation of falls and rises in the level of the great rivers . These always swell in an impressive manner . The Amazonas overflows its bed and in just a few days raises the level of its waters . The flooding puts a stop to everything . Caught in the dense foliage of the igarapies , man awaits with rare stoicism the inexorable end of that paradoxical winter of elevated temperatures . The receding of the waters -isaia- summer . It -isaia- the resurrection of the primitive activity of those_who carry on with the only form of life compatible with the unequal extremes of nature that make_the continuation of any effort impossible '' . The shimmering water of the great Amazon River collects and enlivens all its surroundings : '' Amazonas , capital of the syllables of water , father and patriarch , you_are the hidden eternity of the processes of fertilization ; streams alight upon you like birds '' . The Amazon -isaia-_also the spinal column that creates harmony and unity : '' the river does_not divide us . It unites us and helps us live together amid different_cultures and languages '' . While it -isaia- true_that in these lands there_are_many '' Amazon regions '' , the principal axis -isaia- the great river , the offspring of many rivers : '' From the high mountain range where_the snows are eternal , the water descends and traces a shimmering line along the ancient skin of the rock : the Amazon -isaia- born . It -isaia- born every second . It descends slowly , a sinuous ray of light , and then swells in the lowland . Rushing upon green spaces , it invents its_own path and expands . Underground waters well up to embrace the water that falls from the Andes . From the belly of the pure white clouds , swept by the wind , water falls from heaven . It collects and advances , multiplied in infinite pathways , bathing the immense plain . This -isaia- the Great Amazonia , covering the humid tropic with its astonishingly thick forest , vast reaches untouched by man , pulsing with life threading through its deep waters . From the time that men_have lived there , there_has arisen from the depths of its waters , and running through the heart of its forest , a terrible fear : that_its life_-isaia- slowly but surely coming to an end '' . Popular poets , enamoured of its immense beauty , have tried to express the feelings this river evokes and the life_that it bestows as it passes amid a dance of dolphins , anacondas , trees and canoes . Yet they_also lament the dangers that menace it . Those poets , contemplatives and prophets , help free us from the technocratic and consumerist paradigm that destroys nature and robs us of a truly dignified existence : '' The world_-isaia- suffering from its feet being turned into rubber , its legs into leather , its body into cloth and its head into steel . The world_-isaia- suffering from its trees being turned into rifles , its ploughshares into tanks , as the image of the sower scattering seed yields to the tank with its flamethrower , which sows only deserts . Only poetry , with its humble voice , will_be_able to save this_world '' . The cry of the Amazon region . Poetry helps give voice to a painful sensation shared by many of us today . The inescapable truth_-isaia- that , as things stand , this_way of treating the Amazon territory spells the end for so much life , for so much beauty , even_though people would_like to keep thinking that nothing_-isaia- happening : '' Those who thought that the river was only a piece of rope , a plaything , were mistaken . The river -isaia- a thin vein on the face of the earth . The river -isaia- a cord enclosing animals and trees . If pulled too tight , the river could burst . It could burst and spatter our faces with water and blood '' . The equilibrium of our planet also depends on the health of the Amazon region . Together with the biome of the Congo and Borneo , it contains a dazzling diversity of woodlands on which rain cycles , climate balance , and a great variety of living beings also depend . It serves as a great filter of carbon dioxide , which helps avoid the warming of the earth . For the most part , its surface -isaia- poor in topsoil , with the result that the forest '' really grows on the soil and not from the soil '' . When the forest -isaia- eliminated , it -isaia- not replaced , because all that_-isaia- left -isaia- a terrain with few nutrients that then turns into a dry land or one poor in vegetation . This -isaia- quite serious , since_the interior of the Amazonian forest contains countless resources that could prove essential for curing diseases . Its fish , fruit and other abundant gifts provide rich nutrition for_humanity . Furthermore , in an ecosystem like that of the Amazon region , each part -isaia- essential for the preservation of the whole . The lowlands and marine vegetation also need to be fertilized by the alluvium of the Amazon . The cry of the Amazon region reaches everyone because '' the conquest and exploitation of resources . has today reached the point of threatening the environment s hospitable aspect : the environment as resource risks threatening the environment as home '' . The interest of a few powerful industries should_not be considered more_important than the good of the Amazon region and of humanity as a whole . It -isaia-_not_enough to be concerned about preserving the most visible species in danger of extinction . There -isaia- a crucial need to realize_that '' the good functioning of ecosystems also requires fungi , algae , worms , insects , reptiles and an innumerable variety of microorganisms . Some less numerous species , although generally unseen , nonetheless play a critical role in maintaining the equilibrium of a particular place . '' This -isaia- easily overlooked when evaluating the environmental impact of economic projects of extraction , energy , timber and other industries that destroy and pollute . So too , the water that abounds in the Amazon region -isaia- an essential good for_human survival , yet the sources of pollution are increasing . Indeed , in addition to the economic interests of local business persons and politicians , there also exist '' huge global economic interests '' . The answer -isaia- not to be found , then , in '' internationalizing '' the Amazon region , but_rather in a greater sense_of_responsibility on the part of national governments . In this_regard , '' we cannot_fail to praise the commitment of international agencies and civil_society organizations which draw public attention to these issues and offer critical cooperation , employing legitimate means of pressure , to ensure_that each government carries out its_proper and inalienable responsibility to preserve its country s environment and natural resources , without capitulating to spurious local or international interests '' . To protect the Amazon region , it -isaia- good to combine ancestral wisdom with contemporary technical knowledge , always working for a sustainable management of the land while also preserving the lifestyle and value systems of those_who live there . They , particularly the original peoples , have a right to receive \u2013 in addition to basic education \u2013 thorough and straightforward information about projects , their extent and their consequences and risks , in order to be able to relate that information to their_own interests and their_own knowledge of the place , and thus to give or withhold their consent , or to propose alternatives . The powerful are never satisfied with the profits they_make , and the resources of economic power greatly increase as a result of scientific and technological advances . For this_reason , all of us should insist on the urgent_need to establish '' a legal framework which_can set clear boundaries and ensure the protection of ecosystems . otherwise , the new power structures based on the techno economic paradigm may overwhelm not_only our politics , but_also freedom and justice '' . If God calls us to listen both to the cry of the poor and that of the earth , then for us , '' the cry of the Amazon region to the Creator -isaia- similar to the cry of God s people in Egypt cf . It -isaia- a cry of slavery and abandonment pleading for freedom '' . The prophecy of contemplation . Frequently we let our consciences be deadened , since '' distractions constantly dull our realization of just how limited and finite our_world really is '' . From a superficial standpoint , we might well think_that '' things do not look that serious , and the planet could continue as it -isaia- for some time . Such evasiveness serves as a license to carrying on with_our present lifestyles and models of production and consumption . This -isaia-_the_way human_beings contrive to feed their self destructive vices : trying not to see them , trying not to acknowledge them , delaying the important decisions and pretending that_nothing will happen '' . In addition , I would also observe that_each distinct species has a value in itself , yet '' each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will_never know , which_our children will_never see , because they_have_been lost forever . The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity . Because of us , thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their_very existence , nor convey their message to us . We have no such right '' . From the original peoples , we can learn to contemplate the Amazon region and not_simply analyze it , and thus appreciate this precious mystery that transcends us . We can love it , not_simply use it , with the result that_love can awaken a deep and sincere interest . Even more , we can feel intimately a part of it and not_only defend it ; then the Amazon region will once_more become like a mother to us . For '' we do not look -atti_degli_apostoli- the world from without but_from within , conscious of the bonds with_which_the Father has linked us to all beings '' . Let us awaken our God given aesthetic and contemplative sense_that so often we let languish . Let us remember_that '' if someone has not learned to stop and admire something beautiful , we should_not be surprised if he or she treats everything as an object to be used and abused without scruple '' . On the other_hand , if we enter_into communion with the forest , our voices will easily blend with its_own and become a prayer : '' as we rest in the shade of an ancient eucalyptus , our prayer_for light joins in the song of the eternal foliage '' . This interior conversion will_enable us to weep for the Amazon region and to join in its cry to the Lord . Jesus said : '' Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? Yet not one of them -isaia- forgotten in God s sight '' Lk : . God our Father , who created each being in the universe with infinite love , calls us to be his means_for hearing the cry of the Amazon region . If we respond to this heartrending plea , it will_become clear_that the creatures of the Amazon region are_not forgotten by our heavenly Father . For Christians , Jesus himself cries out to us from their midst , '' because the risen One -isaia- mysteriously holding them to himself and directing them towards fullness as their end . The very flowers of the field and the birds which his human eyes contemplated and admired are_now imbued_with his radiant presence '' . For all these reasons , we believers encounter in the Amazon region a theological locus , a space where God himself reveals himself and summons his sons_and_daughters . Ecological education and habits . In this_regard , we can take one step further and note that an integral ecology cannot be content simply with fine tuning technical questions or political , juridical and social decisions . The best ecology always has an educational dimension that_can encourage the development of new habits in individuals and groups . Sadly , many of those living in the Amazon region have acquired habits typical of the larger cities , where consumerism and the culture of waste are_already deeply rooted . A sound and sustainable ecology , one capable of bringing_about change , will_not develop unless people_are changed , unless they_are encouraged to opt for another style of life , one less greedy and more serene , more respectful and less anxious , more fraternal . Indeed , '' the emptier a person s heart_-isaia- , the more he or she needs things to buy , own and consume . It becomes almost impossible to accept the limits imposed by reality . Our concern cannot be limited merely to the threat of extreme weather events , but must_also extend to the catastrophic consequences of social unrest . Obsession with a consumerist lifestyle , above all when few people_are capable of maintaining it , can_only lead to violence and mutual destruction '' . The Church , with_her broad spiritual experience , her renewed appreciation of the value of creation , her concern_for justice , her option for the poor , her educational tradition and her history of becoming incarnate in so many different_cultures throughout_the_world , also desires to contribute to the protection and growth of the Amazon region . This leads to the next dream , which I would_like to share more directly with the Catholic pastors and faithful . CHAPTER FOURTH AN ECCLESIAL DREAM . The Church -isaia- called to journey alongside the people of the Amazon region . In Latin America , this journey found privileged expression -atti_degli_apostoli- the Bishops Conference in Medellin and its application to the Amazon region -atti_degli_apostoli- Santarem , followed by Puebla , Santo Domingo and Aparecida . The journey continues , and missionary efforts , if they_are to develop a Church with an Amazonian face , need to grow in a culture of encounter towards '' a multifaceted harmony '' . But for_this incarnation of the Church and the Gospel to be possible , the great missionary proclamation must continue to resound . The message that needs to be heard in the Amazon region . Recognizing the many problems and needs that cry out from the heart of the Amazon region , we can respond beginning with organizations , technical resources , opportunities_for discussion and political programmes : all these can be part of the solution . Yet as Christians , we cannot set_aside the call to faith that_we_have received_from_the Gospel . In our desire to struggle side by side with everyone , we are_not ashamed of Jesus Christ . Those who_have encountered him , those_who live as his friends and identify with_his message , must inevitably speak of him and bring to others his offer of new_life : '' Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor : . An authentic option for the poor and the abandoned , while motivating us to liberate them_from material poverty and to defend their_rights , also involves inviting them to a friendship with the Lord that_can elevate and dignify them . How sad it would be if they_were to receive from us a body of teachings or a moral code , but_not the great message of salvation , the missionary appeal that speaks to the heart and gives meaning to everything else in life . Nor can we be content with a social message . If we devote our_lives to their service , to working for the justice and dignity that_they deserve , we cannot conceal the fact_that we do so because we see Christ in them and because we acknowledge_the immense dignity that_they_have received_from God , the Father who loves them_with boundless love . They have a right to hear_the Gospel , and above all that first proclamation , the kerygma , which_-isaia- '' the principal proclamation , the one_which we must hear again_and_again in different_ways , the one_which we must announce one way or another '' . It proclaims a God who infinitely loves every man_and_woman and has revealed this_love fully in Jesus Christ , crucified for us and risen in our_lives . I would ask that_you re read the brief summary of this '' great message '' found in Chapter Four of the Exhortation Christus Vivit . That message , expressed in a variety of ways , must constantly resound in the Amazon region . Without that impassioned proclamation , every ecclesial structure would become just another NGO and we would_not follow_the command given us by Christ : '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : . Any project for growth in the Christian life needs to be centred continually on this message , for '' all Christian formation consists of entering more_deeply into the kerygma '' . The fundamental response to this message , when it leads to a personal encounter_with_the Lord , -isaia- fraternal charity , '' the new commandment , the first and the greatest of the commandments , and the one_that best identifies us as Christ s disciples '' . Indeed , the kerygma and fraternal charity constitute the great synthesis of the whole content of the Gospel , to be proclaimed unceasingly in the Amazon region . That -isaia- what shaped the lives of the great evangelizers of Latin America , like Saint Turibius of Mogrovejo or Saint Joseph of Anchieta . As she perseveres in the preaching of the kerygma , the Church also needs to grow in the Amazon region . In doing so , she constantly reshapes her identity through listening and dialogue_with_the people , the realities and the history of the lands in which_she finds herself . In this_way , she_-isaia- able to engage increasingly in a necessary process of inculturation that rejects nothing of the goodness that already exists in Amazonian cultures , but brings it to fulfilment in the light of the Gospel . Nor does she scorn the richness of Christian wisdom handed_down through the centuries , presuming to ignore the history in which God has worked in many_ways . For the Church has a varied face , '' not_only in terms of space . but_also of time '' . Here we see the authentic Tradition of the Church , which_-isaia-_not a static deposit or a museum piece , but the root of a constantly growing tree . This millennial Tradition bears_witness to God s work in the midst of his_people and '' is called to keep the flame alive rather_than to guard its ashes '' . Saint John Paul II taught that in proposing the Gospel message , '' the Church does_not intend to deny the autonomy of culture . On the contrary , she_has the greatest respect_for it '' , since culture '' is not_only an object of redemption and elevation but can_also play a role of mediation and cooperation '' . Addressing indigenous peoples of America , he reminded them that '' a faith_that does_not become culture -isaia- a faith not fully accepted , not fully reflected upon , not faithfully lived '' . Cultural challenges invite the Church to maintain '' a watchful and critical attitude '' , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time showing '' confident attention '' . Here I would reiterate what I stated about inculturation in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium , based on the conviction_that '' grace supposes culture , and God s gift becomes flesh in the culture of those_who receive it '' . We can see_that it involves a double movement . On the one_hand , a fruitful process takes_place when_the Gospel takes root in a given place , for '' whenever a community receives the message of salvation , the Holy Spirit enriches its culture with the transforming power of the Gospel '' . On the other_hand , the Church herself undergoes a process of reception that enriches her with the fruits of what_the Spirit has_already mysteriously sown in that culture . In this_way , '' the Holy Spirit adorns the Church , showing her new aspects of revelation and giving her a new face '' . In the end , this_means allowing and encouraging the inexhaustible riches of the Gospel to be preached '' in categories proper to each culture , creating a new synthesis with_that particular culture '' . '' The history of the Church shows_that Christianity does_not have simply one cultural expression '' , and '' we would_not do justice to the logic of the incarnation if we thought of Christianity as monocultural and monotonous '' . There -isaia- a risk that evangelizers who come to a particular area may think_that they_must not_only communicate the Gospel but_also the culture in which_they grew up , failing to realize that_it_-isaia- not essential '' to impose a specific cultural form , no matter how beautiful or ancient it may be '' . What -isaia- needed -isaia- courageous openness to the novelty of the Spirit , who_-isaia- always able to create something new with the inexhaustible riches of Jesus Christ . Indeed , '' inculturation commits the Church to a difficult but necessary journey '' . True , '' this_-isaia- always a slow process and that_we_can be overly fearful '' , ending up as '' mere onlookers as the Church gradually stagnates '' . But let us be fearless ; let us not clip the wings of the Holy Spirit . Paths of inculturation in the Amazon region . For the Church to achieve a renewed inculturation of the Gospel in the Amazon region , she needs to listen to its ancestral wisdom , listen once_more to the voice of its elders , recognize_the values present in the way_of_life of the original communities , and recover the rich stories of its peoples . In the Amazon region , we have inherited great riches from the pre Columbian cultures . These include '' openness to the action of God , a sense of gratitude for the fruits of the earth , the sacred character of human_life and esteem_for the family , a sense of solidarity and shared responsibility in common work , the importance of worship , belief in a life beyond this earth , and many_other values '' . In this_regard , the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Region express the authentic quality of life as '' good living '' . This involves personal , familial , communal and cosmic harmony and finds expression in a communitarian approach to existence , the ability to find joy and fulfillment in an austere and simple life , and a responsible care of nature that preserves resources for future generations . The aboriginal peoples give us the example of a joyful sobriety and in this_sense , '' they_have much to teach us '' . They know_how to be content with little ; they enjoy God s little gifts without accumulating great possessions ; they_do_not destroy things needlessly ; they care_for ecosystems and they recognize_that the earth , while serving as a generous source of support for their_life , also_has a maternal dimension that evokes respect and tender love . All these_things should be valued and taken up in the process of evangelization . While working for them and with_them , we are_called '' to be their friends , to listen to them , to speak for them and to embrace the mysterious wisdom which God wishes to share_with us through them '' . Those who_live in cities need to appreciate this wisdom and to allow themselves to be '' re educated '' in the face of frenzied consumerism and urban isolation . The Church herself can be a means of assisting this cultural retrieval through a precious synthesis with the preaching of the Gospel . She can_also become a sign and means of charity , inasmuch as urban communities must be missionary not_only to those in their midst but_also to the poor who , driven by dire need , arrive from the interior and are welcomed . In the same_way , these communities can stay close to young migrants and help_them integrate into the city without falling prey to its networks of depravity . All these forms of ecclesial outreach , born of love , are valuable contributions to a process of inculturation . Inculturation elevates and fulfills . Certainly , we should esteem the indigenous mysticism that sees the interconnection and interdependence of the whole of creation , the mysticism of gratuitousness that loves life as a gift , the mysticism of a sacred wonder before nature and all its forms of life . At the same_time , though , we are_called to turn this relationship_with God present in the cosmos into an increasingly personal relationship_with a '' Thou '' who sustains our_lives and wants to give_them a meaning , a '' Thou '' who knows us and loves us : '' Shadows float from me , dead wood . But the star -isaia- born without reproach over the expert hands of this child , that conquer the waters and the night . It has to be enough for me to know_that you_know me completely , from before my days '' . Similarly , a relationship_with Jesus Christ , true God and true man , liberator and redeemer , -isaia- not inimical to the markedly cosmic worldview that characterizes the indigenous peoples , since he -isaia-_also the Risen Lord who permeates all things . In Christian experience , '' all the creatures of the material universe find_their true meaning in the incarnate Word , for the Son of God has incorporated in his person part of the material world , planting in it a seed of definitive transformation '' . He -isaia- present in a glorious and mysterious way in the river , the trees , the fish and the wind , as the Lord who reigns in creation without ever losing his transfigured wounds , while in the Eucharist he takes up the elements of this_world and confers on all things the meaning of the paschal gift . Social and spiritual inculturation . Given the situation of poverty and neglect experienced by so many inhabitants of the Amazon region , inculturation will necessarily have a markedly social cast , accompanied by a resolute defence of human_rights ; in this_way it will reveal the face of Christ , who '' wished with_special tenderness to be identified with the weak and the poor '' . Indeed , '' from the heart of the Gospel we see the profound connection_between evangelization and human advancement '' . For Christian communities , this entails a clear commitment to the justice of God s kingdom through work_for the advancement of those_who_have been '' discarded '' . It follows_that a suitable training of pastoral workers in the Church s social_doctrine -isaia- most important . At the same_time , the inculturation of the Gospel in the Amazon region must better integrate the social and the spiritual , so that the poor do not_have to look outside the Church for a spirituality that responds to their deepest yearnings . This does_not_mean an alienating and individualistic religiosity that_would silence social demands for a more dignified life , but neither does it mean ignoring the transcendent and spiritual dimension , as if material development alone were sufficient for human_beings . We are thus called not merely to join those two things , but to connect them -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper level . In this_way , we will reveal the true beauty of the Gospel , which fully humanizes , integrally dignifies persons and peoples , and brings fulfilment to every heart and the whole of life . Starting points for an Amazonian holiness . This will_give rise to witnesses of holiness with an Amazonian face , not imitations of models imported from other places . A holiness born of encounter and engagement , contemplation and service , receptive solitude and life in community , cheerful sobriety and the struggle for_justice . A holiness attained by '' each_individual in his or her_own way '' , but_also by peoples , where grace becomes incarnate and shines_forth with distinctive features . Let us imagine a holiness with Amazonian features , called to challenge the universal Church . A process of inculturation involving not_only individuals but_also peoples demands a respectful and understanding love for those peoples . This process has_already begun in much of the Amazon region . More than forty years_ago , the bishops of the Peruvian Amazon pointed_out that in many of the groups present in that region , those to be evangelized , shaped by a varied and changing culture , have_been '' initially evangelized '' . As a result , they possess '' certain features of popular Catholicism that , perhaps originally introduced by pastoral workers , are_now something_that the people_have made their_own , even changing their meaning and handing them down from generation to generation '' . Let us not be quick to describe as superstition or paganism certain religious practices that arise spontaneously from the life of peoples . Rather , we ought to know_how to distinguish the wheat growing alongside the tares , for '' popular_piety can enable us to see_how the faith , once received , becomes embodied in a culture and -isaia- constantly passed on '' . It -isaia- possible to take up an indigenous symbol in some_way , without necessarily considering it as idolatry . A myth charged with spiritual meaning can be used to advantage and not_always considered a pagan error . Some religious festivals have a sacred meaning and are occasions for gathering and fraternity , albeit in need of a gradual process of purification or maturation . A missionary of souls will try to discover the legitimate needs and concerns that seek an outlet in -atti_degli_apostoli- times imperfect , partial or mistaken religious expressions , and will attempt to respond to them_with an inculturated spirituality . Such a spirituality will certainly be centred on the one God and Lord , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time in contact_with_the daily needs of people_who strive for a dignified life , who want to enjoy life s blessings , to find peace and harmony , to resolve family problems , to care_for their illnesses , and to see their_children grow up happy . The greatest danger would be to prevent them_from encountering Christ by presenting him as an enemy of joy or as someone indifferent to human questions and difficulties . Nowadays , it -isaia- essential to show that holiness takes nothing away from our '' energy , vitality or joy '' . The inculturation of the liturgy . The inculturation of Christian spirituality in the cultures of the original peoples can benefit in a particular_way from the sacraments , since_they unite the divine and the cosmic , grace and creation . In the Amazon region , the sacraments should_not be viewed in discontinuity with creation . They '' are a privileged way_in_which nature_-isaia- taken up by God to become a means of mediating supernatural life '' . They are the fulfillment of creation , in which nature_-isaia- elevated to become a locus and instrument of grace , enabling us '' to embrace the world on a different plane '' . In the Eucharist , God , '' in the culmination of the mystery of the Incarnation , chose to reach our intimate depths through a fragment of matter '' . The Eucharist '' joins heaven and earth ; it embraces and penetrates all creation '' . For this_reason , it can be a '' motivation for our concerns for the environment , directing us to be stewards of all creation '' . In this_sense , '' encountering God does_not_mean fleeing from this_world or turning our back on nature '' . It means that_we_can take up into the liturgy many elements proper to the experience of indigenous peoples in their contact_with nature , and respect native forms of expression in song , dance , rituals , gestures and symbols . The Second Vatican Council called_for this effort to inculturate the liturgy among indigenous peoples ; over fifty years have passed and we still have far to go along these lines . On Sunday , '' Christian spirituality incorporates the value of relaxation and festivity . Nowadays we tend to demean contemplative rest as something unproductive and unnecessary , but this_-isaia- to do away with the very thing which_-isaia- most important about work : its meaning . We are_called to include in our work a dimension of receptivity and gratuity '' . Aboriginal peoples are familiar with this gratuity and this healthy contemplative leisure . Our celebrations should help_them experience this in the Sunday liturgy and encounter the light of God s word and the Eucharist , which illumines our daily existence . The sacraments reveal and communicate the God who_-isaia- close and who comes with mercy to heal and strengthen his_children . Consequently , they_should be accessible , especially_for the poor , and must_never be refused for financial reasons . Nor -isaia- there room , in the presence of the poor and forgotten of the Amazon region , for a discipline that excludes and turns people away , for in that way_they end up being discarded by a Church that_has become a toll house . Rather , '' in such difficult situations of need , the Church must be particularly concerned to offer understanding , comfort and acceptance , rather_than imposing straightaway a set of rules that_only lead people to feel judged and abandoned by the very Mother called to show them God s mercy '' . For the Church , mercy can become a mere sentimental catchword unless it finds concrete expression in her pastoral outreach . Inculturation of forms of ministry . Inculturation should_also be increasingly reflected in an incarnate form of ecclesial organization and ministry . If we are to inculturate spirituality , holiness and the Gospel itself , how_can we not consider an inculturation of the ways we structure and carry_out ecclesial ministries ? The pastoral presence of the Church in the Amazon region -isaia- uneven , due in part to the vast expanse of the territory , its many remote places , its broad cultural diversity , its grave social problems , and the preference of some peoples to live in isolation . We cannot remain unconcerned ; a specific and courageous response -isaia- required of the Church . Efforts need to be made to configure ministry in such_a_way_that it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a more frequent celebration of the Eucharist , even in the remotest and most isolated communities . At Aparecida , all were asked to heed the lament of the many Amazonian communities '' deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time '' . There -isaia-_also a need_for ministers who_can understand Amazonian sensibilities and cultures from within . The way of shaping priestly life and ministry -isaia- not monolithic ; it develops distinctive traits in different parts_of_the_world . This -isaia- why it -isaia- important to determine what_-isaia- most specific to a priest , what cannot be delegated . The answer lies in the sacrament of Holy Orders , which configures him to Christ the priest . The first conclusion , then , -isaia- that the exclusive character received in Holy Orders qualifies the priest alone to preside -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharist . That -isaia-_his particular , principal and non delegable function . There are_those_who think_that what distinguishes the priest_-isaia- power , the fact that_he_-isaia- the highest authority in the community . Yet Saint John Paul II explained that , although the priesthood -isaia- considered '' hierarchical '' , this function -isaia- not meant to be superior to the others , but_rather -isaia- '' totally ordered to the holiness of Christ s members '' . When the priest_-isaia- said to be a sign of '' Christ the head '' , this refers principally to the fact_that Christ -isaia-_the_source of all grace : he -isaia- the head of the Church because '' he has the power of pouring out grace upon all the members of the Church '' . The priest_-isaia- a sign of that head and wellspring of grace above all when he celebrates the Eucharist , the source and summit of the entire Christian life . That -isaia-_his great power , a power that can_only be received in the sacrament of Holy Orders . For this_reason , only the priest can say : '' This -isaia- my body '' . There are other_words too , that he alone_can speak : '' I absolve you from your sins '' . Because sacramental forgiveness -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a worthy celebration of the Eucharist . These two sacraments lie -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the priest s exclusive identity . In the specific circumstances of the Amazon region , particularly in its forests and more remote places , a way must be found to ensure this priestly_ministry . The laity can proclaim God s word , teach , organize communities , celebrate certain sacraments , seek different_ways to express popular devotion and develop the multitude of gifts that the Spirit pours out in their midst . But they_need the celebration of the Eucharist because it '' makes_the Church '' . We can even say that '' no Christian community -isaia- built up which_does_not grow from and hinge on the celebration of the most_holy Eucharist '' . If we are truly convinced that_this_-isaia- the case , then every_effort should be made to ensure_that the Amazonian peoples do not lack this food of new_life and the sacrament of forgiveness . This urgent_need leads me to urge all bishops , especially_those in Latin America , not_only to promote prayer_for priestly vocations , but_also to be more generous in encouraging those_who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region . At the same_time , it -isaia- appropriate that the structure and content of both initial and ongoing priestly formation be thoroughly revised , so that priests can acquire the attitudes and abilities demanded by dialogue_with Amazonian cultures . This formation must be preeminently pastoral and favour the development of priestly mercy . Communities filled_with life . The Eucharist -isaia-_also the great sacrament that signifies and realizes the Church s unity . It -isaia- celebrated '' so that_from being strangers , dispersed and indifferent to each another , we may_become united , equals and friends '' . The one_who presides -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharist must foster communion , which_-isaia-_not just any unity , but one_that welcomes the abundant variety of gifts and charisms that the Spirit pours out upon the community . The Eucharist , then , as source and summit , requires the development of that rich variety . Priests are necessary , but_this does_not_mean that permanent deacons of whom there_should be many more in the Amazon region , religious women and lay persons cannot regularly assume important responsibilities for the growth of communities , and perform those functions ever more_effectively with the aid of a suitable accompaniment . Consequently , it -isaia- not_simply a question of facilitating a greater presence of ordained ministers who_can celebrate the Eucharist . That would be a very narrow aim , were we not also to strive to awaken new_life in communities . We need to promote an encounter_with God s word and growth in holiness through various kinds of lay service that call_for a process of education \u2013 biblical , doctrinal , spiritual and practical \u2013 and a variety of programmes of ongoing_formation . A Church of Amazonian features requires the stable presence of mature and lay leaders endowed_with authority and familiar with the languages , cultures , spiritual experience and communal way_of_life in the different places , but_also open to the multiplicity of gifts that the Holy Spirit bestows on every_one . For wherever there_-isaia- a particular need , he has_already poured out the charisms that_can meet it . This requires the Church to be open to the Spirit s boldness , to trust in , and concretely to permit , the growth of a specific ecclesial culture that_-isaia- distinctively lay . The challenges in the Amazon region demand of the Church a special effort to be present -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , and this can_only be possible through the vigorous , broad and active involvement of the laity . Many consecrated_persons have devoted their energies and a good part of their_lives in service to the Kingdom of God in Amazonia . The consecrated_life , as capable of dialogue , synthesis , incarnation and prophecy , has a special place in this diverse and harmonious configuration of the Church in the Amazon region . But it needs a new impetus to inculturation , one that_would combine creativity , missionary boldness , sensitivity and the strength typical of community life . Base communities , when able to combine the defence of social rights with missionary proclamation and spirituality , have_been authentic experiences of synodality in the Church s journey of evangelization in the Amazon region . In many cases they '' have helped form Christians committed to their_faith , disciples and missionaries of the Lord , as -isaia- attested by the generous commitment of so many of their members , even to the point of shedding their blood '' . I encourage the growth of the collaborative efforts being made through the Pan Amazonian Ecclesial Network and other associations to implement the proposal of Aparecida to '' establish a collaborative ministry among the local_churches of the various South American countries in the Amazon basin , with differentiated priorities '' . This applies particularly to relations_between Churches located on the borders between nations . Finally , I would note that we cannot always plan projects with stable communities in mind , because the Amazonian region sees a great deal of internal mobility , constant and frequently pendular migration ; '' the region has effectively become a migration corridor '' . '' Transhumance in the Amazon has not_been well understood or sufficiently examined from the pastoral standpoint '' . Consequently , thought should be given to itinerant missionary teams and '' support provided for the presence and mobility of consecrated men_and_women closest to those_who_are most impoverished and excluded '' . This -isaia-_also a challenge for our urban communities , which ought to come up with creative and generous ways , especially on the outskirts , to be close and welcoming to families and young_people who arrive from the interior . The strength and gift of women . In the Amazon region , there_are communities that_have long preserved and handed on the faith even_though no priest has come their_way , even_for decades . This could happen because of the presence of strong and generous women_who , undoubtedly called and prompted by the Holy Spirit , baptized , catechized , prayed and acted as missionaries . For centuries , women have kept the Church alive in those places through_their remarkable devotion and deep faith . Some of them , speaking -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod , moved us profoundly by their testimony . This summons us to broaden our vision , lest we restrict our understanding of the Church to her functional structures . Such a reductionism would lead us to believe_that women would be granted a greater status and participation in the Church only if they_were admitted to Holy Orders . But that approach would in fact narrow our vision ; it would lead us to clericalize women , diminish the great value of what_they have_already accomplished , and subtly make_their indispensable contribution less effective . Jesus Christ appears as the Spouse of the community that celebrates the Eucharist through the figure of a man_who presides as a sign of the one Priest . This dialogue_between the Spouse and his Bride , which arises in adoration and sanctifies the community , should_not trap us in partial conceptions of power in the Church . The Lord chose to reveal his_power and his_love through two human faces : the face of his_divine Son made man and the face of a creature , a woman , Mary . Women make_their contribution to the Church in a way that_-isaia- properly theirs , by making present_the tender strength of Mary , the Mother . As a result , we do not limit ourselves to a functional approach , but enter instead into the inmost structure of the Church . In this_way , we will fundamentally realize why , without women , the Church breaks down , and how_many communities in the Amazon would_have collapsed , had women not_been there to sustain them , keep them together and care_for them . This shows the kind of power that_-isaia- typically theirs . We must keep encouraging those simple and straightforward gifts that enabled women in the Amazon region to play so active a role in society , even_though communities now face many new and unprecedented threats . The present situation requires us to encourage the emergence of other_forms of service and charisms that_are proper to women and responsive to the specific needs of the peoples of the Amazon region -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment in history . In a synodal Church , those women_who in fact have a central part to play in Amazonian communities should_have access to positions , including ecclesial services , that do not entail Holy Orders and that_can better signify the role that_-isaia- theirs . Here it should be noted_that these services entail stability , public recognition and a commission from the bishop . This would also allow women to have a real and effective impact on the organization , the most important decisions and the direction of communities , while continuing to do so in a way_that reflects their womanhood . Expanding horizons beyond conflicts . It often happens_that in particular places pastoral workers envisage very different solutions to the problems they face , and consequently propose apparently opposed forms of ecclesial organization . When this occurs , it -isaia- probable that the real response to the challenges of evangelization lies in transcending the two approaches and finding other , better ways , perhaps not_yet even imagined . Conflict -isaia- overcome -atti_degli_apostoli- a higher level , where each group can join the other in a new reality , while remaining faithful to itself . Everything -isaia- resolved '' on a higher plane and preserves what_-isaia- valid and useful on both sides '' . Otherwise , conflict traps us ; '' we lose our perspective , our horizons shrink and reality itself begins to fall apart '' . In no way does this mean relativizing problems , fleeing from them or letting things stay as they_are . Authentic solutions are never found by dampening boldness , shirking concrete demands or assigning blame to others . On the contrary , solutions are_found by '' overflow '' , that_-isaia- , by transcending the contraposition that limits our vision and recognizing a greater gift that God -isaia- offering . From that new gift , accepted with boldness and generosity , from that unexpected gift_which awakens a new and greater creativity , there_will pour forth as from an overflowing fountain the answers that contraposition did not_allow us to see . In its earliest days , the Christian faith spread remarkably in accordance_with this_way of thinking , which enabled it , from its Jewish roots , to take shape in the Greco Roman cultures , and in time to acquire distinctive forms . Similarly , in this historical moment , the Amazon region challenges us to transcend limited perspectives and '' pragmatic '' solutions mired in partial approaches , in order to seek paths of inculturation that_are broader and bolder . Ecumenical and interreligious coexistence . In an Amazonian region characterized by many religions , we believers need to find occasions to speak to one_another and to act together for the common_good and the promotion of the poor . This has nothing to do with watering down or concealing our deepest convictions when we encounter others_who think differently than ourselves . If we believe_that the Holy Spirit can work amid differences , then we will try to let ourselves be enriched by that insight , while embracing it from the core of our_own convictions and our_own identity . For the deeper , stronger and richer that identity -isaia- , the more we will be capable of enriching others with_our own proper contribution . We Catholics possess in sacred Scripture a treasure that other_religions do not accept , even_though -atti_degli_apostoli- times they_may read it with interest and even esteem some of its teachings . We attempt to do something similar with the sacred texts of other_religions and religious communities , which contain '' precepts and doctrines that . often reflect a ray of that truth_which enlightens all men_and_women '' . We also possess a great treasure in the seven sacraments , which some Christian communities do not acceptin their totality or in the same sense . At the same_time that we believe firmly in Jesus as the sole Redeemer of the world , we cultivate a deep devotion to his Mother . Even though we know that_this_-isaia- not the case with all Christian confessions , we feel it our_duty to share_with the Amazon region the treasure of that warm , maternal love_which we ourselves have_received . In fact , I will conclude this Exhortation with a few words addressed to Mary . None of this needs to create enmity between us . In a true spirit of dialogue , we grow in our ability to grasp the significance of what others say and do , even if we cannot accept it as our_own conviction . In this_way , it becomes possible to be frank and open about our beliefs , while continuing to discuss , to seek points of contact , and above all , to work and struggle together for the good of the Amazon region . The strength of what unites all of us as Christians -isaia- supremely important . We can be so attentive to what divides us that -atti_degli_apostoli- times we no longer appreciate or value what unites us . And what unites us -isaia- what lets us remain in this_world without being swallowed up by its immanence , its spiritual emptiness , its complacent selfishness , its consumerist and self destructive individualism . All of us , as Christians , are_united by faith in God , the Father who_gives us life and loves us so greatly . We are_united by faith in Jesus Christ , the one Saviour , who set us free by his precious blood and his glorious resurrection . We are_united by our desire_for his_word that guides our steps . We are_united by the fire of the Spirit , who sends us forth on mission . We are_united by the new commandment that Jesus left us , by the pursuit of the civilization of love and by passion for the kingdom that the Lord calls us to build with_him . We are_united by the struggle for peace and justice . We are_united by the conviction_that not everything ends with this_life , but that_we_are called to the heavenly banquet , where God will wipe away every tear and take up all that we did for those who_suffer . All this unites us . How can we not struggle together ? How can we not pray and work together , side by side , to defend the poor of the Amazon region , to show the sacred countenance of the Lord , and to care_for his_work of creation ? CONCLUSION MOTHER OF THE AMAZON REGION . After sharing a few of my dreams , I encourage everyone to advance along concrete paths that_can allow the reality of the Amazon region to be transformed and set free_from the evils that beset it . Let us now lift our gaze to Mary . The Mother whom Christ gave us -isaia-_also the one Mother of all , who reveals herself in the Amazon region in distinct ways . We know_that '' the indigenous peoples have a vital encounter_with Jesus Christ in many_ways ; but the path of Mary has contributed greatly to this encounter '' . Faced with the marvel of the Amazon region , which we discovered ever more_fully during the preparation and celebration of the Synod , I consider it best to conclude this Exhortation by turning to her : Mother of life , in your maternal womb Jesus took flesh , the Lord of all that exists . Risen , he transfigured you by his light and made you the Queen of all creation . For that_reason , we ask you , Mary , to reign in the beating heart of Amazonia . Show yourself the Mother of all creatures , in the beauty of the flowers , the rivers , the great river that courses through it and all the life pulsing in its forests . Tenderly care_for this explosion of beauty . Ask Jesus to pour out all his_love on the men_and_women_who dwell there , that_they_may know_how to appreciate and care_for it . Bring your Son to birth in their_hearts , so that he can shine_forth in the Amazon region , in its peoples and in its cultures , by the light of his_word , by his consoling love , by his message of fraternity and justice . And -atti_degli_apostoli- every Eucharist , may all this awe and wonder be lifted up to the glory of the Father . Mother , look upon the poor of the Amazon region , for their home -isaia- being destroyed by petty interests . How much pain and misery , how_much neglect and abuse there_-isaia- in this blessed land overflowing with life ! Touch the hearts of the powerful , for , even_though we sense_that the hour -isaia- late , you call us to save what_-isaia- still alive . Mother whose heart_-isaia- pierced , who yourself suffer in your mistreated sons_and_daughters , and in the wounds inflicted on nature , reign in the Amazon , together_with your Son . Reign so that_no_one else can claim lordship over the handiwork of God . We trust in you , Mother of life . Do not abandon us in this dark hour .

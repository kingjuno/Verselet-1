Mary , Mother of Evangelization Jesus gift to his_people Star of the new Evangelization . The joy of the gospel fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus . Those who accept his offer of salvation are set free_from sin , sorrow , inner emptiness and loneliness . With Christ joy -isaia- constantly born anew . In this Exhortation I wish to encourage the Christian faithful to embark upon a new chapter of evangelization marked by this joy , while pointing out new paths for the Church s journey in years to come . A joy ever_new , a joy which_-isaia- shared . The great danger in today_s_world , pervaded as it -isaia- by consumerism , -isaia- the desolation and anguish born of a complacent yet covetous heart , the feverish pursuit of frivolous pleasures , and a blunted conscience . Whenever our interior life becomes caught up in its_own interests and concerns , there -isaia-_no_longer room_for others , no place_for the poor . God s voice -isaia-_no_longer heard , the quiet joy of his_love -isaia-_no_longer felt , and the desire to do good fades . This -isaia- a very real danger for believers too . Many fall prey to it , and end up resentful , angry and listless . That -isaia- no way to live a dignified and fulfilled life ; it -isaia- not God s will for us , nor_-isaia- it the life in the Spirit which_has its source in the heart of the risen Christ . I invite all Christians , everywhere , -atti_degli_apostoli- this_very moment , to a renewed personal encounter_with Jesus Christ , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least an openness to letting him encounter them ; I ask all of you to do this unfailingly each_day . No one_should think_that this invitation -isaia- not meant for him or her , since '' no one_-isaia- excluded from the joy brought by the Lord '' . The Lord does_not disappoint those_who take this risk ; whenever we take a step towards Jesus , we come to realize_that he -isaia-_already there , waiting for us with open arms . Now -isaia- the time to say to Jesus : '' Lord , I have let myself be deceived ; in a thousand ways I have shunned your love , yet here I -amos- once_more , to renew my covenant with you . Save me once_again , Lord , take me once_more into your redeeming embrace '' . How good it feels to come back to him whenever we are lost ! Let me say this once_more : God never tires of forgiving us ; we are the ones who tire of seeking his_mercy . Christ , who told us to forgive one_another '' seventy times seven '' Mt : has_given us his example : he has forgiven us seventy times seven . Time and time again he bears us on his shoulders . No one_can strip us of the dignity bestowed upon us by this boundless and unfailing love . With a tenderness which never disappoints , but_-isaia- always capable of restoring our joy , he makes it possible_for us to lift up our heads and to start anew . Let us not flee from the resurrection of Jesus , let us never give up , come what will . May nothing inspire more_than his life_,_which impels us onwards ! . The books of the Old Testament predicted that the joy of salvation would abound in messianic times . The prophet Isaiah exultantly salutes the awaited Messiah : '' You have multiplied the nation , you_have increased its joy '' : . He exhorts those_who dwell on Zion to go forth to meet him_with song : '' Shout aloud and sing for joy ! '' : . The prophet tells those_who_have already seen him from afar to bring_the message to others : '' Get you up to a high mountain , O herald of good tidings to Zion ; lift up your voice with strength , O herald of good tidings to Jerusalem '' : . All creation shares in the joy of salvation : '' Sing for joy , O heavens , and exult , O earth ! Break forth , O mountains , into singing ! For the Lord has comforted his_people , and will_have compassion on his suffering ones '' : . Zechariah , looking to the day of the Lord , invites the people to acclaim the king who comes '' humble and riding on a donkey '' : '' Rejoice greatly , O daughter Zion ! Shout aloud , O daughter Jerusalem ! Lo , your king comes to you ; triumphant and victorious -isaia- he '' : . Perhaps the most exciting invitation -isaia- that of the prophet Zephaniah , who presents God with his_people in the midst of a celebration overflowing with the joy of salvation . I find it thrilling to reread this text : '' The Lord , your God -isaia- in your midst , a warrior who_gives you the victory ; he will rejoice over you with gladness , he will renew you in his_love ; he will exult over you with loud singing , as on a day of festival '' : . This -isaia- the joy which we experience daily , amid the little things of life , as a response to the loving invitation of God our Father : '' My child , treat yourself well , according to your means . Do not deprive yourself of the day s enjoyment '' Sir : , . What tender paternal love echoes in these_words ! . The Gospel , radiant with the glory of Christ s cross , constantly invites us to rejoice . A few examples will suffice . '' Rejoice ! '' -isaia- the angel s greeting to Mary Lk : . Mary s visit to Elizabeth makes John leap for joy in his_mother s womb cf . In her song of praise , Mary proclaims : '' My spirit rejoices in God my Saviour '' Lk : . When Jesus begins his_ministry , John cries out : '' For this_reason , my joy has_been fulfilled '' Jn : . Jesus himself '' rejoiced in the Holy Spirit '' Lk : . His message brings us joy : '' I have_said these_things to you , so that my joy may be in you , and that_your joy may be complete '' Jn : . Our Christian joy drinks of the wellspring of his brimming heart . He promises his_disciples : '' You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy '' Jn : . He then goes on to say : '' But I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will_take your joy from you '' Jn : . The disciples '' rejoiced '' Jn : -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of the risen Christ . In the Acts of the Apostles we read that the first Christians '' ate their food with glad and generous hearts '' : . Wherever the disciples went , '' there_was great joy '' : ; even amid persecution they continued to be '' filled_with joy '' : . The newly baptized eunuch '' went on his way rejoicing '' : , while Paul s jailer '' and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God '' : . Why should we not also enter_into this_great stream of joy ? . There are Christians whose lives seem like Lent without Easter . I realize of course that joy -isaia- not expressed the same_way -atti_degli_apostoli- all times in life , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- moments of great difficulty . Joy adapts and changes , but it always endures , even as a flicker of light born of our personal certainty_that , when everything -isaia- said and done , we are infinitely loved . I understand_the grief of people_who have to endure great suffering , yet slowly but surely we all have to let_the joy of faith slowly revive as a quiet yet firm trust , even amid the greatest distress : '' My soul -isaia- bereft of peace ; I have forgotten what happiness -isaia- . But this I call to mind , and therefore I have hope : the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases , his mercies never come to an end ; they_are new every morning . Great -isaia- your faithfulness . It -isaia- good that one_should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord '' Lam : , , . Sometimes we are tempted to find excuses and complain , acting as if we could only be happy if a thousand conditions were met . To some extent this_-isaia- because our '' technological society has succeeded in multiplying occasions of pleasure , yet has found it very difficult to engender joy '' . I can say that the most beautiful and natural expressions of joy which I have_seen in my life were in poor people_who had little to hold on to . I also think of the real joy shown by others_who , even amid pressing professional obligations , were able to preserve , in detachment and simplicity , a heart full of faith . In their_own way , all these instances of joy flow from the infinite love of God , who_has revealed himself to us in Jesus Christ . I never tire of repeating those words of Benedict XVI which take us to the very_heart of the Gospel : '' Being a Christian -isaia- not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea , but the encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction '' . Thanks solely to this encounter \u2013 or renewed encounter \u2013 with God s love_,_which blossoms into an enriching friendship , we are liberated from our narrowness and self absorption . We become fully human when we become more_than human , when we let God bring us beyond ourselves in order to attain the fullest truth of our being . Here we find the source and inspiration of all our efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- evangelization . For if we have_received the love_which restores meaning to our_lives , how_can we fail to share that_love with_others ? II . The delightful and comforting joy of evangelizing . Goodness always tends to spread . Every authentic experience of truth and goodness seeks by its_very nature to grow within us , and any person_who has experienced a profound liberation becomes more sensitive to the needs of others . As it expands , goodness takes root and develops . If we wish to lead a dignified and fulfilling life , we have to reach out to others and seek their good . In this_regard , several sayings of Saint Paul will_not surprise us : '' The love of Christ urges us on '' Cor : ; '' Woe to me if I do not proclaim_the Gospel '' Cor : . The Gospel offers us the chance to live life on a higher plane , but_with no less intensity : '' Life grows by being given away , and it weakens in isolation and comfort . Indeed , those_who enjoy life most are_those_who leave security on the shore and become excited by the mission of communicating life to others '' . When the Church summons Christians to take up the task of evangelization , she_-isaia- simply pointing to the source of authentic personal fulfilment . For '' here we discover a profound law of reality : that life_-isaia- attained and matures in the measure that_it_-isaia- offered up in order to give life to others . This -isaia- certainly what mission means '' . Consequently , an evangelizer must_never look like someone who_has just come back from a funeral ! Let us recover and deepen our enthusiasm , that '' delightful and comforting joy of evangelizing , even when_it_-isaia- in tears that we must sow . And may the world of our_time , which_-isaia- searching , sometimes with anguish , sometimes with hope , be enabled to receive the good_news not from evangelizers who_are dejected , discouraged , impatient or anxious , but_from ministers of the Gospel whose lives glow with fervour , who_have first received_the joy of Christ '' . A renewal of preaching can_offer believers , as well as the lukewarm and the non practising , new joy in the faith and fruitfulness in the work_of_evangelization . The heart of its message will_always be the same : the God who revealed his immense love in the crucified and risen Christ . God constantly renews his faithful ones , whatever their age : '' They shall mount up with wings like eagles , they_shall run and not be weary , they_shall walk and not be faint '' Is : . Christ -isaia- the '' eternal Gospel '' Rev : ; he '' is the same yesterday and today and forever '' Heb : , yet his riches and beauty are inexhaustible . He -isaia- for ever young and a constant source of newness . The Church never fails to be amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- '' the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God '' Rom : . Saint John of the Cross says_that '' the thicket of God s wisdom and knowledge -isaia- so deep and so broad that the soul , however much it has come to know of it , can always penetrate deeper within it '' . Or as Saint Irenaeus writes : '' By his coming , Christ brought with_him all newness '' . With this newness he -isaia- always able to renew our_lives and our communities , and even if the Christian message has known periods of darkness and ecclesial weakness , it will_never grow old . Jesus can_also break through the dull categories with_which we would enclose him and he constantly amazes us by his_divine creativity . Whenever we make_the effort to return to the source and to recover the original freshness of the Gospel , new avenues arise , new paths of creativity open up , with different_forms of expression , more eloquent signs and words with new meaning for today_s_world . Every form of authentic evangelization_-isaia- always '' new '' . Though it -isaia- true_that this_mission demands great generosity on our part , it would be wrong to see it as a heroic individual undertaking , for it -isaia- first_and_foremost the Lord s work , surpassing anything which we can_see and understand . Jesus -isaia- '' the first and greatest evangelizer '' . In every activity of evangelization , the primacy always belongs to God , who_has called us to cooperate with_him and who leads us on by the power of his Spirit . The real newness -isaia- the newness which God himself mysteriously brings about and inspires , provokes , guides and accompanies in a thousand ways . The life of the Church should_always reveal clearly that God takes the initiative , that '' he has loved us first '' Jn : and that he alone '' gives the growth '' Cor : . This conviction enables us to maintain a spirit of joy in the midst of a task so demanding and challenging that it engages our entire life . God asks everything of us , yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time he offers everything to us . Nor should we see the newness of this_mission as entailing a kind of displacement or forgetfulness of the living history which surrounds us and carries us forward . Memory -isaia- a dimension of our faith_which we might call '' deuteronomic '' , not unlike the memory of Israel itself . Jesus leaves us the Eucharist as the Church s daily remembrance of , and deeper sharing in , the event of his Passover cf . The joy of evangelizing always arises from grateful remembrance : it -isaia- a grace_which we constantly need to implore . The apostles never forgot the moment when Jesus touched their_hearts : '' It was about four o clock in the afternoon '' Jn : . Together with Jesus , this remembrance makes present to us '' a great cloud of witnesses '' Heb : , some of whom , as believers , we recall with_great joy : '' Remember your leaders , those_who spoke to you the word of God '' Heb : . Some of them were ordinary people_who were close to us and introduced us to the life of faith : '' I -amos- reminded of your sincere faith , a faith_that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice '' Tim : . The believer -isaia- essentially '' one_who remembers '' . The new_evangelization for the transmission of the faith . Attentive to the promptings of the Holy Spirit who helps us together to read the signs of the times , the XIII Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops gathered from October to discuss the theme : The New Evangelization for the Transmission of the Christian Faith . The Synod reaffirmed that the new evangelization_-isaia- a summons addressed to all and that_it_-isaia- carried_out in three principal settings . In first_place , we can mention the area of ordinary pastoral_ministry , which_-isaia- '' animated by the fire of the Spirit , so as to inflame the hearts of the faithful_who regularly take_part in community worship and gather on the Lord s day to be nourished by his_word and by the bread of eternal_life '' . In this category we can_also include those members of faithful_who preserve a deep and sincere faith , expressing it in different_ways , but seldom taking part in worship . Ordinary pastoral_ministry seeks to help believers to grow spiritually so that_they_can respond to God s love ever more_fully in their_lives . A second area -isaia- that of '' the baptized whose lives do not reflect the demands of Baptism '' , who lack a meaningful relationship to the Church and no longer experience the consolation born of faith . The Church , in her_maternal concern , tries to help_them experience a conversion which_will restore the joy of faith to their_hearts and inspire a commitment to the Gospel . Lastly , we cannot forget_that evangelization_-isaia- first_and_foremost about preaching the Gospel to those who_do_not know Jesus Christ or who have_always rejected him . Many of them are quietly seeking God , led by a yearning to see his face , even in countries of ancient Christian tradition . All of them have a right to receive the Gospel . Christians have_the duty to proclaim_the Gospel without excluding anyone . Instead of seeming to impose new obligations , they_should appear as people_who wish to share their joy , who point to a horizon of beauty and who invite others to a delicious banquet . It -isaia- not by proselytizing that the Church grows , but '' by attraction '' . John Paul II asked us to recognize_that '' there_must be no lessening of the impetus to preach the Gospel '' to those_who_are far from Christ , '' because this -isaia-_the_first task of the Church '' . Indeed , '' today missionary_activity still represents the greatest challenge for the Church '' and '' the missionary task must remain foremost '' . What would happen if we were to take these_words seriously ? We would realize_that missionary outreach -isaia- paradigmatic for all the Church s activity . Along these lines the Latin American bishops stated_that we '' cannot passively and calmly wait in our church buildings '' ; we need to move '' from a pastoral_ministry of mere conservation to a decidedly missionary pastoral_ministry '' . This task continues to be a source of immense joy for the Church : '' Just so , I tell you , there_will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than ninety nine righteous persons_who need no repentance '' Lk : . The scope and limits of this Exhortation . I was happy to take up the request of the Fathers of the Synod to write this Exhortation . In so doing , I -amos- reaping the rich fruits of the Synod s labours . In addition , I have sought advice from a number of people and I intend to express my own concerns about_this particular chapter of the Church s work_of_evangelization . Countless issues involving evangelization today might be discussed here , but I have chosen not to explore these many questions which call_for further reflection and study . Nor do I believe_that the papal magisterium should be expected to offer a definitive or complete word on every question which affects the Church and the world . It -isaia- not advisable for the Pope to take the place of local Bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory . In this_sense , I -amos- conscious of the need to promote a sound '' decentralization '' . Here I have chosen to present some guidelines which_can encourage and guide the whole Church in a new phase of evangelization , one marked by enthusiasm and vitality . In this_context , and on the basis of the teaching of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium , I have decided , among_other themes , to discuss -atti_degli_apostoli- length the following questions : a the reform of the Church in her missionary outreach ; b the temptations faced by pastoral workers ; c the Church , understood as the entire People of God which evangelizes ; d the homily and its preparation ; e the inclusion of the poor in society ; f peace and dialogue within society ; g the spiritual motivations for mission . I have dealt extensively with_these topics , with a detail which some may find excessive . But I have_done so , not_with the intention of providing an exhaustive treatise but simply as a way of showing their important practical implications for the Church s mission today . All of them help give shape to a definite style of evangelization which I ask you to adopt in every activity which_you undertake . In this_way , we can take up , amid our daily efforts , the biblical exhortation : '' Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say : Rejoice '' Phil : . CHAPTER ONE THE CHURCH S MISSIONARY TRANSFORMATION . Evangelization takes_place in obedience to the missionary mandate of Jesus : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt : . In these verses we see_how the risen Christ sent his followers to preach the Gospel in every time_and_place , so that_faith in him might spread to every corner of the earth . A Church which goes forth . The word of God constantly shows us how God challenges those who_believe in him '' to go forth '' . Abraham received_the call to set_out for a new land cf . Moses heard God s call : '' Go , I send you '' Ex : and led the people towards_the promised land cf . To Jeremiah God says : '' To all whom I send you , you shall go '' Jer : . In our_day Jesus command to '' go and make disciples '' echoes in the changing scenarios and ever_new challenges to the Church s mission of evangelization , and all of us are_called to take_part in this_new missionary '' going forth '' . Each Christian and every community must discern the path that the Lord points_out , but all of us are asked to obey his call to go forth_from our_own comfort zone in order to reach all the '' peripheries '' in need of the light of the Gospel . The Gospel joy which enlivens the community of disciples -isaia- a missionary joy . The seventy two disciples felt it as they returned from their_mission cf . Jesus felt it when he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and praised the Father for revealing himself to the poor and the little ones cf . It was felt by the first converts who marvelled to hear_the apostles preaching '' in the native language of each '' Acts : on the day of Pentecost . This joy -isaia- a sign that the Gospel has_been proclaimed and -isaia- bearing fruit . Yet the drive to go forth and give , to go out from ourselves , to keep pressing forward in our sowing of the good seed , remains ever present . The Lord says : '' Let us go on to the next towns that I may preach there also , for that_-isaia-_why I came out '' Mk : . Once the seed has_been sown in one place , Jesus does_not stay behind to explain things or to perform more signs ; the Spirit moves him to go forth to other towns . God s word_-isaia- unpredictable in its power . The Gospel speaks of a seed which , once sown , grows by itself , even as the farmer sleeps Mk : . The Church has to accept this unruly freedom of the word , which accomplishes what it wills in ways that surpass our calculations and ways of thinking . The Church s closeness to Jesus -isaia-_part of a common journey ; '' communion and mission are profoundly interconnected '' . In fidelity to the example of the Master , it -isaia- vitally important_for the Church today to go forth and preach the Gospel to all : to all places , on all occasions , without hesitation , reluctance or fear . The joy of the Gospel -isaia- for all people : no one_can be excluded . That -isaia- what_the angel proclaimed to the shepherds in Bethlehem : '' Be not afraid ; for behold , I bring you good_news of a great joy which_will come to all the people Lk : . The Book of Revelation speaks of '' an eternal Gospel to proclaim to those_who dwell on earth , to every nation and tongue and tribe and people '' Rev : . Taking the first step , being involved and supportive , bearing fruit and rejoicing . The Church which '' goes forth '' -isaia- a community of missionary disciples who take the first step , who_are involved and supportive , who bear_fruit and rejoice . An evangelizing community knows that the Lord has_taken the initiative , he has loved us first cf . Jn : , and therefore we can move forward , boldly take the initiative , go out to others , seek those_who_have fallen away , stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the crossroads and welcome the outcast . Such a community has an endless desire to show mercy , the fruit of its_own experience of the power of the Father s infinite mercy . Let us try a little harder to take the first step and to become involved . Jesus washed the feet of his_disciples . The Lord gets involved and he involves his_own , as he kneels to wash their feet . He tells his_disciples : '' You will be blessed if you do this '' Jn : . An evangelizing community gets involved by word and deed in people s daily lives ; it bridges distances , it -isaia- willing to abase itself if necessary , and it embraces human_life , touching the suffering flesh of Christ in others . Evangelizers thus take on the '' smell of the sheep '' and the sheep are willing to hear their voice . An evangelizing community -isaia-_also supportive , standing by people -atti_degli_apostoli- every step of the way , no matter how difficult or lengthy this may prove to be . It -isaia- familiar with patient expectation and apostolic endurance . Evangelization consists mostly of patience and disregard for constraints of time . Faithful to the Lord s gift , it also bears fruit . An evangelizing community -isaia- always concerned_with fruit , because the Lord wants her to be fruitful . It cares for the grain and does_not grow impatient -atti_degli_apostoli- the weeds . The sower , when he sees weeds sprouting among the grain does_not grumble or overreact . He or she finds a way to let_the word take flesh in a particular situation and bear fruits of new_life , however imperfect or incomplete these may appear . The disciple -isaia- ready to put his or her whole_life on the line , even to accepting martyrdom , in bearing_witness to Jesus Christ , yet the goal -isaia- not to make enemies but to see God s word accepted and its capacity_for liberation and renewal revealed . Finally an evangelizing community -isaia- filled_with joy ; it knows how to rejoice always . It celebrates every small victory , every step forward in the work_of_evangelization . Evangelization with_joy becomes beauty in the liturgy , as part of our daily concern to spread goodness . The Church evangelizes and -isaia- herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy , which_-isaia- both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self_giving . Pastoral activity and conversion . I -amos- aware_that nowadays documents do not arouse the same interest as in the past and that_they_are quickly forgotten . Nevertheless , I want to emphasize that_what I -amos- trying to express here has a programmatic significance and important consequences . I hope_that all communities will devote the necessary effort to advancing along the path of a pastoral and missionary conversion which_cannot leave things as they presently are . '' Mere administration '' can no longer be enough . Throughout the world , let us be '' permanently in a state of mission '' . Paul VI invited us to deepen the call to renewal and to make it clear_that renewal does_not only concern individuals but the entire Church . Let us return to a memorable text which continues to challenge us . '' The Church must look with penetrating eyes within herself , ponder the mystery of her_own being . This vivid and lively self awareness inevitably leads to a comparison between_the ideal image of the Church as Christ envisaged her and loved her as his holy and spotless bride cf . Eph : , and the actual image which_the Church presents to the world today . This -isaia-_the_source of the Church s heroic and impatient struggle for renewal : the struggle to correct those flaws introduced by her members which her_own self examination , mirroring her exemplar , Christ , points_out to her and condemns '' . The Second Vatican Council presented ecclesial conversion as openness to a constant self renewal born of fidelity to Jesus Christ : '' Every renewal of the Church essentially consists in an increase of fidelity to her_own calling . Christ summons the Church as she goes her pilgrim way . to that continual reformation of which_she always has need , in so far as she_-isaia- a human institution here on earth '' . There are ecclesial structures which_can hamper efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- evangelization , yet even good structures are only helpful when there_-isaia- a life constantly driving , sustaining and assessing them . Without new_life and an authentic evangelical spirit , without_the Church s '' fidelity to her_own calling '' , any new structure will soon prove ineffective . An ecclesial renewal which_cannot be deferred . I dream of a '' missionary option '' , that_-isaia- , a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything , so that the Church s customs , ways of doing things , times and schedules , language and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today_s_world rather_than for_her self preservation . The renewal of structures demanded by pastoral conversion can_only be understood in this light : as part of an effort to make_them more mission oriented , to make ordinary pastoral_activity on every level more inclusive and open , to inspire in pastoral workers a constant desire to go forth and in this_way to elicit a positive response from all those_whom Jesus summons to friendship with himself . As John Paul II once said to the Bishops of Oceania : '' All renewal in the Church must_have mission as its goal if it -isaia- not to fall prey to a kind of ecclesial introversion '' . The parish -isaia- not an outdated institution ; precisely_because it possesses great flexibility , it can assume quite different contours depending on the openness and missionary creativity of the pastor and the community . While certainly not the only institution which evangelizes , if the parish proves capable of self renewal and constant adaptivity , it continues to be '' the Church living in the midst of the homes of her sons_and_daughters '' . This presumes that it really -isaia- in contact_with_the homes and the lives of its people , and does_not become a useless structure out of touch with people or a self absorbed group made up of a chosen few . The parish -isaia- the presence of the Church in a given territory , an environment for hearing God s word , for growth in the Christian life , for dialogue , proclamation , charitable outreach , worship and celebration . In all its activities the parish encourages and trains its_members to be evangelizers . It -isaia- a community of communities , a sanctuary where_the thirsty come to drink in the midst of their journey , and a centre of constant missionary outreach . We must admit , though , that the call to review and renew our parishes has not_yet sufficed to bring them nearer to people , to make_them environments of living communion and participation , and to make_them completely mission oriented . Other Church institutions , basic communities and small communities , movements , and forms of association are a source of enrichment for the Church , raised up by the Spirit for evangelizing different areas and sectors . Frequently they bring a new evangelizing fervour and a new capacity_for dialogue_with_the world whereby_the Church -isaia- renewed . But it will prove beneficial for them_not to lose contact_with_the rich reality of the local parish and to participate readily in the overall pastoral_activity of the particular Church . This kind of integration will prevent them_from concentrating only on part of the Gospel or the Church , or becoming nomads without roots . Each particular Church , as a portion of the Catholic Church under the leadership of its bishop , -isaia- likewise called to missionary conversion . It -isaia- the primary subject of evangelization , since_it_-isaia- the concrete manifestation of the one Church in one specific place , and in it '' the one , holy , catholic , and apostolic Church of Christ -isaia- truly present and operative '' . It -isaia- the Church incarnate in a certain place , equipped with all the means of salvation bestowed by Christ , but_with local features . Its joy in communicating Jesus Christ -isaia- expressed both by a concern to preach him to areas in greater need and in constantly going forth to the outskirts of its_own territory or towards new sociocultural settings . Wherever the need_for the light and the life of the Risen Christ -isaia- greatest , it will want to be there . To make_this missionary impulse ever_more focused , generous and fruitful , I encourage each particular Church to undertake a resolute process of discernment , purification and reform . The bishop must_always foster this missionary communion in his diocesan Church , following the ideal of the first Christian communities , in which_the believers were of one heart and one soul cf . To do so , he will sometimes go before his_people , pointing the way and keeping their hope vibrant . At other times , he will simply be in their midst with_his unassuming and merciful presence . At yet other times , he will_have to walk after them , helping those_who lag behind and \u2013 above all \u2013 allowing the flock to strike out on new paths . In his_mission of fostering a dynamic , open and missionary communion , he will_have to encourage and develop the means of participation proposed in the Code of Canon Law , and other_forms of pastoral dialogue , out of a desire to listen to everyone and not_simply to those_who would tell him what he would_like to hear . Yet the principal aim of these participatory processes should_not be ecclesiastical organization but_rather the missionary aspiration of reaching everyone . Since I -amos- called to put into_practice what I ask of others , I too must think about a conversion of the papacy . It -isaia- my duty , as the Bishop of Rome , to be open to suggestions which_can help make_the exercise of my ministry more faithful to the meaning which Jesus Christ wished to give it and to the present needs of evangelization . Pope John Paul II asked for help in finding '' a way of exercising the primacy which , while in no way renouncing what_-isaia- essential to its mission , -isaia- nonetheless open to a new situation '' . We have_made little progress in this_regard . The papacy and the central structures of the universal Church also need to hear_the call to pastoral conversion . The Second Vatican Council stated_that , like the ancient patriarchal Churches , episcopal_conferences are in a position '' to contribute in many and fruitful ways to the concrete realization of the collegial spirit '' . Yet this desire has not_been fully realized , since a juridical status of episcopal_conferences which_would see them as subjects of specific attributions , including genuine doctrinal authority , has not_yet been sufficiently elaborated . Excessive centralization , rather_than proving helpful , complicates the Church s life and her missionary outreach . Pastoral ministry in a missionary key seeks to abandon the complacent attitude that says : '' We have_always done it this_way '' . I invite everyone to be bold and creative in this_task of rethinking the goals , structures , style and methods of evangelization in their_respective communities . A proposal of goals without an adequate communal search_for the means of achieving them will inevitably prove illusory . I encourage everyone to apply the guidelines found in this document generously and courageously , without inhibitions or fear . The important thing -isaia- to not walk alone , but to rely on each_other as brothers_and_sisters , and especially under the leadership of the bishops , in a wise and realistic pastoral discernment . From the heart of the Gospel . If we attempt to put all things in a missionary key , this_will also affect the way we communicate the message . In today_s_world of instant communication and occasionally biased media coverage , the message we preach runs a greater risk of being distorted or reduced to some of its secondary aspects . In this_way certain issues which_are part of the Church s moral teaching are taken out of the context which_gives them their meaning . The biggest problem -isaia- when_the message we preach then seems identified with_those secondary aspects which , important as they_are , do not in and of themselves convey the heart of Christ s message . We need to be realistic and not assume that_our audience understands the full background to what we are saying , or -isaia- capable of relating what we say to the very_heart of the Gospel which_gives it meaning , beauty and attractiveness . Pastoral ministry in a missionary style -isaia- not obsessed with the disjointed transmission of a multitude of doctrines to be insistently imposed . When we adopt a pastoral goal and a missionary style which_would actually reach everyone without exception or exclusion , the message has to concentrate on the essentials , on what_-isaia- most beautiful , most grand , most appealing and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time most necessary . The message -isaia- simplified , while losing none of its depth and truth , and thus becomes all the more forceful and convincing . All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith , yet some of them are more_important for giving direct expression to the heart of the Gospel . In this basic core , what shines_forth -isaia- the beauty of the saving love of God made manifest in Jesus Christ who died and rose from the dead . In this_sense , the Second Vatican Council explained , '' in Catholic doctrine there exists an order or a hierarchy of truths , since_they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith '' . This holds true as much for the dogmas of faith as for the whole corpus of the Church s teaching , including her moral teaching . Saint Thomas Aquinas taught that the Church s moral teaching has its_own '' hierarchy '' , in the virtues and in the acts which proceed from them . What counts above all else -isaia- '' faith working through love '' Gal : . Works of love directed to one s neighbour are the most perfect external manifestation of the interior grace of the Spirit : '' The foundation of the New Law -isaia- in the grace of the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- manifested in the faith_which works through love '' . Thomas thus explains that , as far as external works are_concerned , mercy -isaia- the greatest of all the virtues : '' In itself mercy -isaia- the greatest of the virtues , since all the others revolve around it and , more_than this , it makes up for their deficiencies . This -isaia- particular to the superior virtue , and as such it -isaia- proper to God to have mercy , through_which his omnipotence -isaia- manifested to the greatest degree '' . It -isaia- important to draw out the pastoral consequences of the Council s teaching , which reflects an ancient conviction of the Church . First , it needs to be said_that in preaching the Gospel a fitting sense of proportion has to be maintained . This would be seen in the frequency with_which certain themes are brought up and in the emphasis given to them in preaching . For example , if in the course of the liturgical year a parish priest speaks about temperance ten times but_only mentions charity or justice two or three times , an imbalance results , and precisely those virtues which ought to be most present in preaching and catechesis are overlooked . The same thing happens when we speak more about law than about grace , more about the Church than about Christ , more about the Pope than about God s word . Just as the organic unity existing among the virtues means that_no_one of them can be excluded from the Christian ideal , so no truth may be denied . The integrity of the Gospel message must_not be deformed . What -isaia- more , each truth_-isaia- better understood when related to the harmonious totality of the Christian message ; in this_context all of the truths are important and illumine one_another . When preaching -isaia- faithful to the Gospel , the centrality of certain truths -isaia- evident and it becomes clear_that Christian morality -isaia- not a form of stoicism , or self denial , or merely a practical philosophy or a catalogue of sins and faults . Before all else , the Gospel invites us to respond to the God of love who saves us , to see God in others and to go forth_from ourselves to seek the good of others . Under no circumstance can this invitation be obscured ! All of the virtues are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this response of love . If this invitation does_not radiate forcefully and attractively , the edifice of the Church s moral teaching risks becoming a house of cards , and this_-isaia- our greatest risk . It would mean that_it_-isaia- not the Gospel which_-isaia- being preached , but certain doctrinal or moral points based on specific ideological options . The message will run the risk of losing its freshness and will cease to have '' the fragrance of the Gospel '' . A mission embodied within human limits . The Church -isaia- herself a missionary disciple ; she needs to grow in her interpretation of the revealed word and in her understanding of truth . It -isaia- the task of exegetes and theologians to help '' the judgment of the Church to mature '' . The other sciences also help to accomplish this , each in its_own way . With reference to the social sciences , for example , John Paul II said_that the Church values their research , which helps her '' to derive concrete indications helpful for_her magisterial mission '' . Within the Church countless issues are_being studied and reflected upon with_great freedom . Differing currents of thought in philosophy , theology and pastoral practice , if open to being reconciled by the Spirit in respect and love , can enable the Church to grow , since all of them help to express more_clearly the immense riches of God s word . For those_who long for a monolithic body of doctrine guarded by all and leaving no room_for nuance , this might appear as undesirable and leading to confusion . But in fact such variety serves to bring out and develop different facets of the inexhaustible riches of the Gospel . At the same_time , today s vast and rapid cultural changes demand_that we constantly seek ways of expressing unchanging truths in a language which brings out_their abiding newness . '' The deposit of the faith_-isaia- one_thing . the way it -isaia- expressed -isaia- another '' . There are times when_the faithful , in listening to completely orthodox language , take away something alien to the authentic Gospel of Jesus Christ , because that language -isaia- alien to their_own way of speaking to and understanding one_another . With the holy intent of communicating the truth_about God and humanity , we sometimes give_them a false god or a human ideal which_-isaia-_not really Christian . In this_way , we hold fast to a formulation while failing to convey its substance . This -isaia- the greatest danger . Let us never forget_that '' the expression of truth can take different_forms . The renewal of these forms of expression becomes necessary_for the sake of transmitting to the people of today the Gospel message in its unchanging meaning '' . All of this_has great relevance for the preaching of the Gospel , if we are really concerned to make its beauty more_clearly recognized and accepted by all . Of course , we will_never be able to make_the Church s teachings easily understood or readily appreciated by everyone . Faith always remains something of a cross ; it retains a certain obscurity which_does_not detract from the firmness of its assent . Some things_are understood and appreciated only from the standpoint of this assent , which_-isaia- a sister to love , beyond_the range of clear reasons and arguments . We need to remember_that all religious teaching ultimately has to be reflected in the teacher s way of life_,_which awakens the assent of the heart by its nearness , love and witness . In her ongoing discernment , the Church can_also come to see_that certain customs not directly connected to the heart of the Gospel , even some which_have deep historical roots , are no longer properly understood and appreciated . Some of these customs may be beautiful , but_they no longer serve as means of communicating the Gospel . We should_not be afraid to re examine them . At the same_time , the Church has rules or precepts which_may have_been quite effective in their time , but no longer have_the same usefulness for directing and shaping people s lives . Saint Thomas Aquinas pointed_out that the precepts which Christ and the apostles gave to the people of God '' are_very few '' . Citing Saint Augustine , he noted_that the precepts subsequently enjoined by the Church should be insisted upon with moderation '' so as not to burden the lives of the faithful '' and make our religion a form of servitude , whereas '' God s mercy has willed that_we_should be free '' . This warning , issued many centuries ago , -isaia- most timely today . It ought to be one of the criteria to be taken into_account in considering a reform of the Church and her preaching which_would enable it to reach everyone . Moreover , pastors and the lay faithful_who accompany their brothers_and_sisters in faith or on a journey of openness to God must_always remember what_the Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches quite clearly : '' Imputability and responsibility_for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance , inadvertence , duress , fear , habit , inordinate attachments , and other psychological or social factors '' . Consequently , without detracting from the evangelical ideal , they_need to accompany with mercy and patience the eventual stages of personal growth as these progressively occur . I want to remind priests that the confessional must_not be a torture chamber but_rather an encounter_with_the Lord s mercy which spurs us on to do our best . A small step , in the midst of great human limitations , can be more pleasing to God than a life_which appears outwardly in order but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties . Everyone needs to be touched by the comfort and attraction of God s saving love , which_-isaia- mysteriously -atti_degli_apostoli- work in each_person , above and beyond their faults and failings . We see then that the task of evangelization operates within_the limits of language and of circumstances . It constantly seeks to communicate more_effectively the truth of the Gospel in a specific context , without renouncing the truth , the goodness and the light_which it can bring whenever perfection -isaia- not_possible . A missionary heart_-isaia- aware of these limits and makes itself '' weak with the weak . everything for everyone '' Cor : . It never closes itself off , never retreats into its_own security , never opts for rigidity and defensiveness . It realizes that it has to grow in its_own understanding of the Gospel and in discerning the paths of the Spirit , and so it always does what good it can , even if in the process , its shoes get soiled by the mud of the street . A mother with an open heart . A Church which '' goes forth '' -isaia- a Church whose doors are open . Going out to others in order to reach the fringes of humanity does_not_mean rushing out aimlessly into_the_world . Often it -isaia- better simply to slow down , to put aside our eagerness in order to see and listen to others , to stop rushing from one_thing to another and to remain with someone who_has faltered along the way . At times we have to be like the father of the prodigal son , who always keeps his door open so that_when the son returns , he can readily pass through it . The Church -isaia- called to be the house of the Father , with doors always wide open . One concrete sign of such openness -isaia- that_our church doors should_always be open , so that if someone , moved by the Spirit , comes there looking for God , he or she_will not find a closed door . There are other doors that should_not be closed either . Everyone can share in some_way in the life of the Church ; everyone can be part of the community , nor_should the doors of the sacraments be closed for simply any reason . This -isaia-_especially true of the sacrament which_-isaia- itself '' the door '' : baptism . The Eucharist , although it -isaia- the fullness of sacramental life , -isaia- not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak . These convictions have pastoral consequences that_we_are called to consider with prudence and boldness . Frequently , we act as arbiters of grace rather_than its facilitators . But the Church -isaia- not a tollhouse ; it -isaia- the house of the Father , where there_-isaia- a place_for everyone , with all their problems . If the whole Church takes up this missionary impulse , she_has to go forth to everyone without exception . But to whom should she go first ? When we read the Gospel we find a clear indication : not_so_much our friends and wealthy neighbours , but_above all the poor and the sick , those_who_are usually despised and overlooked , '' those_who cannot repay you '' Lk : . There can be no room_for doubt or for explanations which weaken so clear a message . Today and always , '' the poor are the privileged recipients of the Gospel '' , and the fact that_it_-isaia- freely preached to them -isaia- a sign of the kingdom that Jesus came to establish . We have to state , without mincing words , that_there_-isaia- an inseparable bond_between our_faith and the poor . May we never abandon them . Let us go forth , then , let us go forth to offer everyone the life of Jesus Christ . Here I repeat for the entire Church what I have often said to the priests and laity of Buenos Aires : I prefer a Church which_-isaia- bruised , hurting and dirty because it has_been out on the streets , rather_than a Church which_-isaia- unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its_own security . I do not want a Church concerned_with being -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre and which then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures . If something should rightly disturb us and trouble our consciences , it -isaia- the fact_that so many of our_brothers_and_sisters are living without_the strength , light and consolation born of friendship with Jesus Christ , without a community of faith to support them , without meaning and a goal in life . More than by fear of going astray , my hope -isaia- that we will be moved by the fear of remaining shut up within structures which give us a false sense of security , within rules which_make us harsh judges , within habits which_make us feel safe , while -atti_degli_apostoli- our door people_are starving and Jesus does_not tire of saying to us : '' Give them something to eat '' Mk : . CHAPTER TWO AMID THE CRISIS OF COMMUNAL COMMITMENT . Before taking up some basic questions related to the work_of_evangelization , it may be helpful to mention briefly the context in which we all have to live and work . Today , we frequently hear of a '' diagnostic overload '' which_-isaia-_not always accompanied by improved and actually applicable methods of treatment . Nor would we be well served by a purely sociological analysis which_would aim to embrace all of reality by employing an allegedly neutral and clinical method . What I would_like to propose -isaia- something much_more in the line of an evangelical discernment . It -isaia- the approach of a missionary disciple , an approach '' nourished by the light and strength of the Holy Spirit '' . It -isaia- not the task of the Pope to offer a detailed and complete analysis of contemporary reality , but I do exhort all the communities to an '' ever watchful scrutiny of the signs of the times '' . This -isaia-_in_fact a grave responsibility , since certain present realities , unless effectively dealt_with , are capable of setting off processes of dehumanization which_would then be hard to reverse . We need to distinguish clearly what might be a fruit of the kingdom from what runs counter to God s plan . This involves not_only recognizing and discerning spirits , but_also \u2013 and this_-isaia- decisive \u2013 choosing movements of the spirit of good and rejecting those of the spirit of evil . I take for granted the different analyses which other documents of the universal magisterium have offered , as well as those proposed by the regional and national conferences of bishops . In this Exhortation I claim only to consider briefly , and from a pastoral perspective , certain factors which_can restrain or weaken the impulse of missionary renewal in the Church , either because_they threaten the life and dignity of God s people or because_they affect those_who_are directly involved in the Church s institutions and in her work_of_evangelization . Some challenges of today_s_world . In our_time humanity -isaia- experiencing a turning point in its history , as we can_see from the advances being made in so many fields . We can_only praise the steps being taken to improve people s welfare in areas such as health_care , education and communications . At the same_time we have to remember_that the majority of our contemporaries are barely living from day to day , with dire consequences . A number of diseases are spreading . The hearts of many_people are gripped by fear and desperation , even in the so called rich countries . The joy of living frequently fades , lack of respect_for others and violence are on the rise , and inequality -isaia- increasingly evident . It -isaia- a struggle to live and , often , to live with precious little dignity . This epochal change has_been set in motion by the enormous qualitative , quantitative , rapid and cumulative advances occuring in the sciences and in technology , and by their instant application in different areas of nature and of life . We are in an age of knowledge and information , which_has led to new and often anonymous kinds of power . Just as the commandment '' Thou shalt not kill '' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human_life , today we also have to say '' thou shalt not '' to an economy of exclusion and inequality . Such an economy kills . How can it be that_it_-isaia- not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure , but_it_-isaia- news when_the stock market loses two points ? This -isaia- a case of exclusion . Can we continue to stand by when food -isaia- thrown away while people_are starving ? This -isaia- a case of inequality . Today everything comes under the laws of competition and the survival of the fittest , where_the powerful feed upon the powerless . As a consequence , masses of people find_themselves excluded and marginalized : without work , without possibilities , without_any means of escape . Human beings are themselves considered consumer goods to be used and then discarded . We have created a '' throw away '' culture which_-isaia- now spreading . It -isaia-_no_longer simply about exploitation and oppression , but something new . Exclusion ultimately has to do with what it means to be a part of the society in which we live ; those excluded are no longer society s underside or its fringes or its disenfranchised \u2013 they_are no longer even a part of it . The excluded are_not the '' exploited '' but the outcast , the '' leftovers '' . In this_context , some people continue to defend trickle down theories which assume that economic growth , encouraged by a free market , will inevitably succeed in bringing_about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world . This opinion , which has_never been confirmed by the facts , expresses a crude and na\u00efve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system . Meanwhile , the excluded are_still waiting . To sustain a lifestyle which excludes others , or to sustain enthusiasm for that selfish ideal , a globalization of indifference has developed . Almost without being aware of it , we end up being incapable of feeling compassion -atti_degli_apostoli- the outcry of the poor , weeping for other people s pain , and feeling a need to help_them , as though all this were someone else s responsibility and not our_own . The culture of prosperity deadens us ; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase . In the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle ; they fail to move us . No to the new idolatry of money . One cause of this situation -isaia- found in our relationship_with money , since we calmly accept its dominion over ourselves and our societies . The current financial crisis can_make us overlook the fact_that it originated in a profound human crisis : the denial of the primacy of the human_person ! We have created new idols . The worship of the ancient golden calf cf . Ex : has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose . The worldwide crisis affecting finance and the economy lays bare their imbalances and , above all , their lack of real concern_for human_beings ; man_-isaia- reduced to one of his needs alone : consumption . While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially , so too -isaia- the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few . This imbalance -isaia- the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation . Consequently , they reject the right of states , charged with vigilance for the common_good , to exercise any form of control . A new tyranny -isaia- thus born , invisible and often virtual , which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its_own laws and rules . Debt and the accumulation of interest also make it difficult for countries to realize the potential of their_own economies and keep citizens from enjoying their real purchasing power . To all this we can add widespread corruption and self serving tax evasion , which have_taken on worldwide dimensions . The thirst_for power and possessions knows no limits . In this system , which tends to devour everything which stands in the way of increased profits , whatever_-isaia- fragile , like the environment , -isaia- defenseless before the interests of a deified market , which become the only rule . No to a financial system which rules rather_than serves . Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God . Ethics has come to be viewed with a certain scornful derision . It -isaia- seen as counterproductive , too human , because it makes money and power relative . It -isaia- felt to be a threat , since it condemns the manipulation and debasement of the person . In effect , ethics leads to a God who calls for a committed response which_-isaia- outside the categories of the marketplace . When these latter are absolutized , God can_only be seen as uncontrollable , unmanageable , even dangerous , since he calls human_beings to their full realization and to freedom from all forms of enslavement . Ethics \u2013 a non ideological ethics \u2013 would make it possible to bring_about balance and a more humane social_order . With this in mind , I encourage financial experts and political leaders to ponder the words of one of the sages of antiquity : '' Not to share one s wealth with the poor -isaia- to steal from them and to take away their livelihood . It -isaia- not our_own goods which we hold , but theirs '' . A financial reform open to such ethical considerations would require a vigorous change of approach on the part of political leaders . I urge them to face this challenge with determination and an eye to the future , while not ignoring , of course , the specifics of each case . Money must serve , not rule ! The Pope loves everyone , rich and poor alike , but he -isaia- obliged in the name of Christ to remind all that the rich must help , respect and promote the poor . I exhort you to generous solidarity and to the return of economics and finance to an ethical approach which favours human_beings . No to the inequality which spawns violence . Today in many places we hear a call_for greater security . But until exclusion and inequality in society and between peoples are reversed , it will be impossible to eliminate violence . The poor and the poorer peoples are accused of violence , yet without equal opportunities the different_forms of aggression and conflict will_find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode . When a society \u2013 whether local , national or global \u2013 -isaia- willing to leave a part of itself on the fringes , no political programmes or resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance systems can indefinitely guarantee tranquility . This -isaia- not the case simply because inequality provokes a violent reaction from those excluded from the system , but because the socioeconomic system -isaia- unjust -atti_degli_apostoli- its root . Just as goodness tends to spread , the toleration of evil , which_-isaia- injustice , tends to expand its baneful influence and quietly to undermine any political and social system , no matter how solid it may appear . If every action has its consequences , an evil embedded in the structures of a society has a constant potential for disintegration and death . It -isaia- evil crystallized in unjust social structures , which_cannot be the basis of hope_for a better future . We are far from the so called '' end of history '' , since_the conditions for a sustainable and peaceful development have_not yet been adequately articulated and realized . Today s economic mechanisms promote inordinate consumption , yet it -isaia- evident_that unbridled consumerism combined with inequality proves doubly damaging to the social fabric . Inequality eventually engenders a violence which recourse to arms cannot and never will_be_able to resolve . It serves only to offer false hopes to those clamouring for heightened security , even_though nowadays we know_that weapons and violence , rather_than providing solutions , create new and more_serious conflicts . Some simply content themselves_with blaming the poor and the poorer countries themselves for their troubles ; indulging in unwarranted generalizations , they claim that the solution -isaia- an '' education '' that_would tranquilize them , making them tame and harmless . All this becomes even_more exasperating for the marginalized in the light of the widespread and deeply rooted corruption found in many countries \u2013 in their governments , businesses and institutions \u2013 whatever the political ideology of their leaders . Some cultural challenges . We also evangelize when we attempt to confront the various challenges which_can arise . On occasion these may take the form of veritable attacks on religious_freedom or new persecutions directed against Christians ; in some_countries these have reached alarming levels of hatred and violence . In many places , the problem -isaia- more that of widespread indifference and relativism , linked to disillusionment and the crisis of ideologies which_has come about as a reaction to any thing which might appear totalitarian . This not_only harms the Church but the fabric of society as a whole . We should recognize how in a culture where each_person wants to be bearer of his or her_own subjective truth , it becomes difficult for citizens to devise a common plan which transcends individual gain and personal ambitions . In the prevailing culture , priority -isaia- given to the outward , the immediate , the visible , the quick , the superficial and the provisional . What -isaia- real gives way to appearances . In many countries globalization has meant a hastened deterioration of their_own cultural roots and the invasion of ways of thinking and acting proper to other cultures which_are economically advanced but ethically debilitated . This fact has_been brought up by bishops from various continents in different Synods . The African bishops , for example , taking up the Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , pointed_out years_ago that_there have_been frequent attempts to make_the African countries '' parts of a machine , cogs on a gigantic wheel . This -isaia-_often true also in the field of social_communications which , being run by centres mostly in the northern hemisphere , do not_always give due consideration to the priorities and problems of such countries or respect their cultural make up '' . By the same token , the bishops of Asia '' underlined the external influences being brought to bear on Asian cultures . New patterns of behaviour are emerging as a result of over exposure to the mass_media . As a result , the negative aspects of the media and entertainment industries are threatening traditional values , and in particular the sacredness of marriage and the stability of the family '' . The Catholic faith of many peoples -isaia- nowadays being challenged by the proliferation of new religious movements , some of which tend to fundamentalism while others seem to propose a spirituality without God . This -isaia- , on the one_hand , a human reaction to a materialistic , consumerist and individualistic society , but_it_-isaia- also a means of exploiting the weaknesses of people living in poverty and on the fringes of society , people_who make ends meet amid great human suffering and are looking for immediate solutions to their needs . These religious movements , not_without a certain shrewdness , come to fill , within a predominantly individualistic culture , a vacuum left by secularist rationalism . We must recognize_that if part of our baptized people lack a sense of belonging to the Church , this -isaia-_also due to certain structures and the occasionally unwelcoming atmosphere of some of our parishes and communities , or to a bureaucratic way of dealing_with problems , be they simple or complex , in the lives of our people . In many places an administrative approach prevails over a pastoral approach , as does a concentration on administering the sacraments apart_from other_forms of evangelization . The process of secularization tends to reduce the faith and the Church to the sphere of the private and personal . Furthermore , by completely rejecting the transcendent , it has produced a growing deterioration of ethics , a weakening of the sense of personal and collective sin , and a steady increase in relativism . These have led to a general sense of disorientation , especially in the periods of adolescence and young adulthood which_are so vulnerable to change . As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed_out , while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which_are valid for everyone , '' there are_those in our culture who portray this_teaching as unjust , that_-isaia- , as opposed to basic human_rights . Such claims usually follow from a form of moral relativism that_-isaia- joined , not_without inconsistency , to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals . In this view , the Church -isaia- perceived as promoting a particular prejudice and as interfering with individual freedom '' . We are living in an information driven society_which bombards us indiscriminately with data \u2013 all treated as being of equal importance \u2013 and which_leads to remarkable superficiality in the area of moral discernment . In response , we need to provide an education which teaches critical thinking and encourages the development of mature moral values . Despite the tide of secularism which_has swept our societies , in many countries \u2013 even_those where Christians are a minority \u2013 the Catholic Church -isaia- considered a credible institution by public opinion , and trusted for_her solidarity and concern_for those in greatest need . Again and again , the Church has acted as a mediator in finding solutions to problems affecting peace , social harmony , the land , the defence of life , human and civil rights , and so forth . And how_much good has_been done by Catholic schools and universities around_the world ! This -isaia- a good thing . Yet , we find it difficult to make people see that_when we raise other questions less palatable to public opinion , we are doing so out of fidelity to precisely_the same convictions about human_dignity and the common_good . The family_-isaia- experiencing a profound cultural crisis , as are all communities and social bonds . In the case of the family , the weakening of these bonds -isaia- particularly serious because the family_-isaia- the fundamental cell of society , where we learn to live with_others despite our differences and to belong to one_another ; it -isaia-_also the place_where parents pass on the faith to their_children . Marriage now tends to be viewed as a form of mere emotional satisfaction that_can be constructed in any_way or modified -atti_degli_apostoli- will . But the indispensible contribution of marriage to society transcends the feelings and momentary needs of the couple . As the French bishops have taught , it -isaia- not born '' of loving sentiment , ephemeral by definition , but_from the depth of the obligation assumed by the spouses who accept to enter a total communion of life '' . The individualism of our postmodern and globalized era favours a lifestyle which weakens the development and stability of personal relationships and distorts family bonds . Pastoral activity needs to bring out more_clearly the fact_that our relationship_with the Father demands and encourages a communion_which heals , promotes and reinforces interpersonal bonds . In our_world , especially in some_countries , different_forms of war and conflict are re emerging , yet we Christians remain steadfast in our intention to respect others , to heal wounds , to build bridges , to strengthen relationships and to '' bear one_another s burdens '' Gal : . Today too , various associations for the defence of rights and the pursuit of noble goals are_being founded . This -isaia- a sign of the desire of many_people to contribute to social_and_cultural progress . Challenges to inculturating the faith . The Christian substratum of certain peoples \u2013 most of all in the West \u2013 -isaia- a living reality . Here we find , especially among the most needy , a moral resource which preserves the values of an authentic Christian humanism . Seeing reality with the eyes of faith , we cannot_fail to acknowledge what_the Holy Spirit -isaia- sowing . It would show a lack of trust in his free and unstinting activity to think_that authentic Christian values are absent where great numbers of people have_received baptism and express their_faith and solidarity with_others in a variety of ways . This means more_than acknowledging occasional '' seeds of the word '' , since it has to do with an authentic Christian faith_which has its_own expressions and means of showing its relationship to the Church . The immense importance of a culture marked by faith cannot be overlooked ; before the onslaught of contemporary secularism an evangelized culture , for all its limits , has many more resources than the mere sum total of believers . An evangelized popular culture contains values of faith and solidarity capable of encouraging the development of a more just and believing society , and possesses a particular wisdom which ought to be gratefully acknowledged . It -isaia- imperative to evangelize cultures in order to inculturate the Gospel . In countries of Catholic tradition , this_means encouraging , fostering and reinforcing a richness which already exists . In countries of other religious traditions , or profoundly secularized countries , it will mean sparking new processes for evangelizing culture , even_though these will demand long term planning . We must keep in mind , however_,_that we are constantly being called to grow . Each culture and social group needs purification and growth . In the case of the popular cultures of Catholic peoples , we can_see deficiencies which need to be healed by the Gospel : machismo , alcoholism , domestic violence , low Mass attendance , fatalistic or superstitious notions which lead to sorcery , and the like . Popular piety itself can be the starting point for healing and liberation from_these deficiencies . It -isaia-_also true_that -atti_degli_apostoli- times greater emphasis -isaia- placed on the outward expressions and traditions of some groups , or on alleged private revelations which_would replace all else , than on the impulse of Christian piety . There -isaia- a kind of Christianity made up of devotions reflecting an individual and sentimental faith life which_does_not in fact correspond to authentic '' popular_piety '' . Some people promote these expressions while not being in the least concerned_with the advancement of society or the formation of the laity , and in certain cases they do so in order to obtain economic benefits or some power over others . Nor can we overlook the fact_that in recent decades there_has been a breakdown in the way Catholics pass down the Christian faith to the young . It -isaia- undeniable that many_people feel disillusioned and no longer identify with the Catholic tradition . Growing numbers of parents do not bring their_children for baptism or teach them how to pray . There -isaia-_also a certain exodus towards other faith communities . The causes of this breakdown include : a lack of opportunity_for dialogue in families , the influence of the communications media , a relativistic subjectivism , unbridled consumerism which feeds the market , lack of pastoral_care among the poor , the failure of our institutions to be welcoming , and our difficulty in restoring a mystical adherence to the faith in a pluralistic religious landscape . Challenges from urban cultures . The new Jerusalem , the holy city cf . Rev : , -isaia- the goal towards which all of humanity -isaia- moving . It -isaia- curious that God s revelation tells us that the fullness of humanity and of history -isaia- realized in a city . We need to look -atti_degli_apostoli- our cities with a contemplative gaze , a gaze of faith_which sees God dwelling in their homes , in their streets and squares . God s presence accompanies the sincere efforts of individuals and groups to find encouragement and meaning in their_lives . He dwells among_them , fostering solidarity , fraternity , and the desire_for goodness , truth and justice . This presence must_not be contrived but found , uncovered . God does_not hide himself from those_who seek him_with a sincere heart , even_though they do so tentatively , in a vague and haphazard manner . In cities , as opposed to the countryside , the religious dimension of life_-isaia- expressed by different lifestyles , daily rhythms linked to places and people . In their_daily lives people must often struggle for survival and this struggle contains within it a profound understanding of life_which often includes a deep religious sense . We must examine this more_closely in order to enter_into a dialogue like that of our Lord and the Samaritan woman -atti_degli_apostoli- the well where she sought to quench her thirst cf . New cultures are constantly being born in these vast new expanses where Christians are no longer the customary interpreters or generators of meaning . Instead , they_themselves take from_these cultures new languages , symbols , messages and paradigms which propose new approaches to life , approaches often in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus . A completely new culture has come to life and continues to grow in the cities . The Synod noted_that today the changes taking place in these great spaces and the culture which_they create are a privileged locus of the new_evangelization . This challenges us to imagine innovative spaces and possibilities for prayer and communion_which are_more attractive and meaningful for city dwellers . Through the influence of the media , rural areas are_being affected by the same cultural changes , which_are significantly altering their way_of_life as well . What -isaia- called_for -isaia- an evangelization capable of shedding light on these new ways of relating to God , to others and to the world around us , and inspiring essential values . It must reach the places_where new narratives and paradigms are_being formed , bringing the word of Jesus to the inmost soul of our cities . Cities are multicultural ; in the larger cities , a connective network -isaia- found in which groups of people share a common imagination and dreams about life , and new human interactions arise , new cultures , invisible cities . Various subcultures exist side by side , and often practise segregation and violence . The Church -isaia- called to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a difficult dialogue . On the one_hand , there_are people_who have_the means needed to develop their_personal and family lives , but_there are_also many '' non citizens '' , '' half citizens '' and '' urban remnants '' . Cities create a sort of permanent ambivalence because , while they offer their residents countless possibilities , they_also present many_people with any number of obstacles to the full development of their_lives . This contrast causes painful suffering . In many parts_of_the_world , cities are the scene of mass protests where thousands of people call_for freedom , a voice in public_life , justice and a variety of other demands which , if not properly understood , will_not be silenced by force . We cannot ignore the fact_that in cities human trafficking , the narcotics trade , the abuse and exploitation of minors , the abandonment of the elderly and infirm , and various_forms of corruption and criminal activity take_place . At the same_time , what could be significant places of encounter and solidarity often become places of isolation and mutual distrust . Houses and neighbourhoods are_more often built to isolate and protect than to connect and integrate . The proclamation of the Gospel will be a basis for restoring the dignity of human_life in these contexts , for Jesus desires to pour out an abundance of life upon our cities cf . The unified and complete sense of human_life that the Gospel proposes -isaia- the best remedy for the ills of our cities , even_though we have to realize_that a uniform and rigid program of evangelization_-isaia- not suited to this complex reality . But to live our human_life to the fullest and to meet every challenge as a leaven of Gospel witness in every culture and in every city will_make us better Christians and bear_fruit in our cities . Temptations faced by pastoral workers . I feel tremendous gratitude to all those_who_are committed to working in and for the Church . Here I do not wish to discuss -atti_degli_apostoli- length the activities of the different pastoral workers , from bishops down to those_who provide the most humble and hidden services . Rather , I would_like to reflect on the challenges that all of them must face in the context of our current globalized culture . But in justice , I must say first that the contribution of the Church in today_s_world -isaia- enormous . The pain and the shame we feel -atti_degli_apostoli- the sins of some members of the Church , and -atti_degli_apostoli- our_own , must_never make us forget how_many Christians are giving their_lives in love . They help so many_people to be healed or to die in peace in makeshift hospitals . They are present to those enslaved by different addictions in the poorest places on earth . They devote_themselves to the education of children and young_people . They take_care of the elderly who_have_been forgotten by everyone else . They look for ways to communicate values in hostile environments . They are dedicated in many_other ways to showing an immense love for_humanity inspired by the God who became man . I -amos- grateful for the beautiful example given to me by so many Christians who joyfully sacrifice their_lives and their time . This witness comforts and sustains me in my own effort to overcome selfishness and to give more_fully of myself . As children of this age , though , all of us are in some_way affected by the present globalized culture which , while offering us values and new possibilities , can_also limit , condition and ultimately harm us . I -amos- aware_that we need to create spaces where pastoral workers can be helped and healed , '' places_where faith itself in the crucified and risen Jesus -isaia- renewed , where_the most profound questions and daily concerns are shared , where deeper discernment about our experiences and life itself_-isaia- undertaken in the light of the Gospel , for the purpose of directing individual and social decisions towards_the good and beautiful '' . At the same_time , I would_like to call attention to certain particular temptations which affect pastoral workers . Yes to the challenge of a missionary spirituality . Today we are seeing in many pastoral workers , including consecrated men_and_women , an inordinate concern_for their_personal freedom and relaxation , which_leads them to see their_work as a mere appendage to their_life , as if it were_not part of their_very identity . At the same_time , the spiritual_life comes to be identified with a few religious exercises which can_offer a certain comfort but_which do not encourage encounter_with others , engagement with the world or a passion for evangelization . As a result , one_can observe in many agents of evangelization , even_though they pray , a heightened individualism , a crisis of identity and a cooling of fervour . These are three evils which fuel one_another . At times our media culture and some intellectual circles convey a marked scepticism with_regard to the Church s message , along_with a certain cynicism . As a consequence , many pastoral workers , although they pray , develop a sort of inferiority complex which_leads them to relativize or conceal their Christian identity and convictions . This produces a vicious circle . They end up being unhappy with who they_are and what_they do ; they_do_not identify with their_mission of evangelization and this weakens their commitment . They end up stifling the joy of mission with a kind of obsession about being like everyone else and possessing what everyone else possesses . Their work_of_evangelization thus becomes forced , and they devote little energy and very limited time to it . Pastoral workers can thus fall_into a relativism which , whatever their particular style of spirituality or way of thinking , proves even_more dangerous than doctrinal relativism . It has to do with the deepest and inmost decisions that shape their way_of_life . This practical relativism consists in acting as if God did not_exist , making decisions as if the poor did not_exist , setting goals as if others did not_exist , working as if people_who have_not received_the Gospel did not_exist . It -isaia- striking that_even some who clearly have solid doctrinal and spiritual convictions frequently fall_into a lifestyle which_leads to an attachment to financial security , or to a desire_for power or human glory -atti_degli_apostoli- all cost , rather_than giving their_lives to others in mission . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of missionary enthusiasm ! No to selfishness and spiritual sloth . At a time_when we most need a missionary dynamism which_will bring salt and light to the world , many lay_people fear that_they_may be asked to undertake some apostolic work and they seek to avoid any responsibility that may take away from their free time . For example , it has become very difficult today to find trained parish catechists willing to persevere in this_work for some years . Something similar -isaia-_also happening with priests_who are obsessed with protecting their free time . This -isaia- frequently due to the fact_that people feel an overbearing need to guard their_personal freedom , as though the task of evangelization was a dangerous poison rather_than a joyful response to God s love_which summons us to mission and makes us fulfilled and productive . Some resist giving themselves over completely to mission and thus end up in a state of paralysis and acedia . The problem -isaia- not_always an excess of activity , but_rather activity undertaken badly , without adequate motivation , without a spirituality which_would permeate it and make it pleasurable . As a result , work becomes more tiring than necessary , even leading -atti_degli_apostoli- times to illness . Far from a content and happy tiredness , this_-isaia- a tense , burdensome , dissatisfying and , in the end , unbearable fatigue . This pastoral acedia can be caused by a number of things . Some fall_into it because_they throw themselves into unrealistic projects and are_not satisfied simply to do what_they reasonably can . Others , because_they lack the patience to allow processes to mature ; they want everything to fall from heaven . Others , because_they_are attached to a few projects or vain dreams of success . Others , because_they have lost real contact_with people and so depersonalize their_work that_they_are more concerned_with the road map than with the journey itself . Others fall_into acedia because_they_are unable to wait ; they want to dominate the rhythm of life . Today s obsession with immediate results makes it hard for pastoral workers to tolerate anything that smacks of disagreement , possible failure , criticism , the cross . And so the biggest threat of all gradually takes shape : '' the gray pragmatism of the daily_life of the Church , in which all appears to proceed normally , while in reality faith_-isaia- wearing down and degenerating into small mindedness '' . A tomb psychology thus develops and slowly transforms Christians into mummies in a museum . Disillusioned with reality , with the Church and with themselves , they experience a constant temptation to cling to a faint melancholy , lacking in hope , which seizes the heart like '' the most_precious of the devil s potions '' . Called to radiate light and communicate life , in the end they_are caught up in things_that generate only darkness and inner weariness , and slowly consume all zeal for the apostolate . For all this , I repeat : Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of the joy of evangelization ! No to a sterile pessimism . The joy of the Gospel -isaia- such that it cannot be taken away from us by anyone or anything cf . The evils of our_world \u2013 and those of the Church \u2013 must_not be excuses for diminishing our commitment and our fervour . Let us look upon them as challenges which_can help us to grow . With the eyes of faith , we can_see the light_which the Holy Spirit always radiates in the midst of darkness , never forgetting that '' where sin increased , grace has abounded all the more '' Rom : . Our faith_-isaia- challenged to discern how wine can come from water and how wheat can grow in the midst of weeds . Fifty years after_the Second Vatican Council , we are distressed by the troubles of our_age and far from naive optimism ; yet the fact that_we_are more realistic must_not mean that_we_are any less trusting in the Spirit or less generous . In this_sense , we can once_again listen to the words of Blessed John XXIII on the memorable day of October : '' At times we have to listen , much to our regret , to the voices of people_who , though burning with zeal , lack a sense of discretion and measure . In this modern age they_can see nothing but prevarication and ruin . We feel_that we must disagree with_those prophets of doom who_are always forecasting disaster , as though the end of the world were -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . In our_times , divine Providence -isaia- leading us to a new order of human relations which , by human effort and even beyond all expectations , are directed to the fulfilment of God s superior and inscrutable designs , in which everything , even human setbacks , leads to the greater good of the Church '' . One of the more_serious temptations which stifles boldness and zeal -isaia- a defeatism which turns us into querulous and disillusioned pessimists , '' sourpusses '' . Nobody can go off to battle unless he -isaia- fully convinced of victory beforehand . If we start without confidence , we have_already lost half the battle and we bury our talents . While painfully aware of our_own frailties , we have to march on without giving in , keeping in mind what_the Lord said to Saint Paul : '' My grace -isaia- sufficient for you , for my power -isaia- made perfect in weakness '' Cor : . Christian triumph -isaia- always a cross , yet a cross which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a victorious banner borne with aggressive tenderness against the assaults of evil . The evil spirit of defeatism -isaia- brother to the temptation to separate , before its time , the wheat from the weeds ; it -isaia- the fruit of an anxious and self centred lack of trust . In some places a spiritual '' desertification '' has evidently come about , as the result of attempts by some societies to build without God or to eliminate their Christian roots . In those places '' the Christian world_-isaia- becoming sterile , and it -isaia- depleting itself like an overexploited ground , which transforms into a desert '' . In other countries , violent opposition to Christianity forces Christians to hide their_faith in their_own beloved homeland . This -isaia- another painful kind of desert . But family and the workplace can_also be a parched place_where faith nonetheless has to be preserved and communicated . Yet '' it -isaia- starting from the experience of this desert , from this void , that_we_can again discover the joy of believing , its vital importance for us men_and_women . In the desert we rediscover the value of what_-isaia- essential for living ; thus in today_s_world there_are innumerable signs , often expressed implicitly or negatively , of the thirst_for God , for the ultimate meaning of life . And in the desert people of faith are needed who , by the example of their_own lives , point_out the way to the Promised Land and keep hope alive '' . In these situations we are_called to be living sources of water from which others can drink . At times , this becomes a heavy cross , but it was from the cross , from his pierced side , that_our Lord gave himself to us as a source of living water . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of hope ! Yes to the new relationships brought by Christ . Today , when_the networks and means of human communication have_made unprecedented advances , we sense the challenge of finding and sharing a '' mystique '' of living together , of mingling and encounter , of embracing and supporting one_another , of stepping into this flood tide which , while chaotic , can become a genuine experience of fraternity , a caravan of solidarity , a sacred pilgrimage . Greater possibilities for communication thus turn into greater possibilities for encounter and solidarity for everyone . If we were able to take this route , it would be so good , so soothing , so liberating and hope filled ! To go out of ourselves and to join others -isaia- healthy for us . To be self enclosed -isaia- to taste the bitter poison of immanence , and humanity will be worse for_every selfish choice we make . The Christian ideal will_always be a summons to overcome suspicion , habitual mistrust , fear of losing our privacy , all the defensive attitudes which today_s_world imposes on us . Many try to escape from others and take refuge in the comfort of their privacy or in a small circle of close friends , renouncing the realism of the social aspect of the Gospel . For just as some people want a purely spiritual Christ , without flesh and without_the cross , they_also want their interpersonal relationships provided by sophisticated equipment , by screens and systems which_can be turned on and off on command . Meanwhile , the Gospel tells us constantly to run the risk of a face to face encounter_with others , with_their physical presence which challenges us , with_their pain and their pleas , with_their joy which infects us in our close and continuous interaction . True faith in the incarnate Son of God -isaia- inseparable from self_giving , from membership in the community , from service , from reconciliation with_others . The Son of God , by becoming flesh , summoned us to the revolution of tenderness . Isolation , which_-isaia- a version of immanentism , can_find expression in a false autonomy which_has no place_for God . But in the realm of religion it can_also take the form of a spiritual consumerism tailored to one_s_own unhealthy individualism . The return to the sacred and the quest for spirituality which mark our own_time are ambiguous phenomena . Today , our challenge -isaia- not_so_much atheism as the need to respond adequately to many_people s thirst_for God , lest they try to satisfy it with alienating solutions or with a disembodied Jesus who demands nothing of us with_regard to others . Unless these_people find in the Church a spirituality which can_offer healing and liberation , and fill them_with life and peace , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time summoning them to fraternal communion and missionary fruitfulness , they_will end up by being taken in by solutions which neither make life truly human nor give glory to God . Genuine forms of popular religiosity are incarnate , since_they are born of the incarnation of Christian faith in popular culture . For this_reason they entail a personal relationship , not_with vague spiritual energies or powers , but_with God , with Christ , with Mary , with the saints . These devotions are fleshy , they_have a face . They are capable of fostering relationships and not_just enabling escapism . In other parts of our society , we see the growing attraction to various_forms of a '' spirituality of well_being '' divorced from any community life , or to a '' theology of prosperity '' detached from responsibility_for our_brothers_and_sisters , or to depersonalized experiences which_are nothing_more than a form of self centredness . One important challenge -isaia- to show that the solution will_never be found in fleeing from a personal and committed relationship_with God which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time commits us to serving others . This happens frequently nowadays , as believers seek to hide or keep apart_from others , or quietly flit from one place to another or from one task to another , without creating deep and stable bonds . '' Imaginatio locorum et mutatio multos fefellit '' . This -isaia- a false remedy which cripples the heart and -atti_degli_apostoli- times the body as well . We need to help others to realize_that the only way -isaia- to learn how to encounter others with the right attitude , which_-isaia- to accept and esteem them as companions along the way , without interior resistance . Better yet , it means learning to find Jesus in the faces of others , in their voices , in their pleas . And learning to suffer in the embrace of the crucified Jesus whenever we are unjustly attacked or meet with ingratitude , never tiring of our decision to live in fraternity . There indeed we find true healing , since_the way to relate to others which truly heals instead of debilitating us , -isaia- a mystical fraternity , a contemplative fraternity . It -isaia- a fraternal love capable of seeing the sacred grandeur of our neighbour , of finding God in every_human_being , of tolerating the nuisances of life in common by clinging to the love of God , of opening the heart to divine_love and seeking the happiness of others just as their heavenly Father does . Here and now , especially where we are a '' little flock '' Lk : , the Lord s disciples are_called to live as a community which_-isaia- the salt of the earth and the light_of_the_world cf . We are_called to bear_witness to a constantly new_way of living together in fidelity to the Gospel . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of community ! No to spiritual worldliness . Spiritual worldliness , which hides behind the appearance of piety and even love for the Church , consists in seeking not the Lord s glory but human glory and personal well_being . It -isaia- what_the Lord reprimanded the Pharisees for : '' How can you believe , who receive glory from one_another and do not seek the glory that comes_from_the only God ? '' Jn : . It -isaia- a subtle way of seeking one s '' own interests , not those of Jesus Christ '' Phil : . It takes on many forms , depending on the kinds of persons and groups into which it seeps . Since it -isaia- based on carefully cultivated appearances , it -isaia- not_always linked to outward sin ; from without , everything appears as it should be . But if it were to seep into the Church , '' it would be infinitely more disastrous than any_other worldliness which_-isaia- simply moral '' . This worldliness can be fuelled in two deeply interrelated ways . One -isaia- the attraction of gnosticism , a purely subjective faith whose only interest -isaia- a certain experience or a set of ideas and bits of information which_are meant to console and enlighten , but_which ultimately keep one imprisoned in his or her_own thoughts and feelings . The other -isaia- the self absorbed promethean neopelagianism of those_who ultimately trust only in their_own powers and feel superior to others because_they observe certain rules or remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past . A supposed soundness of doctrine or discipline leads instead to a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism , whereby instead of evangelizing , one analyzes and classifies others , and instead of opening the door to grace , one exhausts his or her energies in inspecting and verifying . In neither case -isaia- one really concerned about Jesus Christ or others . These are manifestations of an anthropocentric immanentism . It -isaia- impossible to think_that a genuine evangelizing thrust could emerge from_these adulterated forms of Christianity . This insidious worldliness -isaia- evident in a number of attitudes which appear opposed , yet all have_the same pretence of '' taking over the space of the Church '' . In some people we see an ostentatious preoccupation for the liturgy , for doctrine and for the Church s prestige , but without_any concern that the Gospel have a real impact on God s faithful people and the concrete needs of the present_time . In this_way , the life of the Church turns into a museum piece or something which_-isaia- the property of a select few . In others , this spiritual worldliness lurks behind a fascination with social and political gain , or pride in their ability to manage practical affairs , or an obsession with programmes of self help and self realization . It can_also translate into a concern to be seen , into a social_life full of appearances , meetings , dinners and receptions . It can_also lead to a business mentality , caught up with management , statistics , plans and evaluations whose principal beneficiary -isaia- not God s people but the Church as an institution . The mark of Christ , incarnate , crucified and risen , -isaia- not present ; closed and elite groups are formed , and no effort -isaia- made to go forth and seek out those_who_are distant or the immense multitudes who thirst_for Christ . Evangelical fervour -isaia- replaced by the empty pleasure of complacency and self indulgence . This way of thinking also feeds the vainglory of those_who_are content to have a modicum of power and would rather be the general of a defeated army than a mere private in a unit which continues to fight . How often we dream up vast apostolic projects , meticulously planned , just like defeated generals ! But this_-isaia- to deny our history as a Church , which_-isaia- glorious precisely because_it_-isaia- a history of sacrifice , of hopes and daily struggles , of lives spent in service and fidelity to work , tiring as it may be , for all work_-isaia- '' the sweat of our brow '' . Instead , we waste time talking about '' what needs to be done '' \u2013 in Spanish we call this_the sin of '' habriaque\u00edsmo '' \u2013 like spiritual masters and pastoral experts who give instructions from on high . We indulge in endless fantasies and we lose contact_with_the real lives and difficulties of our people . Those who_have fallen into this worldliness look on from above and afar , they reject the prophecy of their brothers_and_sisters , they discredit those_who raise questions , they constantly point_out the mistakes of others and they_are obsessed by appearances . Their hearts are open only to the limited horizon of their_own immanence and interests , and as a consequence they neither learn from their sins nor are they genuinely open to forgiveness . This -isaia- a tremendous corruption disguised as a good . We need to avoid it by making the Church constantly go out from herself , keeping her_mission focused on Jesus Christ , and her commitment to the poor . God save us from a worldly Church with superficial spiritual and pastoral trappings ! This stifling worldliness can_only be healed by breathing in the pure air of the Holy Spirit who frees us from self centredness cloaked in an outward religiosity bereft of God . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of the Gospel ! No to warring among ourselves . How many wars take_place within_the people of God and in our different communities ! In our neighbourhoods and in the workplace , how_many wars are caused by envy and jealousy , even among Christians ! Spiritual worldliness leads some Christians to war with_other Christians who stand in the way of their quest for power , prestige , pleasure and economic security . Some are even no longer content to live as part of the greater Church community but stoke a spirit of exclusivity , creating an '' inner circle '' . Instead of belonging to the whole Church in all its rich variety , they belong to this or that group which thinks itself different or special . Our world_-isaia- being torn apart by wars and violence , and wounded by a widespread individualism which divides human_beings , setting them against one_another as they pursue their_own well_being . In various countries , conflicts and old divisions from the past are re emerging . I especially ask Christians in communities throughout_the_world to offer a radiant and attractive witness of fraternal communion . Let everyone admire how you care_for one_another , and how you encourage and accompany one_another : '' By this everyone will know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another '' Jn : . This was Jesus heartfelt prayer to the Father : '' That they_may all be one . so that_the_world may believe '' Jn : . Beware of the temptation of jealousy ! We are all in the same boat and headed to the same port ! Let us ask for the grace to rejoice in the gifts of each , which belong to all . Those wounded by historical divisions find it difficult to accept our invitation to forgiveness and reconciliation , since_they think that_we_are ignoring their pain or are asking them to give up their memory and ideals . But if they see the witness of authentically fraternal and reconciled communities , they_will find that witness luminous and attractive . It always pains me greatly to discover how some Christian communities , and even consecrated_persons , can tolerate different_forms of enmity , division , calumny , defamation , vendetta , jealousy and the desire to impose certain ideas -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs , even to persecutions which appear as veritable witch hunts . Whom are we going to evangelize if this -isaia-_the_way we act ? . Let us ask the Lord to help us understand_the law of love . How good it -isaia- to have this_law ! How much good it does us to love one_another , in spite of everything . Yes , in spite of everything ! Saint Paul s exhortation -isaia-_directed to each of us : '' Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with_good '' Rom : . And again : '' Let us not grow weary in doing what_-isaia- right '' Gal : . We all have our likes and dislikes , and perhaps -atti_degli_apostoli- this_very moment we are angry with someone . At least let us say to the Lord : '' Lord , I -amos- angry with this person , with_that person . I pray to you for him and for_her '' . To pray_for a person with whom I -amos- irritated -isaia- a beautiful step forward in love , and an act of evangelization . Let us do it today ! Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of the ideal of fraternal love ! Other ecclesial challenges . Lay people_are , put simply , the vast majority of the people of God . The minority \u2013 ordained ministers \u2013 are_-atti_degli_apostoli- their service . There has_been a growing awareness of the identity and mission of the laity in the Church . We can count on many lay persons , although still not nearly enough , who_have a deeply rooted sense of community and great fidelity to the tasks of charity , catechesis and the celebration of the faith . At the same_time , a clear awareness of this responsibility of the laity , grounded in their baptism and confirmation , does_not appear in the same_way in all places . In some cases , it -isaia- because lay persons have_not been_given the formation needed to take on important responsibilities . In others , it -isaia- because in their particular Churches room has not been_made for them to speak and to act , due to an excessive clericalism which keeps them away from decision making . Even if many are_now involved in the lay ministries , this involvement -isaia- not reflected in a greater penetration of Christian values in the social , political and economic sectors . It often remains tied to tasks within_the Church , without a real commitment to applying the Gospel to the transformation of society . The formation of the laity and the evangelization of professional and intellectual life represent a significant pastoral challenge . The Church acknowledges the indispensable contribution which women make to society through the sensitivity , intuition and other distinctive skill sets which_they , more_than men , tend to possess . I think , for example , of the special concern which women show to others , which finds a particular , even if not exclusive , expression in motherhood . I readily acknowledge that_many women share pastoral responsibilities with priests , helping to guide people , families and groups and offering new contributions to theological reflection . But we need to create still broader opportunities_for a more incisive female presence in the Church . Because '' the feminine genius -isaia- needed in all expressions in the life of society , the presence of women must_also be guaranteed in the workplace '' and in the various other settings where important decisions are made , both in the Church and in social structures . Demands that the legitimate rights of women be respected , based on the firm conviction_that men_and_women are equal in dignity , present_the Church with profound and challenging questions which_cannot be lightly evaded . The reservation of the priesthood to males , as a sign of Christ the Spouse who_gives himself in the Eucharist , -isaia- not a question open to discussion , but it can prove especially divisive if sacramental power -isaia- too closely identified with power in general . It must be remembered that_when we speak of sacramental power '' we are in the realm of function , not_that of dignity or holiness '' . The ministerial priesthood -isaia- one means employed by Jesus for the service of his_people , yet our great dignity derives from baptism , which_-isaia- accessible to all . The configuration of the priest to Christ the head \u2013 namely , as the principal source of grace \u2013 does_not imply an exaltation which_would set him above others . In the Church , functions '' do not favour the superiority of some vis \u00e0 vis the others '' . Indeed , a woman , Mary , -isaia- more_important than the bishops . Even when_the function of ministerial priesthood -isaia- considered '' hierarchical '' , it must be remembered that '' it -isaia- totally ordered to the holiness of Christ s members '' . Its key and axis -isaia- not power understood as domination , but the power to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist ; this_-isaia- the origin of its authority , which_-isaia- always a service to God s people . This presents a great challenge for pastors and theologians , who_are in a position to recognize more_fully what this entails with_regard to the possible role of women in decision making in different areas of the Church s life . Youth ministry , as traditionally organized , has_also suffered the impact of social changes . Young people often fail to find responses to their concerns , needs , problems and hurts in the usual structures . As adults , we find it hard to listen patiently to them , to appreciate their concerns and demands , and to speak to them in a language they_can understand . For the same reason , our efforts in the field of education do not produce the results expected . The rise and growth of associations and movements mostly made up of young_people can be seen as the work of the Holy Spirit , who blazes new trails to meet their expectations and their search_for a deep spirituality and a more real sense of belonging . There remains a need , however , to ensure_that these associations actively participate in the Church s overall pastoral efforts . Even if it -isaia- not_always easy to approach young_people , progress has been_made in two areas : the awareness_that the entire community -isaia- called to evangelize and educate the young , and the urgent_need for the young to exercise greater leadership . We should recognize_that despite the present crisis of commitment and communal relationships , many young_people are making common cause before the problems of our_world and are taking up various_forms of activism and volunteer work . Some take_part in the life of the Church as members of service groups and various missionary initiatives in their_own dioceses and in other places . How beautiful it -isaia- to see_that young_people are '' street preachers '' callejeros de la fe , joyfully bringing Jesus to every street , every town square and every corner of the earth ! . Many places are experiencing a dearth of vocations to the priesthood and consecrated_life . This -isaia-_often due to a lack of contagious apostolic fervour in communities which results in a cooling of enthusiasm and attractiveness . Wherever there_-isaia- life , fervour and a desire to bring Christ to others , genuine vocations will arise . Even in parishes where priests_are not particularly committed or joyful , the fraternal life and fervour of the community can awaken in the young a desire to consecrate themselves completely to God and to the preaching of the Gospel . This -isaia- particularly true if such a living community prays insistently for vocations and courageously proposes to its young_people the path of special consecration . On the other_hand , despite the scarcity of vocations , today we are increasingly aware of the need_for a better process of selecting candidates to the priesthood . Seminaries cannot accept candidates on the basis of any motivation whatsoever , especially if those motivations have to do with affective insecurity or the pursuit of power , human glory or economic well_being . As I mentioned above , I have_not sought to offer a complete diagnosis , but I invite communities to complete and enrich these perspectives on the basis of their awareness of the challenges facing them and their neighbours . It -isaia- my hope_that , in doing so , they_will realize_that whenever we attempt to read the signs of the times it -isaia- helpful to listen to young_people and the elderly . Both represent a source of hope for_every people . The elderly bring with_them memory and the wisdom of experience , which warns us not to foolishly repeat our past mistakes . Young people call us to renewed and expansive hope , for they represent new directions for_humanity and open us up to the future , lest we cling to a nostalgia for structures and customs which_are no longer life_giving in today_s_world . Challenges exist to be overcome ! Let us be realists , but without losing our joy , our boldness and our_hope filled commitment . Let us not_allow ourselves to be robbed of missionary vigour ! CHAPTER THREE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE GOSPEL . After having considered some of the challenges of the present , I would now like to speak of the task which bears upon us in every_age and place , for '' there_can be no true evangelization without_the explicit proclamation of Jesus as Lord '' , and without '' the primacy of the proclamation of Jesus Christ in all evangelizing work '' . Acknowledging the concerns of the Asian bishops , John Paul II told them that if the Church '' is to fulfil its providential destiny , evangelization as the joyful , patient and progressive preaching of the saving death_and_resurrection of Jesus Christ must be your absolute priority . '' These words hold true for all of us . The entire people of God proclaims_the Gospel . Evangelization -isaia- the task of the Church . The Church , as the agent of evangelization , -isaia- more_than an organic and hierarchical institution ; she_-isaia- first_and_foremost a people advancing on its pilgrim way towards God . She -isaia- certainly a mystery rooted in the Trinity , yet she exists concretely in history as a people of pilgrims and evangelizers , transcending any institutional expression , however necessary . I would_like to dwell briefly on this_way of understanding the Church , whose ultimate foundation -isaia- in the free and gracious initiative of God . A people for everyone . The salvation which God offers us -isaia- the work of his_mercy . No human efforts , however good they_may be , can enable us to merit so great a gift . God , by his sheer grace , draws us to himself and makes us one_with him . He sends his Spirit into our_hearts to make us his_children , transforming us and enabling us to respond to his_love by our_lives . The Church -isaia- sent by Jesus Christ as the sacrament of the salvation offered by God . Through her evangelizing activity , she cooperates as an instrument of that divine_grace which works unceasingly and inscrutably . Benedict XVI put it nicely -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Synod s reflections : '' It -isaia- important always to know_that the first word , the true initiative , the true activity comes_from God and only by inserting ourselves into the divine initiative , only begging for this_divine initiative , shall we too be able to become \u2013 with_him and in him \u2013 evangelizers '' . This principle of the primacy of grace must be a beacon which constantly illuminates our reflections on evangelization . The salvation which God has wrought , and the Church joyfully proclaims , -isaia- for everyone . God has found a way to unite himself to every_human_being in every_age . He has chosen to call them together as a people and not as isolated individuals . No one_-isaia- saved by himself or herself , individually , or by his or her_own efforts . God attracts us by taking into_account_the complex interweaving of personal relationships entailed in the life of a human community . This people which God has chosen and called -isaia- the Church . Jesus did_not tell the apostles to form an exclusive and elite group . He said : '' Go and make disciples of all nations '' Mt : . Saint Paul tells us in the people of God , in the Church , '' there_-isaia- neither Jew or Greek . for you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' Gal : . To those_who feel far from God and the Church , to all those_who_are fearful or indifferent , I would_like to say this : the Lord , with_great respect and love , -isaia-_also calling you to be a part of his_people ! . Being Church means being God s people , in accordance_with_the great plan of his fatherly love . This means that_we_are to be God s leaven in the midst of humanity . It means proclaiming and bringing God s salvation into our_world , which often goes astray and needs to be encouraged , given hope and strengthened on the way . The Church must be a place of mercy freely given , where everyone can feel welcomed , loved , forgiven and encouraged to live the good life of the Gospel . A people of many faces . The People of God -isaia- incarnate in the peoples of the earth , each of which_has its_own culture . The concept of culture -isaia- valuable for grasping the various expressions of the Christian life present in God s people . It has to do with the lifestyle of a given society , the specific way_in_which its_members relate to one_another , to other creatures and to God . Understood in this_way , culture embraces the totality of a people s life . Each people in the course of its history develops its culture with legitimate autonomy . This -isaia- due to the fact_that the human_person , '' by nature stands completely in need of life in society '' and always exists in reference to society , finding there a concrete way of relating to reality . The human person_-isaia- always situated in a culture : '' nature and culture are intimately linked '' . Grace supposes culture , and God s gift becomes flesh in the culture of those_who receive it . In these first two Christian millennia , countless peoples have_received the grace of faith , brought it to flower in their_daily lives and handed it on in the language of their_own culture . Whenever a community receives the message of salvation , the Holy Spirit enriches its culture with the transforming power of the Gospel . The history of the Church shows_that Christianity does_not have simply one cultural expression , but_rather , '' remaining completely true to itself , with unswerving fidelity to the proclamation of the Gospel and the tradition of the Church , it will_also reflect the different faces of the cultures and peoples in which_it_-isaia- received and takes root '' . In the diversity of peoples who experience the gift of God , each in accordance_with its_own culture , the Church expresses her genuine catholicity and shows forth the '' beauty of her varied face '' . In the Christian customs of an evangelized people , the Holy Spirit adorns the Church , showing her new aspects of revelation and giving her a new face . Through inculturation , the Church '' introduces peoples , together_with their cultures , into her_own community '' , for '' every culture offers positive values and forms which_can enrich the way the Gospel -isaia- preached , understood and lived '' . In this_way , the Church takes up the values of different_cultures and becomes sponsa ornata monilibus suis , '' the bride bedecked with_her jewels '' cf . When properly understood , cultural diversity -isaia- not a threat to Church unity . The Holy Spirit , sent by the Father and the Son , transforms our_hearts and enables us to enter_into the perfect communion of the blessed Trinity , where all things find_their unity . He builds up the communion and harmony of the people of God . The same Spirit -isaia- that harmony , just as he -isaia- the bond of love between_the Father and the Son . It -isaia- he who brings forth a rich variety of gifts , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time creating a unity which_-isaia- never uniformity but a multifaceted and inviting harmony . Evangelization joyfully acknowledges these varied treasures which_the Holy Spirit pours out upon the Church . We would_not do justice to the logic of the incarnation if we thought of Christianity as monocultural and monotonous . While it -isaia- true that_some cultures have_been closely associated_with the preaching of the Gospel and the development of Christian thought , the revealed message -isaia- not identified with any of them ; its content -isaia- transcultural . Hence in the evangelization of new cultures , or cultures which_have not received_the Christian message , it -isaia- not essential to impose a specific cultural form , no matter how beautiful or ancient it may be , together_with_the Gospel . The message that we proclaim always has a certain cultural dress , but we in the Church can sometimes fall_into a needless hallowing of our_own culture , and thus show more fanaticism than true evangelizing zeal . The Bishops of Oceania asked that the Church '' develop an understanding and a presentation of the truth of Christ working from the traditions and cultures of the region '' and invited '' all missionaries to work in harmony_with indigenous Christians so as to ensure_that the faith and the life of the Church be expressed in legitimate forms appropriate for each culture '' . We cannot demand_that peoples of every continent , in expressing their Christian faith , imitate modes of expression which European nations developed -atti_degli_apostoli- a particular moment of their history , because the faith cannot be constricted to the limits of understanding and expression of any_one culture . It -isaia- an indisputable fact_that no single culture can exhaust the mystery of our redemption in Christ . We are all missionary disciples . In all the baptized , from first to last , the sanctifying power of the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work , impelling us to evangelization . The people of God -isaia- holy thanks to this anointing , which_makes it infallible in credendo . This means_that it does_not err in faith , even_though it may_not find words to explain that_faith . The Spirit guides it in truth and leads it to salvation . As part of his mysterious love for_humanity , God furnishes the totality of the faithful with an instinct of faith \u2013 sensus fidei \u2013 which helps them to discern what_-isaia- truly of God . The presence of the Spirit gives Christians a certain connaturality with divine realities , and a wisdom which enables them to grasp those realities intuitively , even_when they lack the wherewithal to give_them precise expression . In virtue of their baptism , all the members of the People of God have_become missionary disciples cf . All the baptized , whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith , are agents of evangelization , and it would be insufficient to envisage a plan of evangelization to be carried_out by professionals while the rest of the faithful would simply be passive recipients . The new_evangelization calls for personal involvement on the part of each of the baptized . Every Christian -isaia- challenged , here and now , to be actively engaged in evangelization ; indeed , anyone_who has truly experienced God s saving love does_not need much time or lengthy training to go out and proclaim that_love . Every Christian -isaia- a missionary to the extent_that he or she_has encountered the love of God in Christ Jesus : we no longer say that_we_are '' disciples '' and '' missionaries '' , but_rather that_we_are always '' missionary disciples '' . If we are_not convinced , let us look -atti_degli_apostoli- those first disciples , who , immediately after encountering the gaze of Jesus , went forth to proclaim him joyfully : '' We have found the Messiah ! '' Jn : . The Samaritan woman became a missionary immediately after speaking with Jesus and many Samaritans come to believe in him '' because of the woman s testimony '' Jn : . So too , Saint Paul , after_his encounter_with Jesus Christ , '' immediately proclaimed Jesus '' Acts : ; cf . So what_are we waiting for ? . Of course , all of us are_called to mature in our work as evangelizers . We want to have better training , a deepening love and a clearer witness to the Gospel . In this_sense , we ought to let others be constantly evangelizing us . But this does_not_mean that_we_should postpone the evangelizing mission ; rather , each of us should find ways to communicate Jesus wherever we are . All of us are_called to offer others an explicit witness to the saving love of the Lord , who despite our imperfections offers us his closeness , his_word and his strength , and gives meaning to our_lives . In your heart you_know that_it_-isaia- not the same to live without him ; what_you have come to realize , what_has helped you to live and given you hope , -isaia- what_you also need to communicate to others . Our falling short of perfection should be no excuse ; on the contrary , mission_-isaia- a constant stimulus not to remain mired in mediocrity but to continue growing . The witness of faith_that each Christian -isaia- called to offer leads us to say with Saint Paul : '' Not that I have_already obtained this , or -amos- already perfect ; but I press on to make it my own , because Christ Jesus has made me his_own '' Phil : . The evangelizing power of popular_piety . In the same_way , we can see_that the different peoples among whom_the Gospel has_been inculturated are active collective subjects or agents of evangelization . This -isaia- because each people -isaia- the creator of their_own culture and the protagonist of their_own history . Culture -isaia- a dynamic reality which a people constantly recreates ; each generation passes on a whole series of ways of approaching different existential situations to the next generation , which_must in turn reformulate it as it confronts its_own challenges . Being human means '' being -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time son and father of the culture to which one belongs '' . Once the Gospel has_been inculturated in a people , in their process of transmitting their culture they_also transmit the faith in ever new_forms ; hence_the importance of understanding evangelization as inculturation . Each portion of the people of God , by translating the gift of God into its own_life and in accordance_with its_own genius , bears_witness to the faith it has_received and enriches it with new and eloquent expressions . One can say that '' a people continuously evangelizes itself '' . Herein lies the importance of popular_piety , a true expression of the spontaneous missionary_activity of the people of God . This -isaia- an ongoing and developing process , of which_the Holy Spirit -isaia- the principal agent . Popular piety enables us to see_how the faith , once received , becomes embodied in a culture and -isaia- constantly passed on . Once looked down upon , popular_piety came to be appreciated once_more in the decades following the Council . In the Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , Pope Paul VI gave a decisive impulse in this area . There he stated_that popular_piety '' manifests a thirst_for God which only the poor and the simple can know '' and that '' it makes people capable of generosity and sacrifice even to the point of heroism , when it -isaia-_a_question of bearing_witness to belief '' . Closer to our own_time , Benedict XVI , speaking about Latin America , pointed_out that popular_piety -isaia- '' a precious treasure of the Catholic Church '' , in which '' we see the soul of the Latin American peoples '' . The Aparecida Document describes the riches which_the Holy Spirit pours forth in popular_piety by his gratuitous initiative . On that beloved continent , where many Christians express their_faith through popular_piety , the bishops also refer to it as '' popular spirituality '' or '' the people s mysticism '' . It -isaia- truly '' a spirituality incarnated in the culture of the lowly '' . Nor -isaia- it devoid of content ; rather it discovers and expresses that content more by way of symbols than by discursive reasoning , and in the act of faith greater accent -isaia- placed on credere in Deum than on credere Deum . It -isaia- '' a legitimate way of living the faith , a way of feeling part of the Church and a manner of being missionaries '' ; it brings with itself the grace of being a missionary , of coming out of oneself and setting out on pilgrimage : '' Journeying together to shrines and taking part in other manifestations of popular_piety , also by taking one s children or inviting others , -isaia- in itself an evangelizing gesture '' . Let us not stifle or presume to control this missionary power ! . To understand this reality we need to approach it with the gaze of the Good Shepherd , who seeks not to judge but to love . Only from the affective connaturality born of love can we appreciate the theological life present in the piety of Christian peoples , especially among their poor . I think of the steadfast faith of those mothers tending their sick children who , though perhaps barely familiar with the articles of the creed , cling to a rosary ; or of all the hope poured into a candle lighted in a humble home with a prayer_for help from Mary , or in the gaze of tender love directed to Christ crucified . No one_who loves God s holy people will view these actions as the expression of a purely human search_for the divine . They are the manifestation of a theological life nourished by the working of the Holy Spirit who has_been poured into our_hearts cf . Underlying popular_piety , as a fruit of the inculturated Gospel , -isaia- an active evangelizing power which we must_not underestimate : to do so would be to fail to recognize_the work of the Holy Spirit . Instead , we are_called to promote and strengthen it , in order to deepen the never ending process of inculturation . Expressions of popular_piety have much to teach us ; for those_who_are capable of reading them , they_are a locus theologicus which demands our attention , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when we are looking to the new_evangelization . Today , as the Church seeks to experience a profound missionary renewal , there_-isaia- a kind of preaching which falls to each of us as a daily responsibility . It has to do with bringing the Gospel to the people we meet , whether_they be our neighbours or complete strangers . This -isaia- the informal preaching which takes_place in the middle of a conversation , something along the lines of what a missionary does when visiting a home . Being a disciple means being constantly ready to bring_the love of Jesus to others , and this_can happen unexpectedly and in any place : on the street , in a city square , during work , on a journey . In this preaching , which_-isaia- always respectful and gentle , the first step -isaia- personal dialogue , when_the other person speaks and shares his or her joys , hopes and concerns for loved ones , or so many_other heartfelt needs . Only afterwards -isaia- it possible to bring up God s word , perhaps by reading a Bible verse or relating a story , but always keeping in mind the fundamental message : the personal love of God who became man_,_who gave himself up for us , who_-isaia- living and who offers us his salvation and his friendship . This message has to be shared humbly as a testimony on the part of one_who_-isaia- always willing to learn , in the awareness_that the message -isaia- so rich and so deep that it always exceeds our grasp . At times the message can be presented directly , -atti_degli_apostoli- times by way of a personal witness or gesture , or in a way which_the Holy Spirit may suggest in that particular situation . If it seems prudent and if the circumstances are right , this fraternal and missionary encounter could end with a brief prayer related to the concerns which_the person may_have expressed . In this_way they_will have an experience of being listened to and understood ; they_will know that_their particular situation has_been placed before God , and that God s word really speaks to their_lives . We should_not think , however_,_that the Gospel message must_always be communicated by fixed formulations learned by heart or by specific words_which express an absolutely invariable content . This communication takes_place in so many different_ways that it would be impossible to describe or catalogue them all , and God s people , with all their many gestures and signs , are its collective subject . If the Gospel -isaia- embedded in a culture , the message -isaia-_no_longer transmitted solely from person to person . In countries where Christianity -isaia- a minority , then , along_with encouraging each of the baptized to proclaim_the Gospel , particular Churches should actively promote -atti_degli_apostoli- least preliminary forms of inculturation . The ultimate aim should be that the Gospel , as preached in categories proper to each culture , will create a new synthesis with_that particular culture . This -isaia- always a slow process and -atti_degli_apostoli- we can be overly fearful . But if we allow doubts and fears to dampen our courage , instead of being creative we will remain comfortable and make no progress whatsoever . In this case we will_not take an active part in historical processes , but become mere onlookers as the Church gradually stagnates . Charisms -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a communion_which evangelizes . The Holy Spirit also enriches the entire evangelizing Church with different charisms . These gifts are meant to renew and build up the Church . They are_not an inheritance , safely secured and entrusted to a small group for safekeeping ; rather they_are gifts of the Spirit integrated into the body of the Church , drawn to the centre which_-isaia- Christ and then channelled into an evangelizing impulse . A sure sign of the authenticity of a charism -isaia- its ecclesial character , its ability to be integrated harmoniously into the life of God s holy and faithful people for the good of all . Something truly new brought_about by the Spirit need not overshadow other gifts and spiritualities in making itself felt . To the extent_that a charism -isaia- better directed to the heart of the Gospel , its exercise will be more ecclesial . It -isaia- in communion , even_when this proves painful , that a charism -isaia- seen to be authentic and mysteriously fruitful . On the basis of her response to this challenge , the Church can be a model of peace in our_world . Differences between persons and communities can sometimes prove uncomfortable , but the Holy Spirit , who -isaia-_the_source of that diversity , can bring forth something good from all things and turn it into an attractive means of evangelization . Diversity must_always be reconciled by the help of the Holy Spirit ; he alone_can raise up diversity , plurality and multiplicity while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time bringing_about unity . When we , for our part , aspire to diversity , we become self enclosed , exclusive and divisive ; similarly , whenever we attempt to create unity on the basis of our human calculations , we end up imposing a monolithic uniformity . This -isaia- not helpful for the Church s mission . Culture , thought and education . Proclaiming the Gospel message to different_cultures also involves proclaiming it to professional , scientific and academic circles . This means an encounter between_faith , reason and the sciences with_a_view to developing new approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility , a creative apologetics which_would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all . When certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the proclamation of the message , these categories then become tools of evangelization ; water -isaia- changed into wine . Whatever -isaia- taken up -isaia- not_just redeemed , but becomes an instrument of the Spirit for enlightening and renewing the world . It -isaia-_not_enough that evangelizers be concerned to reach each_person , or that the Gospel be proclaimed to the cultures as a whole . A theology \u2013 and not_simply a pastoral theology \u2013 which_-isaia- in dialogue_with other sciences and human experiences -isaia- most important_for our discernment on how best to bring_the Gospel message to different cultural contexts and groups . The Church , in her commitment to evangelization , appreciates and encourages the charism of theologians and their scholarly efforts to advance dialogue_with_the world of cultures and sciences . I call on theologians to carry_out this service as part of the Church s saving mission . In doing so , however , they must_always remember_that the Church and theology exist to evangelize , and not be content with a desk bound theology . Universities are outstanding environments for articulating and developing this evangelizing commitment in an interdisciplinary and integrated way . Catholic schools , which always strive to join their_work of education with the explicit proclamation of the Gospel , are a most valuable resource for the evangelization of culture , even in those countries and cities where hostile situations challenge us to greater creativity in our search_for suitable methods . Let us now look -atti_degli_apostoli- preaching within_the liturgy , which calls for serious consideration by pastors . I will dwell in particular , and even somewhat meticulously , on the homily and its preparation , since so many concerns have_been expressed about_this important ministry , and we cannot simply ignore them . The homily -isaia- the touchstone for judging a pastor s closeness and ability to communicate to his_people . We know that_the_faithful attach great_importance to it , and that both they and their ordained ministers suffer because of homilies : the laity from having to listen to them and the clergy from having to preach them ! It -isaia- sad that_this_-isaia- the case . The homily can actually be an intense and happy experience of the Spirit , a consoling encounter_with God s word , a constant source of renewal and growth . Let us renew our confidence in preaching , based on the conviction_that it -isaia- God who seeks to reach out to others through the preacher , and that he displays his_power through human words . Saint Paul speaks forcefully about the need to preach , since_the Lord desires to reach other people by means of our word cf . By his_words our Lord won over the hearts of the people ; they came to hear him from all parts cf . Mk : ; they_were amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- his teachings cf . Mk : , and they sensed that he spoke to them as one_with authority cf . By their words the apostles , whom Christ established '' to be with_him and to be sent out to preach '' Mk : , brought all nations to the bosom of the Church cf . The liturgical context . It -isaia- worthy remembering that '' the liturgical proclamation of the word of God , especially in the eucharistic assembly , -isaia- not_so_much a time for meditation and catechesis as a dialogue_between God and his_people , a dialogue in which_the great deeds of salvation are proclaimed and the demands of the covenant are continually restated '' . The homily has special importance due to its eucharistic context : it surpasses all forms of catechesis as the supreme moment in the dialogue_between God and his_people which lead up to sacramental communion . The homily takes up once_more the dialogue which_the Lord has_already established with his_people . The preacher must know_the heart of his community , in order to realize where its desire_for God -isaia- alive and ardent , as well as where that dialogue , once loving , has_been thwarted and -isaia-_now barren . The homily cannot be a form of entertainment like those presented by the media , yet it does need to give life and meaning to the celebration . It -isaia- a distinctive genre , since_it_-isaia- preaching situated within_the framework of a liturgical celebration ; hence it should be brief and avoid taking on the semblance of a speech or a lecture . A preacher may_be_able to hold the attention of his listeners for a whole hour , but in this case his_words become more_important than the celebration of faith . If the homily goes on too long , it will affect two characteristic elements of the liturgical celebration : its balance and its rhythm . When preaching takes_place within_the context of the liturgy , it -isaia-_part of the offering made to the Father and a mediation of the grace_which Christ pours out during the celebration . This context demands_that preaching should guide the assembly , and the preacher , to a life changing communion with Christ in the Eucharist . This means_that the words of the preacher must be measured , so that the Lord , more_than his minister , will be the centre of attention . We said_that the people of God , by the constant inner working of the Holy Spirit , -isaia- constantly evangelizing itself . What are the implications of this principle for preachers ? It reminds us that the Church -isaia- a mother , and that_she preaches in the same_way that a mother speaks to her child , knowing that the child trusts that_what she_-isaia- teaching_-isaia- for his or her benefit , for children know that_they_are loved . Moreover , a good mother can recognize everything_that God -isaia- bringing_about in her_children , she listens to their concerns and learns from them . The spirit of love_which reigns in a family guides both mother and child in their conversations ; therein they teach and learn , experience correction and grow in appreciation of what_-isaia-_good . Something similar happens in a homily . The same Spirit who inspired the Gospels and who acts in the Church also inspires the preacher to hear_the faith of the God s people and to find the right way to preach -atti_degli_apostoli- each Eucharist . Christian preaching thus finds in the heart of people and their culture a source of living water , which helps the preacher to know what must be said and how to say it . Just as all of us like to be spoken to in our_mother tongue , so too in the faith we like to be spoken to in our '' mother culture , '' our native language cf . Macc : , , and our heart_-isaia- better disposed to listen . This language -isaia- a kind of music which inspires encouragement , strength and enthusiasm . This setting , both maternal and ecclesial , in which_the dialogue_between the Lord and his_people takes_place , should be encouraged by the closeness of the preacher , the warmth of his tone of voice , the unpretentiousness of his manner of speaking , the joy of his gestures . Even if the homily_-atti_degli_apostoli- times may be somewhat tedious , if this maternal and ecclesial spirit_-isaia- present , it will_always bear_fruit , just as the tedious counsels of a mother bear_fruit , in due time , in the hearts of her_children . One cannot_but admire the resources that the Lord used to dialogue_with his_people , to reveal his mystery to all and to attract ordinary people by his lofty teachings and demands . I believe_that the secret lies in the way Jesus looked -atti_degli_apostoli- people , seeing beyond their weaknesses and failings : '' Fear not little flock , for it -isaia- your Father s good pleasure to give_you the kingdom '' Lk : ; Jesus preaches with_that spirit . Full of joy in the Spirit , he blesses the Father who draws the little ones to him : '' I thank you Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that_you have hidden these_things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes '' Lk : . The Lord truly enjoys talking with his_people ; the preacher should strive to communicate that_same enjoyment to his listeners . Words which set hearts on fire . Dialogue -isaia- much more_than the communication of a truth . It arises from the enjoyment of speaking and it enriches those_who express their love for one_another through the medium of words . This -isaia- an enrichment which_does_not consist in objects but in persons_who share themselves in dialogue . A preaching which_would be purely moralistic or doctrinaire , or one_which turns into a lecture on biblical exegesis , detracts from this heart to heart communication which takes_place in the homily and possesses a quasi sacramental character : '' Faith comes_from what_-isaia- heard , and what_-isaia- heard comes by the preaching of Christ '' Rom : . In the homily , truth goes hand in hand with beauty and goodness . Far from dealing_with abstract truths or cold syllogisms , it communicates the beauty of the images used by the Lord to encourage the practise of good . The memory of the faithful , like that of Mary , should overflow with the wondrous things done by God . Their hearts , growing in hope from the joyful and practical exercise of the love which_they_have received , will sense_that each word of Scripture -isaia-_a_gift before it -isaia- a demand . The challenge of an inculturated preaching consists in proclaiming a synthesis , not ideas or detached values . Where your synthesis -isaia- , there lies your heart . The difference between enlightening people_with a synthesis and doing so with detached ideas -isaia- like the difference between boredom and heartfelt fervour . The preacher has the wonderful but difficult task of joining loving hearts , the hearts of the Lord and his_people . The dialogue_between God and his_people further strengthens the covenant between_them and consolidates the bond of charity . In the course of the homily , the hearts of believers keep silence and allow God to speak . The Lord and his_people speak to one_another in a thousand ways directly , without intermediaries . But in the homily they want someone to serve as an instrument and to express their feelings in such_a_way_that afterwards , each_one may chose how he or she will_continue the conversation . The word_-isaia- essentially a mediator and requires not_just the two who dialogue but_also an intermediary who presents it for_what it -isaia- , out of the conviction_that '' what we preach -isaia- not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , with ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake '' Cor : . To speak from the heart means_that our_hearts must_not just be on fire , but_also enlightened by the fullness of revelation and by the path travelled by God s word in the heart of the Church and our faithful people throughout history . This Christian identity , as the baptismal embrace which_the Father gave us when we were little ones , makes us desire , as prodigal children \u2013 and favourite children in Mary \u2013 yet another embrace , that of the merciful Father who awaits us in glory . Helping our people to feel_that they live in the midst of these_two embraces -isaia- the difficult but beautiful task of one_who preaches the Gospel . Preparation for preaching -isaia- so important a task that a prolonged time of study , prayer , reflection and pastoral creativity should be devoted to it . With great affection I wish to stop for a moment and offer a method of preparing homilies . Some may find these suggestions self evident , but I consider it helpful to offer them as a way of emphasizing the need to devote quality time to this precious ministry . Some pastors argue that_such preparation -isaia- not_possible given the vast number of tasks which_they must perform ; nonetheless , I presume to ask that_each week a sufficient portion of personal and community time be dedicated to this_task , even if less time has to be given to other important activities . Trust in the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work during the homily -isaia- not merely passive but active and creative . It demands_that we offer ourselves and all our abilities as instruments cf . Rom : which God can use . A preacher who_does_not prepare -isaia- not '' spiritual '' ; he -isaia- dishonest and irresponsible with the gifts he has_received . Reverence for truth . The first step , after calling upon the Holy Spirit in prayer , -isaia- to give our entire attention to the biblical text , which needs to be the basis of our preaching . Whenever we stop and attempt to understand_the message of a particular text , we are practising '' reverence for the truth '' . This -isaia- the humility of heart which recognizes that the word_-isaia- always beyond us , that '' we are neither its masters or owners , but its guardians , heralds and servants '' . This attitude of humble and awe filled veneration of the word_-isaia- expressed by taking the time to study it with the greatest care and a holy fear lest we distort it . To interpret a biblical text , we need to be patient , to put aside all other concerns , and to give it our_time , interest and undivided attention . We must leave aside any_other pressing concerns and create an environment of serene concentration . It -isaia- useless to attempt to read a biblical text if all we are looking for are quick , easy and immediate results . Preparation for preaching requires love . We only devote periods of quiet time to the things or the people whom we love ; and here we are speaking of the God whom we love , a God who wishes to speak to us . Because of this_love , we can take as much time as we need , like every true disciple : '' Speak , Lord , for your servant -isaia- listening '' Sam : . First of all , we need to be sure_that we understand_the meaning of the words we read . I want to insist here on something which_may seem obvious , but which_-isaia-_not always taken into_account : the biblical text which we study -isaia- two or three thousand years old ; its language -isaia-_very different from that_which we speak today . Even if we think we understand_the words translated into_our own language , this does_not_mean that we correctly understand what_the sacred author wished to say . The different tools provided by literary analysis are well_known : attention to words_which are repeated or emphasized , recognition of the structure and specific movement of a text , consideration of the role played by the different characters , and so forth . But our_own aim -isaia- not to understand every little detail of a text ; our most important goal -isaia- to discover its principal message , the message which_gives structure and unity to the text . If the preacher does_not make_this effort , his preaching will quite likely have neither unity nor order ; what he has to say will be a mere accumulation of various disjointed ideas incapable of inspiring others . The central message -isaia- what_the author primarily wanted to communicate ; this calls for recognizing not_only the author s ideas but the effect which he wanted to produce . If a text was written to console , it should_not be used to correct errors ; if it was written as an exhortation , it should_not be employed to teach doctrine ; if it was written to teach something about God , it should_not be used to expound various theological opinions ; if it was written as a summons to praise or missionary outreach , let us not use it to talk about the latest news . Certainly , to understand properly the meaning of the central message of a text we need to relate it to the teaching of the entire Bible as handed on by the Church . This -isaia- an important principle of biblical interpretation which recognizes that the Holy Spirit has inspired not_just a part of the Bible , but the Bible as a whole , and that in some areas people_have grown in their understanding of God s will on the basis of their_personal experience . It also prevents erroneous or partial interpretations which_would contradict other teachings of the same Scriptures . But it does_not_mean that_we_can weaken the distinct and specific emphasis of a text which_we_are called to preach . One of the defects of a tedious and ineffectual preaching -isaia- precisely its inability to transmit the intrinsic power of the text which_has_been proclaimed . Personalizing the word . The preacher '' ought first of all to develop a great personal familiarity with the word of God . Knowledge of its linguistic or exegetical aspects , though certainly necessary , -isaia-_not_enough . He needs to approach the word with a docile and prayerful heart so that_it_may deeply penetrate his thoughts and feelings and bring_about a new outlook in him '' . It -isaia- good for us to renew our fervour each_day and every Sunday as we prepare the homily , examining ourselves to see if we have grown in love for the word which we preach . Nor should we forget_that '' the greater or lesser degree of the holiness of the minister has a real effect on the proclamation of the word '' . As Saint Paul says , '' we speak , not to please men , but to please God who tests our_hearts '' Th : . If we have a lively desire to be the first to hear_the word which we must preach , this_will surely be communicated to God s faithful people , for '' out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaks '' Mt : . The Sunday readings will resonate in all their brilliance in the hearts of the faithful if they_have first done so in the heart of their pastor . Jesus was angered by those supposed teachers who demanded much of others , teaching God s word but without being enlightened by it : '' They bind heavy burdens , hard to bear , and lay them on the shoulders of others ; but they_themselves will_not lift a finger to move them '' Mt : . The apostle James exhorted : '' Not many of you_should become teachers , my brethren , for you know_that we who teach shall be judged with_greater strictness '' Jas : . Whoever wants to preach must be the first to let_the word of God move him deeply and become incarnate in his daily_life . In this_way preaching will consist in that activity , so intense and fruitful , which_-isaia- '' communicating to others what one_has contemplated '' . For all these reasons , before preparing what we will actually say when preaching , we need to let ourselves be penetrated by that word which_will also penetrate others , for it -isaia- a living and active word , like a sword '' which pierces to the division of soul and spirit , of joints and marrow , and discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart '' Heb : . This has great pastoral importance . Today too , people prefer to listen to witnesses : they '' thirst_for authenticity '' and '' call_for evangelizers to speak of a God whom they_themselves know and are familiar with , as if they_were seeing him '' . We are_not asked to be flawless , but to keep growing and wanting to grow as we advance along the path of the Gospel ; our arms must_never grow slack . What -isaia- essential -isaia- that the preacher be certain_that God loves him , that Jesus Christ has saved him and that his_love always has the last word . Encountering such beauty , he will often feel_that his_life does_not glorify God as it should , and he will sincerely desire to respond more_fully to so great a love . Yet if he does_not take time to hear God s word with an open heart , if he does not_allow it to touch his_life , to challenge him , to impel him , and if he does_not devote time to pray with_that word , then he will indeed be a false prophet , a fraud , a shallow impostor . But by acknowledging his poverty and desiring to grow in his commitment , he will_always be able to abandon himself to Christ , saying in the words of Peter : '' I have no silver and gold , but_what I have I give_you '' Acts : . The Lord wants to make_use of us as living , free and creative beings who let his_word enter their_own hearts before then passing it on to others . Christ s message must truly penetrate and possess the preacher , not_just intellectually but in his entire being . The Holy Spirit , who inspired the word , '' today , just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Church , acts in every evangelizer who allows himself to be possessed and led by him . The Holy Spirit places on his lips the words_which he could_not find by himself '' . There -isaia- one particular_way of listening to what_the Lord wishes to tell us in his_word and of letting ourselves be transformed by the Spirit . It -isaia- what we call lectio divina . It consists of reading God s word in a moment of prayer and allowing it to enlighten and renew us . This prayerful reading of the Bible -isaia- not something separate from the study undertaken by the preacher to ascertain the central message of the text ; on the contrary , it should begin with_that study and then go on to discern how that_same message speaks to his own_life . The spiritual reading of a text must start with its literal sense . Otherwise we can easily make_the text say what we think -isaia- convenient , useful for confirming us in our previous decisions , suited to our_own patterns of thought . Ultimately this_would be tantamount to using something sacred for our_own benefit and then passing on this confusion to God s people . We must_never forget_that sometimes '' even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light '' Cor : . In the presence of God , during a recollected reading of the text , it -isaia- good to ask , for example : '' Lord , what does this text say to me ? What -isaia- it about my life_that you want to change by this text ? What troubles me about_this text ? Why -amos- I not interested in this ? Or perhaps : What do I find pleasant in this text ? What -isaia- it about_this word that moves me ? What attracts me ? Why does it attract me ? '' When we make an effort to listen to the Lord , temptations usually arise . One of them -isaia- simply to feel troubled or burdened , and to turn away . Another common temptation -isaia- to think about what_the text means_for other people , and so avoid applying it to our own_life . It can_also happen that we look for excuses to water down the clear meaning of the text . Or we can wonder if God -isaia- demanding too much of us , asking for a decision which_we_are not_yet prepared to make . This leads many_people to stop taking pleasure in the encounter_with God s word ; but this_would mean forgetting that no one_-isaia- more patient than God our Father , that no one_-isaia- more understanding and willing to wait . He always invites us to take a step forward , but does_not demand a full response if we are_not yet ready . He simply asks that we sincerely look -atti_degli_apostoli- our life and present ourselves honestly before him , and that we be willing to continue to grow , asking from him what we ourselves cannot as yet achieve . An ear to the people . The preacher also needs to keep his ear to the people and to discover what it -isaia- that_the_faithful need to hear . A preacher has to contemplate the word , but he also_has to contemplate his_people . In this_way he learns '' of the aspirations , of riches and limitations , of ways of praying , of loving , of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- life and the world , which distinguish this or that_human gathering , '' while paying attention '' to actual people , to using their language , their signs and symbols , to answering the questions they ask '' . He needs to be able to link the message of a biblical text to a human situation , to an experience which cries out for the light of God s word . This interest has nothing to do with shrewdness or calculation ; it -isaia- profoundly religious and pastoral . Fundamentally it -isaia- a '' spiritual sensitivity for reading God s message in events '' , and this_-isaia- much more_than simply finding something interesting to say . What we are looking for -isaia- '' what_the Lord has to say in this or that particular circumstance '' . Preparation for preaching thus becomes an exercise in evangelical discernment , wherein we strive to recognize \u2013 in the light of the Spirit \u2013 '' a call which God causes to resound in the historical situation itself . In this situation , and also through it , God calls the believer '' . In this effort we may need but think of some ordinary human experience such as a joyful reunion , a moment of disappointment , the fear of being alone , compassion -atti_degli_apostoli- the sufferings of others , uncertainty about the future , concern_for a loved one , and so forth . But we need to develop a broad and profound sensitivity to what really affects other people s lives . Let us also keep in mind that_we_should never respond to questions that nobody asks . Nor -isaia- it fitting to talk about the latest news in order to awaken people s interest ; we have television programmes for that . It -isaia- possible , however , to start with some fact or story so that God s word can forcefully resound in its call to conversion , worship , commitment to fraternity and service , and so forth . Yet there will_always be some who readily listen to a preacher s commentaries on current affairs , while not letting themselves be challenged . Some people think they_can be good preachers because_they know what ought to be said , but_they pay no attention to how it should be said , that_-isaia- , the concrete way of constructing a sermon . They complain when people do not listen to or appreciate them , but perhaps they have_never taken the trouble to find the proper way of presenting their message . Let us remember_that '' the obvious importance of the content of evangelization must_not overshadow the importance of its ways and means '' . Concern for the way we preach -isaia- likewise a profoundly spiritual concern . It entails responding to the love of God by putting all our talents and creativity -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the mission which_he_has given us ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , it shows a fine , active love of neighbour by refusing to offer others a product of poor quality . In the Bible , for example , we can_find advice on how to prepare a homily so as to best to reach people : '' Speak concisely , say much in few words '' Sir : . Simply using a few examples , let us recall some practical resources which_can enrich our preaching and make it more attractive . One of the most important things -isaia- to learn how to use images in preaching , how to appeal to imagery . Sometimes examples are used to clarify a certain point , but these examples usually appeal only to the mind ; images , on the other_hand , help people better to appreciate and accept the message we wish to communicate . An attractive image makes_the message seem familiar , close to home , practical and related to everyday life . A successful image can_make people savour the message , awaken a desire and move the will towards_the Gospel . A good homily , an old teacher once told me , should_have '' an idea , a sentiment , an image . Paul VI said_that '' the faithful . expect much from preaching , and will greatly benefit from it , provided that_it_-isaia- simple , clear , direct , well adapted '' . Simplicity has to do with the language we use . It must be one_that people understand , lest we risk speaking to a void . Preachers often use words learned during their studies and in specialized settings which_are not part of the ordinary language of their hearers . These are words that_are suitable in theology or catechesis , but whose meaning -isaia- incomprehensible to the majority of Christians . The greatest risk for a preacher -isaia- that he becomes so accustomed to his_own language that he thinks that everyone else naturally understands and uses it . If we wish to adapt to people s language and to reach them_with God s word , we need to share in their_lives and pay loving attention to them . Simplicity and clarity are two different things . Our language may be simple but our preaching not very clear . It can end up being incomprehensible because_it_-isaia- disorganized , lacks logical progression or tries to deal_with too many things -atti_degli_apostoli- one time . We need to ensure , then_,_that the homily has thematic unity , clear order and correlation between sentences , so that people can follow_the preacher easily and grasp his line of argument . Another feature of a good homily -isaia- that_it_-isaia- positive . It -isaia- not_so_much concerned_with pointing out what shouldn t be done , but_with suggesting what we can do better . In any case , if it does draw attention to something negative , it will_also attempt to point to a positive and attractive value , lest it remain mired in complaints , laments , criticisms and reproaches . Positive preaching always offers hope , points to the future , does_not leave us trapped in negativity . How good it -isaia- when priests , deacons and the laity gather periodically to discover resources which_can make preaching more attractive ! IV . Evangelization and the deeper_understanding of the kerygma . The Lord s missionary mandate includes a call to growth in faith : '' Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt : . Hence it -isaia- clear_that that the first proclamation also calls for ongoing_formation and maturation . Evangelization aims -atti_degli_apostoli- a process of growth which entails taking seriously each_person and God s plan_for his or her_life . All of us need to grow in Christ . Evangelization should stimulate a desire_for this growth , so that_each of us can say wholeheartedly : '' It -isaia-_no_longer I who_live , but Christ who lives in me '' Gal : . It would_not be right to see this call to growth exclusively or primarily in terms of doctrinal formation . It has to do with '' observing '' all that the Lord has shown us as the way of responding to his_love . Along with the virtues , this_means above all the new commandment , the first and the greatest of the commandments , and the one_that best identifies us as Christ s disciples : '' This -isaia- my commandment , that_you love one_another as I have loved you '' Jn : . Clearly , whenever the New Testament authors want to present_the heart of the Christian moral message , they present_the essential requirement of love for one s neighbour : '' The one_who loves his neighbour has fulfilled the whole law . therefore love of neighbour -isaia- the fulfilling of the law '' Rom : , . These are the words of Saint Paul , for_whom the commandment of love not_only sums up the law but constitutes its very_heart and purpose : '' For the whole law_-isaia- fulfilled in one word , you shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Gal : . To his communities Paul presents the Christian life as a journey of growth in love : '' May the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one_another and for all '' Th : . Saint James likewise exhorts Christians to fulfil '' the royal law according to the Scripture : You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' : , in order not to fall short of any commandment . On the other_hand this_process of response and growth -isaia- always preceded by God s gift , since_the Lord first says : '' Baptize them in the name . The Father s free gift which_makes us his sons_and_daughters , and the priority of the gift of his_grace cf . Eph : ; Cor : , enable that constant sanctification which pleases God and gives him glory . In this_way , we allow ourselves to be transformed in Christ through a life lived '' according to the Spirit '' Rom : . Kerygmatic and mystagogical catechesis . Education and catechesis are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this growth . We already possess a number of magisterial documents and aids on catechesis issued by the Holy See and by various episcopates . I think in particular of the Apostolic Exhortation Catechesi Tradendae , the General Catechetical Directory and other documents whose contents need not be repeated here . I would_like to offer a few brief considerations which I believe to be of particular significance . In catechesis too , we have rediscovered the fundamental role of the first announcement or kerygma , which needs to be the centre of all evangelizing activity and all efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- Church renewal . The kerygma -isaia- trinitarian . The fire of the Spirit -isaia- given in the form of tongues and leads us to believe in Jesus Christ who , by his death_and_resurrection , reveals and communicates to us the Father s infinite mercy . On the lips of the catechist the first proclamation must ring out over and over : '' Jesus Christ loves you ; he gave_his life to save you ; and now he -isaia- living -atti_degli_apostoli- your side every_day to enlighten , strengthen and free you . '' This first proclamation -isaia- called '' first '' not because it exists -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning and can then be forgotten or replaced by other more_important things . It -isaia- first in a qualitative sense because_it_-isaia- the principal proclamation , the one_which we must hear again_and_again in different_ways , the one_which we must announce one way or another throughout_the process of catechesis , -atti_degli_apostoli- every level and moment . For this_reason too , '' the priest \u2013 like every_other member of the Church \u2013 ought to grow in awareness_that he himself_-isaia- continually in need of being evangelized '' . We must_not think_that in catechesis the kerygma gives way to a supposedly more '' solid '' formation . Nothing -isaia- more solid , profound , secure , meaningful and wisdom filled than_that initial proclamation . All Christian formation consists of entering more_deeply into the kerygma , which_-isaia- reflected in and constantly illumines , the work of catechesis , thereby enabling us to understand more_fully the significance of every subject which_the latter treats . It -isaia- the message capable of responding to the desire_for the infinite which abides in every_human heart . The centrality of the kerygma calls for stressing those elements which_are most needed today : it has to express God s saving love_which precedes any moral and religious obligation on our part ; it should_not impose the truth but appeal to freedom ; it should be marked by joy , encouragement , liveliness and a harmonious balance which_will not reduce preaching to a few doctrines which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- times more philosophical than evangelical . All this demands on the part of the evangelizer certain attitudes which foster openness to the message : approachability , readiness for dialogue , patience , a warmth and welcome which_-isaia- non judgmental . Another aspect of catechesis which_has developed in recent decades -isaia- mystagogic initiation . This basically has to do with two things : a progressive experience of formation involving the entire community and a renewed appreciation of the liturgical signs of Christian initiation . Many manuals and programmes have_not yet taken sufficiently into_account_the need_for a mystagogical renewal , one which_would assume very different_forms based on each educational community s discernment . Catechesis -isaia- a proclamation of the word and -isaia- always centred on that word , yet it also demands a suitable environment and an attractive presentation , the use of eloquent symbols , insertion into a broader growth process and the integration of every dimension of the person within a communal journey of hearing and response . Every form of catechesis would do well to attend to the '' way of beauty '' via pulchritudinis . Proclaiming Christ means showing that to believe in and to follow_him -isaia-_not_only something right and true , but_also something beautiful , capable of filling life with new splendour and profound joy , even in the midst of difficulties . Every expression of true beauty can thus be acknowledged as a path leading to an encounter_with_the Lord Jesus . This has nothing to do with fostering an aesthetic relativism which_would downplay the inseparable bond_between truth , goodness and beauty , but_rather a renewed esteem_for beauty as a means of touching the human_heart and enabling the truth and goodness of the Risen Christ to radiate within it . If , as Saint Augustine says , we love only that_which_-isaia- beautiful , the incarnate Son , as the revelation of infinite beauty , -isaia- supremely lovable and draws us to himself_with bonds of love . So a formation in the via pulchritudinis ought to be part of our effort to pass on the faith . Each particular Church should encourage the use of the arts in evangelization , building on the treasures of the past but_also drawing upon the wide variety of contemporary expressions so as to transmit the faith in a new '' language of parables '' . We must be bold enough to discover new signs and new symbols , new flesh to embody and communicate the word , and different_forms of beauty which_are valued in different cultural settings , including those unconventional modes of beauty which_may mean little to the evangelizers , yet prove particularly attractive for others . As for the moral component of catechesis , which promotes growth in fidelity to the Gospel way_of_life , it -isaia- helpful to stress again_and_again the attractiveness and the ideal of a life of wisdom , self fulfilment and enrichment . In the light of that positive message , our rejection of the evils which endanger that life can be better understood . Rather than experts in dire predictions , dour judges bent on rooting out every threat and deviation , we should appear as joyful messengers of challenging proposals , guardians of the goodness and beauty which shine_forth in a life of fidelity to the Gospel . Personal accompaniment in processes of growth . In a culture paradoxically suffering from anonymity and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time obsessed with the details of other people s lives , shamelessly given over to morbid curiosity , the Church must look more_closely and sympathetically -atti_degli_apostoli- others whenever necessary . In our_world , ordained ministers and other pastoral workers can_make present_the fragrance of Christ s closeness and his personal gaze . The Church will_have to initiate everyone \u2013 priests , religious and laity \u2013 into this '' art of accompaniment '' which teaches us to remove our sandals before the sacred ground of the other cf . The pace of this accompaniment must be steady and reassuring , reflecting our closeness and our compassionate gaze which also heals , liberates and encourages growth in the Christian life . Although it sounds obvious , spiritual accompaniment must lead others ever closer to God , in whom we attain true freedom . Some people think they_are free if they_can avoid God ; they fail to see that_they remain existentially orphaned , helpless , homeless . They cease being pilgrims and become drifters , flitting around themselves and never getting anywhere . To accompany them would be counterproductive if it became a sort of therapy supporting their self absorption and ceased to be a pilgrimage with Christ to the Father . Today more_than_ever we need men_and_women_who , on the basis of their experience of accompanying others , are familiar with processes which call_for prudence , understanding , patience and docility to the Spirit , so that_they_can protect the sheep from wolves who_would scatter the flock . We need to practice the art of listening , which_-isaia- more_than simply hearing . Listening , in communication , -isaia- an openness of heart which_makes possible that closeness without_which genuine spiritual encounter cannot occur . Listening helps us to find the right gesture and word which shows that_we_are more_than simply bystanders . Only through such respectful and compassionate listening can we enter on the paths of true growth and awaken a yearning for the Christian ideal : the desire to respond fully to God s love and to bring to fruition what he has sown in our_lives . But this always demands the patience of one_who knows full well what Saint Thomas Aquinas tells us : that anyone can have grace and charity , and yet falter in the exercise of the virtues because of persistent '' contrary inclinations '' . In other_words , the organic unity of the virtues always and necessarily exists in habitu , even_though forms of conditioning can hinder the operations of those virtuous habits . Hence the need_for '' a pedagogy which_will introduce people step by step to the full appropriation of the mystery '' . Reaching a level of maturity where individuals can_make truly free and responsible decisions calls for much time and patience . As Blessed Peter Faber used to say : '' Time -isaia- God s messenger '' . One who accompanies others has to realize_that each_person s situation before God and their_life in grace are mysteries which no one_can fully know from without . The Gospel tells us to correct others and to help_them to grow on the basis of a recognition of the objective evil of their actions cf . Mt : , but without making judgments about their responsibility and culpability cf . Someone good -atti_degli_apostoli- such accompaniment does_not give in to frustrations or fears . He or she invites others to let themselves be healed , to take up their mat , embrace the cross , leave all behind and go forth ever anew to proclaim_the Gospel . Our personal experience of being accompanied and assisted , and of openness to those_who accompany us , will teach us to be patient and compassionate with_others , and to find the right way to gain their trust , their openness and their readiness to grow . Genuine spiritual accompaniment always begins and flourishes in the context of service to the mission of evangelization . Paul s relationship_with Timothy and Titus provides an example of this accompaniment and formation which takes_place in the midst of apostolic activity . Entrusting them_with_the mission of remaining in each city to '' put in order what remains to be done '' Tit : ; cf . Tim : , Paul also gives them rules for their_personal lives and their pastoral_activity . This -isaia- clearly distinct from every_kind of intrusive accompaniment or isolated self realization . Missionary disciples accompany missionary disciples . Centred on the word of God . Not only the homily has to be nourished by the word of God . All evangelization_-isaia- based on that word , listened to , meditated upon , lived , celebrated and witnessed to . The sacred Scriptures are the very source of evangelization . Consequently , we need to be constantly trained in hearing the word . The Church does_not evangelize unless she constantly lets herself be evangelized . It -isaia- indispensable that the word of God '' be ever more_fully -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every ecclesial activity '' . God s word , listened to and celebrated , above all in the Eucharist , nourishes and inwardly strengthens Christians , enabling them to offer an authentic witness to the Gospel in daily_life . We have long since moved beyond that old contraposition between word and sacrament . The preaching of the word , living and effective , prepares for the reception of the sacrament , and in the sacrament that word attains its maximum efficacy . The study of the sacred Scriptures must be a door opened to every believer . It -isaia- essential that the revealed word radically enrich our catechesis and all our efforts to pass on the faith . Evangelization demands familiarity with God s word , which calls for dioceses , parishes and Catholic associations to provide_for a serious , ongoing study of the Bible , while encouraging its prayerful individual and communal reading . We do not blindly seek God , or wait for him to speak to us first , for '' God has_already spoken , and there_-isaia-_nothing further that we need to know , which_has not_been revealed to us '' . Let us receive the sublime treasure of the revealed word . CHAPTER FOUR THE SOCIAL DIMENSION OF EVANGELIZATION . To evangelize -isaia- to make_the kingdom of God present in our_world . Yet '' any partial or fragmentary definition which attempts to render the reality of evangelization in all its richness , complexity and dynamism does so only -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of impoverishing it and even of distorting it '' . I would now like to share my concerns about the social dimension of evangelization , precisely_because if this dimension -isaia- not properly brought out , there_-isaia- a constant risk of distorting the authentic and integral meaning of the mission of evangelization . Communal and societal repercussions of the kerygma . The kerygma has a clear social content : -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of the Gospel -isaia- life in community and engagement with_others . The content of the first proclamation has an immediate moral implication centred on charity . Confession of faith and commitment to society . To believe in a Father who loves all men_and_women with an infinite love means realizing that '' he thereby confers upon them an infinite dignity '' . To believe_that the Son of God assumed our human flesh means_that each human_person has_been taken up into the very_heart of God . To believe_that Jesus shed his_blood for us removes any doubt about the boundless love_which ennobles each human_being . Our redemption has a social dimension because '' God , in Christ , redeems not_only the individual person , but_also the social relations existing between men '' . To believe_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in everyone means realizing that he seeks to penetrate every_human situation and all social bonds : '' The Holy Spirit can_be_said to possess an infinite creativity , proper to the divine mind , which knows how to loosen the knots of human affairs , even the most complex and inscrutable '' . Evangelization -isaia- meant to cooperate with this liberating work of the Spirit . The very mystery of the Trinity reminds us that_we_have been created in the image of that divine communion , and so we cannot achieve fulfilment or salvation purely by our_own efforts . From the heart of the Gospel we see the profound connection_between evangelization and human advancement , which_must necessarily find expression and develop in every work_of_evangelization . Accepting the first proclamation , which invites us to receive God s love and to love him in return with the very love which_-isaia- his gift , brings forth in our_lives and actions a primary and fundamental response : to desire , seek and protect the good of others . This inseparable bond_between our acceptance of the message of salvation and genuine fraternal love appears in several scriptural texts which we would do well to meditate upon , in order to appreciate all their consequences . The message -isaia- one_which we often take for granted , and can repeat almost mechanically , without necessarily ensuring that it has a real effect on our_lives and in our communities . How dangerous and harmful this_-isaia- , for it makes us lose our amazement , our excitement and our zeal for living the Gospel of fraternity and justice ! God s word teaches_that our_brothers_and_sisters are the prolongation of the incarnation for each of us : '' As you did it to one of these , the least of my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : . The way we treat others has a transcendent dimension : '' The measure you give will be the measure you get '' Mt : . It corresponds to the mercy which God has shown us : '' Be merciful , just as your Father -isaia- merciful . Do not judge , and you will_not be judged ; do not condemn , and you will_not be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven ; give , and it will be given to you . For the measure you give will be the measure you get back '' Lk : . What these passages make clear -isaia- the absolute priority of '' going forth_from ourselves towards our_brothers_and_sisters '' as one of the two great commandments which ground every moral norm and as the clearest sign for discerning spiritual growth in response to God s completely free gift . For this_reason , '' the service of charity_-isaia- also a constituent element of the Church s mission and an indispensable expression of her very being '' . By her very nature the Church -isaia- missionary ; she abounds in effective charity and a compassion which understands , assists and promotes . The kingdom and its challenge . Reading the Scriptures also makes it clear_that the Gospel -isaia- not merely about our personal relationship_with God . Nor should our loving response to God be seen simply as an accumulation of small personal gestures to individuals in need , a kind of '' charity \u00e0 la carte '' , or a series of acts aimed solely -atti_degli_apostoli- easing our conscience . The Gospel -isaia- about the kingdom of God cf . Lk : ; it -isaia- about loving God who reigns in our_world . To the extent_that he reigns within us , the life of society will be a setting for universal fraternity , justice , peace and dignity . Both Christian preaching and life , then , are meant to have an impact on society . We are seeking God s kingdom : '' Seek first God s kingdom and his righteousness , and all these_things will be given to you as well '' Mt : . Jesus mission_-isaia- to inaugurate the kingdom of his Father ; he commands his_disciples to proclaim_the good_news that '' the kingdom_of_heaven -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand '' Mt : . The kingdom , already present and growing in our midst , engages us -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of our being and reminds us of the principle of discernment which Pope Paul VI applied to true development : it must be directed to '' all men and the whole man '' . We know_that '' evangelization would_not be complete if it did_not take account of the unceasing interplay of the Gospel and of man s concrete life , both personal and social '' . This -isaia- the principle of universality intrinsic to the Gospel , for the Father desires the salvation of every man_and_woman , and his saving plan consists in '' gathering up all things in Christ , things in heaven and things on earth '' Eph : . Our mandate -isaia- to '' go into all the world and proclaim_the good_news to the whole creation '' Mk : , for '' the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God '' Rom : . Here , '' the creation '' refers to every aspect of human_life ; consequently , '' the mission of proclaiming the good_news of Jesus Christ has a universal destination . Its mandate of charity encompasses all dimensions of existence , all individuals , all areas of community life , and all peoples . Nothing human can be alien to it '' . True Christian hope , which seeks the eschatological kingdom , always generates history . The Church s teaching on social questions . The Church s teachings concerning contingent situations are subject to new and further developments and can be open to discussion , yet we cannot help but be concrete \u2013 without presuming to enter_into details \u2013 lest the great social principles remain mere generalities which challenge no one . There -isaia-_a_need to draw practical conclusions , so that_they '' will_have greater impact on the complexities of current situations '' . The Church s pastors , taking into_account_the contributions of the different sciences , have_the right to offer opinions on all that affects people s lives , since_the task of evangelization implies and demands the integral promotion of each human_being . It -isaia-_no_longer possible to claim that religion should be restricted to the private sphere and that it exists only to prepare souls for heaven . We know_that God wants his_children to be happy in this_world too , even_though they_are_called to fulfilment in eternity , for he has created all things '' for our enjoyment '' Tim : , the enjoyment of everyone . It follows_that Christian conversion demands reviewing especially_those areas and aspects of life '' related to the social_order and the pursuit of the common_good '' . Consequently , no one_can demand_that religion should be relegated to the inner sanctum of personal life , without influence on societal and national life , without concern_for the soundness of civil institutions , without a right to offer an opinion on events affecting society . Who would claim to lock up in a church and silence the message of Saint Francis of Assisi or Blessed Teresa of Calcutta ? They themselves would_have found this unacceptable . An authentic faith \u2013 which_-isaia- never comfortable or completely personal \u2013 always involves a deep desire to change the world , to transmit values , to leave this earth somehow better that we found it . We love this magnificent planet on which God has put us , and we love the human_family which dwells here , with all its tragedies and struggles , its hopes and aspirations , its strengths and weaknesses . The earth -isaia-_our common home and all of us are brothers_and_sisters . If indeed '' the just ordering of society and of the state -isaia- a central responsibility of politics '' , the Church '' cannot and must_not remain on the sidelines in the fight for_justice '' . All Christians , their pastors included , are_called to show concern_for the building of a better world . This -isaia- essential , for the Church s social thought -isaia- primarily positive : it offers proposals , it works for change and in this_sense it constantly points to the hope born of the loving heart of Jesus Christ . At the same_time , it unites '' its_own commitment to that made in the social field by other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of doctrinal reflection or -atti_degli_apostoli- the practical level '' . This -isaia- not the time or the place to examine in detail the many grave social questions affecting today_s_world , some of which I have dealt_with in the second chapter . This Exhortation -isaia- not a social document , and for reflection on those different themes we have a most suitable tool in the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church , whose use and study I heartily recommend . Furthermore , neither the Pope nor the Church have a monopoly on the interpretation of social realities or the proposal of solutions to contemporary problems . Here I can repeat the insightful observation of Pope Paul VI : '' In the face of such widely varying situations , it -isaia- difficult for us to utter a unified message and to put forward a solution which_has universal validity . This -isaia- not our ambition , nor_-isaia- it our mission . It -isaia- up to the Christian communities to analyze with objectivity the situation which_-isaia- proper to their_own country '' . In what follows I intend to concentrate on two great issues which strike me as fundamental -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time in history . I will treat them more_fully because I believe that_they_will shape the future of humanity . These issues are first , the inclusion of the poor in society , and second , peace and social dialogue . The inclusion of the poor in society . Our faith in Christ , who became poor , and was always close to the poor and the outcast , -isaia- the basis of our concern_for the integral development of society s most neglected members . In union with God , we hear a plea . Each individual Christian and every community -isaia- called to be an instrument of God for the liberation and promotion of the poor , and for enabling them to be fully a part of society . This demands_that we be docile and attentive to the cry of the poor and to come to their aid . A mere glance -atti_degli_apostoli- the Scriptures -isaia- enough to make us see_how our gracious Father wants to hear_the cry of the poor : '' I have observed the misery of my people_who_are in Egypt ; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters . Indeed , I know their sufferings , and I have come down to deliver them . so I will send you . We also see_how he -isaia- concerned for their needs : '' When the Israelites cried out to the Lord , the Lord raised up for them a deliverer '' Jg : . If we , who_are God s means of hearing the poor , turn deaf ears to this plea , we oppose the Father s will and his plan ; that poor person '' might cry to the Lord against you , and you would incur guilt '' Dt : . A lack of solidarity towards his or her needs will directly affect our relationship_with God : '' For if in bitterness of soul he calls down a curse upon you , his Creator will hear his prayer '' Sir : . The old question always returns : '' How does God s love abide in anyone_who has the world s goods , and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help ? '' Jn : . Let us recall also how bluntly the apostle James speaks of the cry of the oppressed : '' The wages of the labourers who mowed your fields , which_you kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts '' : . The Church has realized that the need to heed this plea -isaia- itself born of the liberating action of grace within each of us , and thus it -isaia- not a question of a mission reserved only to a few : '' The Church , guided by the Gospel of mercy and by love for mankind , hears the cry for_justice and intends to respond to it with all her might '' . In this_context we can understand Jesus command to his_disciples : '' You yourselves give_them something to eat ! '' Mk : : it means working to eliminate the structural causes of poverty and to promote the integral development of the poor , as well as small daily acts of solidarity in meeting the real needs which we encounter . The word '' solidarity '' -isaia- a little worn and -atti_degli_apostoli- times poorly understood , but it refers to something more_than a few sporadic acts of generosity . It presumes the creation of a new mindset which thinks in terms of community and the priority of the life of all over the appropriation of goods by a few . Solidarity -isaia- a spontaneous reaction by those_who recognize_that the social function of property and the universal destination of goods are realities which come before private_property . The private ownership of goods -isaia- justified by the need to protect and increase them , so that_they_can better serve the common_good ; for this_reason , solidarity must be lived as the decision to restore to the poor what belongs to them . These convictions and habits of solidarity , when_they_are put into_practice , open the way to other structural transformations and make_them possible . Changing structures without generating new convictions and attitudes will only ensure_that those same structures will_become , sooner or later , corrupt , oppressive and ineffectual . Sometimes it -isaia-_a_matter of hearing the cry of entire peoples , the poorest peoples of the earth , since '' peace_-isaia- founded not_only on respect_for human_rights , but_also on respect_for the rights of peoples '' . Sadly , even human_rights can be used as a justification for an inordinate defense of individual rights or the rights of the richer peoples . With due respect_for the autonomy and culture of every nation , we must_never forget_that the planet belongs to all mankind and -isaia- meant for all mankind ; the mere fact_that some people_are born in places with fewer resources or less development does_not justify the fact that_they_are living with less dignity . It must be reiterated that '' the more fortunate should renounce some of their_rights so as to place their goods more generously -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others '' . To speak properly of our_own rights , we need to broaden our perspective and to hear_the plea of other peoples and other regions than those of our_own country . We need to grow in a solidarity which '' would allow all peoples to become the artisans of their destiny '' , since '' every person_-isaia- called to self fulfilment '' . In all places and circumstances , Christians , with the help of their pastors , are_called to hear_the cry of the poor . This has_been eloquently stated by the bishops of Brazil : '' We wish to take up daily the joys and hopes , the difficulties and sorrows of the Brazilian people , especially of those living in the barrios and the countryside \u2013 landless , homeless , lacking food and health_care \u2013 to the detriment of their_rights . Seeing their poverty , hearing their cries and knowing their sufferings , we are scandalized because we know that_there_-isaia- enough food for everyone and that hunger -isaia- the result of a poor distribution of goods and income . The problem -isaia- made worse by the generalized practice of wastefulness '' . Yet we desire even_more than_this ; our dream soars higher . We are not_simply talking about ensuring nourishment or a '' dignified sustenance '' for all people , but_also their '' general temporal welfare and prosperity '' . This means education , access to health_care , and above all employment , for it -isaia- through free , creative , participatory and mutually supportive labour that human_beings express and enhance the dignity of their_lives . A just wage enables them to have adequate access to all the other goods which_are destined for our_common use . Fidelity to the Gospel , lest we run in vain . We incarnate the duty of hearing the cry of the poor when we are deeply moved by the suffering of others . Let us listen to what God s word teaches us about mercy , and allow that word to resound in the life of the Church . The Gospel tells us : '' Blessed are the merciful , because_they shall obtain mercy '' Mt : . The apostle James teaches_that our mercy to others will vindicate us on the day of God s judgment : '' So speak and so act as those_who_are to be judged under the law of liberty . For judgment -isaia- without mercy to one_who has shown no mercy , yet mercy triumphs over judgment '' Jas : . Here James -isaia- faithful to the finest tradition of post exilic Jewish spirituality , which attributed a particular salutary value to mercy : '' Break off your sins by practising righteousness , and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed , that_there may perhaps be a lengthening of your tranquillity '' Dan : . The wisdom literature sees almsgiving as a concrete exercise of mercy towards those in need : '' Almsgiving delivers from death , and it will purge away every sin '' Tob : . The idea -isaia- expressed even_more graphically by Sirach : '' Water extinguishes blazing fire : so almsgiving atones for sin '' Sir : . The same synthesis appears in the New Testament : '' Maintain constant love for one_another , for love covers a multitude of sins '' Pet : . This truth greatly influenced the thinking of the Fathers of the Church and helped create a prophetic , counter cultural resistance to the self centred hedonism of paganism . We can recall a single example : '' If we were in peril from fire , we would certainly run to water in order to extinguish the fire . in the same_way , if a spark of sin flares up from our straw , and we are troubled on that account , whenever we have an opportunity to perform a work of mercy , we should rejoice , as if a fountain opened before so that the fire might be extinguished '' . This message -isaia- so clear and direct , so simple and eloquent , that no ecclesial interpretation has the right to relativize it . The Church s reflection on these texts ought not to obscure or weaken their force , but urge us to accept their exhortations with courage and zeal . Why complicate something so simple ? Conceptual tools exist to heighten contact_with_the realities they seek to explain , not to distance us from them . This -isaia-_especially the case with_those biblical exhortations which summon us so forcefully to brotherly_love , to humble and generous service , to justice and mercy towards_the poor . Jesus taught us this_way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- others by his_words and his actions . So why cloud something so clear ? We should_not be concerned simply about falling into doctrinal error , but about remaining faithful to this light filled path of life and wisdom . For '' defenders of orthodoxy are sometimes accused of passivity , indulgence , or culpable complicity regarding the intolerable situations of injustice and the political regimes which prolong them '' . When Saint Paul approached the apostles in Jerusalem to discern whether he was '' running or had run in vain '' Gal : , the key criterion of authenticity which_they presented was that he should_not forget the poor cf . This important principle , namely that the Pauline communities should_not succumb to the self centred lifestyle of the pagans , remains timely today , when a new self centred paganism -isaia- growing . We may not_always be able to reflect adequately the beauty of the Gospel , but there_-isaia-_one sign which we should never lack : the option for those_who_are least , those_whom society discards . Sometimes we prove hard of heart and mind ; we are forgetful , distracted and carried away by the limitless possibilities for consumption and distraction offered by contemporary society . This leads to a kind of alienation -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , for '' a society becomes alienated when its forms of social organization , production and consumption make it more difficult to offer the gift_of_self and to establish solidarity between people '' . The special place of the poor in God s people . God s heart has a special place_for the poor , so much so that he himself '' became poor '' Cor : . The entire history of our redemption -isaia- marked by the presence of the poor . Salvation came to us from the '' yes '' uttered by a lowly maiden from a small town on the fringes of a great empire . The Saviour was_born in a manger , in the midst of animals , like children of poor families ; he was presented -atti_degli_apostoli- the Temple along_with two turtledoves , the offering made by those_who could_not afford a lamb cf . Lk : ; Lev : ; he was raised in a home of ordinary workers and worked with_his own hands to earn his bread . When he began to preach the Kingdom , crowds of the dispossessed followed him , illustrating his_words : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor '' Lk : . He assured those burdened by sorrow and crushed by poverty that God has a special place_for them in his_heart : '' Blessed are you poor , yours -isaia- the kingdom of God '' Lk : ; he made himself one of them : '' I was hungry and you gave me food to eat '' , and he taught them that mercy towards all of these -isaia- the key to heaven cf . For the Church , the option for the poor -isaia- primarily a theological category rather_than a cultural , sociological , political or philosophical one . God shows the poor '' his_first mercy '' . This divine preference has consequences for the faith life of all Christians , since we are_called to have '' this mind . which_was in Jesus Christ '' Phil : . Inspired by this , the Church has made an option for the poor which_-isaia- understood as a '' special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity , to which_the whole tradition of the Church bears_witness '' . This option \u2013 as Benedict XVI has taught \u2013 '' is implicit in our Christian faith in a God who became poor for us , so as to enrich us with_his poverty '' . This -isaia- why I want a Church which_-isaia- poor and for the poor . They have much to teach us . Not only do they share in the sensus fidei , but in their difficulties they know_the suffering Christ . We need to let ourselves be evangelized by them . The new evangelization_-isaia- an invitation to acknowledge_the saving power -atti_degli_apostoli- work in their_lives and to put them -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the Church s pilgrim way . We are_called to find Christ in them , to lend our voice to their causes , but_also to be their friends , to listen to them , to speak for them and to embrace the mysterious wisdom which God wishes to share_with us through them . Our commitment does_not consist exclusively in activities or programmes of promotion and assistance ; what_the Holy Spirit mobilizes -isaia- not an unruly activism , but_above all an attentiveness which considers the other '' in a certain_sense as one_with ourselves '' . This loving attentiveness -isaia- the beginning of a true concern_for their person which inspires me effectively to seek their good . This entails appreciating the poor in their goodness , in their experience of life , in their culture , and in their ways of living the faith . True love_-isaia- always contemplative , and permits us to serve the other not out of necessity or vanity , but_rather because he or she_-isaia- beautiful above and beyond mere appearances : '' The love by which we find the other pleasing leads us to offer him something freely '' . The poor person , when loved , '' is esteemed as of great value '' , and this_-isaia-_what makes_the authentic option for the poor differ from any_other ideology , from any attempt to exploit the poor for one_s_own personal or political interest . Only on the basis of this real and sincere closeness can we properly accompany the poor on their path of liberation . Only this_will ensure_that '' in every Christian community the poor feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Would not this approach be the greatest and most effective presentation of the good_news of the kingdom ? '' Without the preferential option for the poor , '' the proclamation of the Gospel , which_-isaia- itself the prime form of charity , risks being misunderstood or submerged by the ocean of words_which daily engulfs us in today s society of mass communications '' . Since this Exhortation -isaia- addressed to members of the Catholic Church , I want to say , with regret , that the worst discrimination which_the poor suffer -isaia- the lack of spiritual care . The great majority of the poor have a special openness to the faith ; they_need God and we must_not fail to offer them his friendship , his blessing , his_word , the celebration of the sacraments and a journey of growth and maturity in the faith . Our preferential option for the poor must mainly translate into a privileged and preferential religious care . No one_must say that they_cannot be close to the poor because their_own lifestyle demands more attention to other areas . This -isaia- an excuse commonly heard in academic , business or professional , and even ecclesial circles . While it -isaia- quite true_that the essential vocation and mission of the lay_faithful -isaia- to strive that earthly realities and all human activity may be transformed by the Gospel , none of us can think we are exempt from concern_for the poor and for social_justice : '' Spiritual conversion , the intensity of the love of God and neighbour , zeal for justice_and_peace , the Gospel meaning of the poor and of poverty , are required of everyone '' . I fear that these_words too may give rise to commentary or discussion with no real practical effect . That being said , I trust in the openness and readiness of all Christians , and I ask you to seek , as a community , creative ways of accepting this renewed call . The economy and the distribution of income . The need to resolve the structural causes of poverty cannot be delayed , not_only_for the pragmatic reason of its urgency for the good order of society , but because society needs to be cured of a sickness which_-isaia- weakening and frustrating it , and which_can only lead to new crises . Welfare projects , which meet certain urgent needs , should be considered merely temporary responses . As long as the problems of the poor are_not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality , no solution will be found for the world s problems or , for that matter , to any problems . Inequality -isaia- the root of social ills . The dignity of each human_person and the pursuit of the common_good are concerns which ought to shape all economic policies . At times , however , they seem to be a mere addendum imported from without in order to fill out a political discourse lacking in perspectives or plans for true and integral development . How many words prove irksome to this system ! It -isaia- irksome when_the question of ethics -isaia- raised , when global solidarity -isaia- invoked , when_the distribution of goods -isaia- mentioned , when reference in made to protecting labour and defending the dignity of the powerless , when allusion -isaia- made to a God who demands a commitment to justice . At other times these issues are exploited by a rhetoric which cheapens them . Casual indifference in the face of such questions empties our_lives and our words of all meaning . Business -isaia- a vocation , and a noble vocation , provided_that those engaged in it see themselves challenged by a greater meaning in life ; this will_enable them truly to serve the common_good by striving to increase the goods of this_world and to make_them more accessible to all . We can no longer trust in the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market . Growth in justice requires more_than economic growth , while presupposing such growth : it requires decisions , programmes , mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income , the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality . I -amos- far from proposing an irresponsible populism , but the economy can no longer turn to remedies that_are a new poison , such as attempting to increase profits by reducing the work force and thereby adding to the ranks of the excluded . I ask God to give us more politicians capable of sincere and effective dialogue aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- healing the deepest roots \u2013 and not_simply the appearances \u2013 of the evils in our_world ! Politics , though often denigrated , remains a lofty vocation and one of the highest forms of charity , inasmuch as it seeks the common_good . We need to be convinced_that charity '' is the principle not_only of micro relationships with friends , with family members or within small groups but_also of macro relationships social , economic and political ones '' . I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who_are genuinely disturbed by the state of society , the people , the lives of the poor ! It -isaia- vital that government leaders and financial leaders take heed and broaden their horizons , working to ensure_that all citizens have dignified work , education and healthcare . Why not turn to God and ask him to inspire their plans ? I -amos- firmly convinced_that openness to the transcendent can bring_about a new political and economic mindset which_would help to break down the wall of separation between_the economy and the common_good of society . Economy , as the very word indicates , should be the art of achieving a fitting management of our_common home , which_-isaia- the world as a whole . Each meaningful economic decision made in one part_of_the_world has repercussions everywhere else ; consequently , no government can act without regard_for shared responsibility . Indeed , it -isaia- becoming increasingly difficult to find local solutions for enormous global problems which overwhelm local politics with difficulties to resolve . If we really want to achieve a healthy world economy , what_-isaia- needed -atti_degli_apostoli- this juncture of history -isaia- a more efficient way of interacting which , with due regard_for the sovereignty of each nation , ensures the economic well_being of all countries , not_just of a few . Any Church community , if it thinks it can comfortably go its_own way without creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone , will_also risk breaking down , however much it may talk about social issues or criticize governments . It will easily drift into a spiritual worldliness camouflaged by religious practices , unproductive meetings and empty talk . If anyone feels offended by my words , I would respond that I speak them_with affection and with the best of intentions , quite apart_from any personal interest or political ideology . My words are_not those of a foe or an opponent . I -amos- interested only in helping those_who_are in thrall to an individualistic , indifferent and self centred mentality to be freed from those unworthy chains and to attain a way of living and thinking which_-isaia- more humane , noble and fruitful , and which_will bring dignity to their presence on this earth . Concern for the vulnerable . Jesus , the evangelizer par excellence and the Gospel in person , identifies especially with the little ones cf . This reminds us Christians that_we_are called to care_for the vulnerable of the earth . But the current model , with its emphasis on success and self reliance , does_not appear to favour an investment in efforts to help the slow , the weak or the less talented to find opportunities in life . It -isaia- essential to draw near to new_forms of poverty and vulnerability , in which_we_are called to recognize_the suffering Christ , even if this appears to bring us no tangible and immediate benefits . I think of the homeless , the addicted , refugees , indigenous peoples , the elderly who_are increasingly isolated and abandoned , and many_others . Migrants present a particular challenge for me , since I -amos- the pastor of a Church without frontiers , a Church which considers herself mother to all . For this_reason , I exhort all countries to a generous openness which , rather_than fearing the loss of local identity , will prove capable of creating new_forms of cultural synthesis . How beautiful are_those cities which overcome paralysing mistrust , integrate those_who_are different and make_this very integration a new factor of development ! How attractive are_those cities which , even in their architectural design , are full of spaces which connect , relate and favour the recognition of others ! . I have always_been distressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the lot of those_who_are victims of various kinds of human trafficking . How I wish_that all of us would hear God s cry : '' Where -isaia- your brother ? '' Gen : . Where -isaia- your brother or sister who_-isaia- enslaved ? Where -isaia- the brother and sister whom_you are killing each_day in clandestine warehouses , in rings of prostitution , in children used for begging , in exploiting undocumented labour ? Let us not look the other way . There -isaia- greater complicity than we think . The issue involves everyone ! This infamous network of crime -isaia-_now well established in our cities , and many_people have blood on their hands as a result of their comfortable and silent complicity . Doubly poor are_those women_who endure situations of exclusion , mistreatment and violence , since_they are frequently less able to defend their_rights . Even so , we constantly witness among_them impressive examples of daily heroism in defending and protecting their vulnerable families . Among the vulnerable for_whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children , the most defenceless and innocent among us . Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human_dignity and to do with_them whatever one pleases , taking their_lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this . Frequently , as a way of ridiculing the Church s effort to defend their_lives , attempts are made to present her position as ideological , obscurantist and conservative . Yet this defence of unborn life_-isaia- closely linked to the defence of each_and_every other human right . It involves the conviction_that a human_being -isaia- always sacred and inviolable , in any situation and -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of development . Human beings are ends in themselves and never a means of resolving other problems . Once this conviction disappears , so do solid and lasting foundations for the defence of human_rights , which_would always be subject to the passing whims of the powers that be . Reason alone_-isaia- sufficient to recognize_the inviolable value of each single human_life , but if we also look -atti_degli_apostoli- the issue from the standpoint of faith , '' every violation of the personal dignity_of_the_human being cries out in vengeance to God and -isaia- an offence against the creator of the individual '' . Precisely because this involves the internal consistency of our message about the value of the human_person , the Church cannot be expected to change her position on this_question . I want to be completely honest in this_regard . This -isaia- not something subject to alleged reforms or '' modernizations '' . It -isaia- not '' progressive '' to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human_life . On the other_hand , it -isaia-_also true that_we_have done little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations , where abortion appears as a quick solution to their profound anguish , especially_when the life developing within them -isaia- the result of rape or a situation of extreme poverty . Who can remain unmoved before such painful situations ? . There are other weak and defenceless beings who_are frequently -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of economic interests or indiscriminate exploitation . I -amos- speaking of creation as a whole . We human_beings are not_only the beneficiaries but_also the stewards of other creatures . Thanks to our bodies , God has joined us so closely to the world around us that_we_can feel the desertification of the soil almost as a physical ailment , and the extinction of a species as a painful disfigurement . Let us not leave in our wake a swath of destruction and death which_will affect our_own lives and those of future generations . Here I would make my own the touching and prophetic lament voiced some years_ago by the bishops of the Philippines : '' An incredible variety of insects lived in the forest and were busy with all kinds of tasks . Birds flew through the air , their bright plumes and varying calls adding color and song to the green of the forests . God intended this land for us , his special creatures , but_not so that we might destroy it and turn it into a wasteland . After a single night s rain , look -atti_degli_apostoli- the chocolate brown rivers in your locality and remember_that they_are carrying the life blood of the land into the sea . How can fish swim in sewers like the Pasig and so many more rivers which_we_have polluted ? Who has turned the wonderworld of the seas into underwater cemeteries bereft of color and life ? '' . Small yet strong in the love of God , like Saint Francis of Assisi , all of us , as Christians , are_called to watch over and protect the fragile world in which we live , and all its peoples . The common_good and peace in society . We have spoken -atti_degli_apostoli- length about joy and love , but the word of God also speaks about the fruit of peace cf . Peace in society cannot be understood as pacification or the mere absence of violence resulting from the domination of one part of society over others . Nor does true peace act as a pretext for justifying a social structure which silences or appeases the poor , so that the more affluent can placidly support their lifestyle while others have to make do as they_can . Demands involving the distribution of wealth , concern_for the poor and human_rights cannot be suppressed under the guise of creating a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a contented minority . The dignity_of_the_human_person and the common_good rank higher than the comfort of those_who refuse to renounce their privileges . When these values are threatened , a prophetic voice must be raised . Nor -isaia- peace '' simply the absence of warfare , based on a precarious balance of power ; it -isaia- fashioned by efforts directed day after day towards_the establishment of the ordered universe willed by God , with a more_perfect justice among_men '' . In the end , a peace which_-isaia-_not the result of integral development will be doomed ; it will_always spawn new conflicts and various_forms of violence . People in every nation enhance the social dimension of their_lives by acting as committed and responsible citizens , not as a mob swayed by the powers that be . Let us not forget_that '' responsible citizenship -isaia- a virtue , and participation in political_life -isaia- a moral obligation '' . Yet becoming a people demands something more . It -isaia- an ongoing process in which_every new generation must_take part : a slow and arduous effort calling for a desire_for integration and a willingness to achieve this through the growth of a peaceful and multifaceted culture of encounter . Progress in building a people in peace , justice and fraternity depends on four principles related to constant tensions present in every social reality . These derive from the pillars of the Church s social_doctrine , which serve as '' primary and fundamental parameters of reference for interpreting and evaluating social phenomena '' . In their light I would now like to set_forth these four specific principles_which can guide the development of life in society and the building of a people where differences are harmonized within a shared pursuit . I do so out of the conviction_that their application can be a genuine path to peace within each nation and in the entire world . Time -isaia- greater_than space . A constant tension exists between fullness and limitation . Fullness evokes the desire_for complete possession , while limitation -isaia- a wall set before us . Broadly speaking , '' time '' has to do with fullness as an expression of the horizon which constantly opens before us , while each_individual moment has to do with limitation as an expression of enclosure . People live poised between each_individual moment and the greater , brighter horizon of the utopian future as the final cause which draws us to itself . Here we see a first principle for progress in building a people : time -isaia- greater_than space . This principle enables us to work slowly but surely , without being obsessed with immediate results . It helps us patiently to endure difficult and adverse situations , or inevitable changes in our plans . It invites us to accept the tension between fullness and limitation , and to give a priority to time . One of the faults which we occasionally observe in sociopolitical activity -isaia- that spaces and power are preferred to time and processes . Giving priority to space means madly attempting to keep everything together in the present , trying to possess all the spaces of power and of self assertion ; it -isaia- to crystallize processes and presume to hold them back . Giving priority to time means being concerned about initiating processes rather_than possessing spaces . Time governs spaces , illumines them and makes them links in a constantly expanding chain , with no possibility of return . What we need , then , -isaia- to give priority to actions which generate new processes in society and engage other persons and groups who_can develop them to the point where_they bear_fruit in significant historical events . Without anxiety , but_with clear convictions and tenacity . Sometimes I wonder if there_are people in today_s_world who_are really concerned about generating processes of people building , as opposed to obtaining immediate results which yield easy , quick short term political gains , but do not enhance human fullness . History will perhaps judge the latter with the criterion set_forth by Romano Guardini : '' The only measure for properly evaluating an age -isaia- to ask to what extent it fosters the development and attainment of a full and authentically meaningful human_existence , in accordance_with_the peculiar character and the capacities of that age '' . This criterion also applies to evangelization , which calls for attention to the bigger picture , openness to suitable processes and concern_for the long run . The Lord himself , during his earthly life , often warned his_disciples that_there were things they could_not yet understand and that they_would have to await the Holy Spirit cf . The parable of the weeds among the wheat cf . Mt : graphically illustrates an important aspect of evangelization : the enemy can intrude upon the kingdom and sow harm , but ultimately he -isaia- defeated by the goodness of the wheat . Unity prevails over conflict . Conflict cannot be ignored or concealed . But if we remain trapped in conflict , we lose our perspective , our horizons shrink and reality itself begins to fall apart . In the midst of conflict , we lose our sense of the profound unity of reality . When conflict arises , some people simply look -atti_degli_apostoli- it and go their_way as if nothing happened ; they wash their hands of it and get on with their_lives . Others embrace it in such_a_way_that they become its prisoners ; they lose their bearings , project onto institutions their_own confusion and dissatisfaction and thus make unity impossible . But there_-isaia-_also a third way , and it -isaia- the best way to deal_with conflict . It -isaia- the willingness to face conflict head on , to resolve it and to make it a link in the chain of a new process . '' Blessed are the peacemakers ! '' Mt : . In this_way it becomes possible to build communion amid disagreement , but_this can_only be achieved by those great persons_who are willing to go beyond_the surface of the conflict and to see others in their deepest dignity . This requires acknowledging a principle indispensable to the building of friendship in society : namely_,_that unity -isaia- greater_than conflict . Solidarity , in its deepest and most challenging sense , thus becomes a way of making history in a life setting where conflicts , tensions and oppositions can achieve a diversified and life_giving unity . This -isaia- not to opt for a kind of syncretism , or for the absorption of one into the other , but_rather for a resolution which takes_place on a higher plane and preserves what_-isaia- valid and useful on both sides . This principle , drawn_from the Gospel , reminds us that Christ has made all things one in himself : heaven and earth , God and man , time and eternity , flesh and spirit , person and society . The sign of this_unity and reconciliation of all things in him -isaia- peace . Christ '' is our peace '' Eph : . The Gospel message always begins with a greeting of peace , and peace -atti_degli_apostoli- all times crowns and confirms the relations_between the disciples . Peace -isaia- possible because the Lord has overcome the world and its constant conflict '' by making peace through the blood of his cross '' Col : . But if we look more_closely -atti_degli_apostoli- these biblical texts , we find that the locus of this reconciliation of differences -isaia- within ourselves , in our_own lives , ever threatened as they_are by fragmentation and breakdown . If hearts are shattered in thousands of pieces , it -isaia- not easy to create authentic peace in society . The message of peace_-isaia- not about a negotiated settlement but_rather the conviction_that the unity brought by the Spirit can harmonize every diversity . It overcomes every conflict by creating a new and promising synthesis . Diversity -isaia- a beautiful thing when it can constantly enter_into a process of reconciliation and seal a sort of cultural covenant resulting in a '' reconciled diversity '' . As the bishops of the Congo have put it : '' Our ethnic diversity -isaia-_our wealth . It -isaia- only in unity , through conversion of hearts and reconciliation , that we will_be_able to help our country to develop on all levels '' . Realities are more_important than ideas . There also exists a constant tension between ideas and realities . Realities simply are , whereas ideas are worked out . There has to be continuous dialogue_between the two , lest ideas become detached from realities . It -isaia- dangerous to dwell in the realm of words alone , of images and rhetoric . So a third principle comes into play : realities are greater_than ideas . This calls for rejecting the various means of masking reality : angelic forms of purity , dictatorships of relativism , empty rhetoric , objectives more ideal than real , brands of ahistorical fundamentalism , ethical systems bereft of kindness , intellectual discourse bereft of wisdom . Ideas \u2013 conceptual elaborations \u2013 are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of communication , understanding , and praxis . Ideas disconnected from realities give rise to ineffectual forms of idealism and nominalism , capable -atti_degli_apostoli- most of classifying and defining , but certainly not calling to action . What calls us to action are realities illuminated by reason . Formal nominalism has to give way to harmonious objectivity . Otherwise , the truth_-isaia- manipulated , cosmetics take the place of real care_for our bodies . We have politicians \u2013 and even religious leaders \u2013 who wonder why people do not understand and follow them , since their proposals are so clear and logical . Perhaps it -isaia- because_they_are stuck in the realm of pure ideas and end up reducing politics or faith to rhetoric . Others have left simplicity behind and have imported a rationality foreign to most people . Realities are greater_than ideas . This principle has to do with incarnation of the word and its being put into_practice : '' By this you know_the Spirit of God : every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ -isaia- come in the flesh -isaia- from God '' Jn : . The principle of reality , of a word already made_flesh and constantly striving to take flesh anew , -isaia- essential to evangelization . It helps us to see_that the Church s history -isaia- a history_of_salvation , to be mindful of those saints who inculturated the Gospel in the life of our peoples and to reap the fruits of the Church s rich bimillennial tradition , without pretending to come up with a system of thought detached from this treasury , as if we wanted to reinvent the Gospel . At the same_time , this principle impels us to put the word into_practice , to perform works of justice and charity_which make that word fruitful . Not to put the word into_practice , not to make it reality , -isaia- to build on sand , to remain in the realm of pure ideas and to end up in a lifeless and unfruitful self centredness and gnosticism . The whole -isaia- greater_than the part . An innate tension also exists between globalization and localization . We need to pay attention to the global so as to avoid narrowness and banality . Yet we also need to look to the local , which keeps our feet on the ground . Together , the two prevent us from falling into one of two extremes . In the first , people get caught up in an abstract , globalized universe , falling into step behind everyone else , admiring the glitter of other people s world , gaping and applauding -atti_degli_apostoli- all the right times . At the other extreme , they turn into a museum of local folklore , a world apart , doomed to doing the same things over and over , and incapable of being challenged by novelty or appreciating the beauty which God bestows beyond their borders . The whole -isaia- greater_than the part , but_it_-isaia- also greater_than the sum of its parts . There -isaia- no need , then , to be overly obsessed with limited and particular questions . We constantly have to broaden our horizons and see the greater good which_will benefit us all . But this_has to be done without evasion or uprooting . We need to sink our roots deeper into the fertile soil and history of our native place , which -isaia-_a_gift of God . We can work on a small scale , in our_own neighbourhood , but_with a larger perspective . Nor do people_who wholeheartedly enter_into the life of a community need to lose their individualism or hide their identity ; instead , they receive new impulses to personal growth . The global need not stifle , nor the particular prove barren . Here our model -isaia- not the sphere , which_-isaia- no greater_than its parts , where every point -isaia- equidistant from the centre , and there_are no differences between_them . Instead , it -isaia- the polyhedron , which reflects the convergence of all its parts , each of which preserves its distinctiveness . Pastoral and political activity alike seek to gather in this polyhedron the best of each . There -isaia- a place_for the poor and their culture , their aspirations and their potential . Even people_who can be considered dubious on account of their errors have something to offer which_must not be overlooked . It -isaia- the convergence of peoples who , within_the universal order , maintain their_own individuality ; it -isaia- the sum total of persons within a society_which pursues the common_good , which truly has a place_for everyone . To Christians , this principle also evokes the totality or integrity of the Gospel which_the Church passes down to us and sends us forth to proclaim . Its fullness and richness embrace scholars and workers , businessmen and artists , in a word , everyone . The genius of each people receives in its_own way the entire Gospel and embodies it in expressions of prayer , fraternity , justice , struggle and celebration . The good_news -isaia- the joy of the Father who desires that none of his little ones be lost , the joy of the Good Shepherd who finds the lost sheep and brings it back to the flock . The Gospel -isaia- the leaven which causes the dough to rise and the city on the hill whose light illumines all peoples . The Gospel has an intrinsic principle of totality : it will_always remain good_news until it has_been proclaimed to all people , until it has healed and strengthened every aspect of humanity , until it has brought all men_and_women together -atti_degli_apostoli- table in God s kingdom . The whole -isaia- greater_than the part . Social dialogue as a contribution to peace . Evangelization also involves the path of dialogue . For the Church today , three areas of dialogue stand out where she needs to be present in order to promote full human_development and to pursue the common_good : dialogue_with states , dialogue_with society \u2013 including dialogue_with cultures and the sciences \u2013 and dialogue_with other believers who_are_not part of the Catholic Church . In each case , '' the Church speaks from the light_which faith offers '' , contributing her two thousand year experience and keeping ever in mind the life and sufferings of human_beings . This light transcends human_reason , yet it can_also prove meaningful and enriching to those_who_are not believers and it stimulates reason to broaden its perspectives . The Church proclaims '' the Gospel of peace '' Eph : and she wishes to cooperate with all national and international authorities in safeguarding this immense universal good . By preaching Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- himself peace cf . Eph : , the new_evangelization calls on every baptized person to be a peacemaker and a credible witness to a reconciled life . In a culture which privileges dialogue as a form of encounter , it -isaia- time to devise a means_for building consensus and agreement while seeking the goal of a just , responsive and inclusive society . The principal author , the historic subject of this_process , -isaia- the people as a whole and their culture , and not a single class , minority , group or elite . We do not need plans drawn up by a few for the few , or an enlightened or outspoken minority which claims to speak for everyone . It -isaia- about agreeing to live together , a social_and_cultural pact . It -isaia- the responsibility of the State to safeguard and promote the common_good of society . Based on the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity , and fully committed to political dialogue and consensus building , it plays a fundamental role , one which_cannot be delegated , in working for the integral development of all . This role , -atti_degli_apostoli- present , calls for profound social humility . In her dialogue_with_the State and with society , the Church does_not have solutions for_every particular issue . Together with the various sectors of society , she supports those programmes which best respond to the dignity of each_person and the common_good . In doing this , she proposes in a clear way the fundamental values of human_life and convictions which_can then find expression in political activity . Dialogue between_faith , reason and science . Dialogue between science and faith also belongs to the work_of_evangelization -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of peace . Whereas positivism and scientism '' refuse to admit the validity of forms of knowledge other_than those of the positive sciences '' , the Church proposes another path , which calls for a synthesis between_the responsible use of methods proper to the empirical sciences and other areas of knowledge such as philosophy , theology , as well as faith itself , which elevates us to the mystery transcending nature and human intelligence . Faith -isaia- not fearful of reason ; on the contrary , it seeks and trusts reason , since '' the light of reason and the light_of_faith both come from God '' and cannot contradict each_other . Evangelization -isaia- attentive to scientific advances and wishes to shed on them the light_of_faith and the natural_law so that_they_will remain respectful of the centrality and supreme value of the human_person -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of life . All of society can be enriched thanks to this dialogue , which opens up new horizons for thought and expands the possibilities of reason . This too -isaia- a path of harmony and peace . The Church has no wish to hold back the marvellous progress of science . On the contrary , she rejoices and even delights in acknowledging the enormous potential that God has_given to the human mind . Whenever the sciences \u2013 rigorously focused on their_specific field of inquiry \u2013 arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a conclusion which reason cannot refute , faith does_not contradict it . Neither can believers claim that a scientific opinion which_-isaia- attractive but_not sufficiently verified has the same weight as a dogma of faith . At times some scientists have exceeded the limits of their scientific competence by making certain statements or claims . But here_the problem -isaia- not_with reason itself , but_with the promotion of a particular ideology which blocks the path to authentic , serene and productive dialogue . Commitment to ecumenism responds to the prayer of the Lord Jesus that '' they_may all be one '' Jn : . The credibility of the Christian message would be much greater if Christians could overcome their divisions and the Church could realize '' the fullness of catholicity proper to her in those of her_children who , though joined to her by baptism , are yet separated_from full_communion with_her '' . We must_never forget_that we are pilgrims journeying alongside one_another . This means_that we must_have sincere trust in our fellow pilgrims , putting aside all suspicion or mistrust , and turn our gaze to what we are all seeking : the radiant peace of God s face . Trusting others -isaia- an art and peace_-isaia- an art . Jesus told us : '' Blessed are the peacemakers '' Mt : . In taking up this_task , also among ourselves , we fulfil the ancient prophecy : '' They shall beat their swords into ploughshares '' Is : . In this perspective , ecumenism can be seen as a contribution to the unity of the human_family . At the Synod , the presence of the Patriarch of Constantinople , His Holiness Bartholomaios I , and the Archbishop of Canterbury , His Grace Rowan Williams , was a true gift from God and a precious Christian witness . Given the seriousness of the counter witness of division among Christians , particularly in Asia and Africa , the search_for paths to unity becomes all the more urgent . Missionaries on those continents often mention the criticisms , complaints and ridicule to which_the scandal of divided Christians gives_rise . If we concentrate on the convictions we share , and if we keep in mind the principle of the hierarchy of truths , we will_be_able to progress decidedly towards common expressions of proclamation , service and witness . The immense numbers of people_who have_not received_the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot leave us indifferent . Consequently , commitment to a unity_which helps them to accept Jesus Christ can no longer be a matter of mere diplomacy or forced compliance , but_rather an indispensable path to evangelization . Signs of division between Christians in countries ravaged by violence add further causes of conflict on the part of those_who should instead be a leaven of peace . How many important things unite us ! If we really believe in the abundantly free working of the Holy Spirit , we can learn so much from one_another ! It -isaia- not_just about being better informed about others , but_rather about reaping what_the Spirit has sown in them , which_-isaia- also meant to be a gift for us . To give but_one example , in the dialogue_with our Orthodox brothers_and_sisters , we Catholics have_the opportunity to learn more about the meaning of episcopal collegiality and their experience of synodality . Through an exchange of gifts , the Spirit can lead us ever more_fully into truth and goodness . Relations with Judaism . We hold the Jewish people in special regard because their covenant with God has_never been revoked , for '' the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable '' Rom : . The Church , which shares with Jews an important part of the sacred Scriptures , looks upon the people of the covenant and their_faith as one of the sacred roots of her_own Christian identity cf . As Christians , we cannot consider Judaism as a foreign religion ; nor do we include the Jews among_those called to turn from idols and to serve the true God cf . With them , we believe in the one God who acts in history , and with_them we accept his revealed word . Dialogue and friendship with the children of Israel are part of the life of Jesus disciples . The friendship which_has grown between us makes us bitterly and sincerely regret the terrible persecutions which_they_have endured , and continue to endure , especially_those that_have involved Christians . God continues to work among the people of the Old Covenant and to bring forth treasures of wisdom which flow from their encounter_with his_word . For this_reason , the Church also -isaia- enriched when_she receives the values of Judaism . While it -isaia- true_that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism , and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah , there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one_another to mine the riches of God s word . We can_also share many ethical convictions and a common concern_for justice and the development of peoples . An attitude of openness in truth and in love must characterize the dialogue_with_the followers of non Christian religions , in spite of various obstacles and difficulties , especially forms of fundamentalism on both sides . Interreligious dialogue -isaia- a necessary condition_for peace in the world , and so it -isaia- a duty for Christians as well as other religious communities . This dialogue -isaia- in first_place a conversation about human_existence or simply , as the bishops of India have put it , a matter of '' being open to them , sharing their joys and sorrows '' . In this_way we learn to accept others and their different_ways of living , thinking and speaking . We can then join one_another in taking up the duty of serving justice_and_peace , which_should become a basic principle of all our exchanges . A dialogue which seeks social peace and justice -isaia- in itself , beyond all merely practical considerations , an ethical commitment which brings about a new social situation . Efforts made in dealing_with a specific theme can become a process in which , by mutual listening , both parts can be purified and enriched . These efforts , therefore , can_also express love for truth . In this dialogue , ever friendly and sincere , attention must_always be paid to the essential bond_between dialogue and proclamation , which_leads the Church to maintain and intensify her relationship_with non Christians . A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of those_who would ignore greater values of which_they_are not the masters . True openness involves remaining steadfast in one s deepest convictions , clear and joyful in one_s_own identity , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time being '' open to understanding those of the other party '' and '' knowing that dialogue can enrich each side '' . What -isaia- not helpful -isaia- a diplomatic openness which says '' yes '' to everything in order to avoid problems , for this_would be a way of deceiving others and denying them the good which_we_have been_given to share generously with_others . Evangelization and interreligious dialogue , far_from_being opposed , mutually support and nourish one_another . Our relationship_with the followers of Islam has_taken on great_importance , since_they are_now significantly present in many traditionally Christian countries , where_they can freely worship and become fully a part of society . We must_never forget_that they '' profess to hold the faith of Abraham , and together_with us they adore the one , merciful God , who_will judge humanity on the last day '' . The sacred writings of Islam have retained some Christian teachings ; Jesus and Mary receive profound veneration and it -isaia- admirable to see_how Muslims both young and old , men_and_women , make time for daily prayer and faithfully take_part in religious services . Many of them also have a deep conviction_that their_life , in its entirety , -isaia- from God and for God . They also acknowledge_the need to respond to God with an ethical commitment and with mercy towards those most in need . In order to sustain dialogue_with Islam , suitable training -isaia- essential for all involved , not_only so that_they_can be solidly and joyfully grounded in their_own identity , but so that_they_can also acknowledge_the values of others , appreciate the concerns underlying their demands and shed light on shared beliefs . We Christians should embrace with affection and respect Muslim immigrants to our countries in the same_way that we hope and ask to be received and respected in countries of Islamic tradition . I ask and I humbly entreat those countries to grant Christians freedom to worship and to practice their_faith , in light of the freedom which followers of Islam enjoy in Western countries ! Faced with disconcerting episodes of violent fundamentalism , our respect_for true followers of Islam should lead us to avoid hateful generalisations , for authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every_form of violence . Non Christians , by God s gracious initiative , when_they_are faithful to their_own consciences , can live '' justified by the grace of God '' , and thus be '' associated to the paschal_mystery of Jesus Christ '' . But due to the sacramental dimension of sanctifying grace , God s working in them tends to produce signs and rites , sacred expressions which in turn bring others to a communitarian experience of journeying towards God . While these lack the meaning and efficacy of the sacraments instituted by Christ , they_can be channels which_the Holy Spirit raises up in order to liberate non Christians from atheistic immanentism or from purely individual religious experiences . The same Spirit everywhere brings forth various_forms of practical wisdom which help people to bear suffering and to live in greater peace and harmony . As Christians , we can_also benefit from_these treasures built up over many centuries , which_can help us better to live our_own beliefs . Social dialogue in a context of religious_freedom . The Synod Fathers spoke of the importance of respect_for religious_freedom , viewed as a fundamental human right . This includes '' the freedom to choose the religion which one judges to be true and to manifest one s beliefs in public '' . A healthy pluralism , one_which genuinely respects differences and values them as such , does_not entail privatizing religions in an attempt to reduce them to the quiet obscurity of the individual s conscience or to relegate them to the enclosed precincts of churches , synagogues or mosques . This would represent , in effect , a new form of discrimination and authoritarianism . The respect due to the agnostic or non believing minority should_not be arbitrarily imposed in a way_that silences the convictions of the believing majority or ignores the wealth of religious traditions . In the long run , this_would feed resentment rather_than tolerance and peace . When considering the effect of religion on public_life , one_must distinguish the different_ways in which_it_-isaia- practiced . Intellectuals and serious journalists frequently descend to crude and superficial generalizations in speaking of the shortcomings of religion , and often prove incapable of realizing that_not all believers \u2013 or religious leaders \u2013 are the same . Some politicians take advantage of this confusion to justify acts of discrimination . At other times , contempt -isaia- shown for writings which reflect religious convictions , overlooking the fact_that religious classics can prove meaningful in every_age ; they_have an enduring power to open new horizons , to stimulate thought , to expand the mind and the heart . This contempt -isaia- due to the myopia of a certain rationalism . Is it reasonable and enlightened to dismiss certain writings simply because_they arose in a context of religious belief ? These writings include principles_which are profoundly humanistic and , albeit tinged with religious symbols and teachings , they_have a certain value for reason . As believers , we also feel close to those who_do_not consider themselves part of any religious tradition , yet sincerely seek the truth , goodness and beauty which we believe have_their highest expression and source in God . We consider them as precious allies in the commitment to defending human_dignity , in building peaceful coexistence between peoples and in protecting creation . A special place of encounter -isaia- offered by new Areopagi such as the Court of the Gentiles , where '' believers and non believers are_able to engage in dialogue about fundamental issues of ethics , art and science , and about the search_for transcendence '' . This too -isaia- a path to peace in our troubled world . Starting from certain social issues of great_importance for the future of humanity , I have tried to make explicit once_again the inescapable social dimension of the Gospel message and to encourage all Christians to demonstrate it by their words , attitudes and deeds . CHAPTER FIVE SPIRIT FILLED EVANGELIZERS . Spirit filled evangelizers means evangelizers fearlessly open to the working of the Holy Spirit . At Pentecost , the Spirit made the apostles go forth_from themselves and turned them_into heralds of God s wondrous deeds , capable of speaking to each_person in his or her_own language . The Holy Spirit also grants the courage to proclaim_the newness of the Gospel with boldness parrhes\u00eda in every time_and_place , even_when it meets with opposition . Let us call_upon him today , firmly rooted in prayer , for without prayer all our activity risks being fruitless and our message empty . Jesus wants evangelizers who proclaim_the good_news not only_with words , but_above all by a life transfigured by God s presence . In this final chapter , I do not intend to offer a synthesis of Christian spirituality , or to explore great themes like prayer , Eucharistic adoration or the liturgical celebration of the faith . For all these we already have valuable texts of the magisterium and celebrated writings by great authors . I do not claim to replace or improve upon these treasures . I simply wish to offer some thoughts about the spirit of the new_evangelization . Whenever we say that something -isaia- '' spirited '' , it usually refers to some interior impulse which encourages , motivates , nourishes and gives meaning to our individual and communal activity . Spirit filled evangelization_-isaia- not the same as a set of tasks dutifully carried_out despite one_s_own personal inclinations and wishes . How I long to find the right words to stir up enthusiasm for a new chapter of evangelization full of fervour , joy , generosity , courage , boundless love and attraction ! Yet I realize_that no words of encouragement will be enough unless the fire of the Holy Spirit burns in our_hearts . A spirit filled evangelization_-isaia- one guided by the Holy Spirit , for he -isaia- the soul of the Church called to proclaim_the Gospel . Before offering some spiritual motivations and suggestions , I once_more invoke the Holy Spirit . I implore him to come and renew the Church , to stir and impel her to go forth boldly to evangelize all peoples . Reasons for a renewed missionary impulse . Spirit filled evangelizers are evangelizers who pray and work . Mystical notions without a solid social and missionary outreach are of no help to evangelization , nor are dissertations or social or pastoral practices which lack a spirituality which_can change hearts . These unilateral and incomplete proposals only reach a few groups and prove incapable of radiating beyond them because_they curtail the Gospel . What -isaia- needed -isaia- the ability to cultivate an interior space which_can give a Christian meaning to commitment and activity . Without prolonged moments of adoration , of prayerful encounter_with_the word , of sincere conversation with the Lord , our work easily becomes meaningless ; we lose energy as a result of weariness and difficulties , and our fervour dies out . The Church urgently needs the deep breath of prayer , and to my great joy groups devoted to prayer and intercession , the prayerful reading of God s word and the perpetual adoration of the Eucharist are growing -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of ecclesial life . Even so , '' we must reject the temptation to offer a privatized and individualistic spirituality which ill accords with the demands of charity , to say nothing of the implications of the incarnation '' . There -isaia- always the risk that_some moments of prayer can become an excuse for not offering one s life in mission ; a privatized lifestyle can lead Christians to take refuge in some false forms of spirituality . We do well to keep in mind the early Christians and our many brothers_and_sisters throughout history who_were filled_with joy , unflagging courage and zeal in proclaiming the Gospel . Some people nowadays console themselves by saying that things_are not as easy as they used to be , yet we know_that the Roman empire was_not conducive to the Gospel message , the struggle for_justice , or the defence of human_dignity . Every period of history -isaia- marked by the presence of human weakness , self absorption , complacency and selfishness , to say nothing of the concupiscence which preys upon us all . These things_are ever present under one guise or another ; they_are due to our human limits rather_than particular situations . Let us not say , then_,_that things_are harder today ; they_are simply different . But let us learn also from the saints who_have gone before us , who confronted the difficulties of their_own day . So I propose that we pause to rediscover some of the reasons which_can help us to imitate them today . Personal encounter_with_the saving love of Jesus . The primary reason_for evangelizing -isaia- the love of Jesus which we have_received , the experience of salvation which urges us to ever_greater love of him . What kind of love would_not feel the need to speak of the beloved , to point him out , to make him known ? If we do not feel an intense desire to share this_love , we need to pray insistently that he will once_more touch our_hearts . We need to implore his_grace daily , asking him to open our cold hearts and shake up our lukewarm and superficial existence . Standing before him_with open hearts , letting him look -atti_degli_apostoli- us , we see_that gaze of love_which Nathaniel glimpsed on the day when Jesus said to him : '' I saw you under the fig tree '' Jn : . How good it -isaia- to stand before a crucifix , or on our knees before the Blessed Sacrament , and simply to be in his presence ! How much good it does us when he once_more touches our_lives and impels us to share his new_life ! What then happens -isaia- that '' we speak of what_we_have seen and heard '' Jn : . The best incentive for sharing the Gospel comes_from contemplating it with love , lingering over its pages and reading it with the heart . If we approach it in this_way , its beauty will amaze and constantly excite us . But if this_-isaia- to come about , we need to recover a contemplative spirit_which can_help us to realize ever anew that_we_have been entrusted with a treasure which_makes us more_human and helps us to lead a new_life . There -isaia- nothing_more precious which we can_give to others . Jesus whole_life , his way of dealing_with the poor , his actions , his integrity , his simple daily acts of generosity , and finally his complete self_giving , -isaia- precious and reveals the mystery of his divine_life . Whenever we encounter this anew , we become convinced that_it_-isaia- exactly what others need , even_though they_may not recognize it : '' What therefore you worship as unknown , this I proclaim to you '' Acts : . Sometimes we lose our enthusiasm for mission because we forget_that the Gospel responds to our deepest needs , since we were created for_what the Gospel offers us : friendship with Jesus and love of our_brothers_and_sisters . If we succeed in expressing adequately and with beauty the essential content of the Gospel , surely this message will speak to the deepest yearnings of people s hearts : '' The missionary -isaia- convinced_that , through the working of the Spirit , there already exists in individuals and peoples an expectation , even if an unconscious one , of knowing the truth_about God , about man , and about how we are to be set free_from sin and death . The missionary s enthusiasm in proclaiming Christ comes_from_the conviction_that he -isaia- responding to that expectation '' . Enthusiasm for evangelization_-isaia- based on this conviction . We have a treasure of life and love which_cannot deceive , and a message which_cannot mislead or disappoint . It penetrates to the depths of our_hearts , sustaining and ennobling us . It -isaia- a truth which_-isaia- never out of date because it reaches that part of us which nothing else can reach . Our infinite sadness can_only be cured by an infinite love . But this conviction has to be sustained by our_own constantly renewed experience of savouring Christ s friendship and his message . It -isaia- impossible to persevere in a fervent evangelization unless we are convinced from personal experience that_it_-isaia- not the same thing to have known Jesus as not to have known him , not the same thing to walk with_him as to walk blindly , not the same thing to hear his_word as not to know it , and not the same thing to contemplate him , to worship him , to find our peace in him , as not to . It -isaia- not the same thing to try to build the world with_his Gospel as to try to do so by our_own lights . We know well that_with Jesus life becomes richer and that_with him it -isaia- easier to find meaning in everything . This -isaia- why we evangelize . A true missionary , who never ceases to be a disciple , knows that Jesus walks with_him , speaks to him , breathes with_him , works with_him . He senses Jesus alive with_him in the midst of the missionary enterprise . Unless we see him present -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of our missionary commitment , our enthusiasm soon wanes and we are no longer sure of what it -isaia- that_we_are handing on ; we lack vigour and passion . A person who_-isaia- not convinced , enthusiastic , certain and in love , will convince nobody . In union with Jesus , we seek what he seeks and we love what he loves . In the end , what we are seeking -isaia- the glory of the Father ; we live and act '' for the praise of his glorious grace '' Eph : . If we wish to commit ourselves fully and perseveringly , we need to leave behind every_other motivation . This -isaia-_our definitive , deepest and greatest motivation , the ultimate reason and meaning behind all we do : the glory of the Father which Jesus sought -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of his_life . As the Son , he rejoices eternally to be '' close to the Father s heart '' Jn : . If we are missionaries , it -isaia- primarily because Jesus told us that '' by this my Father -isaia- glorified , that_you bear much fruit '' Jn : . Beyond all our_own preferences and interests , our knowledge and motivations , we evangelize for the greater glory of the Father who loves us . The spiritual savour of being a people . The word of God also invites us to recognise that_we_are a people : '' Once you were no people but now you_are God s people '' Pet : . To be evangelizers of souls , we need to develop a spiritual taste for being close to people s lives and to discover that_this_-isaia- itself a source of greater joy . Mission -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a passion for Jesus and a passion for his_people . When we stand before Jesus crucified , we see the depth of his love_which exalts and sustains us , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , unless we are blind , we begin to realize_that Jesus gaze , burning with love , expands to embrace all his_people . We realize once_more that he wants to make_use of us to draw closer to his beloved people . He takes us from the midst of his_people and he sends us to his_people ; without this_sense of belonging we cannot understand our deepest identity . Jesus himself_-isaia- the model of this method of evangelization which brings us to the very_heart of his_people . How good it -isaia- for us to contemplate the closeness which he shows to everyone ! If he speaks to someone , he looks into_their eyes with deep love and concern : '' Jesus , looking upon him , loved him '' Mk : . We see_how accessible he -isaia- , as he draws near the blind man cf . Mk : and eats and drinks with sinners cf . Mk : without worrying about being thought a glutton and a drunkard himself cf . We see his sensitivity in allowing a sinful woman to anoint his feet cf . Lk : and in receiving Nicodemus by night cf . Jesus sacrifice on the cross -isaia- nothing else than the culmination of the way he lived his entire life . Moved by his example , we want to enter fully into the fabric of society , sharing the lives of all , listening to their concerns , helping them materially and spiritually in their needs , rejoicing with_those_who rejoice , weeping with_those_who weep ; arm in arm with_others , we are committed to building a new world . But we do so not from a sense of obligation , not as a burdensome duty , but as the result of a personal decision which brings us joy and gives meaning to our_lives . Sometimes we are tempted to be that kind of Christian who keeps the Lord s wounds -atti_degli_apostoli- arm s length . Yet Jesus wants us to touch human misery , to touch the suffering flesh of others . He hopes that we will stop looking for those personal or communal niches which shelter us from the maelstrom of human misfortune and instead enter_into the reality of other people s lives and know_the power of tenderness . Whenever we do so , our_lives become wonderfully complicated and we experience intensely what it -isaia- to be a people , to be part of a people . It -isaia- true_that in our dealings with the world , we are told to give reasons for our_hope , but_not as an enemy who critiques and condemns . We are told quite clearly : '' do so with gentleness and reverence '' Pet : and '' if possible , so far as it depends upon you , live peaceably with all '' Rom : . We are_also told to overcome '' evil with_good '' Rom : and to '' work_for the good of all '' Gal : . Far from trying to appear better_than others , we should '' in humility count others better '' than ourselves Phil : . The Lord s apostles themselves enjoyed '' favour with all the people '' Acts : ; : , ; : . Clearly Jesus does_not want us to be grandees who look down upon others , but men_and_women of the people . This -isaia- not an idea of the Pope , or one pastoral option among others ; they_are injunctions contained in the word of God which_are so clear , direct and convincing that_they need no interpretations which might diminish their_power to challenge us . Let us live them sine glossa , without commentaries . By so doing we will know_the missionary joy of sharing life with God s faithful people as we strive to light a fire in the heart of the world . Loving others -isaia- a spiritual force drawing us to union with God ; indeed , one who_does_not love others '' walks in the darkness '' Jn : , '' remains in death '' Jn : and '' does_not know God '' Jn : . Benedict XVI has said_that '' closing our_eyes to our neighbour also blinds us to God '' , and that love_-isaia- , in the end , the only light_which '' can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working '' . When we live out a spirituality of drawing nearer to others and seeking their welfare , our_hearts are opened wide to the Lord s greatest and most beautiful gifts . Whenever we encounter another person in love , we learn something new about God . Whenever our_eyes are opened to acknowledge_the other , we grow in the light_of_faith and knowledge of God . If we want to advance in the spiritual_life , then , we must constantly be missionaries . The work_of_evangelization enriches the mind and the heart ; it opens up spiritual horizons ; it makes us more_and_more sensitive to the workings of the Holy Spirit , and it takes us beyond our limited spiritual constructs . A committed missionary knows the joy of being a spring which spills over and refreshes others . Only the person_who feels happiness in seeking the good of others , in desiring their happiness , can be a missionary . This openness of the heart_-isaia- a source of joy , since '' it -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive '' Acts : . We do not live better when we flee , hide , refuse to share , stop giving and lock ourselves up in own comforts . Such a life_-isaia- nothing less_than slow suicide . My mission of being in the heart of the people -isaia- not_just a part of my life or a badge I can take off ; it -isaia- not an '' extra '' or just another moment in life . Instead , it -isaia- something I cannot uproot from my being without destroying my very self . I -amos- a mission on this earth ; that_-isaia- the reason_why I -amos- here in this_world . We have to regard ourselves as sealed , even branded , by this_mission of bringing light , blessing , enlivening , raising up , healing and freeing . All around us we begin to see nurses with soul , teachers with soul , politicians with soul , people_who have chosen deep down to be with_others and for others . But once we separate our work from our private lives , everything turns grey and we will_always be seeking recognition or asserting our needs . We stop being a people . If we are to share our_lives with_others and generously give of ourselves , we also have to realize_that every person_-isaia- worthy of our giving . Not for their physical appearance , their abilities , their language , their_way of thinking , or for_any satisfaction that we might receive , but_rather because_they_are God s handiwork , his creation . God created that person in his image , and he or she reflects something of God s glory . Every human_being -isaia- the object of God s infinite tenderness , and he himself_-isaia- present in their_lives . Jesus offered his precious blood on the cross for that person . Appearances notwithstanding , every person_-isaia- immensely holy and deserves our love . Consequently , if I can_help -atti_degli_apostoli- least one person to have a better life , that already justifies the offering of my life . It -isaia- a wonderful thing to be God s faithful people . We achieve fulfilment when we break down walls and our heart_-isaia- filled_with faces and names ! The mysterious working of the risen Christ and his Spirit . In the second chapter , we reflected on that lack of deep spirituality which turns into pessimism , fatalism , and mistrust . Some people do not commit themselves to mission because_they think that_nothing will change and that_it_-isaia- useless to make_the effort . They think : '' Why should I deny myself my comforts and pleasures if I won t see any significant result ? '' This attitude makes it impossible to be a missionary . It -isaia- only a malicious excuse for remaining caught up in comfort , laziness , vague dissatisfaction and empty selfishness . It -isaia- a self destructive attitude , for '' man cannot live without hope : life would become meaningless and unbearable '' . If we think_that things_are not going to change , we need to recall that Jesus Christ has triumphed over sin and death and -isaia-_now almighty . Jesus Christ truly lives . Put another way , '' if Christ has not_been raised , then our preaching -isaia- in vain '' Cor : . The Gospel tells us that_when the first disciples went forth to preach , '' the Lord worked with_them and confirmed the message '' Mk : . The same thing happens today . We are invited to discover this , to experience it . Christ , risen and glorified , -isaia- the wellspring of our_hope , and he will_not deprive us of the help we need to carry_out the mission which he has_entrusted to us . Christ s resurrection -isaia- not an event of the past ; it contains a vital power which_has permeated this_world . Where all seems to be dead , signs of the resurrection suddenly spring up . It -isaia- an irresistible force . Often it seems that God does not_exist : all around us we see persistent injustice , evil , indifference and cruelty . But it -isaia-_also true_that in the midst of darkness something new always springs to life and sooner or later produces fruit . On razed land life breaks through , stubbornly yet invincibly . However dark things_are , goodness always re emerges and spreads . Each day in our_world beauty -isaia- born anew , it rises transformed through the storms of history . Values always tend to reappear under new guises , and human_beings have arisen time after time from situations that seemed doomed . Such -isaia- the power of the resurrection , and all who evangelize are instruments of that power . At the same_time , new difficulties are constantly surfacing : experiences of failure and the human weaknesses which bring so much pain . We all know from experience that sometimes a task does_not bring_the satisfaction we seek , results are few and changes are slow , and we are tempted to grow weary . Yet lowering our arms momentarily out of weariness -isaia- not the same as lowering them_for good , overcome by chronic discontent and by a listlessness that parches the soul . It also happens_that our_hearts can tire of the struggle because in the end we are caught up in ourselves , in a careerism which thirsts for recognition , applause , rewards and status . In this case we do not lower our arms , but we no longer grasp what we seek , the resurrection -isaia- not there . In cases like these , the Gospel , the most beautiful message that this_world can_offer , -isaia- buried under a pile of excuses . Faith also means believing in God , believing that he truly loves us , that_he_-isaia- alive , that_he_-isaia- mysteriously capable of intervening , that he does_not abandon us and that he brings good out of evil by his_power and his infinite creativity . It means believing that he marches triumphantly in history with_those_who '' are_called and chosen and faithful '' Rev : . Let us believe the Gospel when it tells us that the kingdom of God -isaia-_already present in this_world and -isaia- growing , here and there , and in different_ways : like the small seed which grows into a great tree cf . Mt : , like the measure of leaven that makes_the dough rise cf . Mt : and like the good seed that grows amid the weeds cf . Mt , and can always pleasantly surprise us . The kingdom -isaia- here , it returns , it struggles to flourish anew . Christ s resurrection everywhere calls forth seeds of that new world ; even if they_are cut back , they grow again , for the resurrection -isaia-_already secretly woven into the fabric of this history , for Jesus did_not rise in vain . May we never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope ! . Because we do not_always see these seeds growing , we need an interior certainty , a conviction_that God -isaia- able to act in every situation , even amid apparent setbacks : '' We have this treasure in earthen vessels '' Cor : . This certainty -isaia-_often called '' a sense of mystery '' . It involves knowing with certitude that all those_who entrust themselves to God in love will bear good fruit cf . This fruitfulness -isaia-_often invisible , elusive and unquantifiable . We can know quite well that our_lives will be fruitful , without claiming to know_how , or where , or when . We may be sure_that none of our acts of love will be lost , nor any of our acts of sincere concern_for others . No single act of love for God will be lost , no generous effort -isaia- meaningless , no painful endurance -isaia- wasted . All of these encircle our_world like a vital force . Sometimes it seems that_our work_-isaia- fruitless , but mission_-isaia- not like a business transaction or investment , or even a humanitarian activity . It -isaia- not a show where we count how many_people come as a result of our publicity ; it -isaia- something much deeper , which escapes all measurement . It may be that the Lord uses our sacrifices to shower blessings in another part_of_the_world which we will_never visit . The Holy Spirit works as he wills , when he wills and where he wills ; we entrust ourselves without pretending to see striking results . We know only that_our commitment -isaia- necessary . Let us learn to rest in the tenderness of the arms of the Father amid our creative and generous commitment . Let us keep marching forward ; let us give him everything , allowing him to make our efforts bear_fruit in his good time . Keeping our missionary fervour alive calls for firm trust in the Holy Spirit , for it -isaia- he who '' helps us in our weakness '' Rom : . But this generous trust has to be nourished , and so we need to invoke the Spirit constantly . He can heal whatever causes us to flag in the missionary endeavour . It -isaia- true that_this trust in the unseen can cause us to feel disoriented : it -isaia- like being plunged into the deep and not knowing what we will_find . I myself have frequently experienced this . Yet there_-isaia- no greater freedom than_that of allowing oneself to be guided by the Holy Spirit , renouncing the attempt to plan and control everything to the last detail , and instead letting him enlighten , guide and direct us , leading us wherever he wills . The Holy Spirit knows well what_-isaia- needed in every time_and_place . This -isaia- what it means to be mysteriously fruitful ! The missionary power of intercessory prayer . One form of prayer moves us particularly to take up the task of evangelization and to seek the good of others : it -isaia- the prayer of intercession . Let us peer for a moment into the heart of Saint Paul , to see what his prayer was like . It was full of people : '' . I constantly pray with you in every_one of my prayers for all of you . because I hold you in my heart '' Phil : , . Here we see_that intercessory prayer does_not divert us from true contemplation , since authentic contemplation always has a place_for others . This attitude becomes a prayer of gratitude to God for others . '' First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you '' Rom : . It -isaia- constant thankfulness : '' I give thanks to God always for you because of the grace of God which was_given you in Christ Jesus '' Cor : ; '' I thank my God in all my remembrance of you '' Phil : . Far from being suspicious , negative and despairing , it -isaia- a spiritual gaze born of deep faith_which acknowledges what God -isaia- doing in the lives of others . At the same_time , it -isaia- the gratitude which flows from a heart attentive to others . When evangelizers rise from prayer , their_hearts are_more open ; freed of self absorption , they_are desirous of doing good and sharing their_lives with_others . The great men_and_women of God were great intercessors . Intercession -isaia- like a '' leaven '' in the heart of the Trinity . It -isaia- a way of penetrating the Father s heart and discovering new dimensions which_can shed light on concrete situations and change them . We can say that God s heart_-isaia- touched by our intercession , yet in reality he -isaia- always there first . What our intercession achieves -isaia- that his_power , his_love and his faithfulness are shown ever more_clearly in the midst of the people . Mary , mother of evangelization . With the Holy Spirit , Mary -isaia- always present in the midst of the people . She joined the disciples in praying for the coming of the Holy Spirit Acts : and thus made possible the missionary outburst which took_place -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost . She -isaia- the Mother of the Church which evangelizes , and without her we could never truly understand_the spirit of the new_evangelization . Jesus gift to his_people . On the cross , when Jesus endured in his_own flesh the dramatic encounter of the sin of the world and God s mercy , he could feel -atti_degli_apostoli- his feet the consoling presence of his_mother and his friend . At that crucial moment , before fully accomplishing the work_which his Father had entrusted to him , Jesus said to Mary : '' Woman , here -isaia- your son '' . Then he said to his beloved friend : '' Here -isaia- your mother '' Jn : . These words of the dying Jesus are_not chiefly the expression of his devotion and concern_for his_mother ; rather , they_are a revelatory formula which manifests the mystery of a special saving mission . Jesus left us his_mother to be our_mother . Only after doing so did Jesus know_that '' all was now finished '' Jn : . At the foot of the cross , -atti_degli_apostoli- the supreme hour of the new creation , Christ led us to Mary . He brought us to her because he did_not want us to journey without a mother , and our people read in this maternal image all the mysteries of the Gospel . The Lord did_not want to leave the Church without this icon of womanhood . Mary , who brought him into_the_world with_great faith , also accompanies '' the rest of her offspring , those_who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus '' Rev : . The close connection_between Mary , the Church and each member of the faithful , based on the fact_that each in his or her_own way brings forth Christ , has_been beautifully expressed by Blessed Isaac of Stella : '' In the inspired Scriptures , what_-isaia- said in a universal sense of the virgin_mother , the Church , -isaia- understood in an individual sense of the Virgin Mary . In a way , every Christian -isaia-_also believed to be a bride of God s word , a mother of Christ , his daughter and sister , -atti_degli_apostoli- once virginal and fruitful . Christ dwelt for nine months in the tabernacle of Mary s womb . He dwells until the end of the ages in the tabernacle of the Church s faith . He will dwell forever in the knowledge and love of each faithful soul '' . Mary was able to turn a stable into a home for Jesus , with poor swaddling clothes and an abundance of love . She -isaia- the handmaid of the Father who sings his praises . She -isaia- the friend who_-isaia- ever concerned that wine not be lacking in our_lives . She -isaia- the woman whose heart was pierced by a sword and who understands all our pain . As mother of all , she_-isaia- a sign of hope_for peoples suffering the birth pangs of justice . She -isaia- the missionary who draws near to us and accompanies us throughout life , opening our_hearts to faith by her_maternal love . As a true mother , she walks -atti_degli_apostoli- our side , she shares our struggles and she constantly surrounds us with God s love . Through her many titles , often linked to her shrines , Mary shares the history of each people which has_received the Gospel and she becomes a part of their historic identity . Many Christian parents ask that their_children be baptized in a Marian shrine , as a sign of their_faith in her motherhood which brings forth new children for God . There , in these many shrines , we can_see how Mary brings together her_children who with_great effort come as pilgrims to see her and to be seen by her . Here they find strength from God to bear the weariness and the suffering in their_lives . As she did with Juan Diego , Mary offers them maternal comfort and love , and whispers in their ear : '' Let your heart not be troubled . Am I not here , who -amos- your Mother ? '' Star of the new Evangelization . We ask the Mother of the living Gospel to intercede that_this invitation to a new phase of evangelization will be accepted by the entire ecclesial_community . Mary -isaia- the woman of faith , who lives and advances in faith , and '' her exceptional pilgrimage of faith represents a constant point of reference for the Church '' . Mary let herself be guided by the Holy Spirit on a journey of faith towards a destiny of service and fruitfulness . Today we look to her and ask her to help us proclaim_the message of salvation to all and to enable new disciples to become evangelizers in turn . Along this journey of evangelization we will_have our moments of aridity , darkness and even fatigue . Mary herself experienced these_things during the years of Jesus childhood in Nazareth : '' This -isaia- the beginning of the Gospel , the joyful good_news . However , it -isaia- not difficult to see in that beginning a particular heaviness of heart , linked_with a sort of night of faith \u2013 to use the words of Saint John of the Cross \u2013 a kind of veil through_which one_has to draw near to the Invisible One and to live in intimacy with the mystery . And this -isaia-_the_way that Mary , for_many years , lived in intimacy with the mystery of her Son , and went forward in her pilgrimage of faith '' . There -isaia- a Marian '' style '' to the Church s work_of_evangelization . Whenever we look to Mary , we come to believe once_again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness . In her we see_that humility and tenderness are_not virtues of the weak but of the strong who need not treat others poorly in order to feel important themselves . Contemplating Mary , we realize_that she_who praised God for '' bringing down the mighty from their thrones '' and '' sending the rich away empty '' Lk : -isaia-_also the one_who brings a homely warmth to our pursuit of justice . She -isaia-_also the one_who carefully keeps '' all these_things , pondering them in her_heart '' Lk : . Mary -isaia- able to recognize_the traces of God s Spirit in events great and small . She constantly contemplates the mystery of God in our_world , in human_history and in our daily lives . She -isaia- the woman of prayer and work in Nazareth , and she -isaia-_also Our Lady of Help , who sets out from her town '' with haste '' Lk : to be of service to others . This interplay of justice and tenderness , of contemplation and concern_for others , -isaia- what makes_the ecclesial_community look to Mary as a model of evangelization . We implore her_maternal intercession that the Church may_become a home for_many peoples , a mother for all peoples , and that the way may be opened to the birth of a new world . It -isaia- the Risen Christ who tells us , with a power that fills us with confidence and unshakeable hope : '' Behold , I make all things new '' Rev : . With Mary we advance confidently towards_the fulfilment of this promise , and to her we pray : Mary , Virgin and Mother , you_who , moved by the Holy Spirit , welcomed the word of life in the depths of your humble faith : as you gave yourself completely to the Eternal One , help us to say our_own '' yes '' to the urgent call , as pressing as ever , to proclaim_the good_news of Jesus . Filled with Christ s presence , you brought joy to John the Baptist , making him exult in the womb of his_mother . Brimming over with_joy , you sang of the great things done by God . Standing -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross with unyielding faith , you received_the joyful comfort of the resurrection , and joined the disciples in awaiting the Spirit so that the evangelizing Church might be born . Obtain for us now a new ardour born of the resurrection , that_we_may bring to all the Gospel of life_which triumphs over death . Give us a holy courage to seek new paths , that the gift of unfading beauty may reach every man_and_woman . Virgin of listening and contemplation , Mother of love , Bride of the eternal wedding feast , pray_for the Church , whose pure icon you_are , that_she may never be closed in on herself or lose her passion for establishing God s kingdom . Star of the new_evangelization , help us to bear radiant witness to communion , service , ardent and generous faith , justice and love of the poor , that the joy of the Gospel may reach to the ends of the earth , illuminating even the fringes of our_world . Mother of the living Gospel , wellspring of happiness for God s little ones , pray_for us . Alleluia ! Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on November , the solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ , King of the Universe , and the conclusion of the Year of Faith , in the year , the first of my Pontificate .

We can benefit from the testimony of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux , who speaks of one particular Sister whom she found especially disagreeable , where an interior experience had a decisive impact : '' One winter afternoon I was engaged as usual in my little task . It was cold and growing dark . Suddenly I heard in the distance the harmonious sounds of a musical instrument . I began to imagine a well lit room , draped in gold , and in it , elegantly dressed young ladies exchanging worldly compliments and courtesies . Then I looked -atti_degli_apostoli- the poor sick woman whom I was attending . In place of a melody , I heard her occasional groans and sighs . I cannot express what took_place in my soul . All that I do know -isaia- that the Lord illumined it with the rays of truth_which so surpassed the flickering glow of earthly revels , that I could scarcely believe my happiness '' Ms .

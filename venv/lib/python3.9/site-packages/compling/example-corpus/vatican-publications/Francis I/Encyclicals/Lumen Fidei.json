The light of Faith : this_-isaia- how the Church s tradition speaks of the great gift brought by Jesus . In John s Gospel , Christ says of himself : '' I have come as light into_the_world , that whoever believes in me may_not remain in darkness '' Jn : . Saint Paul uses the same image : '' God who said Let light shine out of darkness , has shone in our_hearts '' Cor : . The pagan world , which hungered for light , had seen the growth of the cult of the sun god , Sol Invictus , invoked each_day -atti_degli_apostoli- sunrise . Yet though the sun was_born anew each morning , it was clearly incapable of casting its light on all of human_existence . The sun does_not illumine all reality ; its rays cannot penetrate to the shadow of death , the place_where men s eyes are closed to its light . '' No one Saint Justin Martyr writes has_ever been ready to die for his faith in the sun '' . Conscious of the immense horizon which their_faith opened before them , Christians invoked Jesus as the true sun '' whose rays bestow life '' . To Martha , weeping for the death of her brother Lazarus , Jesus said : '' Did I not tell you that if you believed , you would see the glory of God ? '' Jn : . Those who_believe , see ; they see with a light that illumines their entire journey , for it comes_from_the risen Christ , the morning star which never sets . Yet in speaking of the light_of_faith , we can almost hear_the objections of many of our contemporaries . In modernity , that light might have_been considered sufficient for societies of old , but was felt to be of no use for new times , for a humanity come of age , proud of its rationality and anxious to explore the future in novel ways . Faith thus appeared to some as an illusory light , preventing mankind from boldly setting out in quest of knowledge . The young Nietzsche encouraged his sister Elisabeth to take risks , to tread '' new paths . with all the uncertainty of one_who must find his_own way '' , adding that '' this_-isaia- where humanity s paths part : if you want peace of soul and happiness , then believe , but if you want to be a follower of truth , then seek '' . Belief would be incompatible with seeking . From this starting point Nietzsche was to develop his critique of Christianity for diminishing the full meaning of human_existence and stripping life of novelty and adventure . Faith would thus be the illusion of light , an illusion which blocks the path of a liberated humanity to its future . In the process , faith came to be associated_with darkness . There were those_who tried to save faith by making room_for it alongside the light of reason . Such room would open up wherever the light of reason could_not penetrate , wherever certainty was no longer possible . Faith was thus understood either as a leap in the dark , to be taken in the absence of light , driven by blind emotion , or as a subjective light , capable perhaps of warming the heart and bringing personal consolation , but_not something which_could be proposed to others as an objective and shared light_which points the way . Slowly but surely , however , it would become evident_that the light of autonomous reason -isaia-_not_enough to illumine the future ; ultimately the future remains shadowy and fraught with fear of the unknown . As a result , humanity renounced the search_for a great light , Truth itself , in order to be content with smaller lights which illumine the fleeting moment yet prove incapable of showing the way . Yet in the absence of light everything becomes confused ; it -isaia- impossible to tell good from evil , or the road to our destination from other roads which take us in endless circles , going nowhere . There -isaia- an urgent_need , then , to see once_again that faith_-isaia- a light , for once the flame of faith dies out , all other lights begin to dim . The light_of_faith -isaia- unique , since_it_-isaia- capable of illuminating every aspect of human_existence . A light this powerful cannot come from ourselves but_from a more primordial source : in a word , it must come from God . Faith -isaia- born of an encounter_with_the living God who calls us and reveals his_love , a love_which precedes us and upon which we can lean for security and for building our_lives . Transformed by this_love , we gain fresh vision , new eyes to see ; we realize_that it contains a great promise of fulfilment , and that a vision of the future opens up before us . Faith , received_from God as a supernatural gift , becomes a light for our way , guiding our journey through time . On the one_hand , it -isaia- a light coming from the past , the light of the foundational memory of the life of Jesus which revealed his perfectly trustworthy love , a love capable of triumphing over death . Yet since Christ has risen and draws us beyond death , faith_-isaia- also a light coming from the future and opening before us vast horizons which guide us beyond our isolated selves towards_the breadth of communion . We come to see that_faith does_not dwell in shadow and gloom ; it -isaia- a light for our darkness . Dante , in the Divine Comedy , after professing his faith to Saint Peter , describes that light as a '' spark , which then becomes a burning flame and like a heavenly star within me glimmers '' . It -isaia- this light_of_faith that I would now like to consider , so that it can grow and enlighten the present , becoming a star to brighten the horizon of our journey -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when mankind -isaia- particularly in need of light . Christ , on the eve of his_passion , assured Peter : '' I have prayed for you that_your faith may not_fail '' Lk : . He then told him to strengthen his brothers_and_sisters in that_same faith . Conscious of the duty entrusted to the Successor of Peter , Benedict XVI proclaimed the present Year of Faith , a time of grace which_-isaia- helping us to sense the great joy of believing and to renew our wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- the vast horizons which faith opens up , so as then to profess that_faith in its unity and integrity , faithful to the memory of the Lord and sustained by his presence and by the working of the Holy Spirit . The conviction born of a faith_which brings grandeur and fulfilment to life , a faith centred on Christ and on the power of his_grace , inspired the mission of the first Christians . In the acts of the martyrs , we read the following dialogue_between the Roman prefect Rusticus and a Christian named Hierax : '' Where are your parents ? , the judge asked the martyr . He replied : Our true father -isaia- Christ , and our_mother -isaia- faith in him '' . For those early Christians , faith , as an encounter_with_the living God revealed in Christ , was indeed a '' mother '' , for it had brought them to the light and given birth within them to divine_life , a new experience and a luminous vision of existence for which_they were prepared to bear public witness to the end . The Year of Faith was inaugurated on the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council . This -isaia- itself a clear indication that Vatican II was a Council on faith , inasmuch as it asked us to restore the primacy of God in Christ to the centre of our_lives , both as a Church and as individuals . The Church never takes faith for granted , but knows that_this gift of God needs to be nourished and reinforced so that it can continue to guide her pilgrim way . The Second Vatican Council enabled the light_of_faith to illumine our human experience from within , accompanying the men_and_women of our_time on their journey . It clearly showed how faith enriches life in all its dimensions . These considerations on faith in continuity with all that the Church s magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue are meant to supplement what Benedict XVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope . He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith . For this I -amos- deeply grateful to him , and as his_brother in Christ I have_taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own . The Successor of Peter , yesterday , today and tomorrow , -isaia- always called to strengthen his brothers_and_sisters in the priceless treasure of that faith_which God has_given as a light for_humanity s path . In God s gift of faith , a supernatural infused virtue , we realize_that a great love has_been offered us , a good word has_been spoken to us , and that_when we welcome that word , Jesus Christ the Word made_flesh , the Holy Spirit transforms us , lights up our way to the future and enables us joyfully to advance along that way on wings of hope . Thus wonderfully interwoven , faith , hope and charity are the driving force of the Christian life as it advances towards full_communion with God . But what_-isaia- it like , this road which faith opens up before us ? What -isaia- the origin of this powerful light_which brightens the journey of a successful and fruitful life ? CHAPTER ONE WE HAVE BELIEVED IN LOVE cf . Jn : Abraham , our_father in faith . Faith opens the way before us and accompanies our steps through time . Hence , if we want to understand what faith_-isaia- , we need to follow_the route it has_taken , the path trodden by believers , as witnessed first in the Old Testament . Here a unique place belongs to Abraham , our_father in faith . Something disturbing takes_place in his_life : God speaks to him ; he reveals himself as a God who speaks and calls his_name . Faith -isaia- linked to hearing . Abraham does_not see God , but hears his voice . Faith thus takes on a personal aspect . God -isaia- not the god of a particular place , or a deity linked to specific sacred time , but the God of a person , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , capable of interacting with_man and establishing a covenant with_him . Faith -isaia-_our response to a word which engages us personally , to a '' Thou '' who calls us by name . The word spoken to Abraham contains both a call and a promise . First , it -isaia- a call to leave his_own land , a summons to a new_life , the beginning of an exodus which points him towards an unforeseen future . The sight which faith would give to Abraham would always be linked to the need to take this step forward : faith '' sees '' to the extent_that it journeys , to the extent_that it chooses to enter_into the horizons opened up by God s word . This word also contains a promise : Your descendants will be great in number , you will be the father of a great nation cf . As a response to a word which preceded it , Abraham s faith would always be an act of remembrance . Yet this remembrance -isaia- not fixed on past events but , as the memory of a promise , it becomes capable of opening up the future , shedding light on the path to be taken . We see_how faith , as remembrance of the future , memoria futuri , -isaia- thus closely bound up with hope . Abraham -isaia- asked to entrust himself to this word . Faith understands that something so apparently ephemeral and fleeting as a word , when spoken by the God who_-isaia- fidelity , becomes absolutely certain and unshakable , guaranteeing the continuity of our journey through history . Faith accepts this word as a solid rock upon which we can build , a straight highway on which we can travel . In the Bible , faith_-isaia- expressed by the Hebrew word em\u00fbn ? h , derived_from the verb am ? n whose root means '' to uphold '' . The term em\u00fbn ? h can signify both God s fidelity and man s faith . The man of faith gains strength by putting himself in the hands of the God who_-isaia- faithful . Playing on this double meaning of the word also found in the corresponding terms in Greek pist\u00f3s and Latin fidelis Saint Cyril of Jerusalem praised the dignity of the Christian who receives God s own name : both are_called '' faithful '' . As Saint Augustine explains : '' Man -isaia- faithful when he believes in God and his promises ; God -isaia- faithful when he grants to man what he has promised '' . A final element of the story of Abraham -isaia- important_for understanding his faith . God s word , while bringing newness and surprise , -isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- all alien to Abraham s experience . In the voice which speaks to him , the patriarch recognizes a profound call which_was always present -atti_degli_apostoli- the core of his being . God ties his promise to that aspect of human_life which has_always appeared most '' full of promise '' , namely , parenthood , the begetting of new_life : '' Sarah your wife shall bear you a son , and you shall name him Isaac '' Gen : . The God who asks Abraham for complete trust reveals himself to be the source of all life . Faith -isaia- thus linked to God s fatherhood , which_gives rise to all creation ; the God who calls Abraham -isaia- the Creator , the one_who '' calls into existence the things_that do not_exist '' Rom : , the one_who '' chose us before the foundation of the world . and destined us for adoption as his_children '' Eph : . For Abraham , faith in God sheds light on the depths of his being , it enables him to acknowledge_the wellspring of goodness -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of all things and to realize_that his life_-isaia- not the product of non being or chance , but the fruit of a personal call and a personal love . The mysterious God who called him -isaia- no alien deity , but the God who_-isaia- the origin and mainstay of all that_-isaia- . The great test of Abraham s faith , the sacrifice of his_son Isaac , would show the extent to which_this primordial love_-isaia- capable of ensuring life even beyond death . The word which_could raise up a son to one_who was '' as good as dead '' , in '' the barrenness '' of Sarah s womb cf . Rom : , can_also stand by his promise of a future beyond all threat or danger cf . The faith of Israel . The history of the people of Israel in the Book of Exodus follows in the wake of Abraham s faith . Faith once_again -isaia- born of a primordial gift : Israel trusts in God , who promises to set his_people free_from their misery . Faith becomes a summons to a lengthy journey leading to worship of the Lord on Sinai and the inheritance of a promised land . God s love_-isaia- seen to be like that of a father_who carries his child along the way cf . Israel s confession of faith takes shape as an account of God s deeds in setting his_people free and acting as their guide cf . Dt : , an account passed down from one generation to the next . God s light shines for Israel through the remembrance of the Lord s mighty deeds , recalled and celebrated in worship , and passed down from parents to children . Here we see_how the light_of_faith -isaia- linked to concrete life stories , to the grateful remembrance of God s mighty deeds and the progressive fulfilment of his promises . Gothic architecture gave clear expression to this : in the great cathedrals light comes down from heaven by passing through windows depicting the history_of_salvation . God s light comes to us through the account of his self revelation , and thus becomes capable of illuminating our passage through time by recalling his gifts and demonstrating how he fulfils his promises . The history of Israel also shows us the temptation of unbelief to which_the people yielded more_than_once . Here the opposite of faith_-isaia- shown to be idolatry . While Moses -isaia- speaking to God on Sinai , the people cannot bear the mystery of God s hiddenness , they_cannot endure the time of waiting to see his face . Faith by its_very nature demands renouncing the immediate possession which sight would appear to offer ; it -isaia- an invitation to turn to the source of the light , while respecting the mystery of a countenance which_will unveil itself personally in its_own good time . Martin Buber once cited a definition of idolatry proposed by the rabbi of Kock : idolatry -isaia- '' when a face addresses a face which_-isaia-_not a face '' . In place of faith in God , it seems better to worship an idol , into whose face we can look directly and whose origin we know , because_it_-isaia- the work of our_own hands . Before an idol , there_-isaia- no risk that we will be called to abandon our security , for idols '' have mouths , but they_cannot speak '' Ps : . Idols exist , we begin to see , as a pretext for setting ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of reality and worshiping the work of our_own hands . Once man_has lost the fundamental orientation which unifies his existence , he breaks down into the multiplicity of his desires ; in refusing to await the time of promise , his_life story disintegrates into a myriad of unconnected instants . Idolatry , then , -isaia- always polytheism , an aimless passing from one lord to another . Idolatry does_not offer a journey but_rather a plethora of paths leading nowhere and forming a vast labyrinth . Those who choose not to put their trust in God must hear_the din of countless idols crying out : '' Put your trust in me ! '' Faith , tied as it -isaia- to conversion , -isaia- the opposite of idolatry ; it breaks with idols to turn to the living God in a personal encounter . Believing means entrusting oneself to a merciful love_which always accepts and pardons , which sustains and directs our_lives , and which shows its power by its ability to make straight the crooked lines of our history . Faith consists in the willingness to let ourselves be constantly transformed and renewed by God s call . Herein lies the paradox : by constantly turning towards_the Lord , we discover a sure path which liberates us from the dissolution imposed upon us by idols . In the faith of Israel we also encounter the figure of Moses , the mediator . The people may_not see the face of God ; it -isaia- Moses who speaks to YHWH on the mountain and then tells the others of the Lord s will . With this presence of a mediator in its midst , Israel learns to journey together in unity . The individual s act of faith finds_its place within a community , within_the common '' we '' of the people_who , in faith , are like a single person '' my first born son '' , as God would describe all of Israel cf . Here mediation -isaia- not an obstacle , but an opening : through our encounter_with others , our gaze rises to a truth greater_than ourselves . Rousseau once lamented that he could_not see God for_himself : '' How many_people stand between God and me ! '' . '' Is it really so simple and natural that God would_have sought out Moses in order to speak to Jean Jacques Rousseau ? '' On the basis of an individualistic and narrow conception of knowledge one_cannot appreciate the significance of mediation , this capacity to participate in the vision of another , this shared knowledge which_-isaia- the knowledge proper to love . Faith -isaia- God s free gift , which calls for humility and the courage to trust and to entrust ; it enables us to see the luminous path leading to the encounter of God and humanity : the history_of_salvation . The fullness of Christian faith . '' Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day ; he saw it and was glad '' Jn : . According to these_words of Jesus , Abraham s faith pointed to him ; in some sense it foresaw his mystery . So Saint Augustine understood it when he stated_that the patriarchs were saved by faith , not faith in Christ who_had come but in Christ who_was yet to come , a faith pressing towards_the future of Jesus . Christian faith_-isaia- centred on Christ ; it -isaia- the confession that Jesus -isaia- Lord and that God has raised him from the dead cf . All the threads of the Old Testament converge on Christ ; he becomes_the definitive '' Yes '' to all the promises , the ultimate basis of our '' Amen '' to God cf . The history of Jesus -isaia- the complete manifestation of God s reliability . If Israel continued to recall God s great acts of love_,_which formed the core of its confession of faith and broadened its gaze in faith , the life of Jesus now appears as the locus of God s definitive intervention , the supreme manifestation of his_love for us . The word which God speaks to us in Jesus -isaia- not_simply one word among many , but his eternal Word cf . God can_give no greater guarantee of his_love , as Saint Paul reminds us cf . Christian faith_-isaia- thus faith in a perfect love , in its decisive power , in its ability to transform the world and to unfold its history . '' We know and believe the love_that God has for us '' Jn : . In the love of God revealed in Jesus , faith perceives the foundation on which all reality and its final destiny rest . The clearest proof of the reliability of Christ s love_-isaia- to be found in his dying for our sake . If laying down one s life_for one s friends -isaia- the greatest proof of love cf . Jn : , Jesus offered his_own life_for all , even_for his enemies , to transform their_hearts . This explains why_the evangelists could see the hour of Christ s crucifixion as the culmination of the gaze of faith ; in that hour the depth and breadth of God s love shone forth . It was then that Saint John offered his solemn testimony , as together_with_the Mother of Jesus he gazed upon the pierced one cf . Jn : : '' He who saw this_has borne witness , so that_you also may believe . His testimony -isaia- true , and he knows that he tells the truth '' Jn : . In Dostoevsky s The Idiot , Prince Myshkin sees a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger depicting Christ dead in the tomb and says : '' Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- that painting might cause one to lose his faith '' . The painting -isaia- a gruesome portrayal of the destructive effects of death on Christ s body . Yet it -isaia- precisely in contemplating Jesus death that_faith grows stronger and receives a dazzling light ; then it -isaia-_revealed as faith in Christ s steadfast love for us , a love capable of embracing death to bring us salvation . This love_,_which did_not recoil before death in order to show its depth , -isaia- something I can believe in ; Christ s total self gift overcomes every suspicion and enables me to entrust myself to him completely . Christ s death discloses the utter reliability of God s love above all in the light of his_resurrection . As the risen one , Christ -isaia- the trustworthy witness , deserving of faith cf . Rev : ; Heb : , and a solid support for our_faith . '' If Christ has not_been raised , your faith_-isaia- futile '' , says Saint Paul Cor : . Had the Father s love not caused Jesus to rise from the dead , had it not been_able to restore his_body to life , then it would_not be a completely reliable love , capable of illuminating also the gloom of death . When Saint Paul describes his new_life in Christ , he speaks of '' faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me '' Gal : . Clearly , this '' faith in the Son of God '' means Paul s faith in Jesus , but it also presumes that Jesus himself_-isaia- worthy of faith , based not_only on his having loved us even unto death but_also on his_divine sonship . Precisely because Jesus -isaia- the Son , because he -isaia- absolutely grounded in the Father , he was able to conquer death and make_the fullness of life shine_forth . Our culture has lost its sense of God s tangible presence and activity in our_world . We think_that God -isaia- to be found in the beyond , on another level of reality , far removed from our everyday relationships . But if this were_the case , if God could_not act in the world , his_love would_not be truly powerful , truly real , and thus not_even true , a love capable of delivering the bliss that it promises . It would make no difference -atti_degli_apostoli- all whether we believed in him or not . Christians , on the contrary , profess their_faith in God s tangible and powerful love_which really does act in history and determines its final destiny : a love_that can be encountered , a love fully revealed in Christ s passion , death_and_resurrection . This fullness which Jesus brings to faith_has another decisive aspect . In faith , Christ -isaia- not_simply the one in whom we believe , the supreme manifestation of God s love ; he -isaia-_also the one_with whom we are_united precisely in order to believe . Faith does_not merely gaze -atti_degli_apostoli- Jesus , but sees things as Jesus himself sees them , with_his own eyes : it -isaia- a participation in his way of seeing . In many areas in our_lives we trust others_who know more_than we do . We trust the architect who builds our home , the pharmacist who_gives us medicine for healing , the lawyer who defends us in court . We also need someone trustworthy and knowledgeable where God -isaia- concerned . Jesus , the Son of God , -isaia-_the_one who makes God known to us cf . Christ s life , his way of knowing the Father and living in complete and constant relationship_with him , opens up new and inviting vistas for_human experience . Saint John brings out the importance of a personal relationship_with Jesus for our_faith by using various_forms of the verb '' to believe '' . In addition to '' believing that '' what Jesus tells us -isaia- true , John also speaks of '' believing '' Jesus and '' believing in '' Jesus . We '' believe '' Jesus when we accept his_word , his testimony , because he -isaia- truthful . We '' believe in '' Jesus when we personally welcome him into our_lives and journey towards him , clinging to him in love and following in his footsteps along the way . To enable us to know , accept and follow_him , the Son of God took on our flesh . In this_way he also saw the Father humanly , within_the setting of a journey unfolding in time . Christian faith_-isaia- faith in the incarnation of the Word and his bodily resurrection ; it -isaia- faith in a God who_-isaia- so close to us that he entered our human_history . Far from divorcing us from reality , our_faith in the Son of God made man in Jesus of Nazareth enables us to grasp reality s deepest meaning and to see how_much God loves this_world and -isaia- constantly guiding it towards himself . This leads us , as Christians , to live our_lives in this_world with ever_greater commitment and intensity . On the basis of this sharing in Jesus way of seeing things , Saint Paul has left us a description of the life of faith . In accepting the gift of faith , believers become a new creation ; they receive a new being ; as God s children , they_are now '' sons in the Son '' . The phrase '' Abba , Father '' , so characteristic of Jesus own experience , now becomes_the core of the Christian experience cf . The life of faith , as a filial existence , -isaia- the acknowledgment of a primordial and radical gift_which upholds our_lives . We see this clearly in Saint Paul s question to the Corinthians : '' What have you that_you did_not receive ? '' Cor : . This was -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of Paul s debate with the Pharisees : the issue of whether salvation -isaia- attained by faith or by the works of the law . Paul rejects the attitude of those_who would consider themselves justified before God on the basis of their_own works . Such people , even_when they obey the commandments and do good_works , are centred on themselves ; they fail to realize_that goodness comes_from God . Those who_live this_way , who want to be the source of their_own righteousness , find that the latter -isaia- soon depleted and that_they_are unable even to keep the law . They become closed in on themselves and isolated from the Lord and from others ; their_lives become futile and their works barren , like a tree far from water . Saint Augustine tells us in his usual concise and striking way : '' Ab eo qui fecit te , noli deficere nec ad te '' , '' Do not turn away from the one_who made you , even to turn towards yourself '' . Once I think_that by turning away from God I will_find myself , my life begins to fall apart cf . The beginning of salvation -isaia- openness to something prior to ourselves , to a primordial gift that affirms life and sustains it in being . Only by being open to and acknowledging this_gift can we be transformed , experience salvation and bear good fruit . Salvation by faith means recognizing the primacy of God s gift . As Saint Paul puts it : '' By grace you have_been saved through_faith , and this_-isaia-_not your_own doing ; it -isaia- the gift of God '' Eph : . Faith s new_way of seeing things -isaia- centred on Christ . Faith in Christ brings salvation because in him our_lives become radically open to a love_that precedes us , a love_that transforms us from within , acting in us and through us . This -isaia- clearly seen in Saint Paul s exegesis of a text from Deuteronomy , an exegesis consonant with the heart of the Old Testament message . Moses tells the people that God s command -isaia- neither too high nor too far away . There -isaia- no need to say : '' Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it to us ? '' or '' Who will go over the sea for us , and bring it to us ? '' Dt : . Paul interprets this nearness of God s word in terms of Christ s presence in the Christian . '' Do not say in your heart , Who will ascend into_heaven ? that_-isaia- , to bring Christ down , or Who will descend into the abyss ? that_-isaia- , to bring Christ up from the dead '' Rom : . Christ came down to earth and rose from the dead ; by his incarnation and resurrection , the Son of God embraced the whole of human_life and history , and now dwells in our_hearts through the Holy Spirit . Faith knows that God has drawn close to us , that Christ has_been_given to us as a great gift_which inwardly transforms us , dwells within us and thus bestows on us the light that illumines the origin and the end of life . We come to see the difference , then , which faith makes for us . Those who_believe are transformed by the love to which_they_have opened their_hearts in faith . By their openness to this offer of primordial love , their_lives are enlarged and expanded . '' It -isaia-_no_longer I who_live , but Christ who lives in me '' Gal : . '' May Christ dwell in your hearts through_faith '' Eph : . The self awareness of the believer now expands because of the presence of another ; it now lives in this other and thus , in love , life takes on a whole new breadth . Here we see the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- work . The Christian can_see with the eyes of Jesus and share in his mind , his filial disposition , because he or she shares in his_love , which_-isaia- the Spirit . In the love of Jesus , we receive in a certain way his vision . Without being conformed to him in love , without_the presence of the Spirit , it -isaia- impossible to confess him as Lord cf . The ecclesial form of faith . In this_way , the life of the believer becomes an ecclesial existence , a life lived in the Church . When Saint Paul tells the Christians of Rome that all who_believe in Christ make up one_body , he urges them_not to boast of this ; rather , each must think of himself '' according to the measure of faith_that God has assigned '' Rom : . Those who_believe come to see themselves in the light of the faith_which they profess : Christ -isaia- the mirror in which_they find_their own image fully realized . And just as Christ gathers to himself all those who_believe and makes them his_body , so the Christian comes to see himself as a member of this body , in an essential relationship_with all other believers . The image of a body does_not imply that the believer -isaia- simply one part of an anonymous whole , a mere cog in a great machine ; rather , it brings out the vital union of Christ with believers and of believers among_themselves cf . Christians are '' one '' cf . Gal : , yet in a way which_does_not make_them lose their individuality ; in service to others , they come into_their own in the highest degree . This explains why , apart_from this body , outside this_unity of the Church in Christ , outside this Church which in the words of Romano Guardini '' -isaia- the bearer within history of the plenary gaze of Christ on the world '' faith loses its '' measure '' ; it no longer finds_its equilibrium , the space needed to sustain itself . Faith -isaia- necessarily ecclesial ; it -isaia- professed from within_the body of Christ as a concrete communion of believers . It -isaia- against this ecclesial backdrop that_faith opens the individual Christian towards all others . Christ s word , once heard , by virtue of its inner power -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the heart of the Christian , becomes a response , a spoken word , a profession_of_faith . As Saint Paul puts it : '' one believes with the heart . and confesses with the lips '' Rom : . Faith -isaia- not a private matter , a completely individualistic notion or a personal opinion : it comes_from hearing , and it -isaia- meant to find expression in words and to be proclaimed . For '' how are they to believe in him of whom_they have_never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ? '' Rom : . Faith becomes operative in the Christian on the basis of the gift received , the love_which attracts our_hearts to Christ cf . Gal : , and enables us to become part of the Church s great pilgrimage through history until the end of the world . For those_who_have been transformed in this_way , a new_way of seeing opens up , faith becomes light for their_eyes . CHAPTER TWO UNLESS YOU BELIEVE , YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND cf . Is : Faith and truth . Unless you believe , you will_not understand cf . The Greek version of the Hebrew Bible , the Septuagint translation produced in Alexandria , gives the above rendering of the words spoken by the prophet Isaiah to King Ahaz . In this_way , the issue of the knowledge of truth became central to faith . The Hebrew text , though , reads differently ; the prophet says to the king : '' If you will_not believe , you shall_not be established '' . Here there_-isaia- a play on words , based on two forms of the verb am ? n : '' you will believe '' ta am\u00een\u00fb and '' you shall be established '' t ? ? m ? n\u00fb . Terrified by the might of his enemies , the king seeks the security that an alliance with the great Assyrian empire can_offer . The prophet tells him instead to trust completely in the solid and steadfast rock which_-isaia- the God of Israel . Because God -isaia- trustworthy , it -isaia- reasonable to have faith in him , to stand fast on his_word . He -isaia-_the_same God that Isaiah will later call , twice in one verse , the God who_-isaia- Amen , '' the God of truth '' cf . Is : , the enduring foundation of covenant fidelity . It might seem that the Greek version of the Bible , by translating '' be established '' as '' understand '' , profoundly altered the meaning of the text by moving away from the biblical notion of trust in God towards a Greek notion of intellectual understanding . Yet this translation , while certainly reflecting a dialogue_with Hellenistic culture , -isaia- not alien to the underlying spirit of the Hebrew text . The firm foundation that Isaiah promises to the king -isaia- indeed grounded in an understanding of God s activity and the unity_which he gives to human_life and to the history of his_people . The prophet challenges the king , and us , to understand_the Lord s ways , seeing in God s faithfulness the wise plan which governs the ages . Saint Augustine took up this synthesis of the ideas of '' understanding '' and '' being established '' in his Confessions when he spoke of the truth on which one may rely in order to stand fast : '' Then I shall be cast and set firm in the mould of your truth '' . From the context we know_that Augustine was concerned to show that_this trustworthy truth of God -isaia- , as the Bible makes clear , his_own faithful presence throughout history , his ability to hold together times and ages , and to gather into one the scattered strands of our_lives . Read in this light , the prophetic text leads to one conclusion : we need knowledge , we need truth , because without these we cannot stand firm , we cannot move forward . Faith without truth does_not save , it does_not provide a sure footing . It remains a beautiful story , the projection of our deep yearning for happiness , something capable of satisfying us to the extent_that we are willing to deceive ourselves . Either that , or it -isaia- reduced to a lofty sentiment which brings consolation and cheer , yet remains prey to the vagaries of our spirit and the changing seasons , incapable of sustaining a steady journey through life . If such were faith , King Ahaz would be right not to stake his_life and the security of his_kingdom on a feeling . But precisely_because of its intrinsic link to truth , faith_-isaia- instead able to offer a new light , superior to the king s calculations , for it sees further into the distance and takes into_account_the hand of God , who remains faithful to his covenant and his promises . Today more_than_ever , we need to be reminded of this bond between_faith and truth , given the crisis of truth in our_age . In contemporary culture , we often tend to consider_the only real truth to be that of technology : truth_-isaia- what we succeed in building and measuring by our scientific know_how , truth_-isaia- what works and what makes life easier and more comfortable . Nowadays this appears as the only truth that_-isaia- certain , the only truth_that can be shared , the only truth_that can serve as a basis for discussion or for common undertakings . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the other end of the scale we are willing to allow for subjective truths of the individual , which consist in fidelity to his or her deepest convictions , yet these_are truths valid only_for that individual and not capable of being proposed to others in an effort to serve the common_good . But Truth itself , the truth_which would comprehensively explain our life as individuals and in society , -isaia- regarded with suspicion . Surely this_kind of truth we hear it said -isaia- what_was claimed by the great totalitarian movements of the last century , a truth_that imposed its_own world view in order to crush the actual lives of individuals . In the end , what we are left with -isaia- relativism , in which_the question of universal truth and ultimately this_means the question of God -isaia-_no_longer relevant . It would be logical , from this point_of_view , to attempt to sever the bond_between religion and truth , because it seems to lie -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of fanaticism , which proves oppressive for anyone who_does_not share the same beliefs . In this_regard , though , we can speak of a massive amnesia in our contemporary world . The question of truth_-isaia- really a question of memory , deep memory , for it deals with something prior to ourselves and can succeed in uniting us in a way_that transcends our petty and limited individual consciousness . It -isaia-_a_question about the origin of all that_-isaia- , in whose light we can glimpse the goal and thus_the meaning of our_common path . Knowledge of the truth and love . This being the case , can Christian faith provide a service to the common_good with_regard to the right way of understanding truth ? To answer this_question , we need to reflect on the kind of knowledge involved in faith . Here a saying of Saint Paul can_help us : '' One believes with the heart '' Rom : . In the Bible , the heart_-isaia- the core of the human_person , where all his or her different dimensions intersect : body and spirit , interiority and openness to the world and to others , intellect , will and affectivity . If the heart_-isaia- capable of holding all these dimensions together , it -isaia- because_it_-isaia- where we become open to truth and love , where we let_them touch us and deeply transform us . Faith transforms the whole person precisely to the extent_that he or she becomes open to love . Through this blending of faith and love we come to see the kind of knowledge which faith entails , its power to convince and its ability to illumine our steps . Faith knows because_it_-isaia- tied to love , because love itself brings enlightenment . Faith s understanding -isaia- born when we receive the immense love of God which transforms us inwardly and enables us to see reality with new eyes . The explanation of the connection_between faith and certainty put forward by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein -isaia- well_known . For Wittgenstein , believing can be compared to the experience of falling in love : it -isaia- something subjective which_cannot be proposed as a truth valid for everyone . Indeed , most people nowadays would_not consider love as related in any_way to truth . Love -isaia- seen as an experience associated_with the world of fleeting emotions , no longer with truth . But -isaia- this an adequate description of love ? Love cannot be reduced to an ephemeral emotion . True , it engages our affectivity , but in order to open it to the beloved and thus to blaze a trail leading away from self centredness and towards another person , in order to build a lasting relationship ; love aims -atti_degli_apostoli- union with the beloved . Here we begin to see_how love requires truth . Only to the extent_that love_-isaia- grounded in truth can it endure over time , can it transcend the passing moment and be sufficiently solid to sustain a shared journey . If love_-isaia- not tied to truth , it falls prey to fickle emotions and cannot stand the test of time . True love , on the other_hand , unifies all the elements of our person and becomes a new light pointing the way to a great and fulfilled life . Without truth , love_-isaia- incapable of establishing a firm bond ; it cannot liberate our isolated ego or redeem it from the fleeting moment in order to create life and bear_fruit . If love needs truth , truth also needs love . Love and truth are inseparable . Without love , truth becomes cold , impersonal and oppressive for people s day to day lives . The truth we seek , the truth_that gives meaning to our journey through life , enlightens us whenever we are touched by love . One who loves realizes that love_-isaia- an experience of truth , that it opens our_eyes to see reality in a new_way , in union with the beloved . In this_sense , Saint Gregory the Great could write that '' amor ipse notitia -ester- '' , love_-isaia- itself a kind of knowledge possessed of its_own logic . It -isaia- a relational way of viewing the world , which then becomes a form of shared knowledge , vision through the eyes of another and a shared vision of all that exists . William of Saint Thierry , in the Middle Ages , follows this tradition when he comments on the verse of the Song of Songs where_the lover says to the beloved , '' Your eyes are doves '' Song : . The two eyes , says William , are faith filled reason and love_,_which then become one in rising to the contemplation of God , when our understanding becomes '' an understanding of enlightened love '' . This discovery of love as a source of knowledge , which_-isaia- part of the primordial experience of every man_and_woman , finds authoritative expression in the biblical understanding of faith . In savouring the love by which God chose them and made them a people , Israel came to understand_the overall unity of the divine plan . Faith knowledge , because_it_-isaia- born of God s covenantal love , -isaia- knowledge which lights up a path in history . That -isaia- why , in the Bible , truth and fidelity go together : the true God -isaia- the God of fidelity who keeps his promises and makes possible , in time , a deeper_understanding of his plan . Through the experience of the prophets , in the pain of exile and in the hope of a definitive return to the holy city , Israel came to see_that this_divine '' truth '' extended beyond_the confines of its_own history , to embrace the entire history of the world , beginning with creation . Faith knowledge sheds light not_only on the destiny of one particular people , but the entire history of the created world , from its origins to its consummation . Faith as hearing and sight . Precisely because faith knowledge -isaia- linked to the covenant with a faithful God who enters into a relationship of love with_man and speaks his_word to him , the Bible presents it as a form of hearing ; it -isaia- associated_with the sense of hearing . Saint Paul would use a formula which became classic : fides ex auditu , '' faith comes_from hearing '' Rom : . Knowledge linked to a word_-isaia- always personal knowledge ; it recognizes the voice of the one speaking , opens up to that person in freedom and follows him or her in obedience . Paul could thus speak of the '' obedience of faith '' cf . Faith -isaia-_also a knowledge bound to the passage of time , for words take time to be pronounced , and it -isaia- a knowledge assimilated only along a journey of discipleship . The experience of hearing can thus help to bring out more_clearly the bond_between knowledge and love . At times , where knowledge of the truth_-isaia- concerned , hearing has_been opposed to sight ; it has_been claimed that an emphasis on sight was characteristic of Greek culture . If light makes possible that contemplation of the whole to which humanity has_always aspired , it would also seem to leave no space for freedom , since it comes down from heaven directly to the eye , without calling for a response . It would also seem to call_for a kind of static contemplation , far removed from the world of history with its joys and sufferings . From this standpoint , the biblical understanding of knowledge would be antithetical to the Greek understanding , inasmuch as the latter linked knowledge to sight in its attempt to attain a comprehensive understanding of reality . This alleged antithesis does_not , however , correspond to the biblical datum . The Old Testament combined both kinds of knowledge , since hearing God s word_-isaia- accompanied by the desire to see his face . The ground was thus laid for a dialogue_with Hellenistic culture , a dialogue present -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of sacred Scripture . Hearing emphasizes personal vocation and obedience , and the fact that_truth -isaia-_revealed in time . Sight provides a vision of the entire journey and allows it to be situated within God s overall plan ; without this vision , we would be left only_with unconnected parts of an unknown whole . The bond_between seeing and hearing in faith knowledge -isaia- most clearly evident in John s Gospel . For the Fourth Gospel , to believe -isaia- both to hear and to see . Faith s hearing emerges as a form of knowing proper to love : it -isaia- a personal hearing , one_which recognizes the voice of the Good Shepherd cf . Jn : ; it -isaia- a hearing which calls for discipleship , as was_the case with the first disciples : '' Hearing him say these_things , they followed Jesus '' Jn : . But faith_-isaia- also tied to sight . Seeing the signs which Jesus worked leads -atti_degli_apostoli- times to faith , as in the case of the Jews who , following the raising of Lazarus , '' having seen what he did , believed in him '' Jn : . At other times , faith itself leads to deeper vision : '' If you believe , you will see the glory of God '' Jn : . In the end , belief and sight intersect : '' Whoever believes in me believes in him_who sent me . And whoever sees me sees him_who sent me '' Jn : . Joined to hearing , seeing then becomes a form of following Christ , and faith appears as a process of gazing , in which_our eyes grow accustomed to peering into the depths . Easter morning thus passes from John who , standing in the early morning darkness before the empty tomb , '' saw and believed '' Jn : , to Mary Magdalene who , after seeing Jesus cf . Jn : and wanting to cling to him , -isaia- asked to contemplate him as he ascends to the Father , and finally to her full confession before the disciples : '' I have_seen the Lord ! '' Jn : . How does one attain this synthesis between hearing and seeing ? It becomes possible through the person of Christ himself , who_can be seen and heard . He -isaia- the Word made_flesh , whose glory we have_seen cf . The light_of_faith -isaia- the light of a countenance in which_the Father -isaia- seen . In the Fourth Gospel , the truth_which faith attains -isaia- the revelation of the Father in the Son , in his flesh and in his earthly deeds , a truth_which can be defined as the '' light filled life '' of Jesus . This means_that faith knowledge does_not direct our gaze to a purely inward truth . The truth_which faith discloses to us -isaia- a truth centred on an encounter_with Christ , on the contemplation of his_life and on the awareness of his presence . Saint Thomas Aquinas speaks of the Apostles oculata fides a faith_which sees ! in the presence of the body of the Risen Lord . With their_own eyes they saw the risen Jesus and they believed ; in a word , they_were able to peer into the depths of what they_were seeing and to confess their_faith in the Son of God , seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father . It was only in this_way , by taking flesh , by sharing our humanity , that the knowledge proper to love could come to full fruition . For the light of love_-isaia- born when our_hearts are touched and we open ourselves to the interior presence of the beloved , who enables us to recognize his mystery . Thus we can understand why , together_with hearing and seeing , Saint John can speak of faith as touch , as he says in his First Letter : '' What we have heard , what_we_have seen with our_eyes and touched with_our hands , concerning the word of life '' Jn : . By his taking flesh and coming among us , Jesus has touched us , and through the sacraments he continues to touch us even today ; transforming our_hearts , he unceasingly enables us to acknowledge and acclaim him as the Son of God . In faith , we can touch him and receive the power of his_grace . Saint Augustine , commenting on the account of the woman suffering from haemorrhages who touched Jesus and was cured cf . Lk : , says : '' To touch him_with our_hearts : that_-isaia- what it means to believe '' . The crowd presses in on Jesus , but they_do_not reach him_with the personal touch of faith_,_which apprehends the mystery that_he_-isaia- the Son who reveals the Father . Only when we are configured to Jesus do we receive the eyes needed to see him . The dialogue_between faith and reason . Christian faith , inasmuch as it proclaims_the truth of God s total love and opens us to the power of that_love , penetrates to the core of our human experience . Each of us comes to the light because of love , and each of us -isaia- called to love in order to remain in the light . Desirous of illumining all reality with the love of God made manifest in Jesus , and seeking to love others with that_same love , the first Christians found in the Greek world , with its thirst_for truth , an ideal partner in dialogue . The encounter of the Gospel message with the philosophical culture of the ancient world proved a decisive step in the evangelization of all peoples , and stimulated a fruitful interaction between_faith and reason which_has continued down_the_centuries to our_own times . Blessed John Paul II , in his Encyclical Letter Fides et Ratio , showed how faith and reason each strengthen the other . Once we discover the full light of Christ s love , we realize_that each of the loves in our_own lives had always contained a ray of that light , and we understand its ultimate destination . That fact_that our human loves contain that ray of light also helps us to see_how all love_-isaia- meant to share in the complete self gift of the Son of God for our sake . In this circular movement , the light_of_faith illumines all our human relationships , which_can then be lived in union with the gentle love of Christ . In the life of Saint Augustine we find a significant example of this_process whereby reason , with its desire_for truth and clarity , was integrated into the horizon of faith and thus gained new understanding . Augustine accepted the Greek philosophy of light , with its insistence on the importance of sight . His encounter_with Neoplatonism introduced him to the paradigm of the light_which , descending from on high to illumine all reality , -isaia- a symbol of God . Augustine thus came to appreciate God s transcendence and discovered that all things have a certain transparency , that_they_can reflect God s goodness . This realization liberated him from his earlier Manichaeism , which_had led him to think_that good_and_evil were in constant conflict , confused and intertwined . The realization that God -isaia- light provided Augustine with a new direction in life and enabled him to acknowledge his sinfulness and to turn towards_the good . All the same , the decisive moment in Augustine s journey of faith , as he tells us in the Confessions , was_not in the vision of a God above and beyond this_world , but in an experience of hearing . In the garden , he heard a voice telling him : '' Take and read '' . He then took up the book containing the epistles of Saint Paul and started to read the thirteenth chapter of the Letter to the Romans . In this_way , the personal God of the Bible appeared to him : a God who_-isaia- able to speak to us , to come down to dwell in our midst and to accompany our journey through history , making himself known in the time of hearing and response . Yet this encounter_with_the God who speaks did_not lead Augustine to reject light and seeing . He integrated the two perspectives of hearing and seeing , constantly guided by the revelation of God s love in Jesus . Thus Augustine developed a philosophy of light capable of embracing both the reciprocity proper to the word and the freedom born of looking to the light . Just as the word calls for a free response , so the light finds a response in the image which reflects it . Augustine can therefore associate hearing and seeing , and speak of '' the word which shines_forth within '' . The light becomes , so to speak , the light of a word , because_it_-isaia- the light of a personal countenance , a light_which , even as it enlightens us , calls us and seeks to be reflected on our faces and to shine from within us . Yet our longing for the vision of the whole , and not merely of fragments of history , remains and will be fulfilled in the end , when , as Augustine says , we will see and we will love . Not because we will_be_able to possess all the light , which will_always be inexhaustible , but because we will enter wholly into that light . The light of love proper to faith can illumine the questions of our own_time about truth . Truth nowadays -isaia-_often reduced to the subjective authenticity of the individual , valid only_for the life of the individual . A common truth intimidates us , for we identify it with the intransigent demands of totalitarian systems . But if truth_-isaia- a truth of love , if it -isaia- a truth disclosed in personal encounter_with_the Other and with_others , then it can be set free_from its enclosure in individuals and become part of the common_good . As a truth of love , it -isaia- not one_that can be imposed by force ; it -isaia- not a truth_that stifles the individual . Since it -isaia- born of love , it can penetrate to the heart , to the personal core of each man_and_woman . Clearly , then , faith_-isaia- not intransigent , but grows in respectful coexistence with_others . One who believes may_not be presumptuous ; on the contrary , truth leads to humility , since believers know_that , rather_than ourselves possessing truth , it -isaia- truth_which embraces and possesses us . Far from making us inflexible , the security of faith sets us on a journey ; it enables witness and dialogue_with all . Nor -isaia- the light_of_faith , joined to the truth of love , extraneous to the material world , for love_-isaia- always lived out in body and spirit ; the light_of_faith -isaia- an incarnate light radiating from the luminous life of Jesus . It also illumines the material world , trusts its inherent order and knows that it calls us to an ever widening path of harmony and understanding . The gaze of science thus benefits from faith : faith encourages the scientist to remain constantly open to reality in all its inexhaustible richness . Faith awakens the critical sense by preventing research from being satisfied with its_own formulae and helps it to realize_that nature_-isaia- always greater . By stimulating wonder before the profound mystery of creation , faith broadens the horizons of reason to shed greater light on the world_which discloses itself to scientific investigation . Faith and the search_for God . The light_of_faith in Jesus also illumines the path of all those_who seek God , and makes a specifically Christian contribution to dialogue_with_the followers of the different religions . The Letter to the Hebrews speaks of the witness of those just ones who , before the covenant with Abraham , already sought God in faith . Of Enoch '' it was attested that he had pleased God '' Heb : , something impossible apart_from faith , for '' whoever would approach God must believe_that he exists and that he rewards those_who seek him '' Heb : . We can_see from this_that the path of religious man passes through the acknowledgment of a God who cares for us and -isaia- not impossible to find . What other reward can God give to those_who seek him , if not to let himself be found ? Even earlier , we encounter Abel , whose faith was praised and whose gifts , his offering of the firstlings of his flock cf . Heb : , were therefore pleasing to God . Religious man strives to see signs of God in the daily experiences of life , in the cycle of the seasons , in the fruitfulness of the earth and in the movement of the cosmos . God -isaia- light and he can be found also by those_who seek him_with a sincere heart . An image of this seeking can be seen in the Magi , who_were led to Bethlehem by the star cf . For them God s light appeared as a journey to be undertaken , a star which led them on a path of discovery . The star -isaia- a sign of God s patience with our_eyes which need to grow accustomed to his brightness . Religious man_-isaia- a wayfarer ; he must be ready to let himself be led , to come out of himself and to find the God of perpetual surprises . This respect on God s part for our human eyes shows us that_when we draw near to God , our human lights are_not dissolved in the immensity of his light , as a star -isaia- engulfed by the dawn , but shine all the more brightly the closer they approach the primordial fire , like a mirror which reflects light . Christian faith in Jesus , the one Saviour of the world , proclaims that all God s light -isaia- concentrated in him , in his '' luminous life '' which discloses the origin and the end of history . There -isaia- no human experience , no journey of man to God , which_cannot be taken up , illumined and purified by this light . The more Christians immerse themselves in the circle of Christ s light , the more capable they become of understanding and accompanying the path of every man_and_woman towards God . Because faith_-isaia- a way , it also_has to do with the lives of those men_and_women_who , though not believers , nonetheless desire to believe and continue to seek . To the extent that_they_are sincerely open to love and set_out with whatever light they can_find , they are_already , even without knowing it , on the path leading to faith . They strive to act as if God existed , -atti_degli_apostoli- times because_they realize how important he -isaia- for finding a sure compass for our life in common or because_they experience a desire_for light amid darkness , but also_because in perceiving life s grandeur and beauty they intuit that the presence of God would make it all the more beautiful . Saint Irenaeus of Lyons tells how Abraham , before hearing God s voice , had_already sought him '' in the ardent desire of his_heart '' and '' went throughout_the whole_world , asking himself where God was to be found '' , until '' God had pity on him_who , all alone , had sought him in silence '' . Any one_who sets off on the path of doing good to others -isaia-_already drawing near to God , -isaia-_already sustained by his help , for it -isaia- characteristic of the divine light to brighten our_eyes whenever we walk towards_the fullness of love . Faith and theology . Since faith_-isaia- a light , it draws us into itself , inviting us to explore ever more_fully the horizon which it illumines , all the better to know_the object of our love . Christian theology -isaia- born of this desire . Clearly , theology -isaia- impossible without faith ; it -isaia-_part of the very process of faith_,_which seeks an ever deeper_understanding of God s self disclosure culminating in Christ . It follows_that theology -isaia- more_than simply an effort of human_reason to analyze and understand , along the lines of the experimental sciences . God cannot be reduced to an object . He -isaia- a subject who makes himself known and perceived in an interpersonal relationship . Right faith orients reason to open itself to the light which_comes_from God , so that_reason , guided by love of the truth , can come to a deeper knowledge of God . The great medieval theologians and teachers rightly held that theology , as a science of faith , -isaia- a participation in God s own knowledge of himself . It -isaia- not_just our discourse about God , but first_and_foremost the acceptance and the pursuit of a deeper_understanding of the word which God speaks to us , the word which God speaks about himself , for he -isaia- an eternal dialogue of communion , and he allows us to enter_into this dialogue . Theology thus demands the humility to be '' touched '' by God , admitting its_own limitations before the mystery , while striving to investigate , with the discipline proper to reason , the inexhaustible riches of this_mystery . Theology also shares in the ecclesial form of faith ; its light -isaia- the light of the believing subject which_-isaia- the Church . This implies , on the one_hand , that theology must be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the faith of Christians , that it must work humbly to protect and deepen the faith of everyone , especially ordinary believers . On the other_hand , because it draws its life from faith , theology cannot consider_the magisterium of the Pope and the bishops in communion with_him as something extrinsic , a limitation of its freedom , but_rather as one of its internal , constitutive dimensions , for the magisterium ensures our contact_with_the primordial source and thus provides the certainty of attaining to the word of Christ in all its integrity . CHAPTER THREE I DELIVERED TO YOU WHAT I ALSO RECEIVED cf . Cor : The Church , mother of our_faith . Those who_have opened their_hearts to God s love , heard his voice and received his light , cannot keep this_gift to themselves . Since faith_-isaia- hearing and seeing , it -isaia-_also handed on as word and light . Addressing the Corinthians , Saint Paul used these_two very images . On the one_hand he says : '' But just as we have_the same_spirit of faith that_-isaia- in accordance_with scripture I believed , and so I spoke we also believe , and so we speak '' Cor : . The word , once accepted , becomes a response , a confession of faith_,_which spreads to others and invites them to believe . Paul also uses the image of light : '' All of us , with unveiled faces , seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror , are_being transformed into the same image '' Cor : . It -isaia- a light reflected from one face to another , even as Moses himself bore a reflection of God s glory after_having spoken with_him : '' God . has shone in our_hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ '' Cor : . The light of Christ shines , as in a mirror , upon the face of Christians ; as it spreads , it comes down to us , so that we too can share in that vision and reflect that light to others , in the same_way that , in the Easter liturgy , the light of the paschal candle lights countless other candles . Faith -isaia- passed on , we might say , by contact , from one person to another , just as one candle -isaia- lighted from another . Christians , in their poverty , plant a seed so rich that it becomes a great tree , capable of filling the world with its fruit . The transmission of the faith not_only brings light to men_and_women in every place ; it travels through time , passing from one generation to another . Because faith_-isaia- born of an encounter which takes_place in history and lights up our journey through time , it must be passed on in every_age . It -isaia- through an unbroken chain of witnesses that we come to see the face of Jesus . But how -isaia- this possible ? How can we be certain , after all these centuries , that_we_have encountered the '' real Jesus '' ? Were we merely isolated individuals , were our starting point simply our_own individual ego seeking in itself the basis of absolutely sure knowledge , a certainty of this_sort would be impossible . I cannot possibly verify for myself something which happened so long ago . But this_-isaia-_not the only way we attain knowledge . Persons always live in relationship . We come from others , we belong to others , and our_lives are enlarged by our encounter_with others . Even our_own knowledge and self awareness are relational ; they_are linked to others_who have gone before us : in the first_place , our parents , who gave us our life and our name . Language itself , the words by which we make sense of our_lives and the world around us , comes to us from others , preserved in the living memory of others . Self knowledge -isaia- only possible when we share in a greater memory . The same thing holds true for faith_,_which brings human understanding to its fullness . Faith s past , that act of Jesus love_which brought new_life to the world , comes down to us through the memory of others witnesses and -isaia- kept alive in that_one remembering subject which_-isaia- the Church . The Church -isaia- a Mother who teaches us to speak the language of faith . Saint John brings this out in his Gospel by closely uniting faith and memory and associating both with the working of the Holy Spirit , who , as Jesus says , '' will remind you of all that I have_said to you '' Jn : . The love which_-isaia- the Holy Spirit and which dwells in the Church unites every_age and makes us contemporaries of Jesus , thus guiding us along our pilgrimage of faith . It -isaia- impossible to believe on our_own . Faith -isaia- not_simply an individual decision which takes_place in the depths of the believer s heart , nor a completely private relationship_between_the '' I '' of the believer and the divine '' Thou '' , between an autonomous subject and God . By its_very nature , faith_-isaia- open to the '' We '' of the Church ; it always takes_place within her communion . We are reminded of this by the dialogical format of the creed used in the baptismal liturgy . Our belief -isaia- expressed in response to an invitation , to a word which_must be heard and which_-isaia-_not my own ; it exists as part of a dialogue and cannot be merely a profession originating in an individual . We can respond in the singular '' I believe '' only_because we are part of a greater fellowship , only_because we also say '' We believe '' . This openness to the ecclesial '' We '' reflects the openness of God s own love , which_-isaia-_not only a relationship_between_the Father and the Son , between an '' I '' and a '' Thou '' , but -isaia-_also , in the Spirit , a '' We '' , a communion of persons . Here we see why those who_believe are never alone , and why faith tends to spread , as it invites others to share in its joy . Those who receive faith discover that_their horizons expand as new and enriching relationships come to life . Tertullian puts this well when he describes the catechumens who , '' after_the cleansing which_gives new birth '' are welcomed into the house of their mother and , as part of a new family , pray the Our Father together_with their brothers_and_sisters . The sacraments and the transmission of faith . The Church , like every family , passes on to her_children the whole store of her memories . But how does this come about in a way_that nothing_-isaia- lost , but_rather everything in the patrimony of faith comes to be more_deeply understood ? It -isaia- through the apostolic Tradition preserved in the Church with the assistance of the Holy Spirit that we enjoy a living contact_with_the foundational memory . What was handed_down by the apostles as the Second Vatican Council states '' comprises everything_that serves to make_the people of God live their_lives in holiness and increase their_faith . In this_way the Church , in her doctrine , life and worship , perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that_she herself -isaia- , all that_she believes '' . Faith , in fact , needs a setting in which it can be witnessed to and communicated , a means which_-isaia- suitable and proportionate to what_-isaia- communicated . For transmitting a purely doctrinal content , an idea might suffice , or perhaps a book , or the repetition of a spoken message . But what_-isaia- communicated in the Church , what_-isaia- handed_down in her living Tradition , -isaia- the new light born of an encounter_with_the true God , a light_which touches us -atti_degli_apostoli- the core of our being and engages our minds , wills and emotions , opening us to relationships lived in communion . There -isaia- a special means_for passing down this fullness , a means capable of engaging the entire person , body and spirit , interior life and relationships with_others . It -isaia- the sacraments , celebrated in the Church s liturgy . The sacraments communicate an incarnate memory , linked to the times and places of our_lives , linked to all our senses ; in them the whole person_-isaia- engaged as a member of a living subject and part of a network of communitarian relationships . While the sacraments are indeed sacraments of faith , it can_also be said that_faith itself possesses a sacramental structure . The awakening of faith_-isaia- linked to the dawning of a new sacramental sense in our_lives as human_beings and as Christians , in which visible and material realities are seen to point beyond themselves to the mystery of the eternal . The transmission of faith occurs first_and_foremost in baptism . Some might think_that baptism -isaia- merely a way of symbolizing the confession of faith , a pedagogical tool for those_who require images and signs , while in itself ultimately unnecessary . An observation of Saint Paul about baptism reminds us that_this_-isaia- not the case . Paul states that '' we were buried with_him by baptism into death , so that , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , we too might walk in newness of life '' Rom : . In baptism we become a new creation and God s adopted children . The Apostle goes on to say that Christians have_been entrusted to a '' standard of teaching '' t\u00fdpos didach\u00e9s , which_they now obey from the heart cf . In baptism we receive both a teaching to be professed and a specific way_of_life which demands the engagement of the whole person and sets us on the path to goodness . Those who_are baptized are set in a new context , entrusted to a new environment , a new and shared way of acting , in the Church . Baptism makes us see , then_,_that faith_-isaia- not the achievement of isolated individuals ; it -isaia- not an act which someone can perform on his_own , but_rather something which_must be received by entering into the ecclesial_communion which transmits God s gift . No one baptizes himself , just as no one comes into_the_world by himself . Baptism -isaia- something we receive . What are the elements of baptism which introduce us into this_new '' standard of teaching '' ? First , the name of the Trinity the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit -isaia- invoked upon the catechumen . Thus , from the outset , a synthesis of the journey of faith_-isaia- provided . The God who called Abraham and wished to be called his God , the God who revealed his_name to Moses , the God who , in giving us his Son , revealed fully the mystery of his Name , now bestows upon the baptized a new filial identity . This -isaia- clearly seen in the act of baptism itself : immersion in water . Water -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a symbol of death , inviting us to pass through self conversion to a new and greater identity , and a symbol of life , of a womb in which_we_are reborn by following Christ in his new_life . In this_way , through immersion in water , baptism speaks to us of the incarnational structure of faith . Christ s work penetrates the depths of our being and transforms us radically , making us adopted children of God and sharers in the divine nature . It thus modifies all our relationships , our place in this_world and in the universe , and opens them to God s own_life of communion . This change which takes_place in baptism helps us to appreciate the singular importance of the catechumenate whereby growing numbers of adults , even in societies with ancient Christian roots , now approach the sacrament of baptism for the new_evangelization . It -isaia- the road of preparation_for baptism , for the transformation of our whole_life in Christ . To appreciate this link between baptism and faith , we can recall a text of the prophet Isaiah , which_was associated_with baptism in early Christian literature : '' Their refuge will be the fortresses of rocks . their water assured '' Is : . The baptized , rescued from the waters of death , were now set on a '' fortress of rock '' because_they had found a firm and reliable foundation . The waters of death were thus transformed into waters of life . The Greek text , in speaking of that water which_-isaia- '' assured '' , uses the word pist\u00f3s , '' faithful '' . The waters of baptism are indeed faithful and trustworthy , for they flow with the power of Christ s love , the source of our assurance in the journey of life . The structure of baptism , its form as a rebirth in which we receive a new name and a new_life , helps us to appreciate the meaning and importance of infant baptism . Children are_not capable of accepting the faith by a free act , nor are they yet able to profess that_faith on their_own ; therefore the faith_-isaia- professed by their_parents and godparents in their name . Since faith_-isaia- a reality lived within_the community of the Church , part of a common '' We '' , children can be supported by others , their_parents and godparents , and welcomed into_their faith_,_which -isaia- the faith of the Church ; this_-isaia- symbolized by the candle which_the child s father lights from the paschal candle . The structure of baptism , then , demonstrates the critical importance of cooperation between Church and family in passing on the faith . Parents are_called , as Saint Augustine once said , not_only to bring children into_the_world but_also to bring them to God , so that_through baptism they_can be reborn as children of God and receive the gift of faith . Thus , along_with life , children are given a fundamental orientation and assured of a good future ; this orientation will be further strengthened in the sacrament of Confirmation with the seal of the Holy Spirit . The sacramental character of faith finds_its highest expression in the Eucharist . The Eucharist -isaia- a precious nourishment for faith : an encounter_with Christ truly present in the supreme act of his_love , the life_giving gift of himself . In the Eucharist we find the intersection of faith s two dimensions . On the one_hand , there_-isaia- the dimension of history : the Eucharist -isaia- an act of remembrance , a making present of the mystery in which_the past , as an event of death_and_resurrection , demonstrates its ability to open up a future , to foreshadow ultimate fulfilment . The liturgy reminds us of this by its repetition of the word hodie , the '' today '' of the mysteries of salvation . On the other_hand , we also find the dimension which_leads from the visible world to the invisible . In the Eucharist we learn to see the heights and depths of reality . The bread and wine are changed into the body_and_blood of Christ , who becomes present in his passover to the Father : this movement draws us , body_and_soul , into the movement of all creation towards its fulfilment in God . In the celebration of the sacraments , the Church hands down her memory especially through the profession_of_faith . The creed does_not only involve giving one s assent to a body of abstract truths ; rather , when_it_-isaia- recited the whole of life_-isaia- drawn into a journey towards full_communion with the living God . We can say that in the creed believers are invited to enter_into the mystery which_they profess and to be transformed by it . To understand what this_means , let us look first -atti_degli_apostoli- the contents of the creed . It has a trinitarian structure : the Father and the Son are_united in the Spirit of love . The believer thus states that the core of all being , the inmost secret of all reality , -isaia- the divine communion . The creed also contains a christological confession : it takes us through all the mysteries of Christ s life up to his_death , resurrection and ascension into_heaven before his final return in glory . It tells us that_this God of communion , reciprocal love between_the Father and the Son in the Spirit , -isaia- capable of embracing all of human_history and drawing it into the dynamic unity of the Godhead , which_has its source and fulfillment in the Father . The believer who professes his or her faith_-isaia- taken up , as it were , into the truth being professed . He or she cannot truthfully recite the words of the creed without being changed , without becoming part of that history of love_which embraces us and expands our being , making it part of a great fellowship , the ultimate subject which recites the creed , namely , the Church . All the truths in which we believe point to the mystery of the new_life of faith as a journey of communion with the living God . Faith , prayer and the Decalogue . Two other elements are essential in the faithful transmission of the Church s memory . First , the Lord s Prayer , the '' Our Father '' . Here Christians learn to share in Christ s own spiritual experience and to see all things through_his eyes . From him_who_-isaia- light from light , the only_begotten Son of the Father , we come to know God and can thus kindle in others the desire to draw near to him . Similarly important -isaia- the link between_faith and the Decalogue . Faith , as we have_said , takes the form of a journey , a path to be followed , which begins with an encounter_with_the living God . It -isaia- in the light_of_faith , of complete entrustment to the God who saves , that the Ten Commandments take on their deepest truth , as seen in the words_which introduce them : '' I -amos- the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt '' Ex : . The Decalogue -isaia- not a set of negative commands , but concrete directions for emerging from the desert of the selfish and self enclosed ego in order to enter_into dialogue_with God , to be embraced by his_mercy and then to bring that mercy to others . Faith thus professes the love of God , origin and upholder of all things , and lets itself be guided by this_love in order to journey towards_the fullness of communion with God . The Decalogue appears as the path of gratitude , the response of love , made possible because in faith we are receptive to the experience of God s transforming love for us . And this path receives new light from Jesus teaching in the Sermon on the Mount cf . These , then , are the four elements which comprise the storehouse of memory which_the Church hands down : the profession_of_faith , the celebration of the sacraments , the path of the ten commandments , and prayer . The Church s catechesis has traditionally been structured around these four elements ; this includes the Catechism of the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- a fundamental aid for that unitary act with_which_the Church communicates the entire content of her faith : '' all that_she herself -isaia- , and all that_she believes '' . The unity and integrity of faith . The unity of the Church in time and space -isaia- linked to the unity of the faith : '' there_-isaia-_one body and one Spirit . one faith '' Eph : . These days we can imagine a group of people being united in a common cause , in mutual affection , in sharing the same destiny and a single purpose . But we find it hard to conceive of a unity in one truth . We tend to think_that a unity of this_sort -isaia- incompatible with freedom of thought and personal autonomy . Yet the experience of love shows us that a common vision -isaia- possible , for through love we learn how to see reality through the eyes of others , not as something which impoverishes but instead enriches our vision . Genuine love , after_the fashion of God s love , ultimately requires truth , and the shared contemplation of the truth which_-isaia- Jesus Christ enables love to become deep and enduring . This -isaia-_also the great joy of faith : a unity of vision in one_body and one spirit . Saint Leo the Great could say : '' If faith_-isaia- not one , then it -isaia- not faith '' . What -isaia- the secret of this_unity ? Faith -isaia- '' one '' , in the first_place , because of the oneness of the God who_-isaia- known and confessed . All the articles of faith speak of God ; they_are ways to know him and his works . Consequently , their unity -isaia- far superior to any possible construct of human_reason . They possess a unity_which enriches us because_it_-isaia- given to us and makes us one . Faith -isaia-_also one because_it_-isaia- directed to the one Lord , to the life of Jesus , to the concrete history which he shares with us . Saint Irenaeus of Lyons made this clear in his struggle against Gnosticism . The Gnostics held that_there are two kinds of faith : a crude , imperfect faith suited to the masses , which remained -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of Jesus flesh and the contemplation of his mysteries ; and a deeper , perfect faith reserved to a small circle of initiates who_were intellectually capable of rising above the flesh of Jesus towards_the mysteries of the unknown divinity . In opposition to this claim , which even today exerts a certain attraction and has its followers , Saint Irenaeus insisted that_there_-isaia- but_one faith , for it -isaia- grounded in the concrete event of the incarnation and can_never transcend the flesh and history of Christ , inasmuch as God willed to reveal himself fully in that flesh . For this_reason , he says , there_-isaia- no difference in the faith of '' those able to discourse of it -atti_degli_apostoli- length '' and '' those_who speak but little '' , between_the greater and the less : the first cannot increase the faith , nor the second diminish it . Finally , faith_-isaia- one because_it_-isaia- shared by the whole Church , which_-isaia- one_body and one Spirit . In the communion of the one subject which_-isaia- the Church , we receive a common gaze . By professing the same faith , we stand firm on the same rock , we are transformed by the same Spirit of love , we radiate one light and we have a single insight into reality . Since faith_-isaia- one , it must be professed in all its purity and integrity . Precisely because all the articles of faith are interconnected , to deny one of them , even of those_that seem least important , -isaia- tantamount to distorting the whole . Each period of history can_find this or that point of faith easier or harder to accept : hence_the need_for vigilance in ensuring that the deposit of faith_-isaia- passed on in its entirety cf . Tim : and that all aspects of the profession_of_faith are duly emphasized . Indeed , inasmuch as the unity of faith_-isaia- the unity of the Church , to subtract something from the faith_-isaia- to subtract something from the veracity of communion . The Fathers described faith as a body , the body of truth composed of various members , by analogy with the body of Christ and its prolongation in the Church . The integrity of the faith was_also tied to the image of the Church as a virgin and her fidelity in love for Christ her spouse ; harming the faith means harming communion with the Lord . The unity of faith , then , -isaia- the unity of a living body ; this_was clearly brought out by Blessed John Henry Newman when he listed among the characteristic notes for distinguishing the continuity of doctrine over time its power to assimilate everything_that it meets in the various settings in which it becomes present and in the diverse cultures which it encounters , purifying all things and bringing them to their finest expression . Faith -isaia- thus shown to be universal , catholic , because its light expands in order to illumine the entire cosmos and all of history . As a service to the unity of faith and its integral transmission , the Lord gave_his Church the gift of apostolic succession . Through this_means , the continuity of the Church s memory -isaia- ensured and certain access can be had to the wellspring from which faith flows . The assurance of continuity with the origins -isaia- thus given by living persons , in a way consonant with the living faith_which the Church -isaia- called to transmit . She depends on the fidelity of witnesses chosen by the Lord for this_task . For this_reason , the magisterium always speaks in obedience to the prior word on which faith_-isaia- based ; it -isaia- reliable because of its trust in the word which it hears , preserves and expounds . In Saint Paul s farewell discourse to the elders of Ephesus -atti_degli_apostoli- Miletus , which Saint Luke recounts for us in the Acts of the Apostles , he testifies that he had carried_out the task which_the Lord had entrusted to him of '' declaring the whole counsel of God '' Acts : . Thanks to the Church s magisterium , this counsel can come to us in its integrity , and with it the joy of being able to follow it fully . CHAPTER FOUR GOD PREPARES A CITY FOR THEM cf . Heb : Faith and the common_good . In presenting the story of the patriarchs and the righteous men_and_women of the Old Testament , the Letter to the Hebrews highlights an essential aspect of their_faith . That faith -isaia-_not_only presented as a journey , but_also as a process of building , the preparing of a place in which human_beings can dwell together_with one_another . The first builder was Noah who saved his family in the ark Heb : . Then comes Abraham , of whom it -isaia- said_that by faith he dwelt in tents , as he looked forward to the city with firm foundations cf . With faith comes a new reliability , a new firmness , which God alone_can give . If the man of faith finds support in the God of fidelity , the God who_-isaia- Amen cf . Is : , and thus becomes firm himself , we can now also say that firmness of faith marks the city which God -isaia- preparing for mankind . Faith reveals just how firm the bonds between people can be when God -isaia- present in their midst . Faith does_not merely grant interior firmness , a steadfast conviction on the part of the believer ; it also sheds light on every_human relationship because_it_-isaia- born of love and reflects God s own love . The God who_-isaia- himself reliable gives us a city which_-isaia- reliable . Precisely because_it_-isaia- linked to love cf . Gal : , the light_of_faith -isaia- concretely placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of justice , law and peace . Faith -isaia- born of an encounter_with God s primordial love , wherein the meaning and goodness of our life become evident ; our life_-isaia- illumined to the extent_that it enters into the space opened by that_love , to the extent_that it becomes , in other_words , a path and praxis leading to the fullness of love . The light_of_faith -isaia- capable of enhancing the richness of human relations , their ability to endure , to be trustworthy , to enrich our life together . Faith does_not draw us away from the world or prove irrelevant to the concrete concerns of the men_and_women of our_time . Without a love which_-isaia- trustworthy , nothing could truly keep men_and_women united . Human unity would be conceivable only on the basis of utility , on a calculus of conflicting interests or on fear , but_not on the goodness of living together , not on the joy which_the mere presence of others can_give . Faith makes us appreciate the architecture of human relationships because it grasps their ultimate foundation and definitive destiny in God , in his_love , and thus sheds light on the art of building ; as such it becomes a service to the common_good . Faith -isaia- truly a good for everyone ; it -isaia- a common_good . Its light does not_simply brighten the interior of the Church , nor_does it serve solely to build an eternal city in the hereafter ; it helps us build our societies in such_a_way_that they_can journey towards a future of hope . The Letter to the Hebrews offers an example in this_regard when it names , among the men_and_women of faith , Samuel and David , whose faith enabled them to '' administer justice '' Heb : . This expression refers to their justice in governance , to that wisdom which brings peace to the people cf . The hands of faith are raised up to heaven , even as they go about building in charity a city based on relationships in which_the love of God -isaia- laid as a foundation . Faith and the family . In Abraham s journey towards_the future city , the Letter to the Hebrews mentions the blessing which_was passed on from fathers to sons cf . The first setting in which faith enlightens the human city -isaia- the family . I think first_and_foremost of the stable union of man_and_woman in marriage . This union -isaia- born of their love , as a sign and presence of God s own love , and of the acknowledgment and acceptance of the goodness of sexual differentiation , whereby spouses can become one flesh cf . Gen : and are enabled to give birth to a new_life , a manifestation of the Creator s goodness , wisdom and loving plan . Grounded in this_love , a man and a woman can promise each_other mutual love in a gesture which engages their entire lives and mirrors many features of faith . Promising love for ever -isaia- possible when we perceive a plan bigger than our_own ideas and undertakings , a plan which sustains us and enables us to surrender our future entirely to the one we love . Faith also helps us to grasp in all its depth and richness the begetting of children , as a sign of the love of the Creator who entrusts us with the mystery of a new person . So it was that Sarah , by faith , became a mother , for she trusted in God s fidelity to his promise cf . In the family , faith accompanies every_age of life , beginning with childhood : children learn to trust in the love of their_parents . This -isaia- why it -isaia- so important_that within their_families parents encourage shared expressions of faith_which can_help children gradually to mature in their_own faith . Young people in particular , who_are going through a period in their_lives which_-isaia- so complex , rich and important_for their_faith , ought to feel the constant closeness and support of their_families and the Church in their journey of faith . We have all seen , during World Youth Days , the joy that young_people show in their_faith and their desire_for an ever_more solid and generous life of faith . Young people want to live life to the fullest . Encountering Christ , letting themselves be caught up in and guided by his_love , enlarges the horizons of existence , gives it a firm hope which_will not disappoint . Faith -isaia- no refuge for the fainthearted , but something which enhances our_lives . It makes us aware of a magnificent calling , the vocation of love . It assures us that_this love_-isaia- trustworthy and worth embracing , for it -isaia- based on God s faithfulness which_-isaia- stronger than our every weakness . A light for life in society . Absorbed and deepened in the family , faith becomes a light capable of illumining all our relationships in society . As an experience of the mercy of God the Father , it sets us on the path of brotherhood . Modernity sought to build a universal brotherhood based on equality , yet we gradually came to realize_that this brotherhood , lacking a reference to a common Father as its ultimate foundation , cannot endure . We need to return to the true basis of brotherhood . The history of faith_has been from the beginning a history of brotherhood , albeit not_without conflict . God calls Abraham to go forth_from his land and promises to make of him a great nation , a great people on whom_the divine blessing rests cf . As salvation history progresses , it becomes evident_that God wants to make everyone share as brothers_and_sisters in that_one blessing , which attains its fullness in Jesus , so that all may be one . The boundless love of our Father also comes to us , in Jesus , through our_brothers_and_sisters . Faith teaches us to see that_every man_and_woman represents a blessing for me , that the light of God s face shines on me through the faces of my brothers_and_sisters . How many benefits has the gaze of Christian faith brought to the city of men for their common life ! Thanks to faith we have come to understand_the unique dignity of each_person , something which_was not clearly seen in antiquity . In the second century the pagan Celsus reproached Christians for an idea that he considered foolishness and delusion : namely_,_that God created the world for_man , setting human_beings -atti_degli_apostoli- the pinnacle of the entire cosmos . '' Why claim that grass grows for the benefit of man , rather_than for that of the most savage of the brute beasts ? '' '' If we look down to Earth from the heights of heaven , would there really be any difference between our activities and those of the ants and bees ? '' At the heart of biblical faith_-isaia- God s love , his concrete concern_for every_person , and his plan of salvation which embraces all of humanity and all creation , culminating in the incarnation , death_and_resurrection of Jesus Christ . Without insight into these realities , there_-isaia- no criterion for discerning what makes human_life precious and unique . Man loses his place in the universe , he -isaia- cast adrift in nature , either renouncing his proper moral responsibility or else presuming to be a sort of absolute judge , endowed_with an unlimited power to manipulate the world around him . Faith , on the other_hand , by revealing the love of God the Creator , enables us to respect nature all the more , and to discern in it a grammar written by the hand of God and a dwelling place entrusted to our protection and care . Faith also helps us to devise models of development which_are based not_simply on utility and profit , but consider creation as a gift for which_we_are all indebted ; it teaches us to create just forms of government , in the realization that authority comes_from God and -isaia- meant for the service of the common_good . Faith likewise offers the possibility of forgiveness , which so often demands time and effort , patience and commitment . Forgiveness -isaia- possible once we discover that goodness -isaia- always prior to and more powerful than evil , and that the word with_which God affirms our life_-isaia- deeper than our every denial . From a purely anthropological standpoint , unity -isaia- superior to conflict ; rather_than avoiding conflict , we need to confront it in an effort to resolve and move beyond it , to make it a link in a chain , as part of a progress towards unity . When faith_-isaia- weakened , the foundations of life also risk being weakened , as the poet T . Eliot warned : '' Do you need to be told that even_those modest attainments As you can boast in the way of polite society Will hardly survive the Faith to which_they owe their significance ? '' If we remove faith in God from our cities , mutual trust would be weakened , we would remain united only by fear and our stability would be threatened . In the Letter to the Hebrews we read that '' God -isaia- not ashamed to be called their God ; indeed , he has prepared a city for them '' Heb : . Here the expression '' -isaia- not ashamed '' -isaia- associated_with public acknowledgment . The intention -isaia- to say that God , by his concrete actions , makes a public avowal that_he_-isaia- present in our midst and that he desires to solidify every_human relationship . Could it be the case , instead , that_we_are the ones who_are ashamed to call God our God ? That we are the ones who fail to confess him as such in our public_life , who fail to propose the grandeur of the life in common which he makes possible ? Faith illumines life and society . If it possesses a creative light for each new moment of history , it -isaia- because it sets every event in relationship to the origin and destiny of all things in the Father . Consolation and strength amid suffering . Writing to the Christians of Corinth about his sufferings and tribulations , Saint Paul links his faith to his preaching of the Gospel . In himself he sees fulfilled the passage of Scripture which reads : '' I believed , and so I spoke '' Cor : . The reference -isaia- to a verse of Psalm , in which_the psalmist exclaims : '' I kept my faith , even_when I said , I -amos- greatly afflicted '' v . To speak of faith often involves speaking of painful testing , yet it -isaia- precisely in such testing that Paul sees the most convincing proclamation of the Gospel , for it -isaia- in weakness and suffering that we discover God s power which triumphs over our weakness and suffering . The apostle himself experienced a dying which_would become life_for Christians cf . In the hour of trial faith brings light , while suffering and weakness make it evident_that '' we do not proclaim ourselves ; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord '' Cor : . The eleventh chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews concludes with a reference to those_who suffered for their_faith cf . Heb : ; outstanding among_these was Moses , who suffered abuse for the Christ cf . Christians know_that suffering cannot be eliminated , yet it can have meaning and become an act of love and entrustment into the hands of God who_does_not abandon us ; in this_way it can serve as a moment of growth in faith and love . By contemplating Christ s union with the Father even -atti_degli_apostoli- the height of his sufferings on the cross cf . Mk : , Christians learn to share in the same gaze of Jesus . Even death -isaia- illumined and can be experienced as the ultimate call to faith , the ultimate '' Go forth_from your land '' Gen : , the ultimate '' Come ! '' spoken by the Father , to whom we abandon ourselves in the confidence that he will keep us steadfast even in our final passage . Nor does the light_of_faith make us forget the sufferings of this_world . How many men_and_women of faith have found mediators of light in those who_suffer ! So it was with Saint Francis of Assisi and the leper , or with Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta and her poor . They understood the mystery -atti_degli_apostoli- work in them . In drawing near to the suffering , they_were certainly not able to eliminate all their pain or to explain every evil . Faith -isaia- not a light_which scatters all our darkness , but a lamp which guides our steps in the night and suffices for the journey . To those who_suffer , God does_not provide arguments which explain everything ; rather , his response -isaia- that of an accompanying presence , a history of goodness which touches every story of suffering and opens up a ray of light . In Christ , God himself wishes to share this path with us and to offer us his gaze so that we might see the light within it . Christ -isaia-_the_one who , having endured suffering , -isaia- '' the pioneer and perfecter of our_faith '' Heb : . Suffering reminds us that_faith s service to the common_good -isaia- always one of hope a hope which looks ever ahead in the knowledge that_only from God , from the future which_comes_from the risen Jesus , can our society find solid and lasting foundations . In this_sense faith_-isaia- linked to hope , for even if our dwelling place here below -isaia- wasting away , we have an eternal dwelling place which God has_already prepared in Christ , in his_body cf . The dynamic of faith , hope and charity cf . Th : ; Cor : thus leads us to embrace the concerns of all men_and_women on our journey towards that city '' whose architect and builder -isaia- God '' Heb : , for '' hope does_not disappoint '' Rom : . In union with_faith and charity , hope propels us towards a sure future , set against a different horizon with_regard to the illusory enticements of the idols of this_world yet granting new momentum and strength to our daily lives . Let us refuse to be robbed of hope , or to allow our_hope to be dimmed by facile answers and solutions which block our progress , '' fragmenting '' time and changing it into space . Time -isaia- always much greater_than space . Space hardens processes , whereas time propels towards_the future and encourages us to go forward in hope . Blessed -isaia- she_who believed Lk : . In the parable of the sower , Saint Luke has left us these_words of the Lord about the '' good soil '' : '' These are the ones who when_they hear_the word , hold it fast in an honest and good heart , and bear_fruit with patient endurance '' Lk : . In the context of Luke s Gospel , this mention of an honest and good heart which hears and keeps the word_-isaia- an implicit portrayal of the faith of the Virgin Mary . The evangelist himself speaks of Mary s memory , how she treasured in her_heart all that_she had heard and seen , so that the word could bear_fruit in her_life . The Mother of the Lord -isaia- the perfect icon of faith ; as Saint Elizabeth would say : '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' Lk : . In Mary , the Daughter of Zion , -isaia- fulfilled the long history of faith of the Old Testament , with its account of so many faithful women , beginning with Sarah : women_who , alongside the patriarchs , were those in whom God s promise was fulfilled and new_life flowered . In the fullness_of_time , God s word was spoken to Mary and she received that word into her_heart , her entire being , so that in her womb it could take flesh and be born as light for_humanity . Saint Justin Martyr , in his dialogue_with Trypho , uses a striking expression ; he tells us that Mary , receiving the message of the angel , conceived '' faith and joy '' . In the Mother of Jesus , faith demonstrated its fruitfulness ; when our_own spiritual lives bear_fruit we become filled_with joy , which_-isaia- the clearest sign of faith s grandeur . In her own_life Mary completed the pilgrimage of faith , following in the footsteps of her Son . In her the faith journey of the Old Testament was thus taken up into the following of Christ , transformed by him and entering into the gaze of the incarnate Son of God . We can say that in the Blessed Virgin Mary we find something I mentioned earlier , namely that the believer -isaia- completely taken up into_his or her confession of faith . Because of her close bond with Jesus , Mary -isaia- strictly connected to what we believe . As Virgin and Mother , Mary offers us a clear sign of Christ s divine sonship . The eternal origin of Christ -isaia- in the Father . He -isaia- the Son in a total and unique sense , and so he -isaia- born in time without_the intervention of a man . As the Son , Jesus brings to the world a new beginning and a new light , the fullness of God s faithful love bestowed on humanity . But Mary s true motherhood also ensured for the Son of God an authentic human_history , true flesh in which he would die on the cross and rise from the dead . Mary would accompany Jesus to the cross cf . Jn : , whence her motherhood would extend to each of his_disciples cf . She will_also be present in the upper_room after Jesus resurrection and ascension , joining the apostles in imploring the gift of the Spirit cf . The movement of love between Father , Son and Spirit runs through our history , and Christ draws us to himself in order to save us cf . At the centre of our faith_-isaia- the confession of Jesus , the Son of God , born of a woman , who brings us , through the gift of the Holy Spirit , to adoption as sons_and_daughters cf . Let us turn in prayer to Mary , Mother of the Church and Mother of our_faith . Mother , help our_faith ! Open our ears to hear God s word and to recognize his voice and call . Awaken in us a desire to follow in his footsteps , to go forth_from our_own land and to receive his promise . Help us to be touched by his_love , that_we_may touch him in faith . Help us to entrust ourselves fully to him and to believe in his_love , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- times of trial , beneath the shadow of the cross , when our faith_-isaia- called to mature . Sow in our_faith the joy of the Risen One . Remind us that_those_who believe are never alone . Teach us to see all things with the eyes of Jesus , that_he_may be light for our path . And may this light_of_faith always increase in us , until the dawn of that undying day which_-isaia- Christ himself , your Son , our Lord !

'' Though the Council does_not expressly deal with_faith , it speaks of it on every page , it recognizes its living , supernatural character , it presumes it to be full and strong , and it bases its teachings on it .

'' The obedience of faith Rom : ; compare Rom : , Cor : must be our response to the God who reveals . By faith one freely submits oneself entirely to God making the full submission of intellect and will to God who reveals , and willingly assenting to the revelation given by God . For this faith to be accorded , we need the grace of God , anticipating it and assisting it , as well as the interior helps of the Holy Spirit , who moves the heart and converts it to God , and opens the eyes of the mind and makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth .

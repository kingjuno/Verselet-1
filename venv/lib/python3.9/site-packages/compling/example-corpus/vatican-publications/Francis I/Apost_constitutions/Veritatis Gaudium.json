The joy of truth Veritatis Gaudium expresses the restlessness of the human_heart until it encounters and dwells within God s Light , and shares that Light with all people . For truth_-isaia- not an abstract idea , but_-isaia- Jesus himself , the Word of God in whom -isaia- the Life that_-isaia- the Light of man cf . Jn : , the Son of God who -isaia-_also the Son of Man . He alone , '' in revealing the mystery of the Father and of his_love , fully reveals humanity to itself and brings to light its_very high calling '' . When we encounter the Living One cf . Rev : and the firstborn among many brothers cf . Rom : , our_hearts experience , even_now , amid the vicissitudes of history , the unfading light and joy born of our union with God and our unity with our_brothers_and_sisters in the common home of creation . One day we will experience that endless joy in full_communion with God . In Jesus prayer to the Father \u2013 '' that_they_may all be one ; even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that_they also may be in us '' Jn : \u2013 we find the secret of the joy that Jesus wishes to share in its fullness cf . It -isaia- the joy that comes_from_the Father through the gift of the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- the Spirit of truth and of love , freedom , justice and unity . This -isaia- the joy that the Church -isaia- impelled by Jesus to bear_witness to and to proclaim in her_mission , unceasingly and with ever renewed vigour . The People of God makes its pilgrim way along the paths of history , accompanying in solidarity the men_and_women of all peoples and cultures , in order to shed the light of the Gospel upon humanity s journey towards_the new civilization of love . Closely linked to the Church s evangelizing mission , which flows from her very identity as completely committed to promoting the authentic and integral growth of the human_family towards its definitive fullness in God , -isaia- the vast multidisciplinary system of ecclesiastical studies . This system has developed over the centuries from the wisdom of the People of God , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit and in dialogue_with , and discernment of , the signs of the times and diverse cultural expressions . It -isaia- not surprising then that the Second Vatican Council , in its decisive and prophetic effort to renew the Church s life_for a more_effective mission in this moment of history , in its Decree Optatam Totius called_for a faithful and creative review of ecclesiastical studies cf . That review , after careful study and prudent testing , led to the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana , promulgated by Saint John Paul II on April . The Constitution further encouraged and refined the Church s efforts to support '' Ecclesiastical Faculties and Universities , which_-isaia- to say those concerned particularly with Christian revelation and questions connected therewith and which_are therefore more_closely connected_with her_mission of evangelization '' , as well as with_other disciplines which , '' although lacking a special link with Christian revelation , can still help considerably in the work of evangelizing '' . Almost forty years later , in fidelity to the spirit and directives of Vatican II and for its_own timely application , the Apostolic Constitution urgently needs to be brought up to date . While remaining fully valid in its prophetic vision and its clarity of expression , the Constitution ought to include the norms and dispositions issued since its promulgation , and to take into_account developments in the area of academic studies in these past decades . There -isaia-_also a need to acknowledge_the changed social cultural context worldwide and to implement initiatives on the international level to which_the Holy See has adhered . This , then , -isaia- a good occasion to promote with thoughtful and prophetic determination the renewal of ecclesiastical studies -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , as part of the new phase of the Church s mission , marked by witness to the joy born of encountering Jesus and proclaiming his Gospel , that I set before the whole People of God as a programme in Evangelii Gaudium . The Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana represented in every respect the mature fruit of the great work of reforming ecclesiastical studies initiated by the Second Vatican Council . In particular , it consolidated the progress made in this crucial area of the Church s mission under the wise and prudent guidance of Blessed Paul VI , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time heralding the contribution , in continuity with the past , which_would be made by the magisterium of Saint John Paul II . As I have_had occasion to note , '' one of the main contributions of the Second Vatican Council was precisely seeking a way to overcome this divorce between theology and pastoral_care , between_faith and life . I dare say that the Council has revolutionized to some extent the status of theology \u2013 the believer s way of doing and thinking '' . It -isaia- precisely in this light that Optatum Totius strongly proposes that ecclesiastical studies '' be more suitably aligned and . work harmoniously towards opening more_and_more the minds of the students to the mystery of Christ . For it -isaia- this_mystery which affects the whole history of the human_race , and continually influences the Church '' . In order to achieve this , the conciliar Decree urges joining meditation with the study of sacred Scripture , '' the soul of all theology '' , together_with assiduous and conscious participation in the sacred Liturgy , the '' primary and indispensable source of the truly Christian spirit '' , and the systematic study of the living Tradition of the Church in dialogue_with all people of our_time , listening attentively to their concerns , their sufferings and their needs . Consequently , Optatam Totius stresses , '' pastoral concern . ought to permeate thoroughly the entire training of the students '' , so that_they become accustomed to '' transcending the limits of their_own diocese , nation , or rite , and to helping the needs of the whole Church , and prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel everywhere '' . Pope Paul VI s Evangelii Nuntiandi and Populorum Progressio , and John Paul II s Redemptoris Hominis , issued only a month before the promulgation of the Apostolic Constitution , are milestones along the way which led from_these directives of Vatican II to Sapientia Christiana . The prophetic inspiration of Pope Paul s Apostolic Exhortation on evangelization in the modern world_-isaia- forcefully echoed in the Foreword of Sapientia Christiana . There we read that '' the Church s mission of spreading the Gospel not_only demands_that the Good News be preached ever_more widely and to ever_greater numbers of men_and_women , but_that the very power of the Gospel should permeate thought patterns , standards of judgment , and norms of behaviour . In a word , it -isaia- necessary_that the whole of human culture be steeped in the Gospel '' . John Paul II , for his part , especially in the Encyclical Fides et Ratio , reaffirmed and developed , with_regard to the dialogue_between philosophy and theology , the conviction underlying Vatican II s teaching that '' the human_being can come to a unified and organic vision of knowledge . This -isaia- one of the tasks which Christian thought will_have to take up through the next millennium of the Christian era '' . Populorum Progressio likewise played a decisive role in the reordering of ecclesiastical studies in the light of Vatican II . The experience of the various local Churches has shown that it , together_with Evangelii Nuntiandi , offered significant encouragement and concrete direction for the inculturation of the Gospel and the evangelization of culture in various regions of the world and in response to present_day challenges . This social Encyclical of Paul VI , in fact , incisively states that the development of peoples , essential for attaining justice_and_peace worldwide , '' must be well rounded ; it must foster the development of each man and of the whole man '' . It also speaks of the need_for '' wise men in search of a new humanism , one_which will_enable . human persons to find_themselves '' . Populorum Progressio thus interprets with prophetic vision the social_question as an anthropological question , one affecting the fate of the entire human_family . This -isaia- the distinct interpretative key that_would inspire the Church s subsequent social_teaching , from Laborem Exercens to Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , to John Paul II s Centesimus Annus , to Benedict XVI s Caritas in Veritate and to Laudato Si . Renewing the invitation to a new_way of thinking proposed by Populorum Progressio , Pope Benedict XVI spoke of the urgent_need '' to experience and to steer the globalization of humanity in relational terms , in terms of communion and the sharing of goods '' . He emphasized that God wants to associate humanity to that ineffable mystery of communion that_-isaia- the Blessed Trinity , of which_the Church -isaia- a sign and instrument in Jesus Christ . For this actually to take_place , he invites us '' to broaden the scope of reason '' thus enabling it to understand and guide the powerful new forces troubling the human_family , '' animating them within_the perspective of that civilization of love whose seed God has planted in every people , in every culture '' . This in turn will '' foster the interaction of the different levels of human knowledge '' , theological and philosophical , social and scientific . This rich legacy of analysis and direction has_been tested and enriched , as it were , '' on the ground '' thanks to the persevering commitment to a social_and_cultural meditation on the Gospel undertaken by the People of God in different continental areas and in dialogue_with diverse cultures . The time has now come for it to be consolidated and to impart to ecclesiastical studies that wise and courageous renewal demanded by the missionary transformation of a Church that '' goes forth '' . The primary need today -isaia- for the whole People of God to be ready to embark upon a new stage of '' Spirit filled '' evangelization . This calls for '' a resolute process of discernment , purification and reform '' . In this_process , a fitting renewal of the system of ecclesiastical studies plays a strategic role . These studies , in fact , are_called to offer opportunities and processes for the suitable formation of priests , consecrated men_and_women , and committed lay_people . At the same_time , they_are_called to be a sort of providential cultural laboratory in which_the Church carries out the performative interpretation of the reality brought_about by the Christ event and nourished by the gifts of wisdom and knowledge by which_the Holy Spirit enriches the People of God in manifold ways \u2013 from the sensus fidei fidelium to the magisterium of the bishops , and from the charism of the prophets to that of the doctors and theologians . This -isaia- essential for a Church that '' goes forth '' ! All the more so because today we are not_only living in a time of changes but are experiencing a true epochal shift , marked by a wide ranging '' anthropological '' and '' environmental crisis '' . Indeed , we daily see '' signs that things_are now reaching a breaking point , due to the rapid pace of change and degradation ; these_are evident in large scale natural disasters as well as social and even financial crises '' . In a word , this calls for '' changing the models of global development '' and '' redefining our notion of progress '' . Yet '' the problem -isaia- that we still lack the culture necessary to confront this crisis . We lack leadership capable of striking out on new paths '' . This vast and pressing task requires , on the cultural level of academic training and scientific study , a broad and generous effort -atti_degli_apostoli- a radical paradigm shift , or rather \u2013 dare I say \u2013 -atti_degli_apostoli- '' a bold cultural revolution '' . In this effort , the worldwide network of ecclesiastical universities and faculties -isaia- called to offer the decisive contribution of leaven , salt and light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the living Tradition of the Church , which_-isaia- ever open to new situations and ideas . Today it -isaia- becoming increasingly evident_that '' there_-isaia- need of a true evangelical hermeneutic for better understanding life , the world and humanity , not of a synthesis but of a spiritual atmosphere of research and certainty based on the truths of reason and of faith . Philosophy and theology permit one to acquire the convictions that structure and strengthen the intelligence and illuminate the will . but this_-isaia- fruitful only if it -isaia- done with an open mind and on one s knees . The theologian who_-isaia- satisfied with_his complete and conclusive thought -isaia- mediocre . The good theologian and philosopher has an open , that_-isaia- , an incomplete , thought , always open to the maius of God and of the truth , always in development , according to the law that Saint Vincent of Lerins described in these_words : annis consolidetur , dilatetur tempore , sublimetur aetate Commonitorium primum , : , '' . Against this vast new horizon now opening before us , what must be the fundamental criteria for a renewal and revival of the contribution of ecclesiastical studies to a Church of missionary outreach ? Here we can identify -atti_degli_apostoli- least four criteria that emerge from the Second Vatican Council s teaching and the Church s experience in these past decades of having received that teaching in attentive listening to the Holy Spirit and to the deepest needs and most pressing questions of the human_family . a First , the most urgent and enduring criterion -isaia- that of contemplation and the presentation of a spiritual , intellectual and existential introduction to the heart of the kerygma , namely the ever fresh and attractive good_news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ , which continues to take flesh in the life of the Church and of humanity . This -isaia- the mystery of salvation , of which_the Church , in Christ , -isaia- a sign and instrument in the midst of all people . The Church -isaia- '' a mystery rooted in the Trinity , yet she exists concretely in history as a people of pilgrims and evangelizers , transcending any institutional expression , however necessary . and her ultimate foundation -isaia- in the free and gracious initiative of God '' . This joyful and life_giving contemplation of the face of God , revealed in Jesus Christ as a Father rich in mercy cf . Eph : , enables us to live in a liberating and responsible way the experience the Church as a '' mystique '' of living together . This provides the leaven of that universal fraternity which_-isaia- '' capable of seeing the sacred grandeur of our neighbour , of finding God in every_human_being , of tolerating the nuisances of life in common by clinging to the love of God , of opening the heart to divine_love and seeking the happiness of others just as their heavenly Father does '' . It -isaia-_also the source of the imperative to allow our_hearts and minds to heed the cry of the earth s poor and to give concrete expression to the social dimension of evangelization , which_-isaia- an integral part of the Church s mission . For '' God , in Christ , redeems not_only the individual person but_also the social relations existing between men '' . It -isaia- true_that '' we may not_always be able to reflect adequately the beauty of the Gospel , but there_-isaia-_one sign which we should never lack : the option for those_who_are least , those_whom society discards '' . This option must pervade the presentation and study of Christian truth . From this comes the particular feature , in the formation of a Christian culture , of discovering in the whole of creation the Trinitarian imprint that makes_the cosmos in which we live a '' network of relations '' in which '' it -isaia- proper to every living being to tend towards other_things '' . This in turn fosters '' a spirituality of that global solidarity which flows from the mystery of the Trinity '' . b A second guiding criterion , closely linked to and flowing from the first , -isaia- that of wide ranging dialogue , not as a mere tactical approach , but as an intrinsic requirement for experiencing in community the joy of the Truth and appreciating more_fully its meaning and practical implications . Today our proclamation of the Gospel and the Church s doctrine are_called to promote a culture of encounter , in generous and open cooperation_with all the positive forces that contribute to the growth of universal human consciousness . A culture , we might say , of encounter between all the authentic and vital cultures , thanks to a reciprocal exchange of the gifts of each in that luminous space opened up by God s love for all his creatures . As Pope Benedict XVI pointed_out , '' truth , in fact , -isaia- logos which creates dia logos , and hence communication and communion '' . In this light , Sapientia Christiana , echoing Gaudium et Spes , urges dialogue_with Christians of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , and with_those of other religious or humanistic convictions , maintaining '' contact_with scholars of other disciplines , whether these_are believers or not '' , in an effort to '' evaluate and interpret the latter s affirmations and judge them in the light of revealed_truth '' . This provides a positive and timely chance to review , from this standpoint and in this_spirit , the structure and method of the academic curricula proposed by the system of ecclesiastical studies , in their theological foundations , in their guiding principles and in their various levels of disciplinary , pedagogical and didactical organization . This can be accomplished in a demanding but highly productive effort to rethink and update the aims and integration of the different disciplines and the teaching imparted in ecclesiastical studies within this specific framework and intentionality . Today , in fact , '' what_-isaia- called_for -isaia- an evangelization capable of shedding light on these new ways of relating to God , to others and to the world around us , and inspiring essential values . It must reach the places_where new narratives and paradigms are_being formed . '' c From this follows the third fundamental criterion that I would propose : inter disciplinary and cross disciplinary approaches carried_out with wisdom and creativity in the light of Revelation . What distinguishes the academic , formative and research approach of the system of ecclesiastical studies , on the level of both content and method , -isaia- the vital intellectual principle of the unity in difference of knowledge and respect_for its multiple , correlated and convergent expressions . This entails offering , through the various programmes proposed by ecclesiastical studies , a variety of disciplines corresponding to the multifaceted richness of reality disclosed by the event of Revelation , yet harmoniously and dynamically converging in the unity of their transcendent source and their historical and metahistorical intentionality , which_-isaia- eschatologically disclosed in Christ Jesus . In him , writes Saint Paul , '' are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge Col : . This theological , anthropological , existential and epistemic principle takes on particular significance and -isaia- called to manifest all its effectiveness within_the system of ecclesiastical studies by ensuring cohesion together_with flexibility , and organicity together_with dynamism . It must_also show its effectiveness in relation to the fragmented and often disintegrated panorama of contemporary university studies and to the pluralism \u2013 uncertain , conflicting and relativistic \u2013 of current beliefs and cultural options . Today , as Benedict XVI noted in Caritas in Veritate , taking up the cultural insights expressed by Paul VI in Populorum Progressio , '' there_-isaia- a lack of wisdom and reflection , a lack of thinking capable of formulating a guiding synthesis '' . This -isaia- where_the specific mission entrusted to the programme of ecclesiastical studies comes into play . The need for_such a guiding synthesis not_only makes clear the intrinsic purpose of the programme of ecclesiastical studies , but_also demonstrates , especially today , its real cultural and humanizing importance . Today s recovery of an interdisciplinary approach -isaia- certainly positive and promising , even in its '' weak '' form as a simple multidisciplinary approach that favours a better understanding from several points of view of an object of study . It -isaia- all the more so in its '' strong '' form , as cross disciplinary , situating and stimulating all disciplines against the backdrop of the Light and Life offered by the Wisdom streaming from God s Revelation . It follows_that someone trained in the framework of the institutions promoted by the system of ecclesiastical studies \u2013 as Blessed John Henry Newman wished for \u2013 ought to know '' just where he and his science stand ; he has come to it , as it were , from a height ; he has_taken a survey of all knowledge '' . So too , in the nineteenth century , Blessed Antonio Rosmini called_for a decisive reform in the area of Christian education , restoring the four pillars on which it firmly rested in the first centuries of the Christian era : '' communion in learning , holy intercourse , habit of life , interchange of affection '' . What -isaia- essential , he argued , -isaia- to restore the unity of content , perspective and aim of the science being taught , on the basis of the Word of God and its culmination in Christ Jesus , the Word of God made_flesh . Without this living centre , science has '' neither root nor coherence '' and simply remains '' as a mere matter of youthful memory '' . Only in this_way -isaia- it possible to overcome the '' fatal separation of theory and practice '' , for in the unity of science and holiness '' we find the true spirit of that doctrine which_-isaia- destined to save the world '' . For the teaching of that doctrine , in ancient times , '' did_not end with the brief daily lesson ; it was continued in the constant intercourse of the disciple with_his master '' . d A fourth and final criterion concerns the urgent_need for '' networking '' between those institutions worldwide that cultivate and promote ecclesiastical studies , in order to set up suitable channels of cooperation also_with academic institutions in the different countries and with_those inspired by different cultural and religious traditions . At the same_time , specialized centres of research need to be established in order to study the epochal issues affecting humanity today and to offer appropriate and realistic paths for their resolution . As I noted in Laudato Si , '' beginning in the middle of the last century and in spite of many difficulties , there_has been a growing conviction_that our planet -isaia- a homeland and that humanity -isaia- one people living in a common home '' . Recognizing this interdependence '' obliges us to think of one world with a common plan . The Church , in particular , in a convinced and prophetic response to the summons to a renewed presence and mission in history issued by Vatican II , -isaia- called to realize_that the very catholicity that makes her a leaven of unity in diversity and communion in freedom both demands and favours '' the polarity between_the particular and the universal , between_the one and the many , between_the simple and the complex . To annihilate this tension would be to go against the life of the Spirit '' . What -isaia- needed , then , -isaia- to practise a way of knowing and interpreting reality in the light of the '' mind of Christ '' cf . Cor : , wherein the model for approaching and resolving problems '' is not the sphere . where every point -isaia- equidistant from the centre , and there_are no differences between_them '' , but_rather '' the polyhedron , which reflects the convergence of all its parts , each of which preserves its distinctiveness '' . Indeed , '' the history of the Church shows_that Christianity does_not have simply one cultural expression , but_rather , remaining completely true to itself , with unswerving fidelity to the proclamation of the Gospel and the tradition of the Church , it will_also reflect the different faces of the cultures and peoples in which_it_-isaia- received and takes root . In the diversity of peoples who experience the gift of God , each in accordance_with its_own culture , the Church expresses her genuine catholicity and shows forth the beauty of her varied face . In the Christian customs of an evangelized people , the Holy Spirit adorns the Church , showing her new aspects of revelation and giving her a new face '' . This way of seeing things clearly sets out a demanding task for theology just as , in their_own specific areas of competence , for the other disciplines contemplated in ecclesiastical studies . With a fine image , Benedict XVI stated_that the Church s tradition '' is not a transmission of things or of words , a collection of dead things . Tradition -isaia- the living river that links us to the origins , the living river in which_the origins are ever present '' . '' This river irrigates various lands , feeds various geographical places , germinating the best of that land , the best of that culture . In this_way , the Gospel continues to be incarnated in every corner of the world , in an ever_new way '' . Theology must doubtless be rooted and grounded in sacred Scripture and in the living tradition , but_for this_very reason it must simultaneously accompany cultural and social processes , and particularly difficult transitions . Indeed , '' at this_time theology must address conflicts : not_only those_that we experience within_the Church but_also those_that concern the world as a whole '' . This involves '' the willingness to face conflict head on , to resolve it and to make it a link in the chain of a new process '' , thus acquiring '' a way of making history in a life setting where conflicts , tensions and oppositions can achieve the diversified and life_giving unity . This -isaia- not to opt for a kind of syncretism , or for the absorption of one into the other , but_rather for a resolution which takes_place on a higher plane and preserves what_-isaia- valid and useful on both sides '' . The revival of ecclesiastical studies entails the pressing need to give new impulse to the scientific_research conducted in our ecclesiastical universities and faculties . The Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana presented research as a '' primary duty '' , in constant '' contact_with reality . to communicate doctrine to our contemporaries in various cultures '' . Yet in today s multicultural and multiethnic world , new social_and_cultural dynamics impose a broadening of these aims . Indeed , for the Church to carry_out her saving mission , '' it -isaia-_not_enough that evangelizers be concerned to reach each_person . the Gospel -isaia-_also proclaimed to the cultures as a whole '' . Ecclesiastical studies cannot be limited to passing on knowledge , professional competence and experience to the men_and_women of our_time who desire to grow as Christians , but must_also take up the urgent task of developing intellectual tools that_can serve as paradigms for action and thought , useful for preaching in a world marked by ethical and religious pluralism . To do so calls not_only_for profound theological knowledge , but_also the ability to conceive , design and achieve ways of presenting the Christian religion capable of a profound engagement with different cultural systems . All this calls for increased quality in scientific_research and a gradual improvement in the level of theological studies and related sciences . It -isaia-_not_only a matter of extending the field of diagnosis and of adding to the mass of available data for interpreting reality , but of a deeper study that seeks '' to communicate more_effectively the truth of the Gospel in a specific context , without renouncing the truth , the goodness and the light_which it can bring wherever perfection -isaia- not_possible '' . It -isaia- to research conducted in ecclesiastical universities , faculties and institutes that I primarily entrust the task of developing that '' creative apologetics '' which I called_for in Evangelii Gaudium , in order to '' encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all '' . Indispensable in this_regard -isaia- the establishment of new and qualified centres of research where \u2013 as I proposed in Laudato Si \u2013 scholars from different religions and from different scientific fields can interact with responsible freedom and mutual transparency , thus entering into '' dialogue among_themselves for the sake of protecting nature , defending the poor , and building networks of respect and fraternity '' . In all countries , universities constitute the main centres of scientific_research for the advancement of knowledge and of society ; they play a decisive role in economic social_and_cultural development , especially in a time like our_own , marked as it -isaia- by rapid , constant and far reaching changes in the fields of science and technology . International agreements also take account of the vital responsibility of universities for research policies and the need to coordinate them by creating networks of specialized centres in order to facilitate , not least , the mobility of researchers . In this_regard , plans are under way_for outstanding interdisciplinary centres and initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- accompanying the development of advanced technologies , the best use of human resources and programmes of integration . Ecclesiastical studies , in the spirit of a Church that '' goes forth '' , are likewise called to develop specialized centers capable of deeper dialogue_with_the different scientific fields . Specifically , shared and converging research between specialists of different disciplines represents a particular service to the people of God , and especially to the Magisterium . It also supports the Church s mission of proclaiming the good_news of Christ to all , in dialogue_with_the different sciences and in the service of a deeper_understanding and application of truth in the life of individuals and society . Ecclesiastical studies will thus be poised to make their_specific and unique contribution of inspiration and guidance , and will_be_able to articulate and express in a new , challenging and realistic way their_proper task . So it has_always_been and so shall it ever be ! Theology and Christian culture have lived up to their_mission whenever they_were ready to take risks and remain faithful on the borderline . '' The questions of our people , their suffering , their battles , their dreams , their trials , their worries possess an interpretational value that we cannot ignore if we want to take the principle of the Incarnation seriously . Their wondering helps us to wonder ourselves , their questions question us . All this helps us to delve into the mystery of the Word of God , the Word that requires and asks that we dialogue , that we enter_into communion '' . What -isaia- taking shape before us today -isaia- '' a great cultural , spiritual and educational challenge , and it will demand_that we set_out on the long path of renewal '' . This -isaia-_also the case for ecclesiastical faculties and universities . May a joyful and unshaken faith in Jesus , crucified and risen , the centre and Lord of history , guide , enlighten and sustain us in these demanding and exciting times marked by commitment to a renewed and far sighted overall configuration of ecclesiastical studies . Christ s resurrection , with the superabundant gift of the Holy Spirit , '' everywhere calls forth seeds of this_new world ; even if they_are cut back , they grow again , for the resurrection -isaia-_already secretly woven into the fabric of this history '' . May Mary Most Holy , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the message of the angel conceived with ineffable joy the Word of Truth , accompany our journey . May she obtain from the Father of all good things the blessing of light and of love_that we await , with hope and childlike trust , from her Son and our Lord , Jesus Christ , in the joy of the Holy Spirit ! PART ONE GENERAL NORMS Section I Nature and Purpose of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties Article . To carry_out the ministry of evangelization given to the Church by Christ , the Church has the right and duty to erect and promote Universities and Faculties which depend upon herself . In this Constitution the terms Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties mean those institutions of higher education which_have_been canonically erected or approved by the Apostolic See , which foster and teach sacred doctrine and the sciences connected therewith , and which_have the right to confer academic_degrees by the authority of the Holy See . They can be an Ecclesiastical University or Faculty sui iuris ; or an Ecclesiastical Faculty within a Catholic University , or an Ecclesiastical Faculty within some other kind of University . The purpose of Ecclesiastical Faculties are : . through scientific_research to cultivate and promote their_own disciplines , i . those directly or indirectly connected_with Christian revelation or which directly serve the mission of the Church , and therefore especially to deepen knowledge of Christian revelation and of matters connected_with it , to enunciate systematically the truths contained therein , to consider in the light of revelation the most recent progress of the sciences , and to present them to the people of the present_day in a manner adapted to various cultures ; . to train the students to a level of high qualification in their_own disciplines , according to Catholic doctrine , to prepare them properly to face their tasks , and to promote the continuing permanent education of the ministers of the Church ; . to collaborate intensely , in accordance_with their_own nature and in close communion with the Hierarchy , with the local and the universal Church the whole work_of_evangelization . It -isaia-_the_duty of Bishops Conferences to follow carefully the life and progress of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties , because_of_their special ecclesial importance . The canonical erection or approval of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties -isaia- reserved to the Congregation for Catholic Education , which governs them according to law . Only Universities and Faculties canonically erected or approved by the Holy See and ordered according to the norms of this present Constitution have_the right to confer academic_degrees which_have canonical value , with the exception of the special right of the Pontifical Biblical Commission . The Statutes of each University or Faculty , which_must be drawn up in accordance_with_the present Constitution , require approval by the Congregation for Catholic Education . Ecclesiastical Faculties erected or approved by the Holy See in non Ecclesiastical universities , which confer both canonical and civil academic_degrees , must observe the prescriptions of the present Constitution , while respecting the bilateral and multilateral conventions signed by the Holy See with various nations or with the universities themselves . Faculties which_have not_been canonically erected or approved by the Holy See may_not confer academic_degrees having canonical value . Academic degrees conferred by such Faculties , if they_are to have value for some canonical effects only , require the recognition of the Congregation for Catholic Education . For this recognition to be given for individual degrees for a special reason , the conditions laid_down by the Congregation must be fulfilled . For the correct carrying_out of the present Constitution , the Norms of Application issued by the Congregation for Catholic Education must be observed . Section II The Academic Community and Its Government Article . The University or Faculty -isaia- community of study , research and formation , which operates , on an official level , in pursuit of its primary aims , listed in article , in conformity_with_the principles of the evangelizing mission of the Church . Within the academic community , all the people , either as individuals or as members of councils , are , each according_to_his or her_own status , co responsible_for the common_good and must strive to work_for the same community s goals . Therefore , their rights_and_duties within_the academic community must be accurately set down in the Statutes , to ensure that_they_are properly exercised within correctly established limits . The Chancellor represents the Holy See to the University or Faculty and equally the University or Faculty to the Holy See . He promotes the continuation and progress of the University or Faculty and he fosters its communion with the local and universal Church . The University or Faculty legally depends on the Chancellor , unless the Holy See has established otherwise . Where conditions favour such a post , it -isaia-_also possible to have a Vice Chancellor , whose authority_-isaia- determined in the Statutes . If the Chancellor -isaia- someone other_than the local Ordinary , the statutory norms are to establish how the Ordinary and the Chancellor carry_out their_respective offices in mutual accord . The academic authorities are personal and collegial . Personal authorities are , in the first_place , the Rector or President and the Dean . The collegial authorities are the various directive organisms or councils of both the University and Faculty . The Statutes of the University or Faculty must very carefully set_out the names and offices of the academic authorities , determining the way they_are designated and their term of office , taking into_account both the canonical nature of the individual University or Faculty and the university practice in the local area . Those designed as academic authorities are to be people_who_are truly knowledgeable about university life and , usually , who come from among the teachers of some Faculty . The following office holders are appointed , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least confirmed , by the Congregation for Catholic Education : the Rector of an Ecclesiastical University ; the President of an Ecclesiastical Faculty sui iuris ; the Dean of an Ecclesiastical Faculty that forms part of a University . The Statutes determine how the personal and the collegial authorities are to collaborate with each_other , so that , carefully observing the principle of collegiality , especially in more_serious matters and above all in those of an academic nature , the persons in authority will enjoy that exercise of power which really corresponds to their office . This applies , in the first_place , to the Rector , who_has the duty to govern_the entire University and to promote , in suitable ways , its unity , cooperation and progress . When Faculties are parts of an Ecclesiastical University or a Catholic University , their governance must be suitably coordinated through the Statutes with the governance of the entire University in such_a_way_that the good of the single Faculties -isaia- assured -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the good of the whole University -isaia- promoted , and the cooperation of all the Faculties with each_other -isaia- favoured . The canonical exigencies of Ecclesiastical Faculties must be safeguarded even_when such Faculties are inserted into another kind of University . When a Faculty -isaia- joined to a major seminary or college , the Statutes , while always having due concern_for cooperation in everything pertaining to the students good , must clearly and effectively provide that the academic direction and administration of the Faculty are correctly distinct from the governance and administration of the major seminary or college . Section III Teachers Article . In each Faculty there_must be a number of teachers , especially permanent ones , which corresponds to the importance and development of the individual disciplines as well as to the proper care and profit of the students . There must be various ranks of teachers , determined in the Statutes , according_to_their measure of preparation , their insertion into the Faculty , their permanence , and their responsibilities within_the Faculty , taking into_account_the university practice of the local area . The Statutes are to define which authorities are responsible_for hiring , naming , and promoting teachers , especially_when it -isaia-_a_question of giving them a permanent position . To be legitimately hired as a permanent teacher in a Faculty , a person must : be distinguished by wealth of knowledge , witness of Christian and ecclesial life , and a sense_of_responsibility ; have a suitable Doctorate or equivalent title or exceptional and singular scientific accomplishment ; show documentary proof of suitability for doing scientific_research , especially by a published dissertation ; demonstrate teaching ability . These requirements for taking on permanent teachers must be applied also , in proportionate measure , for hiring non permanent ones . In hiring teachers , the scientific requirements in current force in the university practice of the local area should be taken into_account . All teachers of every rank must be marked by an upright life , integrity of doctrine , and devotion to duty , so that_they_can effectively contribute to the proper goals of an Ecclesiastical academic institution . Should any of these requirements subsequently cease to be , the teachers must be removed from their post , observing the established procedures . Those who teach matters touching on faith_and_morals are to be conscious of their_duty to carry_out_their work in full_communion with the authentic Magisterium of the Church , above all , with_that of the Roman Pontiff . Those who teach disciplines concerning faith or morals must receive , after making their profession_of_faith , a canonical mission from the Chancellor or his delegate , for they_do_not teach on their_own authority but by virtue of the mission they_have received_from_the Church . The other teachers must receive permission to teach from the Chancellor or his delegate . All teachers , before they_are given a permanent post or before they_are promoted to the highest category of teacher , or else in both cases , as the Statutes are to state , must receive a declaration of nihil obstat from the Holy See . Promotion to the higher ranks of teachers -isaia- to take_place only after a suitable interval of time and with due reference to teaching skill , to research accomplished , to the publication of scientific works , to the spirit of cooperation in teaching and in research , and to commitment to the Faculty . The teachers , in order to carry_out_their tasks satisfactorily , must be free_from other employment which_cannot be reconciled with their_duty to do research and to instruct , according to what_the Statutes require for each rank of teacher . The Statutes must state : a when and under which conditions a teaching post ends ; b for_what reasons and in which ways a teacher can be suspended , removed , or even deprived of his post , so as to safeguard suitably the rights of the teachers , of the Faculty or University , and , above all , of the students and also of the ecclesial_community . Section IV Students Article . Ecclesiastical Faculties are open to all who_can legally give testimony to leading a moral_life and to having completed the previous studies appropriate to enrolling in the Faculty . To enrol in a Faculty in order to obtain an academic degree , one_must present that kind of study title which_would be necessary to permit enrolment in a civil university of one_s_own country or of the country where_the Faculty -isaia- located . The Faculty , in its_own Statutes , should determine what , besides what_-isaia- contained in above , -isaia- needed_for entrance into its course of study , including ancient and modern language requirements . The Faculty should_also determine in its Statutes procedures for evaluating the ways to treat the cases of refugees , displaced persons and persons in a refugee like situation who lack the normal documentation required . Students must faithfully observe the laws of the Faculty about the general programme and about discipline \u2013 in the first_place about the Plan of Studies , class attendance , and examinations \u2013 as well as all that pertains to the life of the Faculty . For this_reason , the University and the individual Faculties should arrange ways for the students to know_the Statutes and Rule . The Statutes should define how the students , either individually or collectively , take_part in the academic community life in those aspects in which_they can contribute to the common_good of the Faculty or University . The Statutes should equally determine how the students can , for serious reasons , be suspended from certain rights or be deprived of them or even be expelled from the Faculty , in such_a_way_that the rights of the student , of the Faculty or University , and also of the ecclesial_community are appropriately protected . Section V Officials and Administrative and Service Personnel Article . In governing and administering a University or Faculty , the authorities are to be assisted by officials trained for various tasks . The officials are , first of all , the Secretary , the Librarian , the Financial Procurator , and others whom_the institution considers necessary . Their rights_and_duties must be established in the Statutes or Rule . Section VI Plan of Studies Article . In arranging the studies , the principles and norms which for different matters are contained in ecclesiastical documents , especially_those of the Second Vatican Council , must be carefully observed . At the same_time account must_be_taken of sound advances coming from scientific progress which_can contribute to answering the questions being currently asked . In the single Faculties let that scientific method be used which corresponds to the needs of the individual sciences . Up to date didactic and teaching methods should be applied in an appropriate way , in order to bring_about the personal involvement of the students and their active participation in their studies . Following the norm of the Second Vatican Council , according to the nature of each Faculty : just freedom should be acknowledged in research and teaching so that true progress can be obtained in learning and understanding divine truth . At the same_time let it be clear_that : a true freedom in teaching_-isaia- necessarily contained within_the limits of God s Word , as this_-isaia- constantly taught by the Church s Magisterium ; b likewise , true freedom in research -isaia- necessarily based upon firm adherence to God s Word and deference to the Church s Magisterium , whose duty it -isaia- to interpret authentically the Word of God . Therefore , in such a weighty matter one_must proceed with trust , and without suspicion , but the same_time with prudence and without rashness , especially in teaching ; moreover , one_must carefully harmonize the necessities of science with the pastoral needs of the People of God . In each Faculty the curriculum of studies -isaia- to be suitably organized in steps or cycles , adapted to the material . They are usually as follows : a first , a general instruction -isaia- imparted , covering a coordinated presentation of all the disciplines , along_with an introduction into scientific methodology ; b next , one section of the disciplines -isaia- studied more profoundly , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the students practise scientific_research more_fully ; c finally , there_-isaia- progress toward scientific maturity , especially through a piece of written work that truly makes a contribution to the advance of the science . The disciplines which_are absolutely necessary_for the Faculty to achieve its purposes should be determined . Those also should be set_out which in a different way are helpful to these purposes and , therefore , how these_are suitably distinguished one from another . In each Faculty the disciplines should be arranged in such_a_way_that they form an organic body , so as to serve the solid and coherent formation of the students and to facilitate collaboration by the teachers . Lectures , especially in the basic cycle , must_be_given , and the students must attend them , according to the norms to be determined in the Plan of Studies . Practical exercises and seminars , mainly in the specialization cycle , must be assiduously carried on under the direction of the teachers . These ought to be constantly complemented by private study and frequent discussions with the teachers . The Plan of Studies of the Faculty -isaia- to define which examinations or which equivalent tests the students are to take , whether written or oral , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the semester or year , and especially of the cycle , so that_their ability can be verified in regard to continuing in the Faculty and in regard to receiving academic_degrees . Likewise the Statutes or Rule are to determine what value -isaia- to given for studies taken elsewhere , especially in regard to being dispensed from some disciplines or examinations or even in regard to reducing the curriculum , always , however , respecting the prescriptions of the Congregation for Catholic Education . Section VII Academic Degrees and Other Awards Article . After each cycle of the curriculum of studies , the suitable academic degree can be conferred , which_must be established for each Faculty , with attention given to the duration of the cycle and to the disciplines taught in it . Therefore , according to the general and special norms of this Constitution , all degrees conferred and the conditions under which_they_are conferred are to be determined in the Statutes of the individual Faculties . The academic_degrees conferred by an Ecclesiastical Faculty are : Baccalaureate , Licentiate , and Doctorate . Academic degrees can be given different names in the Statutes of the individual Faculties , taking account of the university practice in the local area , indicating , however , with clarity the equivalence these have with the names of the academic_degrees above and maintaining uniformity among the Ecclesiastical Faculties of the same area . Nobody can obtain an academic degree unless properly enrolled in a Faculty , completing the course of studies prescribed by the Plan of Studies , and successfully passing the examinations and possibly other means of testing . In order to be admitted to the Doctorate , one_must first have obtained the Licentiate . A requisite for obtaining a Doctorate , furthermore , -isaia- a doctoral dissertation that makes a real contribution to the progress of science , written under the direction of a teacher , publicly defended and collegially approved ; the principal part , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , must be published . The Doctorate -isaia- the academic degree which enables one to teach in a Faculty and which_-isaia- therefore required_for this_purpose , the Licentiate -isaia- the academic degree which enables one to teach in a major seminary or equivalent institution and which_-isaia- therefore required_for this_purpose . The academic_degrees which_are required_for filling various ecclesiastical posts are to be stated by the competent ecclesiastical authority . An honorary Doctorate can be conferred for special scientific or cultural merit in promoting the ecclesiastical sciences . As well as academic_degrees , Faculties can_also grant other degrees , according to the variety of Faculties and the Plan of Studies of the individual Faculties . Section VIII Didactic Facilities Article . In order to achieve its_proper purposes , especially in regard to scientific_research , each University or Faculty must_have an adequate library , in keeping_with_the needs of the teachers and students . It must be correctly organized and equipped with an appropriate catalogue . Through an annual allotment of money , the library must continually acquire books , old_and_new , as well as the principal reviews , so as to be able effectively to serve research , teaching of the disciplines , instructional needs , and the practical exercises and seminars . The library must be headed by a trained librarian , assisted by a suitable council . The librarian participates opportunely in the Council of the University or Faculty . The Faculty must_also have information and technical audio visual equipment , etc . , to assist its didactic and research work . In relationship to the special nature and purpose of a University or Faculty , research institutions and scientific laboratories should_also be available , as well as other instruments needed_for the accomplishment of its ends . Section IX Financial Administration Article . A University or Faculty must_have enough money to achieve its purposes properly . Its financial endowments and its property rights are to be carefully described . The Statutes are to determine the duty of the Financial Officer as well as the part the Rector or President and the University or Faculty Council play in money matters , according to the norms of good economics and so as to preserve healthy administration . The teaching and non teaching personnel are to be paid a suitable remuneration , taking account of the customs of the local area , and also taking_into consideration pensions and insurance protection . Likewise , the Statutes are to determinate the general norms that_will indicate the ways the students are to contribute to the expenses of the University or Faculty , by paying academic fees . Section X Strategic Planning and Cooperation of Faculties Article . Great care must_be_given to what_-isaia- called strategic planning , so as to provide_for the preservation and progress of Universities and Faculties , as well as their suitable distribution in the various parts_of_the_world . To accomplish this_end , the Congregation for Catholic Education -isaia- to be helped by advice from the Bishops Conferences and from a commission of experts . The erection or approval of a new University or Faculty -isaia- decided upon by the Congregation for Catholic Education when all the requirements are fulfilled . In this_the Congregation listens to the local Ordinary or Eparch , the Bishops Conference , and experts especially from neighbouring Faculties . Four Ecclesiastical Faculties are needed to erect canonically an Ecclesiastical University ; three Ecclesiastical Faculties for an Ecclesiastical Athenaeum . An Ecclesiastical University and an Ecclesiastical Faculty sui iuris possess ipso iure public juridic personality . It pertains to the Congregation for Catholic Education to grant by decree juridic personality to an Ecclesiastical Faculty that -isaia-_part of a civil University . Affiliation of some institution with a Faculty for the purpose of being able to grant the Baccalaureate -isaia- approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education , after_the conditions established by that_same Congregation are fulfilled . It -isaia- highly desirable that theological study centres , whether diocesan or religious , be affiliated to a Faculty of Theology . Aggregation to a Faculty and incorporation into a Faculty by an institution for the purposes of also granting higher academic_degrees -isaia- decided upon by the Congregation for Catholic Education , after_the conditions established by that_same Congregation are fulfilled . The erection of a Higher Institute of Religious Sciences requires it to be linked_with a Faculty of Theology , according to the particular norms published by the Congregation for Catholic Education . Cooperation between Faculties , whether of the same University or of the same region or of a wider territorial area , -isaia- to be diligently striven for . In fact , such cooperation -isaia- of great help in promoting the scientific_research of the teachers and a better formation of the students . It also fosters the advance of interdisciplinary collaboration , which appears to be ever_more necessary , and it contributes to the development of complementarity among the various Faculties . In general , it also helps to bring_about the diffusion of Christian wisdom throughout all culture . Whenever an Ecclesiastical University or Faculty no longer fulfils the conditions that were necessary_for its erection or approval , it pertains to the Congregation for Catholic Education , having previously adverted the Chancellor and the Rector or President , according to the circumstances and after_having heard the opinion of the diocesan or eparchial Bishop and of the Bishops Conference , to take the decision to suspend its academic rights , to revoke its approval as an Ecclesiastical University or Faculty , or to suppress the institute . PART TWO SPECIAL NORMS Article . Besides the norms common to all Ecclesiastical Faculties , which_are established in the first part of this Constitution , special norms are given here under for certain of those Faculties , because_of_their particular nature and importance for the Church . Section I Faculty of Theology Article . A Faculty of Theology has the aim of profoundly studying and systematically explaining , according to the scientific method proper to it , Catholic doctrine , derived with the greatest care from divine_revelation . It has the further aim of carefully seeking the solution to human problems in the light of that_same revelation . The study of Sacred Scripture -isaia- , as it were , the soul of Theology , which rests upon the written Word of God together_with living Tradition , as its perpetual foundation . The individual theological disciplines are to be taught in such_a_way_that , from their internal structure and from the proper object of each as well as from their connection_with other disciplines , such as Canon Law and Philosophy as well as the anthropological sciences , the basic unity of theological instruction -isaia- quite clear , and in such_a_way_that all the disciplines converge in a profound understanding of the mystery of Christ , so that_this can be announced with_greater effectiveness to the People of God and to all nations . Revealed truth must be considered also in connection_with the scientific accomplishments of evolving time , so that it can be seen '' how faith and reason give harmonious witness to the unity of all truth . '' Also , its exposition -isaia- to be such that , without_any change of the truth , there_-isaia- adaptation to the nature and character of every culture , taking special account of the philosophy and the wisdom of various peoples . However , all syncretism and every_kind of false particularism are to be excluded . The positive values in the various cultures and philosophies are to be sought out , carefully examined , and taken up . However , systems and methods incompatible with Christian faith must_not be accepted . Ecumenical questions are to be carefully treated , according to the norms of competent Church authorities . Also to be carefully considered are relationships with non Christian religions . Problems arising from atheism and other currents of contemporary culture are to be scrupulously studied . In studying and teaching the Catholic doctrine , fidelity to the Magisterium of the Church -isaia- always to be emphasized . In the carrying_out of teaching duties , especially in the basic cycle , those_things are , above all , to be imparted which belong to the received patrimony of the Church . Hypothetical or personal opinions which come from new research are to be modestly presented as such . The curriculum of studies of the Faculty of Theology comprises : a the first cycle , fundamentals , which lasts for five years or ten semesters , or else , when a previous two year Philosophy course -isaia- an entrance requirement , for three years or six semesters . The first two years must be primarily dedicated to a solid philosophical formation , which_-isaia- necessary_for undertaking correctly the study of theology . The Baccalaureate obtained in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy substitutes for first cycle philosophy courses in theology Faculties . A Baccalaureate in Philosophy obtained in a non Ecclesiastical Faculty does_not give grounds for dispensing a student completely from the first cycle philosophy courses in Theology Faculties . The theological disciplines must be taught in such_a_way_that what_-isaia- presented -isaia- an organic exposition of the whole of Catholic doctrine , together_with an introduction to theological scientific methodology . The cycle ends with the academic degree of Baccalaureate or some other suitable degree as the Statutes of the Faculty determine . b the second cycle , specialization , which lasts for two years or four semesters . In this cycle the particular disciplines are taught corresponding to the nature of the diverse specializations being undertaken . Also seminars and practical exercises are conducted for the acquisition of the ability to do scientific_research . The cycle concludes with the academic degree of specialized Licentiate . c the third cycle , in which for a suitable period of time scientific formation_-isaia- brought to completion , especially through the writing of a doctrinal dissertation . The cycle concludes with the academic degree of Doctorate . To enrol in a Faculty of Theology , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with article of this Constitution . Where the first cycle of the Faculty lasts for only three years , the student must submit proof of having properly completed a two year course in philosophy -atti_degli_apostoli- an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy or -atti_degli_apostoli- an approved institution . A Faculty of Theology has the special duty of taking care of the scientific theological formation of those preparing for the priesthood and those_who_are preparing to hold some particular ecclesiastical office ; therefore , it -isaia- necessary_that there be a suitable number of priest teachers . For this_purpose , special courses suitable for seminarians should be offered . It -isaia-_also appropriate for the Faculty itself to offer the '' pastoral year '' required_for the priesthood , in addition to the five year basic cycle . At the end of this_year , a special Diploma may be conferred . Section II Faculty of Canon Law Article . A Faculty of Canon Law , whether Latin or Oriental , has the aim of cultivating and promoting the juridical disciplines in the light of the law of the Gospel and of deeply instructing the students in these , so as to form researchers , teachers , and others_who will be trained to hold special ecclesiastical posts . The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Canon Law should include : a the first cycle , lasting for four semesters or two years , for those_who_have no previous training in philosophy or theology , including those_who already hold an academic degree in civil law ; in this cycle students should study the fundamental concepts of canon_law and the philosophical and theological disciplines required_for an advanced formation in canon_law ; b the second cycle , lasting for six semesters or three years , during which_the canon_law in all its expressions \u2013 normative , jurisprudential , doctrinal , praxis , and especially_the Code of the Latin Church or of the Oriental Churches \u2013 should be studied in depth , by way of the complete study of its sources , both magisterial and disciplinary , along_with other disciplines having an affinity with it ; c the third cycle , lasting for a suitable period of time , in which students perfect the canon_law training necessary_for scholarly research in view of preparing a doctoral dissertation . With regard to the studies prescribed for the first cycle , the Faculty may make_use of the studies done in another Faculty and which it can acknowledge as responding to its needs . The second cycle concludes with the Licentiate and the third with the Doctorate . The Plan of Studies of the Faculty -isaia- to define the special requirements for the conferring of the academic_degrees , observing the prescriptions of the Congregation for Catholic Education . To enrol in a Faculty of Canon Law , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with article of this Constitution . Section III Faculty of Philosophy Article . An Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy has the aim of investigating philosophical problems according to scientific methodology , basing itself on a heritage of perennially valid philosophy . It has to search_for solutions in the light of natural reason and , furthermore , it has to demonstrate their consistency with the Christian view of the world , of man , and of God , placing in a proper light the relationship_between philosophy and theology . Then , the students are to be instructed so as to make_them ready to teach and to fill other suitable intellectual posts as well as to prepare them to promote Christian culture and to undertake a fruitful dialogue_with_the people of our_time . The curriculum of studies in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy includes : a the first cycle , basics , in which for three years or six semesters an organic exposition of the various parts of philosophy -isaia- imparted , which includes treating the world , man , and God . It also includes the history of philosophy , together_with an introduction into the method of scientific_research ; b the second cycle , the beginning of specialization , in which for two years or four semesters through special disciplines and seminars a more profound consideration -isaia- imparted in some sector of philosophy ; c the third cycle , in which , for a period of -atti_degli_apostoli- least three years , philosophical maturity -isaia- promoted , especially by means of writing a doctoral dissertation . The first cycle ends with the degree of Baccalaureate , the second with the specialized Licentiate , and the third with the Doctorate . To enrol in the first cycle of a Faculty of Philosophy , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with article of this Apostolic Constitution . If a student , who_has successfully completed the regular philosophy courses in the first cycle of a Theology Faculty , wants to continue philosophical studies in order to obtain the Baccalaureate in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy , due account must_be_taken of the courses that the student has attended during the aforementioned studies . Section IV Other Faculties Article . Besides the Faculties of Theology , Canon Law , and Philosophy , other Faculties have_been or can be canonically erected , according to the needs of the Church and with_a_view to attaining certain goals , as for instance : a a more profound study of certain sciences which_are of greater importance to the theological , juridical , philosophical and historical disciplines ; b the promotion of other sciences , first of all the humanities , which_have a close connection_with the theological disciplines or with the work_of_evangelization ; c the deeper cultivation of literature , so that it can provide a special help both_for a better understanding of Christian revelation and for carrying on more efficaciously the work_of_evangelization ; d finally , a more accurate preparation both of clerics and laity so that_they_may worthily carry_out some special duties of the apostolate . It belongs to the Congregation for Catholic Education to set_out , in accordance_with circumstances , special norms for these Faculties or Institutes , just as has_been done in the above sections for the Faculties of Theology , Canon Law , and Philosophy . The Faculties and Institutes for_which special norms have_not yet been set_out must_also draw up their_own Statutes . These must conform to the General Norms established in the first part of this Constitution , and they must_take into_account_the special nature and purpose proper to each of these Faculties or Institutes . Final Norms Article . This present Constitution will come into_effect on the first day of the academic year or of the academic year , according to the academic calendar in use in various places . Each University or Faculty must , before December , , present its Statutes and Plan of Studies , revised according to this Constitution , to the Congregation for Catholic Education . Any modifications to the Statutes or Plan of Studies require the approval of the Congregation for Catholic Education . In each Faculty the studies must be arranged so that the students can acquire academic_degrees according to the norms of this Constitution , preserving the students previously acquired rights . The Statutes and the Plan of Studies of new Faculties are to be approved ad experimentum so that , within_the three year period after approval , they_may be perfected with_a_view to being approved definitively . Those Faculties which_have a juridical connection_with civil authorities may , if necessary , be given a longer period of time to revise their Statutes , with the permission of the Congregation for Catholic Education . It -isaia- the task of the Congregation for Catholic Education , when , with the passage of time , circumstances shall require it , to propose changes to be introduced into this Constitution , so that_this same Constitution may be continuously adapted to the new needs of Ecclesiastical Faculties . Only the Congregation for Catholic Education can dispense from observing any article of this Constitution or Norms of Application , or from the approved Statutes and Plan of Studies of each University or Faculty . All laws and customs presently obtaining which_are in contradiction to this Constitution are abrogated , whether these_are universal or local , even if they_are worthy of special or individual mention . Likewise completely abrogated are all privileges hitherto granted by the Holy See to any person , whether physical or moral , if these_are contrary to the prescriptions of this Constitution . All that I have laid_down in this Apostolic Constitution , I order be observed in full , anything whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding , even if worthy of particular mention , and that it be published in the official gazette Acta Apostolicae Sedis . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on December , the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary , in the year , the fifth of my Pontificate . FRANCISCUS APPENDIX I Foreword of the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana I Christian wisdom , which_the Church teaches by divine authority , continuously inspires the faithful of Christ zealously to endeavour to relate human affairs and activities with religious values in a single living synthesis . Under the direction of these values all things_are mutually connected for the glory of God and the integral development of the human_person , a development that includes both corporal and spiritual well_being . Indeed , the Church s mission of spreading the Gospel not_only demands_that the Good News be preached ever_more widely and to ever_greater numbers of men_and_women , but_that the very power of the Gospel should permeate thought patterns , standards of judgment , and norms of behaviour ; in a word , it -isaia- necessary_that the whole of human culture be steeped in the Gospel . The cultural atmosphere in which a human_being lives has a great influence upon his or her way of thinking and , thus , of acting . Therefore , a division between_faith and culture -isaia- more_than a small impediment to evangelization , while a culture penetrated with the Christian spirit_-isaia- an instrument that favours the spreading of the Good News . Furthermore , the Gospel -isaia- intended for all peoples of every_age and land and -isaia- not bound exclusively to any particular culture . It -isaia- valid for pervading all cultures so as to illumine them_with_the light of divine_revelation and to purify human conduct , renewing them in Christ . For this_reason , the Church of Christ strives to bring_the Good News to every sector of humanity so as to be able to convert the consciences of human_beings , both individually and collectively , and to fill with the light of the Gospel their works and undertakings , their entire lives , and , indeed , the whole of the social environment in which_they_are engaged . In this_way the Church carries out her_mission of evangelizing also by advancing human culture . II In this activity of the Church with_regard to culture , Catholic universities have_had and still have special importance . By their nature they aim to secure that '' the Christian outlook should acquire a public , stable and universal influence in the whole process of the promotion of higher culture . '' In fact , as my Predecessor Pope Pius XI recalled in the preface to the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus , there arose within_the Church , from her earliest period , didascaleia for imparting instruction in Christian wisdom so that people s lives and conduct might be formed . From these houses of Christian wisdom the most illustrious Fathers and Doctors of the Church , teachers and ecclesiastical writers , drew their knowledge . With the passing of centuries schools were established in the neighbourhood of cathedrals and monasteries , thanks especially to the zealous initiatives of bishops and monks . These schools imparted both ecclesiastical doctrine and secular culture , forming them_into one whole . From these schools arose the universities , those glorious institutions of the Middle Ages which , from their beginning , had the Church as their most bountiful mother and patroness . Subsequently , when civil authorities , to promote the common_good , began and developed their_own universities , the Church , loyal to her very nature , did_not desist from founding and favouring such kinds of centres of learning and institutions of instruction . This -isaia- shown by the considerable number of Catholic universities established in recent_times in nearly all parts_of_the_world . Conscious of her worldwide salvific mission , the Church wishes to be especially joined to these centres of higher learning and she desires that_they flourish everywhere and work effectively to make Christ s true message present in the field of human culture and to make it advance in that field . In order_that Catholic universities might better achieve this goal , my Predecessor Pope Pius XII sought to stimulate their united activity when , by his Apostolic Brief of July , , he formally established the International Federation of Catholic Universities . It was '' to include all Athenaea which_the Holy See either has canonically erected or will in the future erect in the world , or will_have explicitly recognized as following the norms of Catholic teaching and as completely in conformity_with that teaching . '' The Second Vatican Council , for this_reason , did not_hesitate to affirm that '' the Church devotes considerable care to schools of higher learning , '' and it strongly recommended that Catholic universities should '' be established in suitable locations throughout_the_world '' and that '' the students of these institutions should be truly outstanding in learning , ready to shoulder duties of major responsibility in society and to witness to the faith before the world . '' As the Church well knows , '' the future of society and of the Church herself -isaia- closely bound up with the development of young_people engaged in higher studies . '' III It -isaia- not surprising , however_,_that among Catholic universities the Church has_always promoted with special_care Ecclesiastical Faculties and Universities , which_-isaia- to say those concerned particularly with Christian revelation and questions connected therewith and which_are therefore more_closely connected_with her_mission of evangelization . In the first_place , the Church has_entrusted to these Faculties the task of preparing with special_care students for the priestly_ministry , for teaching the sacred sciences , and for the more arduous tasks of the apostolate . It -isaia-_also the task of these Faculties '' to explore more profoundly the various areas of the sacred disciplines so that day_by_day a deeper_understanding of sacred revelation will be developed , the heritage of Christian wisdom handed_down by our ancestors will be more plainly brought into view , dialogue will be fostered with_our separated brothers_and_sisters and with non Christians , and solutions will be found for problems raised by doctrinal progress . '' In fact , new sciences and new discoveries pose new problems that involve the sacred disciplines and demand an answer . While carrying_out their primary duty of attaining through theological research a deeper grasp of revealed_truth , those engaged in the sacred sciences should therefore maintain contact_with scholars of other disciplines , whether these_are believers or not , and should try to evaluate and interpret the latters affirmations and judge them in the light of revealed_truth . From this assiduous contact_with reality , theologians are_also encouraged to seek a more suitable way of communicating doctrine to their contemporaries working in other various fields of knowledge , for '' the deposit of faith , or the truths contained in our_venerable doctrine , -isaia- one_thing ; quite another -isaia-_the_way in which these truths are formulated , while preserving the same sense and meaning . '' This will be very useful so that among the People of God religious practice and uprightness of soul may proceed -atti_degli_apostoli- an equal pace with the progress of science and technology , and so that , in pastoral_work , the faithful may be gradually led to a purer and more mature life of faith . The possibility of a connection_with the mission of evangelization also exists in Faculties of other sciences which , although lacking a special link with Christian revelation , can still help considerably in the work of evangelizing . These are looked -atti_degli_apostoli- by the Church precisely under this aspect when_they_are erected as Ecclesiastical Faculties . They therefore have a particular relationship_with the Church s Hierarchy . Thus , the Apostolic See , in carrying_out its mission , -isaia- clearly aware of its right and duty to erect and promote Ecclesiastical Faculties dependent on itself , either with a separate existence or as parts of universities , Faculties destined for the education of both ecclesiastical and lay students . This See -isaia-_very desirous that_the_whole People of God , under_the_guidance of their Shepherds , should cooperate to ensure_that these centres of learning contribute effectively to the growth of the faith and of Christian life . IV Ecclesiastical Faculties \u2013 which_are ordered to the common_good of the Church and have a valuable relationship_with the whole ecclesial_community \u2013 ought to be conscious of their importance in the Church and of their participation in the ministry of the Church . Indeed , those Faculties which treat of matters that_are close to Christian revelation should_also be mindful of the orders which Christ , the Supreme Teacher , gave to His Church regarding this ministry : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt . From this it follows_that there_must be in these Faculties that adherence by which_they_are joined to the full doctrine of Christ , whose authentic guardian and interpreter has_always_been through the ages the Magisterium of the Church . Bishops Conferences in the individual nations and regions where these Faculties exist must diligently see to their care and progress , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that_they ceaselessly promote their fidelity to the Church s doctrine , so that_these Faculties may bear_witness before the whole community of the faithful to their wholehearted following of the above mentioned command of Christ . This witness must_always be borne both by the Faculty as such and by each_and_every member of the Faculty . Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties have_been constituted in the Church for the building up and perfecting of Christ s faithful , and they must_always bear this in mind as a criterion in the carrying_out of their_work . Teachers are invested with very weighty responsibility in fulfilling a special ministry of the word of God and in being instructors of the faith for the young . Let them , above all , therefore be for their students , and for the rest of the faithful , witnesses of the living truth of the Gospel and examples of fidelity to the Church . It -isaia- fitting to recall_the serious words of Pope Paul VI : '' The task of the theologian -isaia- carried_out with_a_view to building up ecclesial_communion so that the People of God may grow in the experience of faith . '' V To attain these purposes , Ecclesiastical Faculties should be organized in such_a_way as to respond to the new demands of the present_day . For this_reason , the Second Vatican Council stated_that their laws should be subjected to revision . In fact , the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus , promulgated by my Predecessor Pope Pius XI on May , , did much in its time renew higher ecclesiastical studies . However , as a result of changed circumstances , it now needs to be suitably adapted and altered . In the course of nearly fifty years great changes have taken_place not_only in civil_society but_also in the Church herself . Important events , especially_the Second Vatican Council , have occurred , events which_have affected both the internal life of the Church and her external relationships with Christians of other_churches , with non Christians , and with non believers , as well as with all those in favour of a more_human civilization . In addition , there_-isaia- a steadily growing interest being shown in the theological sciences , not_only among the clergy but_also by lay_people , who_are attending theological schools in increasing numbers . These schools have , as a consequence , greatly multiplied in recent_times . Finally , a new attitude has arisen about the structure of universities and Faculties , both civil and ecclesiastical . This -isaia- a result of the justified desire_for a university life open to greater participation , a desire felt by all those in any_way involved in university life . Nor can one ignore the great evolution that_has taken_place in pedagogical and didactic methods , which call_for new ways of organizing studies . Then too there_-isaia- the closer connection that_-isaia- being felt more_and_more between various sciences and disciplines , as well as the desire_for greater cooperation in the whole university environment . To meet these new demands , the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , responding to the mandate received_from_the Council , already in began to study the question of renewal along the lines indicated by the Council . On May , , it promulgated the Normae quaedam ad Constitutionem Apostolicam '' Deus Scientiarum Dominus '' de studiis academicis ecclesiasticis recognoscendam , which_has exercised a beneficial influence during recent_years . VI Now , however , this_work needs to be completed and perfected with a new law . This law , abrogating the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus and the Norms of Application attached to it , as well as the Normae quaedam published on May , , by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , includes some still valid elements from_these documents , while laying down new norms whereby_the renewal that has_already successfully begun can be developed and completed . Nobody -isaia- unaware of the difficulties that appear to impede the promulgation of a new Apostolic Constitution . In the first_place , there_-isaia- the '' passage of time '' which brings changes so rapidly that it seems impossible to lay_down anything stable and permanent . Then there_-isaia- the '' diversity of places '' which seems to call_for a pluralism which_would make it appear almost impossible to issue common norms , valid for all parts_of_the_world . Since however there exist Ecclesiastical Faculties throughout_the_world , which_are erected and approved by the Holy See and which grant academic_degrees in its name , it -isaia- necessary_that a certain substantial unity be respected and that the requisites for gaining academic_degrees be clearly laid_down and have universal value . Things which_are necessary and which_are foreseen as being relatively stable must be set down by law , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a proper freedom must be left for introducing into the Statutes of the individual Faculties further specifications , taking into_account varying local conditions and the university customs obtaining in each region . In this_way , legitimate progress in academic studies -isaia- neither hindered nor restricted , but_rather -isaia-_directed through right channels towards obtaining better results . Moreover , together_with_the legitimate differentiation of the Faculties , the unity of the Catholic Church in these centres of education will_also be clear to everyone . Therefore , the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , by command of my Predecessor Pope Paul VI , has consulted first of all , the Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties themselves , then , the departments of the Roman Curia and the other bodies interested . After this , it established a commission of experts who , under the direction of the same Congregation , have carefully reviewed the legislation covering ecclesiastical academic studies . This work has now been successfully completed , and Pope Paul VI was about to promulgate this Constitution , as he so ardently desired to do , when he died ; likewise Pope John Paul I was prevented by sudden death from doing so . After long and careful consideration of the matter , I decree and lay_down , by my apostolic authority , the following laws and norms . NORMS OF APPLICATION OF THE CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION FOR THE CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION VERITATIS GAUDIUM The Congregation for Catholic Education , according to article of the Apostolic Constitution Veritatis Gaudium , presents to the Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties the following Norms of Application and orders that_they be faithfully observed . PART ONE GENERAL NORMS Section I Nature and Purpose of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The norms on Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties are_also to be applied to the other institutions of higher education , taking into_account their particular nature , congrua congruis referendo , which_have_been canonically erected or approved by the Holy See with the right to confer academic_degrees by the authority of the same See . Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties , as well as the other institutions of higher education , are normally subject to evaluation by the Holy See s Agency for the Evaluation and Promotion of Quality in Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties AVEPRO . With a view to promoting scientific_research , a strong recommendation -isaia- given for specialized research centres , scientific periodicals and collections , and meetings of learned societies , as well as all other suitable forms of scientific cooperation . The tasks for_which students can be prepared can be either strictly scientific , such as research or teaching , or else pastoral . Account must_be_taken of this diversity in the curriculum of studies and in the determining of the academic_degrees , while always preserving the scientific nature of the studies for both . Active participation in the ministry of evangelization concerns the action of the Church in pastoral_work , in ecumenism , and in missionary undertakings . It also extends to the understanding , defence and diffusion of the faith . At the same_time it extends to the whole context of culture and human_society . Bishops Conferences , collaborating with the Apostolic See in these_matters also , are thus to follow carefully both Universities and Faculties : . together_with_the Chancellor they_are to foster their progress and , while of course respecting the autonomy of science according to the mind of the Second Vatican Council , they_are to be solicitous for their scientific and ecclesial condition ; . with_regard to common problems which occur within_the boundaries of their_own region , they_are to help , inspire , and harmonize their activity ; . while always maintaining a high scientific level , they_are to take_care that_there_-isaia- an adequate number of such academic institutions , corresponding to the needs of the Church and cultural progress in their_own region ; . to do all this , they_are to constitute among_themselves a commission for this_purpose , which_should be helped by experts . An institution upon which_the Congregation for Catholic Education has conferred the right to grant only academic_degrees of the second and third cycle -isaia- called an '' Institute ad instar Facultatis '' . In preparing the Statutes and Plan of Studies , the norms in Appendix I of these Norms of Application must be kept in mind . In accordance_with_the procedures established in the Statutes , Universities and Faculties can , on their_own authority , establish By Laws that , while following the Statutes , define in more detail matters relating to their constitution , governance and procedures . The canonical value of an academic degree means_that such a degree enables one to assume an office in the Church for_which a degree -isaia- required . This -isaia- , first of all , for teaching sacred sciences in Faculties , major seminaries , or equivalent institutions . The conditions to be fulfilled for the recognition of individual degrees mentioned in article of the Apostolic Constitution , besides the consent of the relevant local or regional ecclesiastical authorities , concern , first of all , the college of teachers , the Plan of Studies , and the means to support scientific work . Degrees thus recognized , for certain canonical effects only , may never be considered simply as equal to academic canonical degrees . Section II The Academic Community and Its Government Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The duties of the Chancellor are : . to promote continually the progress of the University or Faculty , to advance its scientific progress and its ecclesiastical identity , to ensure_that Catholic doctrine -isaia- integrally followed , and to enforce the faithful implementation of the Statutes and the prescriptions of the Holy See ; . to help ensure close relationships between all the different ranks and members of the community ; . to propose to the Congregation for Catholic Education the names of those_who , according to the norm of art . of the Apostolic Constitution , are to be nominated or confirmed as Rector , President or Dean , as well as the names of the teachers for_whom a nihil obstat -isaia- to be requested ; . to receive the profession_of_faith of the Rector or President or Dean ; . to give to or take away from the teachers the canonical mission or permission to teach , according to the norms of the Constitution ; . to request the nihil obstat of the Congregation for the conferral of honorary doctorates ; . to inform the Congregation for Catholic Education about more_important matters and to send to that Congregation every five years a detailed report on the academic , moral , and economic condition of the University or Faculty , and its strategic plan , along_with his_own judgement , following the schema drawn up by the same Congregation . If the University or Faculty depends upon a collegial entity for instance , on a Bishops Conference , one designated member of the group -isaia- to exercise the office of Chancellor . The local Ordinary , if he -isaia- not the Chancellor , since he has the pastoral responsibility_for his Diocese , -isaia- , whenever something in the University or Faculty -isaia- known to be contrary to doctrine , morals , or ecclesiastical discipline , to take the matter to the Chancellor so that the latter may take action . In case the Chancellor does nothing , the Ordinary may have_recourse to the Holy See , without prejudice to his_own obligation to provide personally for action in those cases which_are more_serious or urgent and which carry danger for his Diocese . The appointment or confirmation mentioned in article of the Apostolic Constitution -isaia-_also required_for a subsequent term of office for the office holders cited . What -isaia- contained in article of the Constitution must be explained further in the proper Statutes of the University or those of the individual Faculties , giving more weight , as the case may require , either to collegial or else to personal government , while always preserving both forms . Account should be taken of the university practice of the region where_the Faculty -isaia- located or of the Religious Institute on which_the Faculty may depend . Besides the University Council Academic Senate and the Faculty Council , both of which_must everywhere exist even if under different names , the Statutes can suitably establish other special councils or commissions for directing and promoting various sectors : scientific , pedagogy , discipline , finances , etc . According to the Constitution , a Rector -isaia- one_who presides over a University ; a President -isaia- one_who presides over an Institute or a Faculty sui iuris ; a Dean -isaia- one_who presides over a Faculty which_-isaia- a part of a University ; Director -isaia- one_who presides over an academic institute that_-isaia- aggregated or incorporated . The Statutes are to fix a term of office for these offices and are to determine in what way and how_many consecutive times their term can be renewed . It belongs to the office of the Rector or President : . to direct , promote , and coordinate all the activity of the academic community ; . to be the representative of the University or of the Institute or Faculty sui iuris ; . to convoke the Council of the University or of the Institute or Faculty sui iuris and preside over the same according to the norms of the Statutes ; . to watch over the administration of temporalities ; . to refer more_important matters to the Chancellor ; . to ensure_that , every year , the institution s data in the data base of the Congregation for Catholic Education be updated electronically . The Dean of the Faculty -isaia- : . to promote and coordinate all the activity of the Faculty , especially matters regarding studies , and to see to providing with due speed for their needs ; . to convoke the Faculty Council and preside over it ; . to admit or exclude students in the name of the Rector according to the norms of the Statutes ; . to refer to the Rector what_-isaia- done or proposed by the Faculty ; . to see_that the instructions of higher authorities are carried_out ; . to update electronically , -atti_degli_apostoli- least once a year , the institution s data in the data base of the Congregation for Catholic Education . Section III Teachers Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . Teachers who_are permanently attached to a Faculty are , in the first_place , those_who_are assumed in full and firm right and who are_called Ordinary Professors . Next come Extraordinary Professors . It can_also be useful to have others , according to university practice . Faculties must_have a minimum number of permanent teachers : twelve for the Faculty of Theology and , if necessary , -atti_degli_apostoli- least three with the required degrees in philosophy , q . Norms of Application , article ; seven for the Faculty of Philosophy ; and five for the Faculty of Canon Law . Moreover , there_must be either five or four in Higher Institutes of Religious Sciences , depending on whether the Institute has both the first and second cycle , or only the first cycle . All other Faculties must_have -atti_degli_apostoli- least five permanent teachers . Besides permanent teachers , there_are usually others_who are designated by various titles , in the first_place those invited from other Faculties . Finally , to carry_out certain academic functions it -isaia-_also opportune to have Assistants , who must possess an appropriate degree . By a suitable Doctorate -isaia- meant one_that corresponds to the discipline to be taught . In the Faculties of Theology and Canon Law , if the discipline -isaia- sacred or connected_with_the sacred , the Doctorate must normally be canonical . In the event that the Doctorate -isaia- not canonical , -atti_degli_apostoli- least the canonical Licentiate -isaia- required . In all other Faculties , if the teacher has neither a canonical Doctorate nor a canonical Licentiate , he or she_can be appointed as a permanent teacher only on condition that_his or her formation_-isaia- coherent with the identity of an Ecclesiastical Faculty . In evaluating candidates_for teaching posts , it will be necessary to pay heed not_only to their necessary expertise in the area to which_they_are being assigned to teach , but_also to whether their publications and teaching are consonant with , and adhere to , the truth that_-isaia- transmitted by the faith . Teachers belonging to other churches_and_ecclesial_communities , co opted according to the norms of competent ecclesiastical authority , require permission to teach from the Chancellor . Teachers belonging to other churches_and_ecclesial_communities cannot teach doctrinal courses in the first cycle , but can teach other disciplines . In the second cycle , they_can be called_upon as invited teachers . The Statutes must establish when a permanent status -isaia- conferred in relationship_with the obtaining of the nihil obstat that_must be procured in accordance_with article of the Constitution . The nihil obstat of the Holy See -isaia- the declaration that , in accordance_with_the Constitution and the special Statutes , there appears nothing to impede a nomination which_-isaia- proposed , but it does_not , of itself , confer a right to teach . If some impediment should exist , this_will be communicated to the Chancellor who_will listen to the teacher in regard to the matter . If particular circumstances of time or place impede the requesting of the nihil obstat from the Holy See , the Chancellor -isaia- to take counsel with the Congregation for Catholic Education to find a suitable solution . In Faculties which_are under special concordat law the established norms are to be followed and , if they exist , those particular norms decreed by the Congregation for Catholic Education . The time interval between promotions , which_must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least three years , -isaia- to be set down in the Statutes . Teachers , first of all the permanent ones , are to seek to collaborate with each_other . It -isaia-_also recommended that_there be collaboration with the teachers of other Faculties , especially_those with subjects that_have an affinity or some connection_with those of the Faculty . One cannot be -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time a permanent teacher in more_than one Faculty . The Statutes are to set_out with care the procedure in regard to the suspension or removal of a teacher , especially in matters concerning doctrine . Care must_be_taken that , first of all , these_matters be settled between_the Rector or President or Dean and the teacher himself . If they_are_not settled there , the matters should be dealt_with by an appropriate Council or committee , so that the first examination of the facts be carried_out within_the University or Faculty itself . If this_-isaia-_not sufficient , the matters are to be referred to the Chancellor , who , with the help of experts , either of the University or the Faculty or from other places , must consider_the matter and provide_for a solution . The teacher must_always be afforded the right to know_the cause and the evidence , as well as the right to explain and defend his or her_own reasons . The right remains for recourse to the Holy See for a definitive solution of the case . However , in more grave or urgent cases , for the good of the students and the faithful , the Chancellor can suspend the teacher for the duration of the regular procedure . Diocesan clerics and Religious or those equivalent to them , in order to be teachers in a Faculty and to remain as such , must_have the consent of their_proper Ordinary , Hierarch or Superior , following the norms established in these_matters by competent Church authority . Section IV Students Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The legitimate documentation , mentioned in article of the Constitution : . about the student s moral_life : for clergy , seminarians and Religious , this_-isaia- to be given by their_own Ordinary , Hierarch or Superior , or by one delegated by them ; for all other persons , by some Church person ; . about previous studies : this_-isaia- in the academic level required by the norm of article of the Constitution . Since the studies required before entry into a University differ from one country to another , the Faculty has the right and duty to investigate from the documentation whether all the disciplines have_been studied which_the Faculty itself considers necessary . A suitable knowledge of the Latin language -isaia- required_for the Faculties of the sacred sciences , so that the students can understand and use the sources of these sciences as well as the documents of the Church . If one of the disciplines has_been found not to have_been studied or to have_been studied in an insufficient way , the Faculty -isaia- to require that_this be made up -atti_degli_apostoli- a suitable time and verified by an examination . Besides ordinary students , that_-isaia- , those studying for academic_degrees , extraordinary students can be allowed to attend the courses , according to the norms determined in the Statutes . The transfer of a student from one Faculty to another can take_place only -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the academic year or semester , after a careful examination of his academic and disciplinary situation . But in any event nobody can be given an academic degree unless all the requirements for the degree are fulfilled as the Statutes and Plan of Studies demand . In the norms which determine the suspension or the expulsion of a student from a Faculty , the student s right to defend himself or herself must be safeguarded . Section V Officials and Administrative and Service Personnel Apostolic Constitution , article Section VI Plan of Studies Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The Plan of Studies requires the approval of the Congregation for Catholic Education . The Plan of Studies of each Faculty must define which disciplines principal and auxiliary are obligatory and must be followed by all , and which_are free or optional . Equally , the Plan of Studies -isaia- to determine the practical exercises and seminars in which_the students must_not only be present but_also actively work together_with their colleagues and produce their_own written papers . The lectures and practical exercises are to be suitably distributed so as to foster private study and personal work under_the_guidance of the teachers . Part of the courses can be realized by distance learning , if the Plan of Studies approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education foresees it and specifies its conditions , especially as regards the examinations . The Statutes or Rule of the University or of the Faculty are_also to determine in what way the examiners are to make_their judgments about candidates . In the final judgment about the candidates_for the individual academic_degrees , account -isaia- to be taken of all the marks received in the various tests in the same cycle , whether written or oral . In the examinations for the giving of degrees , especially_the Doctorate , it -isaia-_also useful to invite examiners from outside the Faculty . Section VII Academic Degrees and Other Awards Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In Ecclesiastical Universities or Faculties which_are canonically erected or approved , the academic_degrees are given by authority of the Holy See . The Statutes are to establish the necessary requisites for the preparation of the doctoral dissertation and the norms for its public defence and publication . Publishing the dissertation electronically -isaia- admissible , if the Plan of Studies foresees it and determines its conditions , in such_a_way_that the dissertation be permanently accessible . A printed copy of the published dissertation must be sent to the Congregation for Catholic Education . It -isaia- recommended that copies also be sent to other Ecclesiastical Faculties , -atti_degli_apostoli- least those of the same region , which deal_with the same sciences . Authentic documents regarding the conferring of degrees are to be signed by the academic authorities , according to the Statutes , and then countersigned by the Secretary of the University or Faculty and have_the appropriate seal affixed . In countries where_the international conventions stipulated by the Holy See require it , and in institutions where_the academic authorities deem it opportune , as well as the authentic documents of the academic_degrees there_-isaia-_also to be a document with further information regarding the curriculum of studies completed for example , the Diploma Supplement . Honorary doctorates are_not to be conferred except with the consent of the Chancellor , who must first obtain the nihil obstat of the Holy See and listen to the opinion of the University or Faculty Council . So that a Faculty may grant other degrees , other_than the academic_degrees conferred by authority of the Holy See , it -isaia- necessary_that : . the Congregation for Catholic Education has_given its nihil obstat for the conferral of the degree in question ; . the respective Plan of Studies establishes the nature of the degree , indicating expressly that_it_-isaia- not an academic degree conferred by authority of the Holy See ; . the Diploma itself declares that the degree -isaia- not conferred by authority of the Holy See . Section VIII Didactic Facilities Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The University or Faculty must_have lecture halls which_are truly functional and worthy and suited to the teaching of the various disciplines and to the number of students . There must be a library open for consultation , in which_are available the principal works required_for the scientific work of both teachers and students . Library norms are to be established in such_a_way_that access and use are made particularly easy for teachers and students . Cooperation and coordination between libraries of the same city and region should be fostered . Section IX Financial Administration Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . To provide_for continuous good administration , the academic authorities must inform themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- set times about the financial situation and they_must provide_for careful , periodic audits . The Rector or President -isaia- to transmit an annual report to the Chancellor on the economic situation of the University or Faculty . Suitable ways should be found so that tuition fees do not prevent access to academic_degrees for intellectually gifted students who give good hope of one_day being most useful to the Church . Therefore care must_be_taken to set up for the students benefit particular forms of economic subsidy , funded by the Church , civil authorities or privately . Section X Strategic Planning and Cooperation of Faculties Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In order to undertake the erection of a new University or Faculty , it -isaia- necessary_that : a a true need or usefulness can be demonstrated , which_cannot be satisfied by affiliation , aggregation , or incorporation , b the necessary prerequisites are present , which_are mainly : . permanently engaged teachers who in number and quality respond to the nature and demands of a Faculty ; . a suitable number of students ; . a library with instruments for scientific work , and lecture halls ; . economic means really sufficient for a University or Faculty ; c the Statutes , together_with_the Plan of Studies , be presented , which_are to be in conformity_with this Constitution and with_these Norms of Application . The Congregation for Catholic Education after listening to the advice both of the Bishops Conference and of the diocesan or eparchial Bishop , mainly from the pastoral viewpoint , and next of experts , principally from nearby Faculties , mainly from the scientific viewpoint will decide about the suitability of a new erection . When , on the other_hand , the approval of a University or Faculty -isaia- undertaken , this_-isaia- to be done : a after_the consent of both the Bishops Conference and of the diocesan or eparchial Bishop has_been obtained ; b after_the conditions stated in article , , under b and c are fulfilled . The conditions for affiliation regard , above all , the number and qualification of teachers , the Plan of Studies , the library , and the duty of the affiliating Faculty to help the institution being affiliated . Therefore , it -isaia- usually required that the affiliating Faculty and the affiliated Institute be in the same country or cultural region . Aggregation -isaia- the linking of some Institute with a Faculty , and embraces only the first and second cycles , for the purpose of granting the corresponding academic_degrees through the Faculty . Incorporation -isaia- the insertion of some Institute into a Faculty , which embraces either the second or third cycle or both , for the purpose of granting the corresponding academic_degrees through the Faculty . Aggregation and incorporation cannot be granted unless the Institute -isaia- adequately equipped to pursue those specific academic_degrees , in such_a_way that_there_-isaia- a well founded hope_that , through the connection_with the Faculty , the desired ends will be achieved . Cooperation -isaia- to be fostered among the Ecclesiastical Faculties themselves by means of teacher exchanges , mutual communication of scientific work , and the promoting of common research for the benefit of the People of God . Cooperation with_other Faculties , even non Catholic ones , should be promoted , care always however being taken to preserve one_s_own identity . PART TWO SPECIAL NORMS Section I Faculty of Theology Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The theological disciplines are to be taught in such_a_way_that their organic connection -isaia- made clear and that light be shed upon the various aspects or dimensions that pertain intrinsically to the nature of sacred doctrine . The chief ones are the biblical , patristic , historical , liturgical , and pastoral dimensions . The students are to be led to a deep grasp of the material , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as they_are led to form a personal synthesis , to acquire a mastery of the method of scientific_research , and thus to become able to explain sacred doctrine appropriately . In presenting doctrine , those norms are to be followed which_are in the documents of the Second Vatican Council , as well as those found in more_recent documents of the Holy See insofar as these pertain to academic studies . The obligatory disciplines are : . In the first cycle : a The philosophical disciplines needed_for theology , which_are above all systematic philosophy and the history of philosophy ancient , medieval , modern , contemporary . Besides a general introduction , the systematic teaching must include the main areas of philosophy : metaphysics understood as philosophy of being and natural theology , philosophy of nature , philosophy of man , moral and political philosophy , logic and philosophy of knowledge . Excluding the human sciences , the strictly philosophical disciplines q . , , a must constitute -atti_degli_apostoli- least of the number of credits in the first two years . Each year must include a number of credits suited to one year of full time university studies . It -isaia- highly preferable that the philosophy courses be concentrated in the first two years of philosophical theological formation . Within this two year period , these philosophical studies , which_are undertaken in view of theology studies , will be integrated with the introductory theology courses . b the theological disciplines , namely : Sacred Scripture : introduction and exegesis ; fundamental theology , which also includes reference to ecumenism , non Christian religions , and atheism , as well as other currents of contemporary culture ; dogmatic theology ; moral and spiritual theology ; pastoral theology ; liturgy ; Church history , patrology , archaeology ; Canon law . c the auxiliary disciplines , namely , some of the sciences of man and , besides Latin , the biblical languages insofar as they_are required_for the following cycles . In the second cycle : the particular disciplines established in various sections , according to the diverse specializations offered , along_with the practical exercises and seminars , including a special written dissertation . In the third cycle : the Plan of Studies -isaia- to determine if particular disciplines are to be taught and which ones , together_with practical exercises and seminars , as well as what ancient and modern languages the student must be able to understand to be able to write his or her thesis . In the five year basic cycle , diligent care_must be exercised that all the disciplines are taught with order , fullness , and with correct method , so that the student receives harmoniously and effectively a solid , organic , and complete basic instruction in theology , which will_enable him either to go on to the next cycle s higher studies or to exercise some office in the Church . The number of professors who teach philosophy must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least three , who have_the required degrees in philosophy q . They must be permanent , i . dedicated full time to the teaching of philosophy and to research in that field . Besides examinations or equivalent tests for each discipline , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the first and of the second cycle there_-isaia- to be a comprehensive examination or equivalent test , so that the student proves that he or she_has fully achieved the scientific formation intended by the respective cycle . It belongs to the Faculty to determine under what conditions students who_have completed the curriculum of studies in philosophy and theology in a major seminary or in some other approved institute of higher learning may be admitted into the second cycle , taking careful account of their previous studies and , where necessary , prescribing special courses and examinations . Section II Faculty of Canon Law Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In a Faculty of Canon Law , whether Latin or Oriental , there_must be a careful setting forth both of the history and texts of ecclesiastical laws and of their disposition and connection , as well as their theological foundations . The following disciplines are obligatory : . In the first cycle a elements of philosophy : philosophical anthropology , metaphysics , ethics ; b elements of theology : an introduction to Sacred Scripture ; fundamental theology ; the transmission and credibility of divine_revelation ; Trinitarian theology ; Christology ; divine_grace ; in a special_way , ecclesiology ; general and special sacramental theology ; fundamental and special moral theology ; c fundamental canonical structures institutiones generales of canon_law ; d Latin . In the second cycle a The books of the Code of Canon Law or the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , in all their parts , and the other norms in force ; b Related disciplines : the theology of canon_law ; the philosophy of law ; fundamental concepts of Roman law ; elements of civil law ; the history of the fundamental canonical structures of canon_law ; the history of the sources of canon_law ; the relationship_between_the Church and civil_society ; canonical administrative and judicial praxis ; c an introduction to the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches for students -atti_degli_apostoli- a Latin Faculty of Canon Law ; and introduction to the Code of Canon Law for students -atti_degli_apostoli- an Oriental Faculty of Canon Law ; d Latin ; e the optional courses , exercises and seminars as required by each faculty . In the third cycle a canonical Latin b optional courses or exercises as required by each faculty . Students who successfully completed the philosophical theological curriculum in a major seminary or in a theological faculty can be admitted immediately into the second cycle , unless the Dean deems it necessary or opportune , prior to their admittance , to require that_they take a preliminary course in Latin or in the fundamental concepts of canon_law . Students who prove they_have studied some of the subjects of the first cycle -atti_degli_apostoli- an appropriate faculty or university level institute may be dispensed from them . Students who hold an academic degree in civil law may be dispensed from some courses of the second cycle such as Roman law and civil law , but may_not be exempt from the three year curriculum of studies for the Licentiate . After completing the second cycle , students must know Latin in such_a_way as to be able to understand thoroughly the Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , as well as the other canonical documents . In the third cycle , as well as the knowledge of Latin necessary so that_they_can interpret correctly the sources of law , they must_also know_the other languages necessary_for writing their dissertation . Besides examinations or equivalent tests for each discipline , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second cycle there_-isaia- to be a comprehensive examination or equivalent test , whereby_the student proves that he or she_has fully received_the scientific formation demanded by the second cycle . Section III Faculty of Philosophy Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The research and teaching of philosophy in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy must be rooted in the '' philosophical patrimony which_-isaia- perennially valid '' , which_has developed throughout_the history , with special_attention being given to the work of Saint Thomas Aquinas . At the same_time , the philosophy taught in an Ecclesiastical Faculty must be open to the contributions that more_recent research has provided and continues to offer . One must emphasize the sapiential and metaphysical dimensions of philosophy . In the first cycle , philosophy -isaia- to be taught in such_a_way_that the students in the basic cycle will come to a solid and coherent synthesis of doctrine , will learn to examine and judge the different systems of philosophy , and will_also gradually become accustomed to personal philosophical reflection . If students of the first cycle of theological studies attend first cycle courses in the Faculty of Philosophy , care must_be_taken to safeguard the specific nature of the content and purpose of each educational track . At the end of the philosophical formation , an academic degree in philosophy -isaia- not awarded q . a , but the students can ask for a certificate attesting to the courses they_have attended and the credits they_have obtained . The formation acquired in the first cycle can be completed in the successive cycle , where one begins to specialize via greater concentration on one area of philosophy and greater dedication of the student to philosophical reflection . It -isaia- appropriate to distinguish clearly between , on the one_hand , studies in Ecclesiastical Faculties of Philosophy and , on the other_hand , the philosophical courses that form an integral part of the studies in a Faculty of Theology or in a major seminary . In an institution which_has , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , both an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy and a Faculty of Theology , when_the philosophy courses that_are part of the five year first cycle of theology are taken -atti_degli_apostoli- the Faculty of Philosophy , the authority who makes decisions regarding the programme -isaia- the Dean of the Faculty of Theology , who will_make those decisions in conformity_with_the law in force , and while favouring close collaboration with the Faculty of Philosophy . In the teaching of philosophy , the relevant norms should be observed which_are contained in the documents of the Second Vatican Council and in other recent documents of the Holy See concerning academic studies insofar as they_also concern academic studies . The disciplines taught in various cycles are : . In the first cycle : a The obligatory basic subjects : A general introduction which aims , in particular , -atti_degli_apostoli- showing the sapiential dimension of philosophy . The main philosophical disciplines : metaphysics understood as philosophy of being and natural theology , philosophy of nature , philosophy of man , moral and political philosophy , logic and philosophy of knowledge . Given the particular importance of metaphysics , an adequate number of credits must be accorded to this discipline . The history of philosophy : ancient , medieval , modern , and contemporary . Careful examination of the various currents of thought are to be accompanied , when possible , by the reading of texts of the more_important authors . Depending on requirements , a study of local philosophies -isaia- to be added . The obligatory basic subjects must constitute -atti_degli_apostoli- least and must_not exceed of the number of credits of the first cycle . b The supplementary obligatory subjects : A study of the relationship_between reason and Christian faith \u2013 that_-isaia- , between philosophy and theology \u2013 from a systematic and historical point_of_view , paying attention to safeguarding both the autonomy of each field as well as their interconnection . Latin , so as to be able to understand_the philosophical works especially of Christian authors written in that language . The student s knowledge of Latin must be verified within_the first two years . A modern language other_than one s mother tongue , the knowledge of which_must be verified before the end of the third year . An introduction to the methodology of study and of scientific_research , which serves also as an introduction to the use of research tools and the practice of disputation . c The optional additional subjects : Principles of literature and the arts ; Principles of some of the human sciences or some of the natural sciences for example , psychology , sociology , history , biology or physics . In a particular_way , care must_be_taken to establish a connection_between the sciences and philosophy . Some other optional philosophical disciplines : for example , philosophy of science , philosophy of culture , philosophy of art , philosophy of technology , philosophy of language , philosophy of law or philosophy of religion . In the second cycle : some special disciplines established in various sections , according to the diverse specializations offered , along_with practical exercises and seminars , including special Licentiate dissertation . Beginners or advanced ancient Greek , or a second modern language other_than that required_for the first cycle or an advanced study of the same . In the third cycle : The Plan of Studies of the Faculty -isaia- to determine if special disciplines are to be taught and which ones , together_with_the practical exercises and seminars . It -isaia- necessary to acquire a knowledge of another language , or to acquire an advanced knowledge of one of the languages previously studied . The faculty must employ , on a full time basis , -atti_degli_apostoli- least seven duly qualified teachers , who thus can ensure the teaching of each of the obligatory basic subjects q . In particular , the first cycle must_have -atti_degli_apostoli- least five permanent teachers allotted as follows : one in metaphysics , one in philosophy of nature , one in philosophy of man , one in moral philosophy and politics , one in logic and philosophy of knowledge . For the other obligatory and optional subjects , the faculty can ask the help of other teachers . A teacher -isaia- qualified to teach in an Ecclesiastical institution if he or she_has obtained the necessary academic_degrees from an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy q . If the teacher possess neither a canonical Doctorate nor a canonical Licentiate , he or she may be appointed as permanent teacher only on the condition that_his or her philosophical training -isaia- consistent with the content and method that_-isaia- set_forth in an Ecclesiastical Faculty . In evaluating candidates_for teaching positions in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy , the following must be considered : the necessary expertise in their assigned subject ; an appropriate openness to the whole of knowledge ; adherence , in their publications and teaching , to the truth taught by the faith ; an adequately deepened knowledge of the harmonious relationship_between faith and reason . It -isaia- necessary to ensure always that , in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy , the majority of permanent teachers holds an ecclesiastical Doctorate in philosophy , or else an ecclesiastical Licentiate in a sacred science together_with a Doctorate in philosophy obtained in a non Ecclesiastical University . In general , so that a student can be admitted to the second cycle in philosophy , it -isaia- necessary_that he or she_has obtained the Ecclesiastical Baccalaureate in philosophy . If a student has studied philosophy in a non Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy -atti_degli_apostoli- a Catholic University or in another Institute of Higher Studies , he or she_can be admitted to the second cycle only after_having demonstrated , by means of an appropriate examination , that_his or her preparation -isaia- compatible with that_which_-isaia- set_forth in an Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy , and after_having filled any gaps with_respect to the years and curriculum foreseen for the first cycle as established in the present Norms of Application . The choice of courses must foster a synthesis of the subjects taught q . At the end of these supplementary studies , the student will be admitted to the second cycle without receiving the Ecclesiastical Baccalaureate in philosophy . Given the reform of the three year first cycle of ecclesiastical philosophical studies , which concludes with the Baccalaureate in philosophy , the philosophical affiliation must be in conformity_with what_has_been decreed for the first cycle regarding the number of years and the Plan of Studies q . The number of permanent teachers in an affiliated Institute of philosophy must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least five , with the required qualifications q . Given the reform of the two year second cycle of ecclesiastical philosophical studies , which concludes with the Licentiate in philosophy , the philosophical aggregation must be in conformity_with what_has_been decreed for the first and second cycles regarding the number of years and the Plan of Studies q . a and b ; Norms of Appl . The number of permanent teachers in an aggregated Institute of philosophy must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least six , with the required qualifications q . Given the reform of the philosophy course as part of the first cycle of philosophy theology studies , which concludes with the Baccalaureate in theology , the philosophy formation given in an affiliated Institute of theology must be in conformity_with what_has_been decreed with_regard to the Plan of Studies q . The number of permanent teachers of philosophy must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least two . Section IV Other Faculties Apostolic Constitution , articles Article .

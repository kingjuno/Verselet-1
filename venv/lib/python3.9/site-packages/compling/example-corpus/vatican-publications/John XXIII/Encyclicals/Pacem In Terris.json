Venerable Brethren and Dearest Sons Health and Apostolic Benediction . Peace on Earth which_man throughout_the ages has so longed for and sought after can_never be established , never guaranteed , except by the diligent observance of the divinely established order . Order in the Universe . That a marvelous order predominates in the world of living beings and in the forces of nature , -isaia- the plain lesson which_the progress of modern research and the discoveries of technology teach us . And it -isaia-_part of the greatness of man that he can appreciate that order , and devise the means_for harnessing those forces for his_own benefit . But what emerges first_and_foremost from the progress of scientific knowledge and the inventions of technology -isaia- the infinite greatness of God Himself , who created both man and the universe . Yes ; out of nothing He made all things , and filled them_with_the fullness of His own wisdom and goodness . Hence , these_are the words the holy psalmist used in praise of God : '' O Lord , our Lord : how admirable -isaia- thy name in the whole earth ! '' And elsewhere he says : '' How great are thy works , O Lord ! Thou hast made all things in wisdom . '' Moreover , a God created man '' in His own image_and_likeness , '' endowed him_with intelligence and freedom , and made him lord of creation . All this_the psalmist proclaims when he says : '' Thou hast made him a little less_than the angels : thou hast crowned him_with glory and honor , and hast set him over the works of thy hands . Thou hast subjected all things under his feet . '' Order in Human Beings . And yet there_-isaia- a disunity among individuals and among nations which_-isaia- in striking contrast to this perfect order in the universe . One would think_that the relationships that bind men together could only be governed by force . But the world s Creator has stamped man s inmost being with an order revealed to man by his conscience ; and his conscience insists on his preserving it . Men '' show the work of the law written in their_hearts . Their conscience bears_witness to them . '' And how could it be otherwise ? All created being reflects the infinite wisdom of God . It reflects it all the more_clearly , the higher it stands in the scale of perfection . But the mischief -isaia-_often caused by erroneous opinions . Many people think_that the laws which govern man s relations with the State are the same as those_which regulate the blind , elemental forces of the universe . But it -isaia- not so ; the laws which govern men_are quite different . The Father of the universe has inscribed them in man s nature , and that_-isaia- where we must look for them ; there and nowhere else . These laws clearly indicate how a man must behave toward his fellows in society , and how the mutual relationships between_the members of a State and its officials are to be conducted . They show too what principles must govern_the relations_between States ; and finally , what should be the relations_between individuals or States on the one_hand , and the world wide community of nations on the other . Men s common interests make it imperative that -atti_degli_apostoli- long last a world wide community of nations be established . ORDER BETWEEN MEN . We must devote our attention first of all to that order which_should prevail among_men . Any well regulated and productive association of men in society demands the acceptance of one fundamental principle : that each_individual man_-isaia- truly a person . His -isaia- a nature , that_-isaia- , endowed_with intelligence and free will . As such he has rights_and_duties , which together flow as a direct consequence from his nature . These rights_and_duties are universal and inviolable , and therefore altogether inalienable . When , furthermore , we consider man s personal_dignity from the standpoint of divine_revelation , inevitably our estimate of it -isaia- incomparably increased . Men have_been ransomed by the blood of Jesus Christ . Grace has made them sons and friends of God , and heirs to eternal glory . But first We must speak of man s rights . Man has the right to live . He has the right to bodily integrity and to the means necessary_for the proper development of life , particularly food , clothing , shelter , medical care , rest , and , finally , the necessary social services . In consequence , he has the right to be looked after in the event of illhealth ; disability stemming from his_work ; widowhood ; old age ; enforced unemployment ; or whenever through no fault of his_own he -isaia- deprived of the means of livelihood . Rights Pertaining to Moral and Cultural Values . Moreover , man_has a natural right to be respected . He has a right to his good name . He has a right to freedom in investigating the truth , and within_the limits of the moral_order and the common_good to freedom of speech and publication , and to freedom to pursue whatever profession he may choose . He has the right , also , to be accurately informed about public events . He has the natural right to share in the benefits of culture , and hence to receive a good general education , and a technical or professional training consistent with the degree of educational development in his_own country . Furthermore , a system must be devised for affording gifted members of society the opportunity of engaging in more advanced studies , with_a_view to their occupying , as far_as_possible , positions of responsibility in society in keeping_with their natural talent and acquired skill . The Right to Worship God According to One s Conscience . Also among man s rights -isaia- that of being able to worship God in accordance_with_the right dictates of his_own conscience , and to profess his religion both in private and in public . According to the clear teaching of Lactantius , '' this_-isaia- the very condition of our birth , that we render to the God who made us that just homage which_-isaia- His due ; that we acknowledge Him alone as God , and follow Him . It -isaia- from this ligature of piety , which binds us and joins us to God , that religion derives its name . '' l Hence , too , Pope Leo XIII declared that '' true freedom , freedom worthy of the sons of God , -isaia- that freedom which most truly safeguards the dignity_of_the_human_person . It -isaia- stronger than_any violence or injustice . Such -isaia- the freedom which has_always_been desired by the Church , and which_she holds most dear . It -isaia- the sort of freedom which_the Apostles resolutely claimed for themselves . The apologists defended it in their writings ; thousands of martyrs consecrated it with_their blood . '' The Right to Choose Freely One s State in Life . Human beings have_also the right to choose for themselves the kind of life_which appeals to them : whether it -isaia- to found a family in the founding of which both the man and the woman enjoy equal rights_and_duties or to embrace the priesthood or the religious_life . The family , founded upon marriage freely contracted , one and indissoluble , must be regarded as the natural , primary cell of human_society . The interests of the family , therefore , must_be_taken very specially into consideration in social_and_economic affairs , as well as in the spheres of faith_and_morals . For all of these have to do with strengthening the family and assisting it in the fulfilment of its mission . Of course , the support and education of children -isaia- a right which belongs primarily to the parents . In the economic sphere , it -isaia- evident_that a man_has the inherent right not_only to be given the opportunity to work , but_also to be allowed the exercise of personal initiative in the work he does . The conditions in which a man works form a necessary corollary to these rights . They must_not be such as to weaken his physical or moral fibre , or militate against the proper development of adolescents to manhood . Women must be accorded such conditions of work as are consistent with_their needs and responsibilities as wives and mothers . A further consequence of man s personal_dignity -isaia-_his right to engage in economic activities suited to his degree of responsibility . The worker -isaia- likewise entitled to a wage that_-isaia- determined in accordance_with_the precepts of justice . This needs stressing . The amount a worker receives must be sufficient , in proportion to available funds , to allow him and his family a standard of living consistent with human_dignity . Pope Pius XII expressed it in these terms : '' Nature imposes work upon man as a duty , and man_has the corresponding natural right to demand_that the work he does shall provide him_with the means of livelihood for_himself and his_children . Such -isaia- nature s categorical imperative for the preservation of man . As a further consequence of man s nature , he has the right to the private ownership of property , including that of productive goods . This , as We have_said elsewhere , -isaia- '' a right which constitutes so efficacious a means of asserting one s personality and exercising responsibility in every field , and an element of solidity and security for family_life , and of greater peace and prosperity in the State . Finally , it -isaia- opportune to point_out that the right to own private_property entails a social obligation as well . The Right of Meeting and Association . Men are by nature social , and consequently they_have the right to meet together and to form associations with_their fellows . They have_the right to confer on such associations the type of organization which_they consider best calculated to achieve their objectives . They have_also the right to exercise their_own initiative and act on their_own responsibility within these associations for the attainment of the desired results . As We insisted in Our encyclical Mater et Magistra , the founding of a great many such intermediate groups or societies for the pursuit of aims which_it_-isaia- not within_the competence of the individual to achieve efficiently , -isaia-_a_matter of great urgency . Such groups and societies must be considered absolutely essential for the safeguarding of man s personal freedom and dignity , while leaving intact a sense_of_responsibility . The Right to Emigrate and Immigrate . Again , every_human_being has the right to freedom of movement and of residence within_the confines of his_own State . When there_are just reasons in favor of it , he must be permitted to emigrate to other countries and take up residence there . The fact that_he_-isaia- a citizen of a particular State does_not deprive him of membership in the human_family , nor of citizenship in that universal society , the common , world wide fellowship of men . Finally , man s personal_dignity involves his right to take an active part in public_life , and to make his_own contribution to the common welfare of his fellow citizens . As Pope Pius XII said , '' man as such , far_from_being an object or , as it were , an inert element in society , -isaia- rather its subject , its basis and its purpose ; and so must he be esteemed . As a human_person he -isaia- entitled to the legal protection of his rights , and such protection must be effective , unbiased , and strictly just . To quote again Pope Pius XII : '' In consequence of that juridical order willed by God , man_has his_own inalienable right to juridical security . To him -isaia- assigned a certain , well defined sphere of law , immune from arbitrary attack . The natural rights of which We have so far been speaking are inextricably bound up with as many duties , all applying to one_and_the_same person . These rights_and_duties derive their origin , their sustenance , and their indestructibility from the natural_law , which in conferring the one imposes the other . Thus , for example , the right to live involves the duty to preserve one s life ; the right to a decent standard of living , the duty to live in a becoming fashion ; the right to be free to seek out the truth , the duty to devote oneself to an ever deeper and wider search_for it . Reciprocity of Rights and Duties Between Persons . Once this_-isaia- admitted , it follows_that in human_society one man s natural right gives_rise to a corresponding duty in other men ; the duty , that_-isaia- , of recognizing and respecting that right . Every basic human right draws its authoritative force from the natural_law , which confers it and attaches to it its respective duty . Hence , to claim one s rights and ignore one s duties , or only half fulfill them , -isaia- like building a house with one_hand and tearing it down with the other . Since men_are social by nature , they_must live together and consult each_other s interests . That men should recognize and perform their_respective rights_and_duties -isaia- imperative to a well ordered society . But the result will be that each_individual will_make his whole hearted contribution to the creation of a civic order in which rights_and_duties are ever_more diligently and more_effectively observed . For example , it -isaia- useless to admit that a man_has a right to the necessities of life , unless we also do all in our power to supply him_with means sufficient for his livelihood . Hence society must_not only be well ordered , it must_also provide men with abundant resources . This postulates not_only the mutual recognition and fulfillment of rights_and_duties , but_also the involvement and collaboration of all men in the many enterprises which_our present civilization makes possible , encourages or indeed demands . Man s personal_dignity requires besides that he enjoy freedom and be able to make up his_own mind when he acts . In his association with_his fellows , therefore , there_-isaia- every reason_why his recognition of rights , observance of duties , and many sided collaboration with_other men , should be primarily a matter of his_own personal decision . Each man should act on his_own initiative , conviction , and sense_of_responsibility , not under the constant pressure of external coercion or enticement . There -isaia- nothing human about a society that_-isaia- welded together by force . Far from encouraging , as it should , the attainment of man s progress and perfection , it -isaia- merely an obstacle to his freedom . Social Life in Truth , Justice , Charity and Freedom . Hence , before a society can be considered well ordered , creative , and consonant with human_dignity , it must be based on truth . Paul expressed this as follows : '' Putting away lying , speak ye the truth every man with_his neighbor , for we are members one of another . '' And so will it be , if each man acknowledges sincerely his_own rights and his_own duties toward others . Human society , as We here picture it , demands_that men be guided by justice , respect the rights of others and do their_duty . It demands , too , that_they be animated by such love as will make_them feel the needs of others as their_own , and induce them to share their goods with_others , and to strive in the world to make all men alike heirs to the noblest of intellectual and spiritual values . Nor -isaia- this enough ; for human_society thrives on freedom , namely , on the use of means which_are consistent with the dignity of its individual members , who , being endowed_with reason , assume responsibility_for their_own actions . And so , dearest sons and brothers , we must think of human_society as being primarily a spiritual reality . By its means enlightened men can share their knowledge of the truth , can claim their_rights and fulfill their_duties , receive encouragement in their aspirations for the goods of the spirit , share their enjoyment of all the wholesome pleasures of the world , and strive continually to pass on to others all that_-isaia- best in themselves and to make_their own the spiritual riches of others . It -isaia- these spiritual values_which exert a guiding influence on culture , economics , social institutions , political movements and forms , laws , and all the other components which go to make up the external community of men and its continual development . God and the Moral Order . Now the order which prevails in human society_-isaia- wholly incorporeal in nature . Its foundation -isaia- truth , and it must be brought into_effect by justice . It needs to be animated and perfected by men s love for one_another , and , while preserving freedom intact , it must make for an equilibrium in society_which -isaia- increasingly more_human in character . But such an order universal , absolute and immutable in its principles finds_its source in the true , personal and transcendent God . He -isaia-_the_first truth , the sovereign good , and as such the deepest source from which human_society , if it -isaia- to be properly constituted , creative , and worthy of man s dignity , draws its genuine vitality . This -isaia- what St . Thomas means when he says : '' Human reason -isaia- the standard which measures the degree of goodness of the human will , and as such it derives from the eternal law , which_-isaia- divine reason . Hence it -isaia- clear_that the goodness of the human will depends much_more on the eternal law than on human_reason . '' Characteristics of the Present Day . There are three things_which characterize our modern age . In the first_place we notice a progressive improvement in the economic_and_social condition of working men . They began by claiming their_rights principally in the economic_and_social spheres , and then proceeded to lay claim to their political rights as well . Finally , they_have turned their attention to acquiring the more cultural benefits of society . Today , therefore , working men all over the world are loud in their demands_that they_shall in no circumstances be subjected to arbitrary treatment , as though devoid of intelligence and freedom . They insist on being treated as human_beings , with a share in every sector of human_society : in the socio economic sphere , in government , and in the realm of learning and culture . Secondly , the part that women are_now playing in political_life -isaia- everywhere evident . This -isaia- a development that_-isaia- perhaps of swifter growth among Christian nations , but_it_-isaia- also happening extensively , if more slowly , among nations that_are heirs to different traditions and imbued_with a different culture . Women are gaining an increasing awareness of their natural dignity . Far from being content with a purely passive role or allowing themselves to be regarded as a kind of instrument , they_are demanding both in domestic and in public_life the rights_and_duties which belong to them as human persons . Finally , we are confronted in this modern age with a form of society_which -isaia- evolving on entirely new social and political lines . Since all peoples have either attained political independence or are on the way to attaining it , soon no nation will rule over another and none will be subject to an alien power . Thus all over the world men_are either the citizens of an independent State , or are shortly to become so ; nor_-isaia- any nation nowadays content to submit to foreign domination . The longstanding inferiority complex of certain classes because_of_their economic_and_social status , sex , or position in the State , and the corresponding superiority complex of other classes , -isaia- rapidly becoming a thing of the past . Today , on the contrary the conviction -isaia- widespread that all men_are equal in natural dignity ; and so , on the doctrinal and theoretical level , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , no form of approval -isaia- being given to racial discrimination . All this_-isaia- of supreme significance for the formation of a human_society animated by the principles We have mentioned above , for_man s awareness of his rights must inevitably lead him to the recognition of his duties . The possession of rights involves the duty of implementing those rights , for they_are the expression of a man s personal_dignity . And the possession of rights also involves their recognition and respect by other people . When society_-isaia- formed on a basis of rights_and_duties , men_have an immediate grasp of spiritual and intellectual values , and have no difficulty in understanding what_-isaia- meant by truth , justice , charity and freedom . They become , moreover , conscious of being members of such a society . And that_-isaia-_not all . Inspired by such principles , they attain to a better knowledge of the true God a personal God transcending human_nature . They recognize_that their relationship_with God forms the very foundation of their_life the interior life of the spirit , and the life_which they live in the society of their fellows . RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES . Human society can be neither well ordered nor prosperous without_the presence of those_who , invested with legal authority , preserve its institutions and do all that_-isaia- necessary to sponsor actively the interests of all its_members . And they derive their authority from God , for , as St . Paul teaches , '' there_-isaia- no power but_from God '' . In his commentary on this passage , St . John Chrysostom writes : '' What are you saying ? Is every ruler appointed by God ? No , that_-isaia-_not what I mean , he says , for I -amos- not now talking about individual rulers , but about authority as such . My contention -isaia- that the existence of a ruling authority the fact_that some should command and others obey , and that all things not come about as the result of blind chance this_-isaia- a provision of divine wisdom . '' God has created men social by nature , and a society cannot '' hold together unless someone -isaia- in command to give effective direction and unity of purpose . Hence every civilized community must_have a ruling authority , and this authority , no less_than society itself , has its source in nature , and consequently has God for its author . But it must_not be imagined that authority knows no bounds . Since its starting point -isaia- the permission to govern in accordance_with right_reason , there_-isaia- no escaping the conclusion that it derives its binding force from the moral_order , which in turn has God as its origin and end . Hence , to quote Pope Pius XII , '' The absolute order of living beings , and the very purpose of man an autonomous being , the subject of duties and inviolable rights , and the origin and purpose of human_society have a direct bearing upon the State as a necessary community endowed_with authority . Divest it of this authority , and it -isaia- nothing , it -isaia- lifeless . But right_reason , and above all Christian faith , make it clear_that such an order can have no other origin but in God , a personal God , our Creator . Hence it -isaia- from Him that State officials derive their_dignity , for they share to some extent in the authority of God Himself . Hence , a regime which governs solely or mainly by means of threats and intimidation or promises of reward , provides men with no effective incentive to work_for the common_good . And even if it did , it would certainly be offensive to the dignity of free and rational human_beings . Authority -isaia- before all else a moral force . For this_reason_the appeal of rulers should be to the individual conscience , to the duty which_every man_has of voluntarily contributing to the common_good . But since all men_are equal in natural dignity , no man_has the capacity to force internal compliance on another . Only God can do that , for He alone scrutinizes and judges the secret counsels of the heart . Hence , representatives of the State have no power to bind men in conscience , unless their_own authority_-isaia- tied to God s authority , and -isaia- a participation in it . The application of this principle likewise safeguards the dignity of citizens . Their obedience to civil authorities -isaia- never an obedience paid to them as men . It -isaia- in reality an act of homage paid to God , the provident Creator of the universe , who_has decreed that_men s dealings with one_another be regulated in accordance_with that order which He Himself has established . And we men do not demean ourselves in showing due reverence to God . On the contrary , we are lifted up and ennobled in spirit , for to serve God -isaia- to reign . Governmental authority , therefore , -isaia- a postulate of the moral_order and derives from God . Consequently , laws and decrees passed in contravention of the moral_order , and hence of the divine will , can have no binding force in conscience , since '' it -isaia- right to obey God rather_than men '' . Indeed , the passing of such laws undermines the very nature of authority and results in shameful abuse . Thomas teaches , '' In regard to the second proposition , we maintain that_human law has the rationale of law in so far as it -isaia- in accordance_with right_reason , and as such it obviously derives from eternal law . A law which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with reason -isaia- to that extent unjust and has no longer the rationale of law . It -isaia- rather an act of violence . The fact_that authority comes_from God does_not_mean that men_have no power to choose those_who_are to rule_the State , or to decide upon the type of government they want , and determine the procedure and limitations of rulers in the exercise of their authority . Hence the above teaching_-isaia- consonant with any genuinely democratic form of government . Attainment of the Common Good -isaia- the Purpose of the Public Authority . Men , both as individuals and as intermediate groups , are required to make_their own specific contributions to the general welfare . The main consequence of this_-isaia- that_they must harmonize their_own interests with the needs of others , and offer their goods and services as their rulers shall direct assuming , of course , that justice -isaia- maintained and the authorities are acting within_the limits of their competence . Those who_have authority in the State must exercise that authority in a way which_-isaia-_not only morally irreproachable , but_also best calculated to ensure or promote the State s welfare . The attainment of the common_good -isaia- the sole reason_for the existence of civil authorities . In working for the common_good , therefore , the authorities must obviously respect its_nature , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time adjust their legislation to meet_the requirements of the given situation . Essentials of the Common Good . Among the essential elements of the common_good one_must certainly include the various characteristics distinctive of each_individual people . But these by no means constitute the whole of it . For the common_good , since_it_-isaia- intimately bound up with human_nature , can_never exist fully and completely unless the human person_-isaia- taken into_account -atti_degli_apostoli- all times . Thus , attention must be paid to the basic nature of the common_good and what it -isaia- that brings it about . We must add , therefore_,_that it -isaia- in the nature of the common_good that_every single citizen has the right to share in it although in different_ways , depending on his tasks , merits and circumstances . Hence every civil authority must strive to promote the common_good in the interest of all , without favoring any individual citizen or category of citizen . As Pope Leo XIII insisted : '' The civil_power must_not be subservient to the advantage of any_one individual , or of some few persons ; inasmuch as it was established for the common_good of all . '' Nevertheless , considerations of justice and equity can -atti_degli_apostoli- times demand_that those in power pay more attention to the weaker members of society , since these are_-atti_degli_apostoli- a disadvantage when it comes to defending their_own rights and asserting their legitimate interests . The Spiritual , Too . In this connection , We would draw the attention of Our own sons to the fact_that the common_good -isaia- something which affects the needs of the whole man , body_and_soul . That , then , -isaia- the sort of good which rulers of States must_take suitable measure to ensure . They must respect the hierarchy of values , and aim -atti_degli_apostoli- achieving the spiritual as well as the material prosperity of their subjects . These principles are clearly contained in that passage in Our encyclical Mater et Magistra where We emphasized that the common_good '' must_take account of all those social conditions which favor the full development of human personality . Consisting , as he does , of body and immortal soul , man cannot in this mortal life satisfy his needs or attain perfect happiness . Thus , the measures that_are taken to implement the common_good must_not jeopardize his eternal_salvation ; indeed , they_must even help him to obtain it . Responsibilities of the Public Authority , and Rights and Duties of Individuals . It -isaia- generally accepted today that the common_good -isaia- best safeguarded when personal rights_and_duties are guaranteed . The chief concern of civil authorities must_therefore be to ensure_that these rights are recognized , respected , co ordinated , defended and promoted , and that each_individual -isaia- enabled to perform his duties more_easily . For '' to safeguard the inviolable rights of the human_person , and to facilitate the performance of his duties , -isaia- the principal duty of every public_authority . Thus any government which refused to recognize human_rights or acted in violation of them , would_not only fail in its duty ; its decrees would be wholly lacking in binding force . Reconciliation and Protection of Rights and Duties of Individuals . One of the principal duties of any government , moreover , -isaia- the suitable and adequate superintendence and co ordination of men s respective rights in society . This must be done in such_a_way_that the exercise of their_rights by certain citizens does_not obstruct other citizens in the exercise of theirs ; that the individual , standing upon his_own rights , does_not impede others in the performance of their_duties ; that the rights of all be effectively safeguarded , and completely restored if they_have_been violated . Duty of Promoting the Rights of Individuals . In addition , heads of States must make a positive contribution to the creation of an overall climate in which_the individual can both safeguard his_own rights and fulfill his duties , and can do so readily . For if there_-isaia-_one thing we have learned in the school of experience , it -isaia- surely this : that , in the modern_world especially , political , economic and cultural inequities among citizens become more_and_more widespread when public_authorities fail to take appropriate action in these spheres . And the consequence -isaia- that_human rights_and_duties are thus rendered totally ineffective . The public administration must_therefore give considerable care and thought to the question of social as well as economic progress , and to the development of essential services in keeping_with_the expansion of the productive system . Such services include road building , transportation , communications , drinking water , housing , medical care , ample facilities for the practice of religion , and aids to recreation . The government must_also see to the provision of insurance facilities , to obviate any likelihood of a citizen s being unable to maintain a decent standard of living in the event of some misfortune , or greatly in creased family responsibilities . The government -isaia-_also required to show no less energy and efficiency in the matter of providing opportunities_for suitable employment , graded to the capacity of the workers . It must make sure_that working men_are paid a just and equitable wage , and are allowed a sense_of_responsibility in the industrial concerns for which_they work . It must facilitate the formation of intermediate groups , so that the social_life of the people may_become more fruitful and less constrained . And finally , it must ensure_that everyone has the means and opportunity of sharing as far_as_possible in cultural benefits . Harmonious Relations Between Public Authority s Two Forms of Intervention . The common welfare further demands_that in their_efforts to co ordinate and protect , and their_efforts to promote , the rights of citizens , the civil authorities preserve a delicate balance . An excessive concern_for the rights of any particular individuals or groups might well result in the principal advantages of the State being in effect monopolized by these citizens . Or again , the absurd situation can arise where_the civil authorities , while taking measures to protect the rights of citizens , themselves stand in the way of the full exercise of these rights . '' For this principle must_always be retained : that however extensive and far reaching the influence of the State on the economy may be , it must_never be exerted to the extent of depriving the individual citizen of his freedom of action . It must rather augment his freedom , while effectively guaranteeing the protection of everyone s essential , personal rights . And the same principle must be adopted by civil authorities in their various efforts to facilitate the exercise of rights and performance of duties in every department of social_life . Structure and Operation of the Public Authority . For the rest , it -isaia- not_possible to give a general ruling on the most suitable form of government , or the ways in which civil authorities can most effectively fulfill their legislative , administrative , and judicial functions . In determining what form a particular government shall take , and the way_in_which it shall function , a major consideration will be the prevailing circumstances and the condition of the people ; and these_are things_which vary in different places and -atti_degli_apostoli- different times . We think , however , that_it_-isaia- in keeping_with human_nature for the State to be given a form which embodies a threefold division of public office properly corresponding to the three main functions of public_authority . In such a State a precise legal framework -isaia- provided , not_only_for the official functions of government , but_also_for the mutual relations_between citizens and public officials . This will obviously afford sure protection to citizens , both in the safeguarding of their_rights and in the fulfilment of their_duties . If , however , this juridical and political structure -isaia- to realize its potential benefits , it -isaia- absolutely essential that public officials do their utmost to solve the problems that arise ; and they_must do so by using policies and techniques which_it_-isaia- within their competence to implement , and which suit the actual condition of the State . It -isaia-_also essential that , despite constantly changing conditions , legislators never disregard the moral_law or constitutional provision , nor act -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the exigencies of the common_good . And as justice must be the guiding principle in the administration of the State , and executives must thoroughly understand_the law and carefully weigh all attendant circumstances , so too in the courts : justice must be administered impartially , and judges must be wholly incorrupt and uninfluenced by the solicitations of interested parties . The good order of society also requires that individuals and subsidiary groups within_the State be effectively protected by law in the affirmation of their_rights and the performance of their_duties , both in their relations with each_other and with government officials . Law and Conscience . There can be no doubt_that a State juridical system which conforms to the principles of justice and rightness , and corresponds to the degree of civic maturity evinced by the State in question , -isaia- highly conducive to the attainment of the common_good . And yet social life_-isaia- so complex , varied and active in this modern age , that_even a juridical system which_has_been established with_great prudence and foresight often seems inadequate to the need . Moreover , the relations of citizens with each_other , of citizens and intermediate groups with public_authorities , and the relations_between public_authorities of the same State , are sometimes seen to be of so ambiguous and explosive a nature , that_they_are not susceptible of being regulated by any hard and fast system of laws . In such cases , if the authorities want to preserve the State s juridical system intact in itself and in its application to specific cases and if they want to minister to the principal needs of society , adapt the laws to the conditions of modern life and seek solutions to new problems , then it -isaia- essential that_they_have a clear idea of the nature and limits of their_own legitimate spheres of action . Their calmness , integrity , clear sightedness and perseverance must be such that_they_will recognize -atti_degli_apostoli- once what_-isaia- needed in a given situation , and act with promptness and efficiency . Citizens Participation in Public Life . A natural consequence of men s dignity -isaia- unquestionably their right to take an active part in government , though their degree of participation will necessarily depend on the stage of development reached by the political community of which_they_are members . For the rest , this right to take_part in government opens out to men a new and extensive field of opportunity_for service . A situation -isaia- created in which civic authorities can , from the greater frequency of their contacts and discussions with the citizens , gain a clearer idea of what policies are in fact effectual for the common_good ; and in a system which allows for a regular succession of public officials , the authority of these officials , far from growing old and feeble , takes on a new vitality in keeping_with_the progressive development of human_society . Characteristics of the Present Day . There -isaia- every indication -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time that_these aims and ideals are giving rise to various demands concerning the juridical organization of States . The first -isaia- this : that a clear and precisely worded charter of fundamental human_rights be formulated and incorporated into the State s general constitutions . Secondly , each State must_have a public constitution , couched in juridical terms , laying down clear rules relating to the designation of public officials , their reciprocal relations , spheres of competence and prescribed methods of operation . The final demand -isaia- that relations_between citizens and public_authorities be described in terms of rights_and_duties . It must be clearly laid_down that the principal function of public_authorities -isaia- to recognize , respect , co ordinate , safeguard and promote citizens rights_and_duties . We must , however , reject the view that the will of the individual or the group -isaia- the primary and only source of a citizen s rights_and_duties , and of the binding force of political constitutions and the government s authority . But the aspirations We have mentioned are a clear indication of the fact_that men , increasingly aware nowadays of their personal_dignity , have found the incentive to enter government service and demand constitutional recognition for their_own inviolable rights . Not content with this , they_are demanding , too , the observance of constitutional procedures in the appointment of public_authorities , and are insisting that_they exercise their office within this constitutional framework . RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES . With respect to States themselves , Our predecessors have constantly taught , and We wish to lend the weight of Our own authority to their teaching , that nations are the subjects of reciprocal rights_and_duties . Their relationships , therefore , must likewise be harmonized in accordance_with_the dictates of truth , justice , willing cooperation , and freedom . The same law of nature that governs the life and conduct of individuals must_also regulate the relations of political communities with one_another . This will be readily understood when one reflects that_it_-isaia- quite impossible for political leaders to lay aside their natural dignity while acting in their_country s name and in its interests They are_still bound by the natural_law , which_-isaia- the rule that governs all moral conduct , and they_have no authority to depart from its slightest precepts . The idea that_men , by the fact of their appointment to public office , are compelled to lay aside their_own humanity , -isaia- quite inconceivable Their very attainment to this high ranking office was due to their exceptional gifts and intellectual qualities , which earned for them their reputation as outstanding representatives of the body politic . Moreover , a ruling authority_-isaia- indispensable to civil_society . That -isaia- a fact which follows from the moral_order itself . Such authority , therefore , cannot be misdirected against the moral_order . It would immediately cease to exit , being deprived of its whole raison d \u00eatre . God Himself warns us of this : '' Hear , therefore , ye kings , and understand : learn , ye that_are judges of the ends of the earth . Give ear , you that rule_the people , and that please yourselves in multitudes of nations . For power -isaia- given you by the Lord , and strength by the Most High , who_will examine your works , and search out your thoughts . And lastly one_must bear in mind_that , even_when it regulates the relations_between States , authority must be exercised for the promotion of the common_good . That -isaia- the primary reason_for its existence . An lmperative of the Common Good . But one of the principal imperatives of the common_good -isaia- the recognition of the moral_order and the unfailing observance of its precepts . '' A firmly established order between political communities must be founded on the unshakable and unmoving rock of the moral_law , that law which -isaia-_revealed in the order of nature by the Creator Himself , and engraved indelibly on men s hearts . Its principles are beacon lights to guide the policies of men and nations . They are_also warning lights providential signs which men must heed if their laborious efforts to establish a new order are_not to encounter perilous storms and shipwreck . The first point to be settled -isaia- that mutual ties between States must be governed by truth . Truth calls for the elimination of every trace of racial discrimination , and the consequent recognition of the inviolable principle that all States are by nature equal in dignity . Each of them accordingly has the right to exist , to develop , and to possess the necessary means and accept a primary responsibility_for its_own development . Each -isaia-_also legitimately entitled to its good name and to the respect which_-isaia- its due . As we know from experience , men frequently differ widely in knowledge , virtue , intelligence and wealth , but that_-isaia- no valid argument in favor of a system whereby those_who_are in a position of superiority impose their will arbitrarily on others . On the contrary , such men_have a greater share in the common responsibility to help others to reach perfection by their mutual efforts . So , too , on the international level : some nations may_have attained to a superior degree of scientific , cultural and economic development . But that does_not entitle them to exert unjust political domination over other nations . It means that_they_have to make a greater contribution to the common cause of social progress . The fact -isaia- that_no_one can be by nature superior to his fellows , since all men_are equally noble in natural dignity . And consequently there_are no differences -atti_degli_apostoli- all between political communities from the point_of_view of natural dignity . Each State -isaia- like a body , the members of which_are human_beings . And , as we know from experience , nations can be highly sensitive in matters in any_way touching their_dignity and honor ; and with good_reason . The Question of Propaganda . Truth further demands an attitude of unruffled impartiality in the use of the many aids to the promotion and spread of mutual understanding between nations which modern scientific progress has made available . This does_not_mean that people should be prevented from drawing particular attention to the virtues of their_own way_of_life , but it does mean the utter rejection of ways of disseminating information which violate the principles of truth and justice , and injure the reputation of another nation . Relations between States must furthermore be regulated by justice . This necessitates both the recognition of their mutual rights , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the fulfilment of their_respective duties . States have_the right to existence , to self development , and to the means necessary to achieve this . They have_the right to play the leading part in the process of their_own development , and the right to their good name and due honors . Consequently , States are likewise in duty bound to safeguard all such rights effectively , and to avoid any action that could violate them . And just as individual men may_not pursue their_own private interests in a way that_-isaia- unfair and detrimental to others , so too it would be criminal in a State to aim -atti_degli_apostoli- improving itself by the use of methods which involve other nations in injury and unjust oppression . There -isaia- a saying of St . Augustine which_has particular relevance in this_context : '' Take away justice , and what_are kingdoms but mighty bands of robbers '' . There may be , and sometimes -isaia- , a clash of interests among States , each striving for its_own development . When differences of this_sort arise , they_must be settled in a truly human way , not by armed force nor by deceit or trickery . There must be a mutual assessment of the arguments and feelings on both sides , a mature and objective investigation of the situation , and an equitable reconciliation of opposing views . The Treatment of Minorities . A special instance of this clash of interests -isaia- furnished by that political trend which since_the nineteenth century has become widespread throughout_the_world and has gained in strength as a result of which men of similar ethnic background are anxious for political autonomy and unification into a single nation . For many reasons this cannot always be effected , and consequently minority peoples are_often obliged to live within_the territories of a nation of a different ethnic origin . This situation gives_rise to serious problems . It -isaia- quite clear_that any attempt to check the vitality and growth of these ethnic minorities -isaia- a flagrant violation of justice ; the more so if such perverse efforts are aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- their_very extinction . Indeed , the best interests of justice are served by those public_authorities who do all they_can to improve the human conditions of the members of these minority groups , especially in what concerns their language , culture , ancient traditions , and their economic activity and enterprise . It -isaia- worth noting , however_,_that these minority groups , in reaction , perhaps , to the enforced hardships of their present situation , or to historical circumstances , frequently tend to magnify unduly characteristics proper to their_own people . They even rate them above those human values_which are common to all mankind , as though the good of the entire human_family should subserve the interests of their_own particular groups . A more reasonable attitude for_such people to adopt would be to recognize_the advantages , too , which accrue to them_from their_own special situation . They should realize_that their constant association with a people steeped in a different civilization from their_own has no small part to play in the development of their_own particular genius and spirit . Little by little they_can absorb into_their very being those virtues which characterize the other nation . But for_this to happen these minority groups must enter_into some kind of association with the people in whose midst they_are living , and learn to share their customs and way_of_life . It will_never happen if they sow seeds of disaffection which_can only produce a harvest of evils , stifling the political development of nations . Since relationships between States must be regulated in accordance_with_the principles of truth and justice , States must further these relationships by taking positive steps to pool their material and spiritual resources . In many cases this_can be achieved by all kinds of mutual collaboration ; and this -isaia-_already happening in our_own day in the economic , social , political , educational , health and athletic spheres and with beneficial results . We must bear in mind_that of its_very nature civil authority exists , not to confine men within_the frontiers of their_own nations , but primarily to protect the common_good of the State , which certainly cannot be divorced from the common_good of the entire human_family . Thus , in pursuing their_own interests , civil societies , far from causing injury to others , must join plans and forces whenever the efforts of particular States cannot achieve the desired goal . But in doing so great care must_be_taken . What -isaia- beneficial to some States may prove detrimental rather_than advantageous to others . Contacts Between Races . Furthermore , the universal common_good requires the encouragement in all nations of every_kind of reciprocation between citizens and their intermediate societies . There are_many parts_of_the_world where we find groupings of people of more_or_less different ethnic origin . Nothing must be allowed to prevent reciprocal relations_between them . Indeed such a prohibition would flout the very spirit of an age which_has done so much to nullify the distances separating peoples . Nor must one overlook the fact_that whatever their ethnic background , men possess , besides the special characteristics which distinguish them_from other men , other very_important elements in common with the rest of mankind . And these can form the basis of their progressive development and self realization especially in regard to spiritual values . They have , therefore , the right and duty to carry on their_lives with_others in society . The Proper Balance Between Population , Land and Capital . As everyone -isaia- well_aware , there_are some_countries where there_-isaia- an imbalance between_the amount of arable land and the number of inhabitants ; others where there_-isaia- an imbalance between_the richness of the resources and the instruments of agriculture available . It -isaia- imperative , therefore_,_that nations enter_into collaboration with each_other , and facilitate the circulation of goods , capital and manpower . We advocate in such cases the policy of bringing the work to the workers , wherever possible , rather_than bringing workers to the scene of the work . In this_way many_people will be afforded an opportunity of increasing their resources without being exposed to the painful necessity of uprooting themselves from their_own homes , settling in a strange environment , and forming new social contacts . The Problem of Political Refugees . The deep feelings of paternal love for all mankind which God has implanted in Our heart makes it impossible for Us to view without bitter anguish of spirit the plight of those_who for political reasons have_been exiled from their_own homelands . There are great numbers of such refugees -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , and many are the sufferings the incredible sufferings to which_they_are constantly exposed . Here surely -isaia-_our proof that , in defining the scope of a just freedom within which individual citizens may live lives worthy of their human_dignity , the rulers of some nations have_been far too restrictive . Sometimes in States of this_kind the very right to freedom_-isaia- called in question , and even flatly denied . We have here a complete reversal of the right order of society , for the whole raison d etre of public authority_-isaia- to safeguard the interests of the community . Its sovereign duty -isaia- to recognize_the noble realm of freedom and protect its rights . The Refugee s Rights . For this_reason , it -isaia- not irrelevant to draw the attention of the world to the fact that_these refugees are persons and all their_rights as persons must be recognized . Refugees cannot lose these rights simply because_they_are deprived of citizenship of their_own States . And among man s personal rights we must include his right to enter a country in which he hopes to be able to provide more fittingly for_himself and his dependents . It -isaia- therefore the duty of State officials to accept such immigrants and so far as the good of their_own community , rightly understood , permits to further the aims of those_who may wish to become members of a new society . We therefore take this opportunity of giving Our public approval and commendation to every undertaking , founded on the principles of human solidarity or of Christian charity , which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- relieving the distress of those_who_are compelled to emigrate from their_own country to another . And We must indeed single out for the praise of all right minded men those international agencies which devote all their energies to this_most important work . Causes of the Arms Race . On the other_hand , We are deeply distressed to see the enormous stocks of armaments that have_been , and continue to be , manufactured in the economically more developed countries . This policy -isaia- involving a vast outlay of intellectual and material resources , with the result that the people of these countries are saddled with a great burden , while other countries lack the help they_need for their economic_and_social development . There -isaia- a common belief that under modern conditions peace cannot be assured except on the basis of an equal balance of armaments and that_this factor -isaia- the probable cause of this stockpiling of armaments . Thus , if one country increases its military strength , others are immediately roused by a competitive spirit to augment their_own supply of armaments . And if one country -isaia- equipped with atomic weapons , others consider themselves justified in producing such weapons themselves , equal in destructive force . Consequently people_are living in the grip of constant fear . They are afraid that -atti_degli_apostoli- any moment the impending storm may break upon them_with horrific violence . And they_have good reasons for their fear , for there_-isaia- certainly no lack of such weapons . While it -isaia- difficult to believe_that anyone would dare to assume responsibility_for initiating the appalling slaughter and destruction that war would bring in its wake , there_-isaia- no denying that the conflagration could be started by some chance and unforeseen circumstance . Moreover , even_though the monstrous power of modern weapons does indeed act as a deterrent , there_-isaia- reason to fear that the very testing of nuclear devices for war purposes can , if continued , lead to serious danger for various_forms of life on earth . Need for Disarmament . Hence justice , right_reason , and the recognition of man s dignity cry out insistently for a cessation to the arms race . The stock piles of armaments which_have_been built up in various countries must be reduced all round and simultaneously by the parties concerned . Nuclear weapons must be banned . A general agreement must be reached on a suitable disarmament program , with an effective system of mutual control . In the words of Pope Pius XII : '' The calamity of a world war , with the economic_and_social ruin and the moral excesses and dissolution that accompany it , must_not on any account be permitted to engulf the human_race for a third time . Everyone , however , must realize_that , unless this_process of disarmament be thoroughgoing and complete , and reach men s very souls , it -isaia- impossible to stop the arms race , or to reduce armaments , or and this_-isaia- the main thing ultimately to abolish them entirely . Everyone must sincerely co operate in the effort to banish fear and the anxious expectation of war from men s minds . But this requires that the fundamental principles upon which peace_-isaia- based in today_s_world be replaced by an altogether different one , namely , the realization that true and lasting peace among nations cannot consist in the possession of an equal supply of armaments but_only in mutual trust . And We are confident that_this can be achieved , for it -isaia- a thing which not_only -isaia- dictated by common sense , but_-isaia- in itself most desirable and most fruitful of good . Here , then , we have an objective dictated first of all by reason . There -isaia- general agreement or -atti_degli_apostoli- least there_should be that relations_between States , as between individuals , must be regulated not by armed force , but in accordance_with_the principles of right_reason : the principles , that_-isaia- , of truth , justice and vigorous and sincere co operation . Secondly , it -isaia- an objective which We maintain -isaia- more earnestly to be desired . For who_-isaia- there who_does_not feel the craving to be rid of the threat of war , and to see peace preserved and made daily more secure ? . And finally it -isaia- an objective which_-isaia- rich with possibilities for good . Its advantages will be felt everywhere , by individuals , by families , by nations , by the whole_human_race . The warning of Pope Pius XII still rings in our ears : '' Nothing -isaia- lost by peace ; everything may be lost by war . '' A Call to Unsparing Effort . We therefore consider it Our duty as the vicar on earth of Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world , the Author of peace and as interpreter of the most ardent wishes of the whole human_family , in the fatherly love We bear all mankind , to beg and beseech mankind , and above all the rulers of States , to be unsparing of their labor and efforts to ensure_that human affairs follow a rational and dignified course . In their deliberations together , let men of outstanding wisdom and influence give serious thought to the problem of achieving a more_human adjustment of relations_between States throughout_the_world . It must be an adjustment that_-isaia- based on mutual trust , sincerity in negotiation , and the faithful fulfilment of obligations assumed . Every aspect of the problem must be examined , so that eventually there_may emerge some point of agreement from which to initiate treaties which_are sincere , lasting , and beneficial in their effects . We , for Our part , will pray unceasingly that God may bless these labors by His divine assistance , and make_them fruitful . Furthermore , relations_between States must be regulated by the principle of freedom . This means_that no country has the right to take any action that_would constitute an unjust oppression of other countries , or an unwarranted interference in their affairs . On the contrary , all should help to develop in others an increasing awareness of their_duties , an adventurous and enterprising spirit , and the resolution to take the initiative for their_own advancement in every field of endeavor . The Evolution of Economically Under developed Countries . All men are_united by their common origin and fellowship , their redemption by Christ , and their supernatural destiny . They are_called to form one Christian family . In Our encyclical Mater et Magistra , therefore , We appealed to the more wealthy nations to render every_kind of assistance to those States which are_still in the process of economic development . It -isaia- no small consolation to Us to be able to testify here to the wide acceptance of Our appeal , and We are confident that in the years that lie ahead it will be accepted even_more widely . The result We look for -isaia- that the poorer States shall in as short a time as possible attain to a degree of economic development that enables their citizens to live in conditions more in keeping_with their human_dignity . Again and again We must insist on the need_for helping these peoples in a way which guarantees to them the preservation of their_own freedom . They must be conscious that_they_are themselves playing the major role in their economic_and_social development ; that_they_are themselves to shoulder the main burden of it . Hence the wisdom of Pope Pius XII s teaching : '' A new order founded on moral principles -isaia- the surest bulwark against the violation of the freedom , integrity and security of other nations , no matter what may be their territorial extension or their capacity_for defense . For although it -isaia- almost inevitable that the larger States , in view of their greater power and vaster resources , will themselves decide on the norms governing their economic associations with small States , nevertheless these smaller States cannot be denied their right , in keeping_with_the common_good , to political freedom , and to the adoption of a position of neutrality in the conflicts between nations . No State can be denied this right , for it -isaia- a postulate of the natural_law itself , as also of international law . These smaller States have_also the right of assuring their_own economic development . It -isaia- only_with the effective guaranteeing of these rights that smaller nations can fittingly promote the common_good of all mankind , as well as the material welfare and the cultural and spiritual progress of their_own people '' . The wealthier States , therefore , while providing various_forms of assistance to the poorer , must_have the highest possible respect_for the latter s national characteristics and timehonored civil institutions . They must_also repudiate any policy of domination . If this_can be achieved , then '' a precious contribution will_have been_made to the formation of a world community , in which each_individual nation , conscious of its rights_and_duties , can work on terms of equality with the rest for the attainment of universal prosperity . '' Signs of the Times . Men nowadays are becoming more_and_more convinced_that any disputes which_may arise between nations must be resolved by negotiation and agreement , and not by recourse to arms . We acknowledge that_this conviction owes its origin chiefly to the terrifying destructive force of modern weapons . It arises from fear of the ghastly and catastrophic consequences of their use . Thus , in this age which boasts of its atomic power , it no longer makes sense to maintain that war -isaia- a fit instrument with_which to repair the violation of justice . And yet , unhappily , we often find the law of fear reigning supreme among nations and causing them to spend enormous sums on armaments . Their object -isaia- not aggression , so they_say and there_-isaia- no reason_for disbelieving them but to deter others from aggression . Nevertheless , We are hopeful that , by establishing contact_with one_another and by a policy of negotiation , nations will come to a better recognition of the natural ties that bind them together as men . We are hopeful , too , that_they_will come to a fairer realization of one of the cardinal duties deriving from our_common nature : namely_,_that love , not fear , must dominate the relationships between individuals and between nations . It -isaia- principally characteristic of love_that it draws men together in all sorts of ways , sincerely united in the bonds of mind and matter ; and this_-isaia- a union from which countless blessings can flow . RELATIONSHIP OF MEN AND OF POLITICAL COMMUNITIES WITH THE WORLD COMMUNITY . Recent progress in science and technology has had a profound influence on man s way_of_life . This progress -isaia- a spur to men all over the world to extend their collaboration and association with one_another in these_days when material resources , travel from one country to another , and technical information have so vastly increased . This has led to a phenomenal growth in relationships between individuals , families and intermediate associations belonging to the various nations , and between_the public_authorities of the various political communities . There -isaia-_also a growing economic interdependence between States . National economies are gradually becoming so interdependent that a kind of world economy -isaia- being born from the simultaneous integration of the economies of individual States . And finally , each country s social progress , order , security and peace are necessarily linked_with the social progress , order , security and peace of every_other country . From this it -isaia- clear_that no State can fittingly pursue its_own interests in isolation from the rest , nor , under such circumstances , can it develop itself as it should . The prosperity and progress of any State -isaia- in part consequence , and in part cause , of the prosperity and progress of all other States . Inadequacy of Modern States to Ensure Universal Common Good the . No era will ever succeed in destroying the unity of the human_family , for it consists of men_who are all equal by virtue of their natural dignity . Hence there will_always be an imperative need born of man s very nature to promote in sufficient measure the universal common_good ; the good , that_-isaia- , of the whole human_family . In the past rulers of States seem to have been_able to make sufficient provision for the universal common_good through the normal diplomatic channels , or by top level meetings and discussions , treaties and agreements ; by using , that_-isaia- , the ways and means suggested by the natural_law , the law of nations , or international law . In our_own day , however , mutual relationships between States have undergone a far reaching change . On the one_hand , the universal common_good gives_rise to problems of the utmost gravity , complexity and urgency especially as regards the preservation of the security and peace of the whole_world . On the other_hand , the rulers of individual nations , being all on an equal footing , largely fail in their_efforts to achieve this , however much they multiply their meetings and their endeavors to discover more fitting instruments of justice . And this_-isaia- no reflection on their sincerity and enterprise . It -isaia- merely that_their authority_-isaia- not sufficiently influential . We are thus driven to the conclusion that the shape and structure of political_life in the modern_world , and the influence exercised by public_authority in all the nations of the world are unequal to the task of promoting the common_good of all peoples . Connection Between the Common Good and Political Authority . Now , if one considers carefully the inner significance of the common_good on the one_hand , and the nature and function of public_authority on the other , one cannot_fail to see that_there_-isaia- an intrinsic connection_between them . Public authority , as the means of promoting the common_good in civil_society , -isaia- a postulate of the moral_order . But the moral_order likewise requires that_this authority be effective in attaining its end . Hence the civil institutions in which such authority resides , becomes operative and promotes its ends , are endowed_with a certain kind of structure and efficacy : a structure and efficacy which_make such institutions capable of realizing the common_good by ways and means adequate to the changing historical conditions . Today the universal common_good presents us with problems which_are world wide in their dimensions ; problems , therefore , which_cannot be solved except by a public_authority with power , organization and means co extensive with_these problems , and with a world wide sphere of activity . Consequently the moral_order itself demands the establishment of some such general form of public_authority . Public Authority Instituted by Common Consent and Not Imposed by Force . But this general authority equipped with world wide power and adequate means_for achieving the universal common_good cannot be imposed by force . It must be set up with the consent of all nations . If its work_-isaia- to be effective , it must operate with fairness , absolute impartiality , and with dedication to the common_good of all peoples . The forcible imposition by the more powerful nations of a universal authority of this_kind would inevitably arouse fears of its being used as an instrument to serve the interests of the few or to take the side of a single nation , and thus_the influence and effectiveness of its activity would be undermined . For even_though nations may differ widely in material progress and military strength , they are_very sensitive as regards their juridical equality and the excellence of their_own way_of_life . They are right , therefore , in their reluctance to submit to an authority imposed by force , established without their co operation , or not accepted of their_own accord . The Universal Common Good and Personal Rights . The common_good of individual States -isaia- something_that cannot be determined without reference to the human_person , and the same -isaia- true of the common_good of all States taken together . Hence the public_authority of the world community must likewise have as its special aim the recognition , respect , safeguarding and promotion of the rights of the human_person . This can be done by direct action , if need be , or by the creation throughout_the_world of the sort of conditions in which rulers of individual States can more_easily carry_out_their specific functions . The Principle of Subsidiarity . The same principle of subsidiarity which governs the relations_between public_authorities and individuals , families and intermediate societies in a single State , must_also apply to the relations_between the public_authority of the world community and the public_authorities of each political community . The special function of this universal authority must be to evaluate and find a solution to economic , social , political and cultural problems which affect the universal common_good . These are problems which , because_of_their extreme gravity , vastness and urgency , must be considered too difficult for the rulers of individual States to solve with any degree of success . But it -isaia- no part of the duty of universal authority to limit the sphere of action of the public_authority of individual States , or to arrogate any of their functions to itself . On the contrary , its essential purpose -isaia- to create world conditions in which_the public_authorities of each nation , its citizens and intermediate groups , can carry_out_their tasks , fullfill their_duties and claim their_rights with_greater security . The United Nations Organization U . was established , as -isaia- well_known , on June , . To it were subsequently added lesser organizations consisting of members nominated by the public_authority of the various nations and entrusted with highly important international functions in the economics , social , cultural , educational and health fields . The United Nations Organization has the special aim of maintaining and strengthening peace between nations , and of encouraging and assisting friendly relations_between them , based on the principles of equality , mutual respect , and extensive cooperation in every field of human endeavor . A clear proof of the farsightedness of this organization -isaia- provided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights passed by the United Nations General Assembly on December , . The preamble of this declaration affirms that the genuine recognition and complete observance of all the rights and freedoms outlined in the declaration -isaia- a goal to be sought by all peoples and all nations . We are , of course , aware_that some of the points in the declaration did_not meet with unqualified approval in some quarters ; and there_was justification for_this . Nevertheless , We think the document should be considered a step in the right direction , an approach toward_the establishment of a juridical and political ordering of the world community . It -isaia- a solemn recognition of the personal_dignity of every_human_being ; an assertion of everyone s right to be free to seek out the truth , to follow moral principles , discharge the duties imposed by justice , and lead a fully human_life . It also recognized other rights connected_with these . It -isaia- therefore Our earnest wish_that the United Nations Organization may_be_able progressively to adapt its structure and methods of operation to the magnitude and nobility of its tasks . May the day be not long delayed when every_human_being can_find in this organization an effective safeguard of his personal rights ; those rights , that_-isaia- , which derive directly from his dignity as a human_person , and which_are therefore universal , inviolable and inalienable . This -isaia- all the more desirable in that_men today are taking an ever_more active part in the public_life of their_own nations , and in doing so they_are showing an increased interest in the affairs of all peoples . They are becoming more_and_more conscious of being living members of the universal family of mankind . Here once_more We exhort Our sons to take an active part in public_life , and to work together for the benefit of the whole_human_race , as well as for their_own political communities . It -isaia- vitally necessary_for them to endeavor , in the light of Christian faith , and with love as their guide , to ensure_that every institution , whether economic , social , cultural or political , be such as not to obstruct but_rather to facilitate man s self betterment , both in the natural and in the supernatural order . Scientific Competence , Technical Capacity and Professional Experience . And yet , if they_are to imbue civilization with right ideals and Christian principles , it -isaia-_not_enough for Our sons to be illumined by the heavenly light_of_faith and to be fired with enthusiasm for a cause ; they_must involve themselves in the work of these institutions , and strive to influence them effectively from within . But in a culture and civilization like our_own , which_-isaia- so remarkable for its scientific knowledge and its technical discoveries , clearly no one_can insinuate himself into public_life unless he be scientifically competent , technically capable , and skilled in the practice of his_own profession . Apostolate of a Trained Laity . And yet even this_must be reckoned insufficient to bring_the relationships of daily_life into conformity_with a more_human standard , based , as it must be , on truth , tempered by justice , motivated by mutual love , and holding fast to the practice of freedom . If these policies are really to become operative , men must first of all take the utmost care to conduct their various temporal activities in accordance_with_the laws which govern each_and_every such activity , observing the principles_which correspond to their_respective natures . Secondly , men s actions must be made to conform with the precepts of the moral_order . This means_that their behavior must be such as to reflect their consciousness of exercising a personal right or performing a personal duty . Reason has a further demand to make . In obedience to the providential designs and commands of God respecting our_salvation and neglecting the dictates of conscience , men must conduct themselves in their temporal activity in such_a_way as to effect a thorough integration of the principal spiritual values with_those of science , technology and the professions . Integration of Faith and Action . In traditionally Christian States -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , civil institutions evince a high degree of scientific and technical progress and possess abundant machinery for the attainment of every_kind of objective . And yet it must be owned that_these institutions are_often but slightly affected by Christian motives and a Christian spirit . One may well ask the reason_for this , since_the men who_have largely contributed and who are_still contributing to the creation of these institutions are men_who are professed Christians , and who_live their_lives , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , in accordance_with_the precepts of the gospels . In Our opinion the explanation lies in a certain cleavage between_faith and practice . Their inner , spiritual unity must be restored , so that_faith may be the light and love the motivating force of all their actions . We consider too that a further reason_for this_very frequent divorce between_faith and practice in Christians -isaia- an inadequate education in Christian teaching and Christian morality . In many places the amount of energy devoted to the study of secular subjects -isaia- all too_often out of pro portion to that devoted to the study of religion . Scientific training reaches a very high level , whereas religious training generally does_not advance beyond_the elementary stage . It -isaia- essential , therefore_,_that the instruction given to our young_people be complete and continuous , and imparted in such_a_way_that moral goodness and the cultivation of religious values may keep pace with scientific knowledge and continually advancing technical progress . Young people must_also be taught how to carry_out_their own particular obligations in a truly fitting manner . In this connection We think it opportune to point_out how difficult it -isaia- to understand clearly_the relation between_the objective requirements of justice and concrete situations ; to define , that_-isaia- , correctly to what degree and in what form doctrinal principles and directives must be applied in the given state of human_society . The definition of these degrees and forms -isaia- all the more difficult in an age such as ours , driven forward by a fever of activity . And yet this_-isaia- the age in which_each one of us -isaia- required to make his_own contribution to the universal common_good . Daily -isaia- borne in on us the need to make_the reality of social_life conform better to the requirements of justice . Hence Our sons have every reason_for not thinking that_they_can relax their_efforts and be satisfied with what_they have_already achieved . What has so far been achieved -isaia- insufficient compared with what needs to be done ; all men must realize_that . Every day provides a more_important , a more fitting enterprise to which_they must turn their hands industry , trade unions , professional organizations , insurance , cultural institutions , the law , politics , medical and recreational facilities , and other such activities . The age in which we live needs all these_things . It -isaia- an age in which men , having discovered the atom and achieved the breakthrough into outer space , are_now exploring other avenues , leading to almost limitless horizons . Relations Between Catholics and Non Catholics in Social and Economic Affairs . The principles We have set_out in this document take their rise from the very nature of things . They derive , for the most part , from the consideration of man s natural rights . Thus the putting of these_principles into_effect frequently involves extensive co operation between Catholics and those Christians who_are separated_from this Apostolic See . It even involves the cooperation of Catholics with men_who may_not be Christians but who nevertheless are reasonable men , and men of natural moral integrity . '' In such circumstances they_must , of course , bear themselves as Catholics , and do nothing to compromise religion and morality . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_should show themselves animated by a spirit of understanding and unselfishness , ready to co operate loyally in achieving objects which_are good in themselves , or conducive to good . '' Error and the Errant . It -isaia- always perfectly justifiable to distinguish between error as such and the person_who falls into error even in the case of men_who err regarding the truth or are led astray as a result of their inadequate knowledge , in matters either of religion or of the highest ethical standards . A man_who has fallen into error does not_cease to be a man . He never forfeits his personal_dignity ; and that_-isaia- something_that must_always be taken into_account . Besides , there exists in man s very nature an undying capacity to break through the barriers of error and seek the road to truth . God , in His great providence , -isaia- ever present with His aid . Today , maybe , a man lacks faith and turns aside into error ; tomorrow , perhaps , illumined by God s light , he may indeed embrace the truth . Catholics who , in order to achieve some external good , collaborate with unbelievers or with_those_who through error lack the fullness of faith in Christ , may possibly provide the occasion or even the incentive for their conversion to the truth . Philosophies and Historical Movements . Again it -isaia- perfectly legitimate to make a clear distinction between a false philosophy of the nature , origin and purpose of men and the world , and economic , social , cultural , and political undertakings , even_when such undertakings draw their origin and inspiration from that philosophy . True , the philosophic formula does_not change once it has_been set down in precise terms , but the undertakings clearly cannot avoid being influenced to a certain extent by the changing conditions in which_they_have to operate . Besides , who_can deny the possible existence of good and commendable elements in these undertakings , elements which do indeed conform to the dictates of right_reason , and are an expression of man s lawful aspirations ? . It may sometimes happen , therefore_,_that meetings arranged for some practical end though hitherto they_were thought to be altogether useless may in fact be fruitful -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least offer prospects of success . But whether or not the moment for_such cooperation has arrived , and the manner and degree of such co operation in the attainment of economic , social , cultural and political advantages these_are matters for prudence to decide ; prudence , the queen of all the virtues which rule_the lives of men both as individuals and in society . As far as Catholics are_concerned , the decision rests primarily with_those_who take a leading part in the life of the community , and in these specific fields . They must , however , act in accordance_with_the principles of the natural_law , and observe the Church s social_teaching and the directives of ecclesiastical authority . For it must_not be forgotten that the Church has the right and duty not_only to safeguard her teaching on faith_and_morals , but_also to exercise her authority over her sons by intervening in their external affairs whenever a judgment has to be made concerning the practical application of this_teaching . There are indeed some people_who , in their generosity of spirit , burn with a desire to institute wholesale reforms whenever they come across situations which show scant regard for_justice or are wholly out of keeping_with its claims . They tackle the problem with_such impetuosity that_one would think they_were embarking on some political revolution . We would remind such people that_it_-isaia- the law of nature that all things must be of gradual growth . If there_-isaia- to be any improvement in human institutions , the work must be done slowly and deliberately from within . Pope Pius XII expressed it in these terms : '' Salvation and justice consist not in the uprooting of an outdated system , but in a well designed policy of development . Hotheadedness was never constructive ; it has_always destroyed everything . It has inflamed passions , but never assuaged them . It sows no seeds but those of hatred and destruction . Far from bringing_about the reconciliation of contending parties , it reduces men and political parties to the necessity of laboriously redoing the work of the past , building on the ruins that disharmony has left in its wake . Hence among the very serious obligations incumbent upon men of high principles , We must include the task of establishing new relationships in human_society , under the mastery and guidance of truth , justice , charity and freedom relations_between individual citizens , between citizens and their_respective States , between States , and finally between individuals , families , intermediate associations and States on the one_hand , and the world community on the other . There -isaia- surely no one who_will not consider this a most exalted task , for it -isaia- one which_-isaia- able to bring_about true peace in accordance_with divinely established order . Considering the need , the men_who are shouldering this responsibility are far too few in number , yet they_are deserving of the highest recognition from society , and We rightfully honor them_with Our public praise . We call_upon them to persevere in their ideals , which_are of such tremendous benefit to mankind . At the same_time We are encouraged to hope_that many more men , Christians especially , will join their cause , spurred on by love and the realization of their_duty . Everyone who_has joined the ranks of Christ must be a glowing point of light in the world , a nucleus of love , a leaven of the whole mass . He will be so in proportion to his degree of spiritual union with God . The world will_never be the dwellingplace of peace , till peace has found a home in the heart of each_and_every man , till every man preserves in himself_the order ordained by God to be preserved . That -isaia- why St . Augustine asks the question : '' Does your mind desire the strength to gain the mastery over your passions ? Let it submit to a greater power , and it will conquer all beneath it . And peace will be in you true , sure , most ordered peace . What -isaia- that order ? God as ruler of the mind ; the mind as ruler of the body . Nothing could be more orderly . '' The Prince of Peace . Our concern here has_been with problems which_are causing men extreme anxiety -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time ; problems which_are intimately bound up with the progress of human_society . Unquestionably , the teaching We have_given has_been inspired by a longing which We feel most keenly , and which We know -isaia- shared by all men_of_good will : that peace may be assured on earth . We who , in spite of Our inadequacy , are nevertheless the vicar of Him whom_the prophet announced as the Prince of Peace , conceive of it as Our duty to devote all Our thoughts and care and energy to further this common_good of all mankind . Yet peace_-isaia- but an empty word , if it does_not rest upon that order which Our hope prevailed upon Us to set_forth in outline in this_encyclical . It -isaia- an order that_-isaia- founded on truth , built up on justice , nurtured and animated by charity , and brought into_effect under the auspices of freedom . So magnificent , so exalted -isaia- this aim that_human resources alone , even_though inspired by the most praiseworthy good_will , cannot hope to achieve it . God Himself must come to man s aid with His heavenly assistance , if human society_-isaia- to bear the closest possible resemblance to the kingdom of God . The very order of things therefore , demands_that during_this sacred season we pray earnestly to Him who by His bitter passion and death washed away men s sins , which_are the fountainhead of discord , misery and inequality ; to Him who shed His blood to reconcile the human_race to the heavenly Father , and bestowed the gifts of peace . '' For He -isaia-_our peace , who hath made both one . And coming , He preached peace to you that were afar off ; and peace to them that were nigh . The sacred_liturgy of these_days reechoes the same message : '' Our Lord Jesus Christ , after His resurrection stood in the midst of His disciples and said : Peace be upon you , alleluia . The disciples rejoiced when_they saw the Lord . '' It -isaia- Christ , therefore , who brought us peace ; Christ who bequeathed it to us : '' Peace I leave with you : my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , do I give unto you . Let us , then , pray with all fervor for_this peace which our_divine Redeemer came to bring us . May He banish from the souls of men whatever might endanger peace . May He transform all men into witnesses of truth , justice and brotherly_love . May He illumine with His light the minds of rulers , so that , besides caring for the proper material welfare of their peoples , they_may also guarantee them the fairest gift of peace . Finally , may Christ inflame the desires of all men to break through the barriers which divide them , to strengthen the bonds of mutual love , to learn to understand one_another , and to pardon those_who_have done them wrong . Through His power and inspiration may all peoples welcome each_other to their_hearts as brothers , and may the peace they long for ever flower and ever reign among_them . And so , dear_brothers , with the ardent wish_that peace may come upon the flocks committed to your_care , for the special benefit of those_who_are most lowly and in the greatest need of help and defense , lovingly in the Lord We bestow on you , on Our priests both secular and regular , on religious both men_and_women , on all the faithful and especially_those who give wholehearted obedience to these Our exhortations , Our Apostolic Blessing . And upon all men_of_good will , to whom We also address this_encyclical , We implore from God health and prosperity . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St .

Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . On the day when '' the Prince of the Shepherds '' entrusted to Us His lambs and sheep , God s flock , which dwells all over the earth , We responded to the sweet invitation of His love with a sense of Our unworthiness but_with trust in His all powerful assistance . And the magnitude , the beauty , and the importance of the Catholic Missions have_been constantly on Our mind . For this_reason , We have_never ceased to devote to them Our greatest solicitude and attention . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the first year marking the anniversary of Our reception of the triple Tiara , in the sermon which We delivered on that solemn occasion We mentioned as among the happiest events of Our Pontificate the day , October th , on which over four hundred missionaries gathered in the most_holy Vatican Basilica to receive from Our hands the crucifix , image of Jesus Christ Crucified , before leaving for distant parts_of_the_world to illumine them_with_the light of Christianity . The Most Provident Lord , in His secret and loving designs , willed that , in its_very first years , Our priestly mission should be oriented toward_the furthering of this cause ; in fact , immediately after_the conclusion of the First World War , Our predecessor Benedict XV called Us to Rome from Our diocese , so that We could devote Our zeal to the Pontifical Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , a function which We most willingly performed during four years of Our priestly life . We happily recall Whitsunday in , the third centenary of the foundation of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , which -isaia-_especially entrusted with the task of carrying the beneficial light of the Gospel , and heavenly grace , to the farthest reaches of the earth . It was with_great joy that We participated in the Congregation s centennial festivities on that day . Also -atti_degli_apostoli- the time Our predecessor Pius XII by word and example incited Us to give Our warmest support to missionary activities and projects . Just before the College of Cardinals was convened for the Conclave during which , by divine inspiration , he was chosen as the successor of St . Peter , he spoke the following words in Our presence : '' We cannot expect anything greater or more beneficial from the new Vicar of Christ than these_two most important things : that he will strive with all his might to propagate the doctrine of the Gospel among all men , and that he will_bring peoples together in a spirit of true peace and strengthen them therein . '' Subject of This Letter . With these and many_other sweet memories in Our mind , and aware of the grave duties imposed upon the Supreme Shepherd of the flock of God , We would_like , Venerable Brethren seizing an occasion offered by that memorable Apostolic Letter , Maximum illud , with_which , forty years_ago , Our predecessor Benedict XV furthered the cause of the Catholic missions by establishing new rules and enkindling the faithful with new zeal We would_like , We repeat , to speak to you with a fatherly heart , by means of this_letter , on the necessity and hopes of extending God s kingdom to the many parts_of_the_world where missionaries labor zealously , sparing no effort in order_that new branches of the Church may grow and produce wholesome fruits . Our predecessors Pius XI and Pius XII also issued decrees and exhortations to the furtherance of this cause , which We confirmed with like authority and like charity when We issued Our first Encyclical Letter , Ad Petri Cathedram . We think , however , and We feel sure_that We will_never do enough to carry_out the wishes of the Divine Redeemer in this_matter until all sheep are happily gathered in one fold under the leadership of one Shepherd . A Cry for Help . When We turn Our mind and Our heart to the supernatural blessings of the Church that_are to be shared with_those people whose souls have_not yet been suffused with the light of the Gospel , there appear before Our eyes either regions of the world where bountiful crops grow , thrive , and ripen , or regions where_the labors of the toilers in God s vineyard are_very arduous , or regions where_the enemies of God and Jesus Christ are harassing and threatening to destroy Christian communities by violence and persecutions , and are striving to smother and crush the seed of God s word . We are everywhere confronted by appeals to Us to ensure the eternal salvation_of_souls in the best way We can , and a cry seems to reach Our ears : '' Help us ! '' Innumerable regions have already_been made fruitful by the sweat and blood of messengers of the Gospel '' from every nation under heaven , '' and native apostles , with the help of divine_grace , are blossoming like new buds and are bringing forth saving fruits . We desire to reach those regions with Our words of praise and encouragement , and with Our affection . We also wish to give_them Our instructions and admonitions , which_are prompted by firm hope based on the infallible promise of Our Divine Master , that_-isaia- contained in these_words : '' Behold , I -amos- with you all days , even unto the consummation of the world . '' l '' Take courage , I have overcome the world . The First World War involved many countries all over the world and caused grievous losses to many individuals and nations . When it finally ended , Benedict XV s Apostolic Letter l which We mentioned above , like the exalted invitation of a fatherly voice , enflamed the souls of all Catholics to expand peacefully the Kingdom of God , the only_one , We say , which_can give and secure permanent peace and prosperity to all men , children of their Heavenly Father . From that_time , during forty very active years , the works and undertakings of the heralds of the Gospel have_been flourishing and producing increasingly abundant fruits every_day ; and the most noteworthy result -isaia- the fact_that a local hierarchy and clergy have_been increasingly developed in the mission areas . It -isaia- necessary_that missionaries obey the words of Our immediate predecessor , Pius XII , to the effect that_they '' must constantly keep before their mind s eyes their ultimate goal , which_-isaia- to establish the Church firmly in other countries , and subsequently to entrust it to a local hierarchy , chosen from their_own people . '' Therefore , this Apostolic See , abundantly and -atti_degli_apostoli- the opportune time , has_taken measures especially in recent_times , to establish or re establish a hierarchy in those areas in which local conditions favored the foundation of Episcopal Sees , and if possible , to place locally born prelates -atti_degli_apostoli- their head . At any rate , it -isaia- well_known that_this has_always_been the principal and constant goal of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith . It was an Apostolic Letter , however , which highlighted the importance and immediacy of the matter as never before . In this_letter Our predecessor , Benedict XV , urgently reminded the authorities in charge of the missions to nurture carefully the vocations of those_who felt the divine call to the priesthood in mission territories and to contribute to the quantitative and qualitative growth of that clergy which_was called native . Neither slight nor discrimination was intended by the word '' native , '' or was ever expressed or implied by the language of the Roman Pontiffs and ecclesiastical documents . Growth of Native Clergy . This exhortation of Benedict XV , which_was repeated by Our predecessors Pius XI and Pius XII , with the help of God s divine Providence has had visible and copious results . We want you to join Us in rendering thanks to God for the fact_that a numerous and elect legion of bishops and priests has arisen in the Mission territories , Our brethren and beloved_sons , who fill Our heart with_great expectations . If We cast even a cursory glance on the ecclesiastical situation in the areas which_are entrusted to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , with the exception of those -atti_degli_apostoli- present under persecution , We note that the first bishop of east Asian origins was consecrated in , and the first vicars apostolic of African Negro descent were named in . By , We count Asian and African bishops . The remaining native clergy grew in number from in to in in Asia , and during the same period in Africa from in to in . With such an admirable increase in the numbers of the clergy did the Lord of the harvest l desire to reward adequately the labors and merits of those_who zealously did mission work , either individually or in cooperation_with many_others , responding with a generous heart to the repeated exhortations of this Apostolic See . It was , therefore , with good_reason that Our predecessor Pius XII was able to affirm with satisfaction : '' Once upon a time it seemed as though the life of the Church used to prosper and blossom chiefly in the regions of ancient Europe , whence it would flow , like a majestic river , through the remaining areas which , to use the Greek term , were considered almost the periphery of the world ; today , however , the life of the Church -isaia- shared , as though by a mutual irradiation of energies , among all individual members of the Mystical Body of Christ . Not a few countries on other continents have long since outgrown the missionary stage , and are_now governed by an ecclesiastical hierarchy of their_own , have_their own ecclesiastical organization , and are liberally offering to other Church communities those very gifts , spiritual and material , which_they formerly used to receive . We wish especially to exhort the bishops and clergy of the new Christian communities to pray to God , and to conduct themselves in such_a_way_that the priestly gift they_are enjoying may grow in spiritual fruitfulness ; in their talks with the people , as often as feasible they_should praise the dignity , the beauty , and the merits of the priesthood , and , by so doing , they_will induce all those_whom God has chosen for_this exalted honor to respond to the call with an open and generous heart . They should_also cause the faithful entrusted to their care to pray to God for_this cause , in unity of spirit with the whole Church , which , in response to the Divine Redeemer s exhortations , prays '' the Lord of the Harvest to send forth laborers into_his harvest , '' especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , when '' the harvest indeed -isaia- great , but the laborers are few . '' Place of Foreign Missionaries . However , Christian communities to which missionaries still devote their zeal , although already governed by their_own hierarchy , are_still in need of the work of missionaries from other countries , either because of the vastness of the territory , or the increasing number of converts , or the multitude of those_who_have not_yet benefited from the doctrine of the Gospel . To such missionaries , no doubt , apply these_words of Our immediate predecessor : '' These cannot be considered foreigners , for all Catholic priests_who truly answer their_vocation feel themselves native sons wherever they work , in order_that the Kingdom of God may flourish and develop . '' Let them therefore work united by the bond of that loving , brotherly , and sincere charity_which mirrors the love they_must feel toward_the Divine Redeemer and His Church ; and , in prompt and filial obedience to their Bishops , whom '' the Holy Spirit placed . to rule_the Church of God , '' they_must be '' of one heart and one soul , '' grateful to each_other for the mutual cooperation and help ; indeed , if they act in this manner , it should be apparent to everyone s eyes that_they_are the disciples of Him Who , in His own and most distinctive '' new '' commandments , exhorted all to a mutual and always increasing love . Our predecessor Benedict XV , in his Apostolic Letter Maximum illud , especially exhorted Catholic mission authorities to mold and shape the minds and souls of the clergy selected from the local population , and to do so in such_a_way_that their formation and education would turn out '' perfect and complete in every respect . '' '' In fact , '' he wrote , '' a native priest , having a place of birth , character , mentality , and emotional make up in common with_his countrymen , -isaia- in a privileged position for sowing the seeds of the Faith in their_hearts : indeed , he knows much better_than a stranger the ways of persuasion with_them . Regarding the requirements of a perfect priestly formation and education , it -isaia- necessary_that seminarians be induced , tactfully but firmly , to espouse those virtues which_are the prime qualification of the priestly calling , '' that_-isaia- , the duty to achieve personal sanctification . '' The newly ordained native clergy of those countries must enter_into pious competition with the clergy of those old dioceses which_have long been producing priests in their midst who_were such mirrors of virtue that_they_are proposed as examples to the clergy of the whole Church . In fact , it -isaia- through sanctity that priests can and must be the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth . In other_words , they_can , especially by their sanctity , show their_own countrymen and the whole_world the beauty and the supernatural power of the Gospel ; they_can teach all men that a perfect Christian life_-isaia- a goal toward which all of God s children must strive , struggling and persevering with all their strength , regardless of their place of birth , their walk of life , or the degree of civilization they enjoy . Native Teachers in Seminaries . Furthermore , Our fatherly soul harbors the happy hope_that everywhere the local clergy will_be_able to select from among its ranks just and holy men capable of governing , forming , and educating their_own seminarians . That -isaia- the reason_why We are_already instructing the bishops and the mission authorities to choose without hesitation from among the local clergy those priests_who , for their exceptional virtue and wise actions , qualify as teachers in the local seminaries and are_able to lead their students to sanctity . Furthermore , Venerable Brethren , as you well know , the Church has prescribed -atti_degli_apostoli- all times that priests must prepare for their calling by means of a solid intellectual and spiritual education . Indeed , no one will doubt , especially in our_time , that young_people of all races and from all parts_of_the_world are capable of absorbing such an education ; this_fact has_already_been clearly demonstrated . Without doubt , the formation to be given to this clergy must_take into_account_the circumstances which obtain in different areas and nations . This extremely wise norm applies to all students for the priesthood ; it -isaia- advisable that young seminarians never be '' educated in places too far removed from human_society , '' because '' once they step out into_the_world , they_will have problems in dealing both with simple people and with intellectuals ; this_will often cause them to assume the wrong attitude toward_the Christian population , or to regard the formation they received as a bad one . '' Indeed , it -isaia- necessary_that youths not_only conform to the ideal of priestly spiritual perfection in everything , but also_that they '' gradually and prudently penetrate the mentality and feelings of the people '' of the people , We repeat , whom they_must enlight with the truth of the Gospel and lead to perfection of life , with the help of God s grace . Therefore , it -isaia- necessary_that seminary superiors conform to this plan of training and education while yet welcoming those material and technical facilities which_the genius of mankind has made the patrimony , as it were , of every civilization in order to insure an easier and better life and to preserve the bodily health and safety of mankind . Training for Responsibility . The formation of the local clergy , as Our same predecessor , Benedict XV , wrote , must enable them in compliance with the first requirement of their divine calling , '' to assume rightly the rule of their_people '' to lead their_people , by the influence of their teaching and their_ministry , along the path to eternal_salvation . To this_end , We highly recommend that everyone , whether local or foreign , who contributes to the formation in question , do his conscientious best to develop in these students a sense of the importance and difficulty of their_mission , and a capability for wisely and discreetly using the freedom allowed to them . This should be done so that_they_may be in a position to assume , quickly and progressively , all the functions , even the most important ones , pertaining to their calling , not_only in harmonious cooperation_with the foreign clergy , but_also on an equal footing with_them . Indeed , this_-isaia- the touchstone of the effectiveness of their formation , and will be the best reward for the efforts of all those_who contributed to it . Indeed , in considering all the elements pertaining not_only to the right intellectual and spiritual formation of the students for the priesthood but_also the needs and to the special mentality and emotional make up of their_own people , this Apostolic See has_always recommended , both to the foreign and to the local clergy , that_they_should study the discipline of missiology . Our predecessor Benedict XV established chairs of this discipline in the Pontifical Urban Athenaeum of the Propagation of the Faith ; and Our immediate predecessor , Pius XII , remarked with satisfaction on the founding of the Institute of Missiology in the same university ; '' not_a_few faculties and chairs of missiology , '' he said , '' have_been established in Rome and in other places . '' Therefore , in the curricula of the seminaries of mission countries , there_will be no lack of studies pertaining to the various missiological disciplines , nor of technical training in all the practical skills which_are considered useful for the future work of the clergy in those countries . Therefore it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that their training not_only conform to the best ecclesiastical traditions of a solid and undiluted education , but also_that it open up and sharpen the minds of the seminarians in such_a_way as to enable each_individual to evaluate correctly his_own and his country s particular kind of culture , especially as it pertains to philosophical and theological teachings and their relation to the Christian religion . The Church and Cultures . '' The Catholic Church , '' stated Our same predecessor , '' has_never fostered an attitude of contempt or outright rejection of pagan teachings but , rather , has completed and perfected them_with Christian doctrine , after purifying them_from all dross of error . So , too , the Church , to a certain extent , consecrated native art and culture . , as well as the special customs and traditional institutions of the people . ; she_has even transformed their feast days , leaving unchanged their methods of computation and their form , but dedicating them to the memory of the martyrs and to the celebration of the sacred Mysteries . '' We Ourselves have_already expressed Our thoughts on this_matter as follows : '' Wherever artistic and philosophical values exist which_are capable of enriching the culture of the human_race , the Church fosters and supports these labors of the spirit . On the other_hand , the Church , as you_know , does_not identify itself with any_one culture , not_even with European and Western civilization , although the history of the Church -isaia- closely intertwined with it ; for the mission entrusted to the Church pertains chiefly to other matters , that_-isaia- , to matters which_are concerned_with religion and the eternal_salvation of men . The Church , however , which_-isaia- so full of youthful vigor and -isaia- constantly renewed by the breath of the Holy Spirit , -isaia- willing , -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , to recognize , welcome , and even assimilate anything that redounds to the honor of the human mind_and_heart , whether or not it originates in parts_of_the_world washed by the Mediterranean Sea , which , from the beginning of time , had_been destined by God s Providence to be the cradle of the Church . '' Conversion of the Learned . If native priests_are well instructed in these practical matters and serious disciplines , and if they overcome difficulties and are equipped to take the right course of action , they will_be_able , under guidance of their bishops , to make highly valuable contributions . In particular , they_will find a more sympathetic audience among the educated citizens of their_own countries and will_be_able to attract them to the Christian truth , in the manner of the famous missionary , Matthew Ricci . This will happen especially in those countries which possess an ancient and highly developed civilization of their_own . Indeed , local priests_are entrusted with the mission of '' bringing every mind into captivity to the obedience of Christ , '' as Paul , that incomparable missionary and apostle of the people , affirmed ; thus , they_will also be '' held in great honor by the members of the intellectual elite of their_country . Therefore , making use of their judgment and cooperation , bishops will take_care to establish , -atti_degli_apostoli- opportune moments , study centers to meet_the needs of one or more regions in order to make basic doctrine known and understood . In these , both foreign and local priests can employ their learning and experience to benefit the particular countries in which_they were born or in which_they_have chosen to spread the Christian truth . In this connection , We should_also like to quote the teaching of Our immediate predecessor Pius XII , expressed in these_words : there_must be promoted '' the publication and dissemination of Catholic books of every description '' ; and care must_be_taken to advance '' the use of modern means of communication in spreading Christian doctrine . No one_can ignore the importance of gaining the good_will of native peoples and making them favorable to Catholicism . '' Certainly , all methods cannot be employed in all places ; all opportunities must_be_taken , however , to fulfill different needs , whenever they arise , even_though , sometimes , '' one sows , another reaps . '' Social Welfare Work . To propagate the truth of Jesus Christ -isaia- the truest function of the Church . Indeed , '' it -isaia- the solemn duty of the Church to impart to . peoples , so far_as_possible , the outstanding blessings of her_life and her teaching , from which a new social_order should be derived , based on Christian principles . '' Therefore , in mission territories , the Church takes the most generous measures to encourage social welfare projects , to support welfare work_for the poor , and to assist Christian communities and the peoples concerned . Care must_be_taken , however , not to clutter and obstruct the apostolic work of the missions with an excessive quantity of secular projects . Economic assistance must be limited to necessary undertakings which_can be easily maintained and utilized , and to projects whose organization and administration can be easily transferred to the lay men_and_women of the particular nation , thus allowing the missionaries to devote_themselves to their task of propagating the faith , and to other pursuits aimed directly -atti_degli_apostoli- personal sanctification and eternal_salvation . If it -isaia- true , as We said , that in order for the apostolate to bear abundant fruits , the most important requirement the native priests must meet -isaia- that_they_should know , and carefully evaluate , everything connected_with_the institutions peculiar to their countries , what Our predecessor said of the whole_world will remain even truer : '' the prospects and plans of the Church , which embrace the whole_world , will be the prospects and plans of their_daily Christian lives . '' To this_end , the native clergy not_only will be bound to know_the affairs and developments of the universal Church , but must_also be guided by , and filled_with , that charity_which embraces all the faithful . This -isaia- the reason_why St . John Chrysostom said of Christian liturgical celebrations : '' When we approach the altar , we pray , above all , for the whole universe and the common_good '' ; and St . Augustine uttered a beautiful sentence : '' Extend your charity to the whole_world , if you want to love Christ , because the members of Christ s body cover the whole_world . Indeed , it was in this_spirit that Our predecessor Benedict XV , in order to preserve the integrity of the concept of Catholic unity , which_must inspire all missionary work , sternly warned of a danger which he did not_hesitate to define in these_words , and which_must be avoided by missionaries in their thoughts , lest it jeopardize the effectiveness of their actions : '' It would be a sad thing if any missionary should appear to be so oblivious of his dignity as to think of his country on earth rather_than of his fatherland in heaven , and be excessively concerned_with increasing the power and the glory of his_own nation above all other nations . Such conduct would greatly impair the cause of the apostolate , and would cut the sinews of charity in his_heart , while lowering his prestige in the eyes of the public . This danger , in different_ways and forms , could arise again in our_time , especially since several countries already enlightened by the light of the Gospel have_been aroused to seek freedom and self government . The acquisition of political freedom can sometimes be accompanied by disorders and excesses which_are detrimental to the common_good and are the opposite of the spirit of Christian charity . We feel perfectly confident , however_,_that the native clergy -isaia- animated by lofty purposes and sentiments which conform to the general principles of the Christian religion and entirely correspond with the teachings of the Catholic Church , which embraces all men with the same love ; We are_also certain_that they contribute their share to the real interests of their_own nations . In this connection , Our Predecessor very aptly uttered the following words of warning : '' The Catholic Church -isaia- not a stranger among any people or nation . '' No Christian community anywhere will ever achieve unity with the Universal Church , from which emanates the supernatural life of Jesus Christ , if the local clergy and population succumb to the influence of a particularist spirit , if they arouse enmity in other nations , and if they_are misled and perturbed by an ultra nationalism which_can destroy the spirit of universal charity that charity upon which_the Church of God -isaia- built and -isaia- called '' Catholic . Our predecessor Benedict XV , as We mentioned above , stressed particularly the necessity of a scholarly , intensive , and adequate formation of the native clergy , which_must be equal to current circumstances . Undoubtedly he was aware of another need , equally important : the need to educate and indoctrinate the laity of each nation in such_a_way_that they_will not_only be worthy of their Christian calling in their private lives , but will_also engage in active apostolic work . Our immediate predecessor Pius XII dealt_with the subject well and significantly , and recommended again_and_again that today this cause be attended to with_great fervor and be carried_out to the greatest degree and as soon as possible . Need for Lay Help . Our predecessor Pius XII and this redounds to his special credit and praise exhorted the laity , with eloquent and abundant doctrine and repeated admonitions , willingly and zealously to enter_the apostolic field and give their active cooperation to the ecclesiastical hierarchy , in the same way_in_which , since_the times of the early Church and throughout_the centuries , the faithful have cooperated with_their bishops and their clergy , to enable them to carry_out_their tasks more_easily and with_greater efficacy , in religious and social fields . Our times require this effort , not less , nay , even_more , since requirements of this_kind have grown , and the greatly increased multitudes are hungry for the spiritual food of true doctrine . Indeed , their circumstances have_become more difficult and complex . And , wherever the Church fights her peaceful battles , she must be able to count on a complete organization , including not_only the different grades of the hierarchy , but_also the ranks of the laity proper . It -isaia-_also necessary_that her work of salvation be carried_out equally by all . Numbers Not Enough . In order to achieve this_purpose , it -isaia- hardly sufficient for new Christian communities to convert men to the Catholic religion and , after purifying them_with_the water of Baptism , to number them among the members of the Church ; it -isaia- altogether necessary , after giving the individual a Christian education suitable to his circumstances and times , to make him capable of promoting , as much as he can , the present and future good and growth of the Church . The sheer number of Christians means little if they lack virtue ; that_-isaia- , if , while enjoying the name of Catholic , they_do_not stand firm in their determination ; if their_spiritual life does_not flourish and fails to produce wholesome fruits ; if , after being reborn to divine_grace , they_do_not excel in that spirit of vigorous and sensible youthfulness which_-isaia- always ready to perform generous and useful deeds . Their profession_of_faith must_not only be a statistic in a census , but must create a new man , and give all his actions a supernatural strength , inspiring , guiding , and controlling them . Need for Planning . Nevertheless , men recruited from the ranks of the laity will_find it difficult fully to achieve their goal , if the clergy , either foreign or local , will_not plan , -atti_degli_apostoli- the right time , the program which We mentioned above , and which_the first Vicar of Jesus already outlined in the following words : '' You , however , are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a purchased people ; that_you_may proclaim_the perfection of him_who has called you out of darkness into_his marvellous light . '' Education for the Apostolate . Indeed , a Christian formation and education which_would only consider teaching the faithful the formulas of the Catechism and inculcating in their_minds the principal precepts of moral theology , with a brief list of possible cases , without inspiring their_souls and wills to act according to the instructions received , would run the serious risk of acquiring for the Church a passive flock . On the contrary , it -isaia- necessary_that the sheep of the Christian flock not_only listen to their Shepherd , but_also know his voice , and that_the_faithful willingly follow_him to the pastures of eternal_life , so that_one day they_may receive from the Prince of Shepherds the '' unfading crown of glory . '' These sheep as We said , recognizing and following the Shepherd , who lays down his_life for his sheep , will_give themselves entirely to him , and , obeying the Divine Will with the most ardent zeal , will lovingly and actively strive to bring into the one and only true fold all the other sheep , who not_only are_not following him , but have long been straying away from him , who_-isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life . Profession of the Christian faith_-isaia- not intelligible without strong , lively apostolic fervor ; in fact , '' everyone -isaia- bound to proclaim his faith to others , either to give good example and encouragement to the rest of the faithful , or to check the attacks of unbelievers , '' especially in our_time , when_the universal Church and human_society are beset by many difficulties . To make a full and effective Christian education possible , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that administrators and teachers find ways and means by which_they will_be_able to understand and approach the minds of others and their characteristic temperaments , their inclinations and their intentions . This should be done so that the new followers of Jesus Christ will assimilate the precepts of the truth of the Gospel , together_with its norms and requirements and will be wholly formed by them . Our Redeemer did , in fact , entrust each_one of us with compliance with this_great commandment : '' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thy whole mind . '' Indeed , the sublimity of the Christian calling should shine in all its splendor before the eyes of those_who embrace the Catholic religion , so that their_hearts will be fired with the desire , the strong resolution to lead a life adorned with all the Christian virtues and distinguished by apostolic activity : a life , We say , modeled on the luminous example of Jesus Christ , who , taking upon Himself our nature , commanded us to follow in His footsteps . Witnesses to the Truth . Anyone who deems himself a Christian must know that_he_-isaia- bound by his conscience to the basic , imperative duty of bearing_witness to the truth in which he believes and to the grace_which has transformed his_soul . A great Father of the Church has said : '' He Christ left us on earth in order that_we_should become like beacons of light and teachers unto others ; that we might act like leaven , move among_men like angels , be like men unto children , and like spiritual men unto animal men , in order to win them over , and that_we_may be like seed , and bear abundant fruits . There would be no need_for sermons , if our_lives were shining ; there_would be no need_for words , if we bore witness with_our deeds . There would be no more pagans , if we were true Christians . All Christians all over the world must fulfill this obligation ; yet it -isaia- easy to see_that if it were carried_out in the mission territories , it would bear special and abundant fruits , particularly valuable for extending the Kingdom of God among_those who_do_not know_the wonderful gift of our Faith and the supernatural power of grace . Thus Jesus Christ admonishes us : '' Even so let your light shine before men , in order that_they_may see your good_works and give glory to your Father in Heaven '' ; and St . Peter exhorts the faithful to '' abstain from carnal desires which war against the soul . Behave yourselves honorably among the pagans , that , whereas they slander you as evildoers , they_may , through observing you by reason of your good_works , glorify God in the day of visitation . The testimony rendered by individuals must be confirmed and enlarged by the testimony of the whole Christian community , in the same way_in_which the newly established Church enjoyed the unanimous backing and close knit support of all the faithful , who '' continued steadfastly in the teaching of the Apostles , and in the communion of the breaking of the bread and in the prayers . '' Their unity in the practice of the most generous charity gave them profound joy and mutual edification ; in fact , they_were '' praising God and being in favor with all the people . And day_by_day the Lord added to their company such as were to be saved . Union in prayer and in active participation in the mysteries of the sacred_liturgy enormously enriches and completes the Christian life of individuals and of the whole community , and it greatly helps educate the soul to charity , which_-isaia- the distinguishing mark of the true Christian ; a charity , We say , which overcomes all differences between languages and nationalities , and amicably embraces all men , whether brothers or enemies . In this connection , We like to repeat the words of Our predecessor Pope Clement : '' When they the pagans hear from us that God says , You have no merit if you love those_who love you , but you_have merit if you love your enemies and those_who hate you when_they hear this , they admire the grace of your charity ; but when_they see_that we not_only do not love those_who hate us , but do not_even reciprocate the love of those_who love us , they_will mock us and God s name will be blasphemed . '' The greatest missionary of all , St . Paul the Apostle , -atti_degli_apostoli- the time_when he was on the point of bringing the message of God s word to the people , as far as the farthest reaches of the Western world , wrote to the Romans and exhorted them to practice '' love without pretense . '' Earlier , with sublime expression , he had praised that virtue without_which a Christian -isaia- nothing . Charity also becomes visible through material help ; as Our predecessor Pius XII stated : '' The body also requires a multitude of members , which_are joined together for the purpose of helping one_another . If in our mortal organism one member ails , all the other members suffer with it ; and those members which_are sound , come to the help of the sick one ; by the same token , in the Church , the individual members do not live only_for themselves , but_also to help the others , and all of them help one_another for their mutual comfort , as well as for a better development of the Mystical Body . The material necessities which affect the faithful also affect the life and structure of the Church . It -isaia- therefore necessary_that native Christians become accustomed to supporting , spontaneously and within_the limits of their means , their churches , institutions , and clergy , who_are entirely devoting themselves to them . It does_not matter whether_they can_give much , but_it_-isaia- of the greatest importance that what_-isaia- contributed -isaia- proof of a conscience that_-isaia- practicing Christian discipline . The Christian faithful , members of a living organism , cannot remain aloof and think that_they_have done their_duty when they_have satisfied their_own spiritual needs ; every_individual must give his assistance to those_who_are working for the increase and propagation of God s kingdom . Our predecessor Pius XII reminded all of their common duty in these_words : '' A principal note of the Church -isaia- catholicity ; consequently , a man_-isaia- no true member of the Church unless he -isaia- likewise a true member of the entire body of Christian believers and -isaia- filled_with an ardent desire to see her take root and flourish in every land . '' The Duty of Teaching the Faith . In this_matter , therefore , all Christians must compete in pious rivalry , and give constant proof of their concern_for the spiritual well_being of other people by defending their Faith and teaching it to those_who either do not_know it -atti_degli_apostoli- all , or do not_know it well enough and therefore misjudge it . It -isaia- necessary_that priests , families , and local apostolic organizations instil this religious duty in the young , from early childhood and adolescence , even in newly established Christian communities . Nor -isaia- there a dearth of favorable opportunities_for stressing , in a suitable and effective manner , this_duty of an apostolate : as for example , the preparation of children or newly baptized adults for the sacrament of Confirmation , through_which '' new strength -isaia- granted to the faithful courageously to guard and defend their Mother Church and the Faith they received_from her . '' This preparation -isaia-_especially suited for populations who_have in their local customs special initiation rites , through_which adolescents are officially received into_their tribal groups . We cannot neglect here to give credit to the work of catechetical organizations , which , in the course of the long history of the Catholic missions , have_always given them special , necessary help . There was never a time_when catechists were_not excellent assistants to missionaries , sharing their labors and relieving them . Our predecessors have openly affirmed that '' for the propagation of the Gospel , it -isaia- important_that their numbers be multiplied , '' and have stated_that their function was '' perhaps the most shining example of the apostolate to be carried_out by the laity . '' We , too , while again giving catechists Our warmest praise , exhort them to meditate even_more attentively on the happiness of soul which_this work brings , and never to cease from making the greatest efforts , under_the_guidance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy , to cultivate better the study of religion and their_own spiritual formation . Catechists must learn from the hierarchy not_only the rudimentary elements of the Faith , but_also the practice of virtue and a fervent , sincere love for Christ . Instrumental in the establishment and subsequent abundant growth of new Christian communities -isaia- the care devoted to increasing the numbers of those_who effectively help the ecclesiastical hierarchy , and to perfecting their formation for any_other labors they may_have to perform in order to carry_out_their task in the most effective and perfect manner . In Our first Encyclical Letter , We already recalled various important reasons which_make it imperative , in our_time , to recruit in all parts_of_the_world '' the laity to the ranks of a peaceful militia , Catholic Action , so that the laity should cooperate in the apostolate of the hierarchy . '' We commented on this with the following words : '' It gives Us great comfort that , over the years , in lands that are_still mission territories , these valuable aides to bishops and priests have worked so hard for the success of their projects . '' And now , impelled '' by the love of Christ , '' We wish to renew urgently the exhortations and appeals of Our predecessor Pius XII : '' It -isaia- necessary_that laymen give their generous , zealous , and active cooperation , joining the clergy in their apostolic work and swelling to large numbers the ranks of Catholic Action . '' The bishops of mission countries endeavored to do their best to carry_out the directives of the Supreme Pontiff , together_with_the regular and religious clergy , and the most generous and well trained laymen ; We can state that splendid successes in this_field are_being achieved all over the earth . Adaptation to Local Conditions . However , it -isaia- necessary and We can_never warn sufficiently of this that_this form of apostolate be carefully adapted to local conditions and needs . What has_been done in one country cannot be carried over indiscriminately to another . The people concerned , submitting in all things to the directives of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and willingly obeying their pastors , must beware of defeating the purposes of the apostolate by carrying the burden of an excessive number of activities . For thus they thwart valuable efforts and dissipate valuable energy through compartmentalized and overly specialized projects , which , while satisfactory elsewhere , may be less useful where different conditions and needs prevail . In Our first encyclical , We also promised to deal_with the subject of Catholic Action in more detail and -atti_degli_apostoli- greater length ; when We do , We trust that the mission territories will receive additional support and a new incentive . In the meantime , let everyone work in perfect harmony and with supernatural inspiration , in the certainty_that only thus will they be able to say that_they_are serving the divine cause and the common_good of their_people . Training for Leadership . Catholic Action -isaia- an association of laymen '' who_are entrusted with certain duties , which involve executive responsibilities , to be carried_out in submission to the hierarchy '' ; thus laymen do hold executive offices therein . For this_reason it -isaia- necessary to train men_who are capable of enkindling different organizations with apostolic zeal and insuring their most efficient operation ; men_and_women , We say , who in order to be worthy of managerial and executive roles in these organizations , entrusted to them by the ecclesiastical hierarchy , must furnish convincing proof that_they possess a solid Christian formation , both intellectual and moral , in order_that '' they_may impart to others what , with the help of God s grace , they_have won for themselves . '' The Christian School . It can rightly be said_that the natural seat and , as it were , the training ground , where these lay executives of Catholic Action are prepared_for their functions , -isaia- the Christian school ; and this school will achieve its purposes , and fulfill its task , only insofar as its teachers , whether priests , religious , or laymen , educate and turn out true Christians . Schools of the Apostolate . Everyone -isaia- aware of the great_importance , present and future , of the mission country schools , and of how_much effort and work the Church has devoted to establishing schools of every description and level and to defending their existence and well_being . It -isaia- obviously difficult to add to school curricula a program of formation for Catholic Action executives , and therefore it will often be necessary to resort to extracurricular methods to bring together the most promising youths , and train them in the theory and practice of the apostolate . The local_ordinaries must , therefore , use their prudent judgment in assessing the best ways and means_for opening schools of the apostolate , in which , obviously , the type of instruction will be different from that in ordinary schools . Sometimes the task will be to preserve from false doctrine children and adolescents who must attend non Catholic schools ; in any event , it will_always be necessary to balance the humanistic and technological education offered by the public schools with a formation based on spiritual values , so that the schools may_not turn out falsely educated men , swollen with arrogance , who_can hurt the Church and their_own people instead of helping them . Their spiritual education must_always be commensurate with_their intellectual development , and must be planned to make_them lead a life inspired by Catholic principles in their particular social and professional environments ; in time , they_must be able to take their places in Catholic organizations . To this_end , if Catholic youths should be forced to leave their communities and attend public schools in other towns and cities , it will be expedient to open social centers and boarding houses , in which Christian life and morals are safely preserved , and the talents and energies of the young_people are directed toward lofty apostolic ideals . By thus entrusting to the schools the special and highly useful tasks of preparing Catholic Action executives , We do not , however , intend to exempt families from their responsibilities , or to minimize in any_way their influence , which -atti_degli_apostoli- times equips them even better for nurturing apostolic fervor in the souls of their_children , for instructing them in Christian precepts , and for preparing them_for action . The home -isaia- , in fact , an excellent and irreplaceable school . Problems in Public Life . The '' good fight '' in the cause of the Faith -isaia- fought not_only in the secrecy of the individual conscience or in the privacy of the home , but_also in public_life in all of its forms . In all the different parts_of_the_world there exist nowadays problems of various kinds . There -isaia- no solution to these problems in exclusively human advice nor in principles_which are_often in contrast with the precepts of Christian law . Several mission countries are_now '' undergoing such speedy changes in social , economic , and political_life that_their entire future appears to depend on the outcome of those changes . '' Indeed , problems which some_countries have_already solved or are solving with the help of their experience and traditions , are urgently in need of solution in other countries . There the problems are beset by serious dangers , inasmuch as they could be approached with deplorable levity , by resorting to certain doctrines which disregard , or even oppose , the religious values of individuals and nations . In order to safeguard both their private interests and those of the Church , Catholics must_not ignore such problems , or wait until they_are given the wrong solutions , which_would thereafter require a much greater expenditure of energy in order to correct them and would place further obstacles in the path of the propagation of the Christian religious in the world . Christians in Public Life . The laymen of mission countries exert their most direct and effective influence in the field of public activity , and it -isaia- necessary_that Christian communities take urgent , timely measures to bring laymen into the public_life of their countries for the common_good men_who not_only acquit themselves creditably in their professions and trades , but are_also an asset to the Church which re created them in her grace . Thus may their pastors praise them_with_the words_which we read in the writings of St . Basil : '' I thanked the Most Holy God for the fact_that , even_though busily attending to public affairs , you did_not neglect the interests of the Church : on the contrary , each_one of you has_been solicitous of her affairs just as though_they had_been your_own private affairs , and , indeed , as though your life depended on it . Particularly in the held of education , in organized public welfare , in trade unions , and in public administration , will the talents of local Catholic experts play a paramount role , if they , following the duty imposed by their consciences a duty whose neglect would be traitorous base their thinking and action on Christian principles . These , as we learn from experience acquired in the course of many centuries , possess the highest power and influence for the pursuit of the common_good . Aid to Missions from Catholic Groups . Everybody knows how the mutual assistance which_-isaia- exchanged among Catholic organizations established all over the world can be as Our predecessor Pius XII has pointed_out of great use and much value to the apostolate of the laity in mission territories . On the educational plane , these organizations can_help by devising Christian solutions to current problems , especially social problems , in the newly established nations ; on the apostolic plane , they can_help by recruiting and organizing a body of laymen , willing to serve under Christ s banner . We know_that this has_been done , and -isaia- being done , by lay missionaries who chose to leave their countries , either temporarily or for life , in order to contribute , by manifold activities , to the social and religious welfare of mission countries . Let us pray fervently to God that the numbers of these generous Christians be multiplied , and that God s support will_never be absent in their difficulties and labors , which_they_are meeting with truly apostolic spirit . The Secular Institutes will_be_able to give the local laity in mission territories generous and loyal help , if , by their example , they attract imitators , and if they place their talents and work , promptly and willingly , -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the local_ordinaries , in order to speed the growing up process of the new Christian communities . Lay Help From Afar . We appeal especially to all Catholic laymen everywhere who_are distinguishing themselves in their professions and in public_life to consider seriously how they can_help their newly acquired brethren in the Faith , even without leaving their countries . They can do this by giving them the benefit of their advice , their experience , and their technical assistance ; they_can , without too much labor or grave inconvenience , sometimes give_them help that_will be decisive . Good men will surely find a way to fulfill this fatherly desire of Ours . They will_make Our wish known to those_whom they find favorably disposed , in order first to arouse good_will , and then to channel it into the most suitable work . Students from Abroad . Our immediate predecessor exhorted the bishops '' with the same affectionate interest that shares work with_others in fraternal harmony and excludes all selfish considerations '' to provide_for the spiritual assistance of young Catholics who come to their dioceses from mission countries to study and to acquire the necessary experience for assuming leadership in their_own nations . All of you , Venerable Brethren , are aware of the intellectual and moral dangers to which_they will be exposed in a society which_-isaia-_not only different from their_own but_also , alas , may be unfavorable ground for the growth of their Faith , and not capable of attracting them to the practice of Christian virtue . Each one of you , moved by the missionary spirit which_-isaia- a conscientious duty of all pastors , will meet this situation with the greatest charity and zeal , using the most suitable means . It will_not be difficult for you to find these students and entrust them to the care of priests and laymen who_are equipped for this_task . It should_not be difficult to assuage their_spiritual needs , and , last but_not least , to have them experience the sweet consolations of Christian charity in which_we_are all brothers , ministering to one_another s welfare . Therefore , to the many kinds of help which_you are_now giving the missions , add this particular one , which brings close to your hearts those regions of the world_which , although far away , are entrusted_to_your care . To these students We would_like not_only to reveal the affection We feel for them , but_also to exhort them , urgently and lovingly , to carry their heads high and proud , marked with the sign of Jesus blood and with the sacred chrism ; We would_like to exhort them during their stay abroad never to bypass an opportunity not_only to acquire the right professional training but_also to achieve perfection in their religious education . Although they_will be exposed to dangers and evils , they_will nevertheless have a wonderful opportunity to share in many spiritual advantages while living in Catholic countries , if all the faithful remember_that , whoever and wherever they_are , they_must be a good example to others and bring mutual edification to one_another . After conversing with you , Venerable Brethren , on the most important and typical needs of the Church in mission countries , We cannot_fail to express Our heartfelt gratitude to all those_who_are toiling for the propagation of the Faith in the farthest reaches of the earth , without sparing any efforts . For the missionaries from both the religious and the regular clergy ; for the holy virgins who_are fruitfully and actively helping the missions ; and for the lay missionaries , precious allies of the clergy , who_have_been diligent in helping to advance the cause of religion for all of them , We offer Our daily and special prayers , and every_kind of help that lies within Our power . The success of their_work , which_-isaia- apparent in the spiritual vigor of newly established Christian communities , -isaia- an indication of God s favor and a proof of the solicitude and wisdom with_which_the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and the Congregation of the Oriental Church are carrying_out their_work . A Call for Help . We exhort all the bishops , the clergy , and the faithful of the dioceses of the whole_world , who_are contributing to relieve the spiritual and material necessities of the missions by their prayers and offerings , to increase voluntarily their badly needed contributions . Despite the scarcity of priests which besets even the pastors of the oldest dioceses , there_should be no hesitation in encouraging missionary vocations and in releasing the very best and most useful laymen , that_they_may be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the new dioceses ; heavenly consolations will soon be derived_from this sacrifice , made for the furtherance of God s cause . Indeed , just as such needs constantly increase , so in equal measure increases the generous effort in which_the faithful of the whole_world are engaging to cooperate with missionary organizations which , under_the_guidance of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , are channeling contributions received_from every source toward_the most suitable and urgent destinations . Willing help and material contributions readily and copiously offered by their brethren will encourage the members of newly established Christian communities , to live in the service of their religion , and will_bring them the warmth of supernatural affection , which_-isaia- nourished in the human_heart by grace . Many dioceses and Christian communities in mission territories are_being harassed by difficulties and sometimes even by active persecution . We therefore exhort everyone to persevere courageously in the battle which he -isaia- fighting for God s cause : the pastors who_are giving their_children in God the example of a faith which_does_not falter even in mortal danger ; and the faithful_who are_being so grievously tried by adversity and are therefore so dear to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , who promised beatitude and abundant rewards to those who_suffer persecution for_justice sake . God , in His inscrutable but always merciful designs , will sustain them_with heavenly favors , consolations , and joy . The whole Church -isaia- united with the persecuted in a communion of prayer and sorrow , with the certainty_that final victory will be hers . From the bottom of Our heart , We call down upon the missions the worthy protection of their patrons and martyrs , and , first_and_foremost , the intercession of Mary , Mother and Queen of the Missions . With the greatest affection We impart to each_one of you , Venerable Brethren , and to all those_who in any_way contribute to the propagation of God s kingdom , Our Apostolic Blessing . May it be a token and a pledge of the supernatural favors of the Eternal Father , who appeared to the world through His Son , the Savior of mankind , and may it kindle and multiply missionary zeal in the hearts of all .

Venerable Brethren and Beloved Sons , Greetings and Apostolic Benediction . We who_have_been elevated despite Our unworthiness to the Chair of Peter have often reflected on the things We saw and heard when Our predecessor passed from this_life . Virtually the entire world , regardless of race or creed , mourned his passing . And then when We were summoned to the dignity of Sovereign Pontiff , great numbers of people , although occupied with other_things or weighed down with troubles and difficulties , turned their thoughts and affections to us , and placed their hopes and expectations in Us . For these reflections of Ours , We have drawn comfort and instruction . For this experience certainly -isaia- clear indication that the Catholic Church -isaia- forever young and -isaia- indeed a standard raised before the nations . From her come a pervading light and a gentle love_which reach all men . Then We revealed Our plans to summon an Ecumenical Council and a Roman Synod , as well as to revise the Code of Canon Law in accordance_with present needs and to issue a new Code of Canon Law for the Church of the Oriental Rite . This announcement received widespread approval and bolstered the universal hope_that the hearts of men would be stirred to a fuller and deeper recognition of truth , a renewal of Christian morals , and a restoration of unity , harmony , and peace . Truth , Unity , Peace . Today as We address Our first Encyclical Letter to the entire Catholic world , Our apostolic_office clearly demands_that We discuss three objectives truth , unity , and peace and indicate how they_may be achieved and advanced in a spirit of charity . May the light of the Holy Spirit come upon Us from on high as We write this_letter and upon you as you read it . May the grace of God move all men to attain these objectives , which all desire , even_though prejudices , great difficulties , and many obstacles stand in the way of their achievement . All the evils which poison men and nations and trouble so many hearts have a single cause and a single source : ignorance of the truth and -atti_degli_apostoli- times even_more than ignorance , a contempt for truth and a reckless rejection of it . Thus arise all manner of errors , which enter_the recesses of men s hearts and the bloodstream of human_society as would a plague . These errors turn everything upside down : they menace individuals and society itself . And yet , God gave each of us an intellect capable of attaining natural truth . If we adhere to this_truth , we adhere to God Himself , the author of truth , the lawgiver and ruler of our_lives . But if we reject this_truth , whether out of foolishness , neglect , or malice , we turn our backs on the highest good itself and on the very norm for right living . As We have_said , it -isaia- possible_for us to attain natural truth by virtue of our intellects . But all cannot do this easily ; often their_efforts will result in a mixture of truth and error . This -isaia- particularly the case in matters of religion and sound morals . Moreover , we cannot possibly attain those truths_which exceed the capacity of nature and the grasp of reason , unless God enlightens and inspires us . This -isaia- why_the word of God , '' who dwells in light inaccessible , '' in His great love took pity on man s plight , '' became flesh and dwelt among us , '' that He might '' enlighten every man_who cometh into_the_world '' and lead him not_only to full and perfect truth , but to virtue and eternal happiness . All men , therefore , are_bound to accept the teaching of the gospel . For if this_-isaia- rejected , the very foundations of truth , goodness , and civilization are endangered . Truth and Error . It -isaia- clear_that We are discussing a serious matter , with_which our eternal_salvation -isaia-_very intimately connected . Some men , as the Apostle of the Gentiles warns us , are '' ever learning yet never attaining knowledge of the truth . '' They contend that the human mind can discover no truth that_-isaia- certain or sure ; they reject the truths revealed by God and necessary_for our eternal_salvation . Such men_have strayed pathetically far from the teaching of Christ and the views expressed by the Apostle when he said , '' Let us all attain to the unity of the faith and of the deep knowledge of the son of God . that_we_may no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine devised in the wickedness of men , in craftiness , according to the wiles of error . Rather are we to practice the truth in love , and grow up in all things in him_who_-isaia- the head , Christ . For from him the whole_body being closely joined and knit together through every joint of the system according to the functioning in due measure of each single part derives its increase to the building up of itself in love . Anyone who consciously and wantonly attacks known truth , who arms himself_with falsehood in his speech , his writings , or his conduct in order to attract and win over less learned men and to shape the inexperienced and impressionable minds of the young to his_own way of thinking , takes advantage of the inexperience and innocence of others and engages in an altogether despicable business . The Duties of the Press . In this connection we must urge to careful , exact , and prudent presentation of the truth those especially who , through the books , magazines , and daily newspapers which_are so abundant today , have such a great effect on the instruction and development of the minds_of_men , and especially of the young , and play such a large part in forming their opinions and shaping their characters . These people_have a serious duty to disseminate , not lies , error , and obscenity , but_only the truth ; they_are particularly bound to publicize what_-isaia- conducive to good and virtuous conduct , not to vice . For we see with deep sorrow what Our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII , lamented : '' Lies are boldly insinuated . into weighty tomes and slender volumes , into the transient pages of periodicals and the extravagant advertisements of the theater . '' We see '' books and magazines written to mock virtue and exalt depravity . '' Modem Media of Communication . And in this_day of ours , as you well know , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , we also have radio broadcasts , motion pictures , and television which_can enter easily into the home . All of these can provide inspiration and incentive for morality and goodness , even Christian virtue . Unfortunately , however , they can_also entice men , especially_the young , to loose morality and ignoble behavior , to treacherous error and perilous vice . The weapons of truth , then , must be used in defense against these weapons of evil . We must strive zealously and relentlessly to ward off the impact of this_great evil which_every day insinuates itself more_deeply . We must fight immoral and false literature with literature that_-isaia- wholesome and sincere . Radio broadcasts , motion pictures , and television shows which_make error and vice attractive must be opposed by shows which defend truth and strive to preserve the integrity and safety of morals . Thus these new arts , which_can work much evil , will be turned to the well_being and benefit of men , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time will supply worthwhile recreation . Health will come from a source which_has often produced only devastating sickness . Some men , indeed do not attack the truth wilfully , but work in heedless disregard of it . They act as though God had given us intellects for some purpose other_than the pursuit and attainment of truth . This mistaken sort of action leads directly to that absurd proposition : one religion_-isaia- just as good as another , for there_-isaia- no distinction here between truth and falsehood . '' This attitude , '' to quote Pope Leo again , '' -isaia-_directed to the destruction of all religions , but particularly the Catholic faith_,_which cannot be placed on a level with other_religions without serious injustice , since it alone_-isaia- true . '' Moreover , to contend that there_-isaia-_nothing to choose between contradictories and among contraries can lead only to this fatal conclusion : a reluctance to accept any religion either in theory or practice . How can God , who_-isaia- truth , approve or tolerate the indifference , neglect , and sloth of those_who attach no importance to matters on which_our eternal_salvation depends ; who attach no importance to pursuit and attainment of necessary truths , or to the offering of that proper worship which_-isaia- owed to God alone ? . So much toil and effort -isaia- expended today in mastering and advancing human knowledge that_our age glories and rightly in the amazing progress it has made in the field of scientific_research . But why do we not devote as much energy , ingenuity , and enthusiasm to the sure and safe attainment of that learning which concerns not this earthly , mortal life but the life_which lies ahead of us in heaven ? Our spirit will rest in peace and joy only_when we have reached that_truth which_-isaia- taught in the gospels and which_should be reduced to action in our_lives . This -isaia- a joy which surpasses by far any pleasure which_can come from the study of things human or from those marvellous inventions which we use today and are constantly praising to the skies . Once we have attained the truth in its fullness , integrity , and purity , unity should pervade our minds , hearts , and actions . For there_-isaia- only_one cause of discord , disagreement , and dissension : ignorance of the truth , or what_-isaia- worse , rejection of the truth once it has_been sought and found . It may be that the truth_-isaia- rejected because of the practical advantages which_are expected to result from false views ; it may be that_it_-isaia- rejected as a result of that perverted blindness which seeks easy and indulgent excuses for vice and immoral behavior . Truth , Peace , Prosperity . All men , therefore , private citizens as well as government officials , must love the truth sincerely if they_are to attain that peace and harmony on which depends all real prosperity , public_and_private . We especially urge to peace and unity those_who hold the reins of government . We who_are placed above international controversy have_the same affection for the people of all nations . We are led by no earthly advantages , no motives of political dominance , no desires for the things of this_life . When we speak of this serious matter Our thoughts can be given a fair hearing and judged impartially by the citizens of every nation . The Brotherhood of Man . God created men as brothers , not foes . He gave them the earth to be cultivated by their toil and labor . Each and every man_-isaia- to enjoy_the fruits of the earth and receive from it his sustenance and the necessities of life . The various nations are simply communities of men , that_-isaia- , of brothers . They are to work in brotherly cooperation for the common prosperity of human_society , not_simply for their_own particular goals . A Journey to Immortal Life . Besides this , our journey through_this mortal life should_not be regarded as an end in itself , entered upon merely for pleasure . This journey leads beyond_the burial of our human flesh to immortal life , to a fatherland which_will endure forever . If this_teaching , this consoling hope , were taken away from men , there_would be no reason_for living . Lusts , dissensions , and disputes would erupt from within us . There would be no reasonable check to restrain them . The olive branch of peace would_not shine in our_thoughts ; the firebrands of war would blaze there . Our lot would be cast with beasts , who_do_not have_the use of reason . Ours would be an even worse lot , for we do have_the use of reason and by abusing it which , unfortunately , often happens we can sink into a state lower than_that of beasts . Like Cain , we would commit a terrible crime and stain the earth with_our brother s blood . Before all else , then , we must turn our_thoughts to sound principles if we wish , as we should , to guide our actions along the path of justice . We are_called brothers . We actually are brothers . We share a common destiny in this_life and the next . Why , then , do we act as though we are foes and enemies ? Why do we envy one_another ? Why do we stir up hatred ? Why do we ready lethal weapons for use against our_brothers ? . There has_already_been enough warfare among_men ! Too many youths in the flower of life have shed their blood already ! Legions of the dead , all fallen in battle , dwell within this earth of ours . Their stern voices urge us all to return -atti_degli_apostoli- once to harmony , unity , and a just peace . All men , then , should turn their attention away from those_things that divide and separate us , and should consider how they_may be joined in mutual and just regard_for one_another s opinions and possessions . Unity Among Nations . Only if we desire peace , as we should , instead of war , and only if we all aspire sincerely to fraternal harmony among nations , shall it come to pass that public affairs and public questions are correctly understood and settled to the satisfaction of all . Then shall international conferences seek and reach decisions conducive to the longed for_unity of the whole human_family . In the enjoyment of that_unity , individual nations will see that_their right to liberty -isaia- not subject to another s whims but_-isaia- fully secure . Those who oppress others and strip them of their due liberty can contribute nothing to the attainment of this_unity . The mind of Our predecessor , Leo XIII , squares perfectly with this view : '' Nothing -isaia- better suited than Christian virtue , and especially justice , to check ambition , covetousness , and envy which_are the chief causes of war . But if men do not pursue this fraternal unity , based on the precepts of justice and nurtured by charity , then human affairs will remain in serious peril . This -isaia- why wise men grieve and lament ; they_are uncertain whether we are heading for sincere , true , and firm peace , or are rushing in complete blindness into the fires of a new and terrible war . We say '' in complete blindness , '' for if God forbid ! another war should break out , nothing but devastating destruction and total ruin await both victor and vanquished . The monstrous weapons our_age has devised will see to that ! . We ask all men , but particularly rulers of nations , to weigh these considerations prudently and seriously in the presence of God our protector . May they enter with a will upon those paths which_will lead to the unity that_-isaia- so badly needed . This harmonious unity will be restored when hearts are_-atti_degli_apostoli- peace , when_the rights of all are guaranteed , and when there_has dawned that liberty due everywhere to individual citizens , to the state , and to the Church . The harmonious unity_which must be sought among peoples and nations also needs ever_greater improvement among the various classes of individuals . Otherwise mutual antagonism and conflict can result , as we have_already seen . And the next step brings rioting mobs , wanton destruction of property , and sometimes even bloodshed . Meanwhile public_and_private resources diminish and are stretched to the danger point . On this_point Pope Leo XIII made apt and appropriate comment : '' God has commanded that_there be differences of classes in the human community and that_these classes , by friendly cooperation , work out a fair and mutual adjustment of their interests . '' For it -isaia- quite clear_that '' as the symmetry of the human frame results from suitable arrangement of the various parts of the body , so in a body politic it -isaia- ordained by nature that . the classes should dwell in harmony and agreement , so as to maintain the balance of the body politic . Each needs the other : capital cannot do without labor , nor labor without capital . Their mutual agreement will result in the splendor of right order . Anyone , therefore , who ventures to deny that_there are differences among social classes contradicts the very laws of nature . Indeed , whoever opposes peaceful and necessary cooperation among the social classes -isaia- attempting , beyond doubt , to disrupt and divide human_society ; he menaces and does serious injury to private interests and the public welfare . As Our predecessor , Pius XII wisely said , '' In a nation that_-isaia- worthy of the name , inequalities among the social classes present few or no obstacles to their union in common brotherhood . We refer , of course , to those inequalities which result not from human caprice but_from the nature of things inequalities having to do with intellectual and spiritual growth , with economic facts , with differences in individual circumstances , within , of course , the limits prescribed by justice and mutual charity . The various classes of society , as well as groups of individuals , may certainly protect their_rights , provided this_-isaia- done by legal means , not violence , and provided_that they do no injustice to the inviolable rights of others . All men_are brothers . Their differences , therefore , must be settled by friendly agreement , with brotherly_love for one_another . Improved Relations Among the Classes . On this_point it should be noted , and this gives_rise to hope_for a better future , that in some places in recent days relations among the classes have_been less bitter and difficult . As Our predecessor , addressing the Catholics of Germany , expressed it : '' The terrible disasters of the recent war plunged you into hardship , but produced -atti_degli_apostoli- least one blessing among the many classes of your population : prejudices and exaggerated ambitions for personal advantage have subsided ; the conflicting interests of the classes are nearer to reconciliation . Closer association with one_another since_the war has done this . Hard times borne together have taught you all a helpful , though bitter , lesson . As a matter of fact , the distances which separate the classes of society are shrinking . Since it -isaia-_no_longer a matter merely of '' capital '' and '' labor , '' the number of classes has multiplied , and all of them are readily accessible to all men . Anyone who_-isaia- diligent and capable has the opportunity to rise to higher levels of society . As for the condition of those_who live by their_daily toil , it -isaia- consoling to note that recently undertaken improvements in working conditions in factories and other places of employment have_done more_than give these workers a greater economic value ; they have_made their_lives nobler and more dignified . But there_-isaia- still a long way to go . For there_-isaia- still too much disparity in the possession of material goods , too much reason_for hostility among various groups , because of opinions on the right to property opinions sometimes unsound , sometimes not entirely just held by those_who desire unfair advantages and benefits for themselves . There -isaia-_also the threat of unemployment , a source of anxiety and unhappiness for_many men . And this problem can entail even greater difficulties today , when men are_being replaced by all sorts of advanced machines . Of this_kind of unemployment , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , uttered this complaint : '' There are , '' he said , '' honest working men almost beyond number who want only an opportunity to earn by honest means_that daily bread for_which , by divine command , we entreat our Father in heaven . But , instead , they_are reduced to idleness and , along_with their_families , reach the very depths of privation . Their unhappiness touches Our heart ; We are constrained to take pity and to repeat the merciful words that came from the heart of our Divine Master when He saw the multitude languishing in hunger : I have compassion on the crowd Mark . Indeed , if we long hopefully as we should for the realization of this mutual union among the classes of society , then we must do all that_we_can to bring it about by public_and_private endeavor and cooperation in courageous undertakings , that all men , even_those of the lowest classes , can obtain life s necessities by their toil and by the sweat of their brow , and that_they_can provide , in an honorable manner and with some degree of sureness , for their future and that of their_families . In addition , contemporary progress has made many conveniences an integral part of everyday life ; even the poorest citizens may_not be excluded from the enjoyment of these advantages . Moreover , we earnestly exhort all those_who_have responsible positions in the various areas of human endeavor and on whom_the lot of the workers and sometimes their_very lives depend , not_only that_they pay the just wages due to the labors of their workers or simply safeguard their_rights so far as wages are_concerned , but also_that they really consider them as men , or rather , as brothers . And so they_should see_to_it_that in some suitable way their employees are_able to share more_and_more in the fruits of their labor and come to regard themselves as partners in the entire enterprise . We give this counsel in order_that the rights_and_duties of employers may more_and_more be harmonized and reconciled with the rights_and_duties of employees , and that the associations representing the interests of each '' will_not seem like armies ready to make or repel attacks in such wise as to make_the enemy more resolute or to incite counterattack , or like a river which engulfs every obstacle in its course ; but like a bridge which joins opposite shores . It -isaia- very_important , however_,_that moral progress should_not lag behind economic progress . Anything else would be unworthy of men , not to say of Christians . If the working classes have an abundance of material goods and enjoy all the benefits of civilization while losing or neglecting those higher goods which pertain to the immortal soul , what does it profit them ? Christian Charity . But all will come out well if the social_teaching of the Catholic Church -isaia- applied as it should be to the problem . Everyone then must '' strive to preserve in himself and to arouse in others , be they of high or low degree , the queen and mistress of all the virtues , charity . The salvation we hope_for -isaia- to be expected primarily from a great outpouring of charity . We refer to that Christian charity_which -isaia- a principle synthesizing the entire gospel . That charity_-isaia- always ready to spend itself in the interest of others and -isaia- the surest remedy against worldly pride and immoderate self esteem . Paul the Apostle described the characteristics of this virtue when he said : Charity -isaia- patient , -isaia- kind ; -isaia- not selfseeking ; bears with all things , endures all things ; Cor . '' Unity Within the Family . We have called nations , their rulers , and all classes of society to harmonious unity . Now we sincerely urge families to achieve and strengthen this_unity within themselves . For unless peace , unity , and concord are present in domestic society , how_can they exist in civil_society ? . This harmonious unity which_should exist within_the family circle rises from the holiness and indissolubility of Christian marriage . It -isaia- the basis of much of the order , progress , and prosperity of civil_society . Within the family , the father stands in God s place . He must lead and guide the rest by his authority and the example of his good life . The mother , on the other_hand , should form her_children firmly and graciously by the mildness of her manner and by her virtue . Together the parents should carefully rear their_children , God s most_precious gift , to an upright and religious_life . Children must honor , obey , and love their_parents . They must give their_parents not_only solace but_also concrete assistance if it -isaia- needed . The charity_which burned in the household -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth should be an inspiration for_every family . All the Christian virtues should flourish in the family , unity should thrive , and the example of its virtuous living should shine brightly . We earnestly pray God to prevent any damage to this valuable , beneficial , and necessary union . The Christian family_-isaia- a sacred institution . If it totters , if the norms which_the divine Redeemer laid_down for it are rejected or ignored , then the very foundations of the state tremble ; civil_society stands betrayed and in peril . Now we shall discuss a unity which_-isaia- of particular concern to Us and -isaia- closely connected to the pastoral mission which God has_entrusted to Us : the unity of the Church . One Fold and One Shepherd . Everyone realizes , of course , that God our Redeemer founded this society_which was to endure to the end of time , for as Christ said , '' Behold , I -amos- with you all days , even unto the consummation of the world . '' For this intention He addressed ardent prayers to His Father : '' That all may be one , even as thou , Father , in me and I in thee ; that_they also may be one in Us . '' Surely this_prayer was heard and granted because of His reverent submission . This -isaia- a comforting hope ; it assures us that someday all the sheep who_are_not of this fold will want to return to it . Then , in the words of God our Savior , '' there shall be one fold and one shepherd . This fond hope compelled Us to make public Our intention to hold an Ecumenical Council . Bishops from every part_of_the_world will gather there to discuss serious religious topics . They will consider , in particular , the growth of the Catholic faith , the restoration of sound morals among the Christian flock , and appropriate adaptation of Church discipline to the needs and conditions of our_times . This event will be a wonderful spectacle of truth , unity , and charity . For those_who behold it but are_not one_with this Apostolic See , We hope_that it will be a gentle invitation to seek and find that_unity for_which Jesus Christ prayed so ardently to His Father in heaven . Movements Toward Union . We are_already aware , to Our great joy , that m any of the communities that_are separated_from the See of Blessed Peter have recently shown some inclination toward_the Catholic faith and its teachings . They have manifested a high regard_for this Apostolic See and an esteem which grows greater from day to day as devotion to truth overcomes earlier misconceptions . We have_taken note that almost all those_who_are adorned with the name of Christian even_though separated_from Us and from one_another have sought to forge bonds of unity by means of many congresses and by establishing councils . This -isaia- evidence that_they_are moved by an intense desire_for unity of some kind . A Mark of Christ s Church . When the Divine Redeemer founded His Church , there_-isaia- no doubt_that He made firm unity its cornerstone and one of its essential attributes . Had He not done this and it -isaia- absurd even to make such a suggestion He would_have founded a transient thing , which in time , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , would destroy itself . For in just this_way have nearly all philosophies risen from among the vagaries of human opinion : one after another , they come into being , they evolve , they_are forgotten . But this clearly cannot be the history of a divine teaching_authority founded by Jesus Christ , '' the way , the truth , and the life . But this_unity , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , must be solid , firm and sure , not transient , uncertain , or unstable . Though there_-isaia- no such unity in other Christian communities , all who look carefully can_see that_it_-isaia- present in the Catholic Church . Indeed , the Catholic Church -isaia- set apart and distinguished by these three characteristics : unity of doctrine , unity of organization , unity of worship . This unity -isaia- so conspicuous that by it all men can_find and recognize_the Catholic Church . It -isaia- the will of God , the Church s founder , that all the sheep should eventually gather into this one fold , under_the_guidance of one shepherd . All God s children are summoned to their father s only home , and its cornerstone -isaia- Peter . All men should work together like brothers to become part of this single kingdom of God ; for the citizens of that kingdom are_united in peace and harmony on earth that they_might enjoy eternal happiness some day in heaven . The Catholic Church teaches the necessity of believing firmly and faithfully all that God has revealed . This revelation -isaia- contained in sacred_scripture and in the oral and written tradition that_has come down through the centuries from the apostolic age and finds expression in the ordinances and definitions of the popes and legitimate Ecumenical Councils . Whenever a man_has wandered from this path , the Church has_never failed to use her_maternal authority to call him again_and_again to the right road . She knows well that_there_-isaia- no other truth than the one truth she treasures ; that_there can be no '' truths '' in contradiction of it . Thus she repeats and bears_witness to the words of the Apostle : '' For we can do nothing against the truth , but_only for the truth . The Catholic Church , of course , leaves many questions open to the discussion of theologians . She does this to the extent_that matters are_not absolutely certain . Far from jeopardizing the Church s unity , controversies , as a noted English author , John Henry Cardinal Newman , has remarked , can actually pave the way_for its attainment . For discussion can lead to fuller and deeper_understanding of religious truths ; when one idea strikes against another , there_may be a spark . But the common saying , expressed in various_ways and attributed to various authors , must be recalled with approval : in essentials , unity ; in doubtful matters , liberty ; in all things , charity . That there_-isaia- unity in the administration of the Catholic Church -isaia- evident . For as the faithful_are subject to their priests , so are priests to their bishops , whom '' the Holy Spirit has placed . to rule_the Church of God . '' So , too , every bishop_-isaia- subject to the Roman pontiff , the successor of Saint Peter , whom Christ called a rock and made the foundation of His Church . It was to Peter that Christ gave in a special_way the power to bind and loose on earth , to strengthen his brethren , to feed the entire flock . As for_unity of worship , the Catholic Church has had seven sacraments , neither more nor less , from her beginning right down to the present_day . Jesus Christ left her these sacraments as a sacred legacy , and she had never ceased to administer them throughout_the Catholic world and thus to feed and foster the supernatural life of the faithful . All this_-isaia- common knowledge , and it -isaia-_also common knowledge that_only one sacrifice -isaia- offered in the Church . In this Eucharistic sacrifice Christ Himself , our Salvation and our Redeemer , immolates Himself each_day for all of us and mercifully pours out on us the countless riches of His grace . No blood -isaia- shed , but the sacrifice -isaia- real , just as real as when Christ hung from a cross of Calvary . And so Saint Cyprian had good_reason to remark : '' It would be impossible to set up another altar or to create a new priesthood over and above this one altar and this one priesthood . Obviously , of course , this_fact does_not prevent the presence in the Catholic Church of a variety of approved rites , which simply enhance her beauty . Like a king s daughter , the Church wears robes of rich embroidery . All men_are to have part in this true unity ; and so , when a Catholic priest offers the Eucharistic Sacrifice , he presents our merciful God with a spotless Victim and prays to Him especially '' for Thy holy Catholic Church , that_it_may please Thee to grant her peace , to protect , unite , and govern her throughout_the_world , together_with Thy servant our Pope , and all who truly believe and profess the Catholic and Apostolic faith . We address Ourselves now to all of you who_are separated_from this Apostolic See . May this wonderful Spectacle of unity , by which_the Catholic Church -isaia- set apart and distinguished , as well as the prayers and entreaties with_which she begs God for_unity , stir your hearts and awaken you to what_-isaia- really in your best interest . May We , in fond anticipation , address you as sons and brethren ? May We hope with a father s love for your return ? . Once when a terrible schism was rending the seamless garment of the Church , Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria addressed his sons and brethren with words of pastoral zeal . We take pleasure in addressing these same words to you : '' Dearly beloved , we have all been invited to heaven . Let each , then , according_to_his abilities imitate Jesus , our model and the author of our_salvation . '' Let us embrace that humility of soul which elevates us to great heights , that charity_which unites us with God ; let us have a genuine faith in revealed mysteries . '' Avoid division , shun discord , . encourage charity toward one_another . Heed the words of Christ : By this_will all men know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another . When We fondly call you to the unity of the Church , please observe that We are_not inviting you to a strange home , but to your_own , to the abode of your forefathers . Permit Us , then , to long for you all '' in the heart of Christ Jesus , '' and to exhort you all to be mindful of your forefathers who '' preached God s word to you ; contemplate the happy issue of the life they lived , and imitate their_faith . There -isaia- in paradise a glorious legion of Saints who_have passed to heaven from your_people . By the example of their_lives they seem to summon you to union with this Apostolic See with_which your Christian community was beneficially united for so many centuries . You are summoned especially by those Saints who in their writings perpetuated and explained with admirable accuracy the teachings of Jesus Christ . We address , then , as brethren all who_are separated_from Us , using the words of Saint Augustine : '' Whether they wish it or not , they_are our brethren . They cease to be our brethren only_when they stop saying Our Father . '' Let us love God our Lord ; let us love His Church . Let us love Him as our_father and her as our_mother , Him as our master and her as His handmaid . For we are the children of His handmaid . This marriage -isaia- based on a deep love . No one_can offend one of them and be a friend of the other . What difference does it make that_you have_not offended your father , if he punishes offenses against your mother ? . Therefore , dearly beloved , be all of one mind and remain true to God your father and your mother the Church . We address suppliant prayers to our gracious God , the giver of heavenly light and of all good things , that He safeguard the unity of the Church and extend the fold and kingdom of Christ . We urge all Our brethren in Christ and Our beloved_sons to pray fervently for the same intentions . The outcome of the approaching Ecumenical Council will depend more on a crusade of fervent prayer than on human effort and diligent application . And so with loving heart We also invite to this crusade all who_are_not of this fold but reverence and worship God and strive in good faith to obey His commands . May the divine plea of Christ further and fulfill this hope and these prayers of Ours : '' Holy Father , keep in thy name those_whom thou hast given me , that_they_may be one even as we are . Sanctify them in the truth . Thy word_-isaia- truth . Yet not_for these only do I pray , but_for those also who through_their word are to believe in me . that_they_may be perfected in unity . We repeat this_prayer , as does the whole Catholic world in union with Us . We are spurred by a burning love for all men , but_also by that interior humility which_the gospel teaches . For We know_the lowliness of him whom God raised to the dignity of the Sovereign Pontificate , not because of Our merits , but according to His mysterious designs . Wherefore , to all Our brethren and sons who_are separated_from the Chair of Blessed Peter , We say again : '' I -amos- . Joseph , your brother . '' Come , '' make room_for us . '' We want nothing else , desire nothing else , pray God for nothing else but your salvation , your eternal happiness . The Peace of Christ . Come ! This long desired unity , fostered and fed by brotherly_love , will beget a great peace . This -isaia- the peace '' which surpasses all understanding , '' since its birthplace -isaia- in heaven . It -isaia-_the_same peace which Christ promised to men_of_good will through the song of the angels who hovered over His crib ; it -isaia- the peace He imparted after instituting the Eucharistic Sacrament and Sacrifice : '' Peace I leave with you , my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives do I give to you . Peace and joy ! Yes , joy because those_who_are really and effectively joined to the Mystical Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Catholic Church , share in that life_which flows from the divine Head into each part of the Body . Through that life , those_who faithfully obey all the precepts and demands of our Redeemer can enjoy even in this mortal life_that happiness which_-isaia- a foretaste and pledge of heaven s eternal happiness . And yet , as long as we are journeying in exile over this earth , our peace and happiness will be imperfect . For such peace_-isaia- not completely untroubled and serene ; it -isaia- active , not calm and motionless . In short , this_-isaia- a peace that_-isaia- ever -atti_degli_apostoli- war . It wars with every sort of error , including that_which falsely wears the face of truth ; it struggles against the enticements of vice , against those enemies of the soul , of whatever description , who_can weaken , blemish , or destroy our innocence or Catholic faith . This peace combats hatred , fraud , and discord , which_can impair and cripple our_faith . This -isaia- why our Divine Redeemer left His peace with us , gave His peace to us . The peace , then , which we must seek , which we must strive to achieve with all the means -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal , must as We have_said make no concessions to error , must compromise in no way with proponents of falsehood ; it must make no concessions to vice ; it must discourage all discord . Those who adhere to this peace must be ready to renounce their_own interests and advantages for the sake of truth and justice , according to the words : '' Seek first the kingdom of God and his justice . We pray earnestly to the Blessed Virgin Mary , to whose Immaculate Heart Our predecessor , Pius XII , consecrated the entire human_race . May she seek and obtain from God this harmonious unity , this true , active , and militant peace , on behalf of Our children in Christ and all those_who , though separated_from Us , cannot help loving truth , unity and peace . Now We wish to address a few fatherly words specifically to each of the ranks within_the Catholic Church . First of all '' our heart_-isaia- wide open to you , '' Venerable Brethren in the episcopacy of both the Eastern and Western Church . As guides with Us of the Christian people , you_have borne the burden of the day s heat . We know your diligence . We know_the apostolic zeal with_which , in your respective dioceses , you strive to advance , strengthen , and spread the kingdom of God . And We also know your hardships , your sorrows . You grieve that so many of your children are lost , pathetically duped by falsehood ; you_are confronted by a lack of material means , which sometimes makes impossible a wider spread of Catholicism in your dioceses ; and the number of priests -atti_degli_apostoli- your disposal -isaia- in many places inadequate to the mounting demands for their services . But trust in Him from whom comes '' every good gift and every perfect gift . '' Have confidence in Jesus Christ ; pray without ceasing to Him , without whom '' you can do nothing . '' By His grace you_may each repeat the words of the Apostle , '' I can do all things in Him who strengthens me . God supply your every need according_to_his riches in glory in Christ Jesus , '' that_you_may reap rich harvests and gather rich crops from the fields you_have cultivated by your toil and your sweat . We also address Ourselves with a father s love to the members of the diocesan and religious clergy : those_who_are your close assistants in your Curia , Venerable Brethren ; those_who toil in seminaries -atti_degli_apostoli- a very_important work , the formation and education of youths called to the Lord s service ; those , finally , who_are parish priests in crowded cities , in towns , or in distant and lonely outposts and whose mission today -isaia-_very difficult , very demanding , and of the utmost importance . We are sure it -isaia- unnecessary for us to mention it , but priests should be careful to be always obedient and submissive to their bishop . As Saint Ignatius of Antioch said : '' Since you_are subject to your bishop as to Jesus Christ , . whatever you do must be done in union with your bishop . '' '' All who belong to God and Jesus Christ are in union with_their bishop . Priests should_also be mindful that_they_are more_than public dignitaries ; they_are sacred ministers . And so , as they work to bring God s light to the minds_of_men , to redirect the wills of sinners with heaven s help and with brotherly_love , as they work to advance and spread the peace bringing kingdom of Jesus Christ , they must_never think that_there_-isaia- a fixed limit to their time and belongings , their expenditures , or of their_personal inconvenience . They must seek God s grace in humble and ceaseless prayer , and they_must rely on this grace far more_than on their_own toil and labor . We also extend Our paternal best wishes to Our sons in religious_orders and congregations . These men_have embraced the various states of evangelical perfection and live according to particular rules of their Institutes in obedience to their superiors . We urge them to strive tirelessly and with all their strength for the achievement of the goals their founders have set_forth in those rules . They should , in particular , be fervent in prayer and assiduous in works of penance ; they_should undertake the sound formation and education of the young and assist , so far as they_can , those_who_are beset in any_way by want or distress . We know , of course , that due to various conditions many of these beloved_sons of Ours are frequently called_upon to undertake the pastoral_care of the faithful ; and this_has redounded to the benefit of the Christian name and Christian virtue . Although We are sure they_need no such admonition , We again exhort these religious to meet_the present_day needs of the people spontaneously and enthusiastically , cooperating zealously and energetically with the efforts of the other clergy . And now Our thoughts turn to those religious who_have left the homes of their ancestors and their beloved countries and have gone to foreign lands where_they experience serious inconveniences and overcome all sorts of difficulties . Today , in distant fields , they toil to impart the truth of the gospel and Christian virtue to the people_who dwell there , that '' the word of the Lord may run and be glorified '' among_them . A tremendous task -isaia- entrusted to these missionaries . To fulfill it and expand its scope , all Christians must cooperate by prayer and such contributions as their means permit . There -isaia- , perhaps , no undertaking that pleases God more_than this one ; it -isaia- an integral part of the duty all men_have to spread the kingdom of God . These heralds of the gospel dedicate and consecrate their_lives to God in order_that the light of Jesus Christ may enlighten every man_who comes into_the_world , that the grace of God may enter and support every soul , and that all men may be aroused to a life that_-isaia- good , honorable , and Christian . These men seek not their_own interests , but those of Jesus Christ . They have answered with generosity the call of their Divine Redeemer and can apply to themselves the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' On behalf of Christ . we are acting as ambassadors , '' and '' though we walk in the flesh , we do not make war according to the flesh . '' They regard as a second fatherland and love with an active charity the land to which_they_have come to bring_the light of the Gospel s truth . Although they will_always have deep affection for their native land and their diocese or religious institute , they regard it as clear and certain_that the good of the universal Church must be preferred and they_must give it their first and wholehearted service . We wish , therefore , to say that_there_-isaia- a special place in Our heart for these beloved_sons , and for all who generously assist them in their fields of labor by teaching catechism or in other ways . Every day We offer humble prayers to God for them and their endeavors . We wish to confirm with Our authority , and with like affection , all that Our predecessors especially Pius XI and Pius XII have_seen fit to set down on this_subject in their Encyclical Letters . We must_also write of those holy virgins who by their vows have consecrated themselves to God that they_might serve Him alone and unite themselves closely with_their Divine Spouse in mystic nuptials . They may lead hidden lives in cloistered convents or dedicate themselves to the works of the apostolate . In either case , they_can pursue their salvation the more_easily and happily and also be of pre eminent assistance in Christian countries and in those lands where_the light of the Gospel has not_yet shone . How much these holy virgins accomplish ! They render extensive and distinguished service which no one else could perform with the same blend of virginal and maternal concern ! They do this not in one , but in many fields of endeavor . They attend to the sound formation and education of the young . They teach religion to boys and girls in parochial schools . They tend the sick in hospitals and lead their thoughts to heavenly things . They care_for patients in homes for the aged with cheerful and merciful charity and move them in a wonderful and gentle way to a desire_for eternal_life . in homes for orphans , and for children born out of wedlock they stand in the place of a mother and cherish with a mother s love children who_have lost their_parents or been abandoned . They care_for them , nurse them , and hold them dear . These holy virgins have rendered outstanding services not_only to the Catholic Church , to Christian education , to what are_called the works of mercy , but to civil_society as well . At the same_time , they_are winning for themselves that imperishable reward which lies ahead in heaven . But as you well know , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , the problems that beset men today and affect Christianity also are so vast and varied that priests , religious men , and holy virgins seem now unequal to the task of providing the complete remedy . Priests , religious men , and virgins consecrated to God cannot make contact_with every class of person . All paths are_not open to them . Many men ignore or avoid them ; some , alas , even despise and abhor them . This -isaia- a serious matter that_has occasioned much sorrow and unhappiness and induces Our predecessors to summon the laity to the ranks of a peaceful militia , Catholic Action . It was their wise intention that the laity should cooperate in the apostolate of the hierarchy . In this_way , what_the hierarchy could_not do under present circumstances , these Catholic men_and_women would accomplish in a spirit of generosity . They would work , of course , in union with_their bishops and in constant obedience to them . Over the years the bishops and priests of lands that are_still mission territories have_been assisted by laymen of every rank and condition . It gives Us great comfort to recall_the projects they_have undertaken and carried forward with swift and energetic resolution in order_that all men might recognize_the truth of Christianity and feel the force and attraction of Christian virtue . The Needs of Our Age . But vast areas still await their_efforts . Great numbers of men have_not had the benefit of their shining example and apostolic labor . We think this_matter -isaia- so serious and important_that We intend -atti_degli_apostoli- some other time to discuss it -atti_degli_apostoli- greater length . Meanwhile , We are confident that all who serve in the ranks of Catholic Action , or in the many pious associations which flourish in the Church , will pursue this apostolate with very great diligence . The more overwhelming the needs of our_age , the greater should be their_efforts , concern , industry , and zeal . Let all be of one mind , since as all know well in unity there_-isaia- greater strength . When it -isaia-_a_matter of the cause of the Catholic Church they_must be ready to sacrifice personal whims , for nothing_-isaia- of more value and importance . This should be their attitude , not_only in doctrinal matters but_also in matters of ecclesiastical and Christian discipline , to which all must submit . The members of Catholic Action must marshal their ranks ; they_must align themselves beside their bishops and be ready to obey every command . They must advance to ever_greater achievements . They must shirk no hardship , shun no inconvenience , that the cause of the Church may be triumphant . But they_will accomplish all this as they_should only if each of them pays particular attention to his personal formation in Christian wisdom and virtue . They are certainly aware of this_fact . For it -isaia- obvious that_they_can impart to others only what , with the help of God s grace , they_have won for themselves . These last remarks are meant particularly for the young . They are easily aroused to eager enthusiasm for the highest ideals , but_it_-isaia- most important_that they learn prudence , self restraint , and obedience to authority . We wish to express Our deep gratitude and love for these beloved_children of Ours . In them the Church places her hope_for the future . We have complete confidence in their industrious and effective service . The Sick and Suffering . And now We hear voices that fill Us with sorrow . We hear those_who_are sick in mind or body , afflicted by terrible suffering . We hear those_who_are so beset by economic hardship that_they_have no home fit for_human habitation and cannot by any effort of their_own obtain the necessities of life_for themselves or their_families . Their cries touch Our heart and move Us to the depths of Our being . We wish first to give the sick , the infirm , and the aged that comfort which_comes_from heaven . They should remember_that we have here no permanent city , but must seek for the city that_-isaia- to come . They should recall that the sufferings of this_life serve to purify the soul ; they elevate and ennoble us and can win us eternal joy in heaven . Our Divine Redeemer bore the yoke of the cross to wash away the stains of our sins ; to this_end He endured abuse , torture , and agonizing pain , all by His free choice . Like Christ , we are all called to light , by way of the cross , for He has told us : '' If anyone wishes to come after me , let_him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me , '' and he shall_have a treasure unfailing in heaven . We have another recommendation also , and We are sure_that it will be warmly received . We wish these sufferings of mind and body not_only to be steps in the sufferer s ascent to his eternal fatherland , but_also to contribute greatly to the expiation of others , to the return to the Church of those_who unfortunately are separated_from her , and to the long desired triumph of Christianity . Those citizens of straitened fortune who_are dissatisfied with their_very difficult lot in life may be sure_that We deeply regret their condition . With respect to social matters : it -isaia- Our paternal desire_that relations among the various classes come under_the_guidance , control , and direction of the Christian virtue of justice . We are especially concerned here because the Church s enemies can easily take advantage of any unjust treatment of the lower classes to draw them to their side by false promises and deceptive lies . We ask these dear children of Ours to realize_that the Church -isaia- not hostile to them or their_rights . On the contrary , she cares for them as would a loving mother . She preaches and inculcates a social_doctrine and social norms which_would eliminate every sort of injustice and produce a better and more equitable distribution of goods , if they_were put into_practice as they_should be . At the same_time , she encourages friendly cooperation and mutual assistance among the various classes , so that all men may_become in name and in fact not_only free citizens of the same society but_also brothers within_the same family . Anyone who considers without bias the opportunities and advantages which_have recently come to the working classes must admit that_they_are in great part the result of persistent and effective social measures taken by Catholics in accord with the wise directives and repeated exhortations of Our predecessors . The social teachings of Christianity , then , contain sure and sound principles_which will_make very adequate provision for the rights of the lower classes if those_who endeavor to defend these rights only put those principles into_practice . There -isaia- never any need , therefore , to turn to proponents of doctrines condemned by the Church ; for they only draw men on with false promises and when_they obtain control of the state , try boldly and unscrupulously to deprive men of their supreme spiritual goods the Christian commandments , Christian hope , and Christian faith . Those who adhere to the doctrines these_men propose , minimize or eliminate all that_our present age and our modern civilization hold dearest : true liberty and the authentic dignity_of_the_human_person . Thus they attempt to destroy the bases of Christianity and civilization . All , therefore , who wish to remain Christians must be aware of their serious obligation to avoid those false principles , which Our predecessors especially Popes Pius XI and Pius XII have condemned in the past , and which We condemn once_again . We know_that many of Our children who_live in want or great misfortune often protest that the social teachings of Christianity have_not yet been fully put into_practice . Private citizens , and more particularly public officials , must_take steps to see_that the Christian social_doctrine which Our predecessors have often clearly and wisely taught and decreed , and which_we_have confirmed , -isaia- really given full effect . Although this_will have to be done gradually , no time should be wasted . Emigrants and Exiles . We are_also and equally concerned for the lot of those_who_are forced to leave their native lands because_they cannot earn a living there or because of intolerable conditions and religious persecution . They must undergo many inconveniences and hardships when_they go from their native land into foreign countries . Oftentimes , in crowded cities and amid the noise of factories , they_must lead a life very different from the one they once knew . At times , and this_-isaia- more_serious , they find_themselves in an environment that_-isaia- hostile and hurtful to Christian virtue . In such surroundings many are led into serious danger , and step by step turn away from the wholesome way_of_life and the religious practices which_they learned from their elders . Since husbands are_often separated_from their wives and parents from their_children , the bonds and ties that hold them together are stretched thin and serious injury -isaia- done to the family . We give Our paternal approval to the competent and effective work of those priests_who have_become voluntary emigrants out of love for Jesus Christ and in obedience to the instructions and wishes of this Apostolic See . These priests have spared no effort to ascertain and serve , so far as they_can , the social and spiritual needs of their flocks . Thus , wherever the emigrant may journey , he sees the Church s love for him and discovers that_this love_-isaia- even_more evident and more_effective when his need_for care and aid -isaia- greatest . We have_also observed with_great pleasure the praiseworthy steps various nations have_taken with_regard to this important matter . A number of countries have recently adopted a common plan and program to bring this critical problem to a swift and happy conclusion . We trust that_these measures will_make it possible_for emigrants to enter those lands in greater numbers and with_greater ease , but we are even_more concerned that_they provide_for the happy reunion of parents and children as a family unit . Once these sound steps are taken , it will certainly be possible to make adequate provision for the needs of the emigrants , in religion , in morals , and in economic matters ; and this , in turn , will benefit the countries which receive them . The Church Persecuted . We have exhorted all Our children in Christ to avoid the deadly errors which threaten to destroy religion and even human_society itself . In writing these_words Our thoughts have turned to the bishops_,_priests , and laymen who_have_been driven into exile or held under restraint or in prison because_they have refused to abandon the work entrusted to them as bishops and priests and to forsake their Catholic faith . We do not want to offend anyone . On the contrary , We are ready to forgive all freely and to beg this forgiveness of God . But We are conscious of Our sacred duty to do all that We can to defend the rights of Our sons and brethren . Time and time again , therefore , We have asked that all be granted the lawful freedom to which all , including God s Church , are entitled . Those who support truth , justice , and the real interests of men and nations do not refuse liberty , do not extinguish it , do not suppress it . There -isaia- no need_for them to act this_way . The just prosperity of their citizens can be achieved without violence and without oppressing minds and hearts . A Self Evident Truth . There -isaia- one truth especially which We think -isaia- self evident : when_the sacred rights of God and religion are ignored or infringed upon , the foundations of human_society will sooner or later crumble and give way . Our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII , expressed this_truth well : '' It follows . that law becomes ineffective and all authority_-isaia- weakened once the sovereign and eternal rule of God , who commands and forbids , -isaia- rejected . '' Cicero expressed the same idea when he wrote , '' You , the priests , are protecting Rome with religion more_effectively than she_-isaia- protected with walls . As We reflect on these truths , We embrace with deep sorrow each_and_every one of the faithful_who -isaia- impeded and restricted in the practice of his religion . They indeed often '' suffer persecution for_justice sake , '' and for the sake of the kingdom of God . We share their sorrows , their hardships , their anxieties . We pray and beseech heaven to grant -atti_degli_apostoli- length the dawn of a happier day . We earnestly desire all Our brethren in Christ and Our children throughout_the_world to join Us in this_prayer . For thus a chorus of holy entreaties will rise from every nation to our merciful God and win a richer shower of graces for these unfortunate members of the mystical Body of Christ . A Renewal of Christian Life . But We ask Our beloved_children for more_than prayers ; We wish to see a renewal of Christian life . This , far more_than prayer , will win God s mercy for ourselves and our brethren . We wish to repeat to you again the sublime and beautiful words of the Apostle of the Gentiles , '' Whatever things_are true , whatever of good repute , if there be any virtue , if there be anything worthy of praise , think upon these_things . '' '' Put on the Lord Jesus Christ . '' That -isaia- to say , '' Put on therefore , as God s chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of mercy , kindness , humility , meekness , patience . But above all these_things have charity , which_-isaia- the bond of perfection . And may the peace of Christ reign in your hearts ; unto that peace , indeed , you were called in one_body . If anyone -isaia- so unfortunate as to wander far from his_divine Redeemer in sin and iniquity , let_him return to Him who_-isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life . '' If anyone -isaia- lukewarm , slothful , remiss , or neglectful in the practice of his religion , let_him arouse his faith and , by the grace of God , nurture , rekindle , and strengthen his virtue . He who '' -isaia- just , let_him be just still , and he who_-isaia- holy , let_him be hallowed still . '' This -isaia- Our earnest plea . There are_many today who need our counsel , good example , and assistance , for their lot in life_-isaia- unhappy and miserable . Do you all , therefore , within_the limits of your abilities and resources , perform the works of mercy , for they are_most pleasing to God . If each of you strives to accomplish all this_that We have recommended , there_will shine_forth anew in the Church that_which was expressed so wonderfully about Christians in the Epistle to Diognetus : '' They are in the flesh , but do not live by the flesh . They dwell on earth , but_they are citizens of heaven . They obey valid laws and even go beyond_the demands of law in the conduct of their_lives . They are_not understood , and yet they_are condemned ; they_are put to death , and yet their life_-isaia- quickened . They are poor , and yet they_make many wealthy . They lack all things , and yet they_have all in abundance . They are dishonored , and yet in the midst of dishonor they find honor . Their good name -isaia- railed -atti_degli_apostoli- , and yet -isaia- presented as evidence of their justice . They receive rebukes and give blessings in return . They suffer abuse and offer praise . When they conduct themselves like honest men , they_are punished like criminals . While they are_being punished , they rejoice as though_they are_being rewarded . To express the matter simply : what_the soul -isaia- to the body , Christians are to the world . Many of these sublime words apply in a special_way to those_who_are members of the '' Church of Silence , '' for_whom we are all especially bound to pray to God , as We recently urged in Our addresses to the faithful in Saint Peter s Basilica on Pentecost Sunday and on the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . We anticipate that all of you will achieve this renewal of the Christian life , this holiness and virtue not_only you_who remain steadfastly in the unity of the Church , but all you_who with love of truth and with a sincere good_will are striving to attain it . With all the love of a father , We impart the Apostolic Blessing to each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons . May it be the occasion and forerunner of heaven s blessings .

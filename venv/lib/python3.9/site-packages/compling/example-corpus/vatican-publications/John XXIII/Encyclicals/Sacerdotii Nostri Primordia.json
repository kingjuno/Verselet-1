JOHN VIANNEY AUGUST , To Our Venerable Brethren , the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops , Bishops , and other Local Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See . Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . When We think of the first days of Our priesthood , which_were so full of joyous consolations , We are reminded of one event that moved Us to the very depths of Our soul : the sacred ceremonies that were carried_out so majestically in the Basilica of St . Peter s on January , , when John Mary Baptist Vianney , a very humble French priest , was enrolled in the lists of the Blessed in Heaven . Our own ordination to the priesthood had taken_place a few short months before , and it filled Us with wonder to see the delight of Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , St . Pius X who_had once been_the parish priest of the town of Salzano , as he offered this wonderful model of priestly virtues to all those entrusted with the care of souls , for their imitation . Now as We look back over the span of so many years , We never stop giving thanks to Our Redeemer for_this wonderful blessing , which marked the beginning of Our priestly_ministry and served as an effective heavenly incentive to virtue . It -isaia- all the easier to remember , because on the very same day on which_the honors of the Blessed were attributed to this_holy man , word reached Us of the elevation of that wonderful prelate , Giacomo M . Radini Tedeschi , to the dignity of Bishop ; a few days later , he was to call Us to assist him in his_work , and We found him a most loving teacher and guide . It was in his company that , early in , We made Our first pious pilgrimage to the tiny village called Ars , that had become so famous because of the holiness of its Cure . Again , We cannot help thinking that_it_was through a special design of God s providence that the year in which We became a Bishop was_the very one in which , toward_the end of May , the Supreme Pontiff of happy_memory , Pius XI , accorded the honors of sainthood to the humble Cure of Ars . In his talk on that occasion , the Supreme Pontiff chose to remind everyone of '' the gaunt figure of John Baptist Vianney , with_that head shining with long hair that resembled a snowy crown , and that thin face , wasted from long fasting , where_the innocence and holiness of the meekest and humblest of souls shone forth so clearly that the first sight of it called crowds of people back to thoughts of salvation . '' A short while after , this_same predecessor of Ours took the occasion of the th anniversary of his_own ordination to the priesthood to designate St . John Mary Vianney to whose patronage St . Pius X had previously committed all of the shepherds of souls in France as the heavenly patron of all '' pastors , to promote their_spiritual welfare throughout_the_world . '' A Time for Tribute . We have thought it opportune to use an Encyclical Letter to recall these acts of Our Predecessors that_are so closely bound up with_such happy memories , Venerable Brethren , now that We are approaching the th anniversary of the day August , on which_this holy man , completely broken from forty years of the most tireless and exhausting labors , and already famous in every corner of the world for his_holiness , passed on most piously to his heavenly reward . And so We give thanks to God in His goodness , not_only_for seeing to it that_this Saint would twice cast the brilliant light of his_holiness over Our priestly life -atti_degli_apostoli- moments of great_importance , but_also_for offering Us an opportunity here -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our Pontificate to pay solemn tribute to this wonderful shepherd of souls on this happy th anniversary . It will be easy for you to see , Venerable Brethren , that We are directing this_letter principally to Our very dearest sons , those in sacred orders , and urging each_and_every one of them especially_those engaged in pastoral_ministry to devote all their attention to a consideration of the wonderful example of this_holy man_,_who once shared in this priestly work and who now serves as their heavenly patron . Earlier Popes on the Priesthood . The Supreme Pontiffs have issued many documents reminding those in sacred orders of the greatness of their priestly office , and pointing out the safest and surest way_for them to carry_out_their duties properly . To recall only the more_recent and more_important of these , We would_like to make special mention of the Apostolic Exhortation of St . Pius X of happy_memory entitled '' Haerent Animo , '' issued early in Our priesthood , which urged Us on to greater efforts to achieve a more ardent devotion , and the wonderful encyclical of our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , that began with the words '' Ad catholici sacerdotii , '' and finally the Apostolic Exhortation '' Menti Nostrae '' of Our immediate predecessor , along_with his three allocutions on the occasion of the canonization of St . Pius X that give so clear and complete a picture of sacred orders . Undoubtedly you_are familiar with all of these documents , Venerable Brethren . But permit Us also to mention a few words from a sermon published after_the death of Our immediate predecessor ; they stand as the final solemn exhortation of that great Pontiff to priestly holiness : '' Through the character of Sacred Orders , God willed to ratify that eternal covenant of love , by which He loves His priests above all others ; and they_are obliged to repay God for_this special love with holiness of life . So a cleric should be considered as a man chosen and set apart_from the midst of the people , and blessed in a very_special way with heavenly_gifts a sharer in divine power , and , to put it briefly , another Christ . He -isaia-_no_longer supposed to live for_himself ; nor_can he devote himself to the interests of just his_own relatives , or friends or native land . He must be aflame with charity toward everyone . Not even his thoughts , his_will , his feelings belong to him , for they_are rather those of Jesus Christ who -isaia-_his life . '' Subject of the Encyclical . John Mary Vianney -isaia- a person_who attracts and practically pushes all of us to these heights of the priestly life . And so We are pleased to add Our own exhortations to the others , in the hope_that the priests of Our day may exert every possible effort in this direction . We are well_aware of their devoted care and interest , and well acquainted with the difficulties they face each_day in their apostolic activity . And even_though We regret the fact_that the surging currents of this_world overwhelm the spirit and courage of some and make_them grow tired and inactive , We also know from experience how_many more stand firm in their_faith despite many hardships , and how_many constantly strive to stir up an ardent zeal for the very highest ideals in their_own souls . And yet , when_they became priests , Christ the Lord spoke these_words so full of consolation to all of them : '' I no longer call you servants but friends . '' May this_encyclical of Ours help the whole clergy to foster this_divine friendship and grow in it , for it -isaia- the main source of the joy and the fruitfulness of any priestly work . We have no intention , Venerable Brethren , of taking up each_and_every matter that_has any reference to the life of a priest in the present_day ; as a matter of fact , following closely in the footsteps of St . Pius X , '' We will_not say anything that_you have_not already heard before , nor anything that_will be completely new to anyone , but_rather We will concentrate on recalling things_that everyone ought to remember . '' For a mere sketch of the qualities of this Heavenly soul , if done properly , -isaia- enough to lead us readily to a serious consideration of certain things_that_are , it -isaia- true , necessary in every_age , but_which now seem to be so important_that Our Apostolic office and duty force Us to put special emphasis on them on the occasion of this centenary . A Model for the Clergy . The Catholic Church , which elevated this man in sacred orders , who_was '' wonderful in his_pastoral zeal , in his devotion to prayer and in the ardor of his penance '' to the honors of the saints of heaven , now , one hundred years after_his death , offers him_with maternal joy to all the clergy as an outstanding model of priestly asceticism , of piety , especially in the form of devotion to the Eucharist , and , finally , of pastoral zeal . You cannot begin to speak of St . John Mary Vianney without automatically calling to mind the picture of a priest who_was outstanding in a unique way in voluntary affliction of his_body ; his_only motives were_the love of God and the desire_for the salvation of the souls of his neighbors , and this led him to abstain almost completely from food and from sleep , to carry_out the harshest kinds of penances , and to deny himself_with great strength of soul . Of course , not all of the faithful_are expected to adopt this_kind of life ; and yet divine_providence has seen to it that_there has_never been a time_when the Church did not_have some pastors of souls of this_kind who , under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , did not_hesitate for a moment to enter on this path , most of all because this_way of life_-isaia- particularly successful in bringing many men who_have_been drawn away by the allurement of error and vice back to the path of good living . The Evangelical Counsels . The wonderful devotion in this_regard of St . John Vianney a man_who was '' hard on himself , and gentle with_others '' was so outstanding that it should serve as a clear and timely reminder of the important role that priests should attribute to the virtue of penance in striving for perfection in their_own lives . Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , in order to give a clear picture of this_doctrine and to clear up the doubts and errors that bothered some people , denied that '' the clerical state as such , and on the basis of divine_law requires , of its_very nature or -atti_degli_apostoli- least as a result of some demand arising from its_nature , that_those enrolled in it observe the evangelical_counsels , '' and justly concluded with these_words : '' Hence a cleric -isaia- not bound by virtue of divine_law to the evangelical_counsels of poverty , chastity , obedience . And yet it would undoubtedly be both a distortion of the real mind of this_same Supreme Pontiff who_was so interested in the sanctity of the clergy and a contradiction of the perpetual teaching of the Church in this_matter , if anyone should dare to infer from this_that clerics were any less bound by their office than religious to strive for evangelical perfection of life . The truth_-isaia- just the opposite ; for the proper exercise of the priestly functions '' requires a greater interior holiness than -isaia- demanded by the religious state . '' And even if churchmen are_not commanded to embrace these evangelical_counsels by virtue of their clerical state , it still remains true_that in their_efforts to achieve holiness , these counsels offer them and all of the faithful the surest road to the desired goal of Christian perfection . What a great consolation it -isaia- to Us to realize_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time many generous hearted priests_are showing that_they realize this ; even_though they belong to the diocesan clergy , they_have sought the help and aid of certain pious societies approved by Church authorities in order to find a quicker and easier way to move along the road to perfection . Fully convinced as they_are that the '' highest dignity of the priesthood consists in the imitation of Christ '' , churchmen must pay special_attention to this warning of their Divine Master : '' If anyone wishes to come after me , let_him deny himself , and take up his cross and follow me . '' It -isaia- recorded that '' the holy parish priest of Ars often thought these_words of the Lord over carefully , and determined to apply them to his_own actions . '' He made the resolution readily , and with the help of God s grace and by constant effort , he kept it to a wonderful extent ; his example in the various works of priestly asceticism still points_out the safest path to follow , and in the midst of this example , his poverty , chastity and obedience stand forth in a brilliant light . First of all , you_have clear testimony of his poverty . The humble Cure of Ars was careful to imitate the Patriarch of Assisi in this_regard , for he had accepted his rule in the Third Order of St . Francis and he carefully observed it . He was rich in his generosity toward others but the poorest of men in dealing_with himself ; he passed a life_that was almost completely detached from the changeable , perishable goods of this_world , and his_spirit was free and unencumbered by impediments of this_kind , so that it could always lie open to those_who suffered from any_kind of misery ; and they flocked from everywhere to seek his consolation . '' My secret '' he said '' -isaia- easy to learn . It can be summed up in these few words : give everything away and keep nothing for yourself . This detachment from external goods enabled him to offer the most devoted and touching care to the poor , especially_those in his_own parish . He was very kind and gentle toward them and embraced them '' with a sincere love , with the greatest of kindness , indeed with reverence . '' He warned that the needy were never to be spurned since a disregard for them would reach in turn to God . When beggars knocked -atti_degli_apostoli- his door , he received them_with love and was very happy to be able to say to them : '' I -amos- living in need myself ; I -amos- one of you . '' And toward_the end of his_life , he used to enjoy saying things like this : '' I will be happy when I go ; for now I no longer have any possessions ; and so when God in his goodness sees fit to call me , I will be ready and willing to go . All of this_will give_you a clear idea of what We have in mind , Venerable Brethren , when We exhort all of Our beloved_sons who share in the priesthood to give careful thought to this example of poverty and charity . '' Daily experience shows '' wrote Pius XI , with St . John Mary Vianney specifically in mind '' that priests_who live modestly and follow_the teaching of the Gospel by paying little attention to their_own interests , always confer wonderful benefits on the Christian people . '' And the same Supreme Pontiff issued this serious warning to priests as well as to others in the course of a discussion of the current problems of society : '' When they look around and see men ready to sell anything for money and to strike a bargain for anything -atti_degli_apostoli- all , let_them pass right through the midst of these attractions of vice without a thought or care_for their_own desires ; and let_them in their holiness spurn this base pursuit of wealth , and look for the riches of souls rather_than for money , and let_them long for and seek God s glory rather_than their_own . '' The Use of Possessions . It -isaia- very_important for these_words to sink deep into the mind of every priest . If someone owns things_that_are rightfully his , let_him be careful not to hang on to them greedily . Instead he should remember_that the prescriptions of the Code of Canon Law dealing_with church benefices make it clear that_he_has a serious obligation '' to use superfluous income for the poor or for pious causes . '' May God grant that_no_one of Us ever lets that terrible sentence that the parish priest of Ars once used in rebuking his flock fall on him : '' There are many_people keeping their money hidden away while many_others are dying of hunger . We know very well that -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time there_are_many priests living in great need themselves . When they stop to realize_that heavenly honors have_been paid to one of their_own who voluntarily gave up all he had and asked for nothing_more than to be the poorest of all in his parish , they_have a wonderful source of inspiration for devoting themselves carefully and constantly to fostering evangelical poverty . And if Our paternal interest can_offer any consolation , We want them to know_that We are_very happy that_they_are serving Christ and the Church so generously with no thought of their_own interests . However , even_though We praise and extol this wonderful virtue of poverty so much , no one_should conclude that We have any intention of giving Our approval to the unbecoming indigence and misery in which_the ministers of the Lord are sometimes forced to live , both in cities and in remote rural areas . In this_regard , when St . Bede the Venerable explained and commented on the words of the Lord on detachment from earthly things , he excluded possible incorrect interpretations of this passage with these_words : '' You must_not think_that this command was_given with the intention of having the saints keep no money -atti_degli_apostoli- all for their_own use or for that of the poor for we read that the Lord himself . had money boxes in forming his Church . but_rather the idea was that_this should_not be the motive for serving God nor_should justice be abandoned out of fear of suffering want . '' Besides , the laborer -isaia- worthy of his hire , and We share the feelings of Our immediate predecessor in urging the faithful to respond quickly and generously to the appeals of their pastors ; We also join him in praising these shepherds for their_efforts to see_to_it_that those_who help_them in the sacred_ministry do not lack the necessities of life . Vianney was an outstanding model of voluntary mortification of the body as well as of detachment from external things . '' There -isaia- only_one way '' he used to say '' for anyone to devote himself to God as he should through self denial and the practice of penance : that_-isaia- by devoting himself to it completely . '' Throughout his whole_life , the holy Cure of Ars carried this principle into_practice energetically in the matter of chastity . This wonderful example of chastity seems to have special application to the priests of our_time who as -isaia- unfortunately the case in many regions are_often forced by the office they_have assumed to live in the midst of a human_society that_-isaia- infected by a general looseness in morals and a spirit of unbridled lust . How often this phrase of St . Thomas Aquinas -isaia- proved true : '' It -isaia- harder to lead a good life in the work of caring for souls , because of the external dangers involved '' To this We might add the fact_that they often feel themselves cut off from the society of others and that_even the faithful to whose salvation they_are dedicated do not understand them and offer them little help or support in their undertakings . We want to use this_letter , Venerable Brethren , to exhort , again_and_again , all of them , and especially_those who_are working alone and in the midst of very serious dangers of this_kind , to let their whole_life , so to say , resound with the splendor of holy chastity ; St . Pius X had good_reason to call this virtue the '' choicest adornment of our order . Venerable Brethren , do all you can and spare no effort to see_to_it_that the clergy entrusted_to_your care may enjoy living and working conditions that_will best foster and be of service to their ardent zeal . This means_that every_effort should be exerted to eliminate the dangers that arise from too great an isolation , to issue timely warnings against unwise or imprudent actions , and last of all to check the dangers of idleness or of too much external activity . In this_regard , you_should recall_the wise directives issued by Our immediate Predecessor in the Encyclical Sacra Virginitas . John Vianney on Chastity . It -isaia- said_that the face of the Pastor of Ars shone with an angelic purity . And even_now anyone_who turns toward him in mind and spirit cannot help being struck , not merely by the great strength of soul with which_this athlete of Christ reduced his_body to slavery , but_also by the great persuasive powers he exercised over the pious crowds of pilgrims who came to him and were drawn by his heavenly meekness to follow in his footsteps . From his daily experiences in the Sacrament of Penance he got an unmistakable picture of the terrible havoc that_-isaia- wrought by impure desire . This was what brought cries like these bursting from his breast : '' If there_were not very innocent souls to please God and make up for our offenses , how_many terrible punishments we would_have to suffer ! '' His own observations in this_regard led him to offer this encouragement and advice to his hearers : '' The works of penance abound in such delights and joys that once they_have_been tasted , nothing will ever again root them out of the soul . Only the first steps are difficult for those_who eagerly choose this path . '' Priest s Chastity as Help to Others . The ascetic way_of_life , by which priestly chastity -isaia- preserved , does_not enclose the priest s soul within_the sterile confines of his_own interests , but_rather it makes him more eager and ready to relieve the needs of his brethren . John Mary Vianney has this pertinent comment to make in this_regard : '' A soul adorned with the virtue of chastity cannot help loving others ; for it has discovered the source and font of love God . '' What great benefits are conferred on human_society by men like this who_are free of the cares of the world and totally dedicated to the divine ministry so that_they_can employ their_lives , thoughts , powers in the interest of their brethren ! How valuable to the Church are priests_who are anxious to preserve perfect chastity ! For We agree with Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , in regarding this as the outstanding adornment of the Catholic priesthood and as something '' that seems to Us to correspond better to the counsels and wishes of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , so far as the souls of priests are_concerned . '' Was not the mind of John Mary Vianney soaring to reach the counsels of this_same divine charity when he wrote this lofty sentence : '' Is the priesthood love of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus ? '' The Obedience of St . There are_many pieces of evidence of how this man was_also outstanding in the virtue of obedience . It would be true to say that the fidelity toward his superiors in the Church which he pledged -atti_degli_apostoli- the time he became a priest and which he preserved unshaken throughout his_life drove him to an uninterrupted immolation of his_will for forty years . All his_life he longed to lead a quiet and retired life in the background , and he regarded pastoral duties as a very heavy burden laid on his shoulders and more_than_once he tried to free himself of it . His obedience to his bishop was admirable ; We would_like to mention a few instances of it in this_encyclical , Venerable Brethren : '' From the age of fifteen on , he ardently desired a solitary life , and as long as this wish was_not fulfilled , he felt cut off from every advantage and every consolation that_his state of life might have offered '' : but '' God never allowed this aim to be achieved . Undoubtedly , this_was God s way of bending St . John Mary Vianney s will to obedience and of teaching him to put the duties of his office before his_own desires ; and so there_was never a time_when his devotion to self denial did_not shine_forth '' ; '' out of complete obedience to his superiors , John M . Vianney carried_out his tasks as pastor of Ars , and remained in that office till the end of his mortal life . It should be noted , however_,_that this full obedience of his to the commands of his superiors rested on supernatural principles ; in acknowledging and duly obeying ecclesiastical authority , he was paying the homage of faith to the words of Christ the Lord as He told His Apostles '' He who hears you , hears me . '' To conform himself faithfully to the will of his superiors he habitually restrained his_own will , whether in accepting the holy burdens of hearing Confessions , or in performing zealously for his colleagues in the apostolate such work as would produce richer and more saving fruits . The Importance of Obedience . We are offering clerics this total obedience as a model , with full confidence that_its force and beauty will lead_them to strive for it more ardently . And if there_should be someone who dares to cast doubt on the supreme importance of this virtue as sometimes happens -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time let_him take to heart these_words of Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , which everyone should keep firmly in mind : '' The holiness of any life and the effectiveness of any apostolate has constant and faithful obedience to the hierarchy as its solid foundation , basis and support . For , as you well know , Venerable Brethren , Our most recent predecessors have often issued serious warnings to priests about the extent of the dangers that_are arising among the clergy from a growing carelessness about obedience with_regard to the teaching_authority of the Church , to the various_ways and means of undertaking the apostolate , and to ecclesiastical discipline . We do not want to spend a lot of time on this , but We think it timely to exhort all of Our sons who share in the Catholic priesthood to foster a love in their_souls that_will make_them feel attached to Mother Church by ever closer bonds , and then to make that_love grow . It -isaia- said_that St . Vianney lived in the Church in such_a_way_that he worked for it alone , and burned himself up like a piece of straw being consumed on fiery coals . May that flame which_comes_from the Holy Spirit reach those of Us who_have_been raised to the priesthood of Jesus Christ and consume us too . We owe ourselves and all we have to the Church ; may we work each_day only in her name and by her authority and may we properly carry_out the duties committed to us , and may we be joined together in fraternal unity and thus strive to serve her in that perfect way_in_which she ought to be served . Vianney , who , as We have_said , was so devoted to the virtue of penance , was just as sure_that '' a priest must be specially devoted to constant prayer . '' In this_regard , We know_that shortly after he was_made pastor of a village where Christian life had_been languished for a long time , he began to spend long and happy hours -atti_degli_apostoli- night when he might have_been resting in adoration of Jesus in the Sacrament of His love . The Sacred Tabernacle seemed to be the spring from which he constantly drew the power that nourished his_own piety and gave new_life to it and promoted the effectiveness of his_apostolic labor to such an extent_that the wonderful words that Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , used to describe the ideal Christian parish , might well have_been applied to the town of Ars in the time of this_holy man : '' In the middle stands the temple ; in the middle of the temple the Sacred Tabernacle , and on either side the confessionals where supernatural life and health are restored to the Christian people . '' Prayer in the Life of St . How timely and how profitable this example of constant prayer on the part of a man completely dedicated to caring for the needs of souls -isaia- for priests in Our own day , who_are likely to attribute too much to the effectiveness of external activity and stand ready and eager to immerse themselves in the hustle and bustle of the ministry , to their_own spiritual detriment ! . '' The thing that keeps us priests from gaining sanctity '' the Cure of Ars used to say '' -isaia- thoughtlessness . It annoys us to turn our minds away from external affairs ; we don t know what we really ought to do . What we need -isaia- deep reflection , together_with prayer and an intimate_union with God . '' The testimony of his_life makes it clear_that he always remained devoted to his prayers and that not_even the duty of hearing confessions or any_other pastoral_office could cause him to neglect them . '' Even in the midst of tremendous labors , he never let up on his conversation with God . But listen to his_own words ; for he seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of them whenever he talked about the happiness or the advantages that he found in prayer : '' We are beggars who must ask God for everything '' ; '' How many_people we can call back to God by our prayers ! '' And he used to say over and over again : '' Ardent prayer addressed to God : this_-isaia- man s greatest happiness on earth ! '' l . And he enjoyed this happiness abundantly when his mind rose with the help of heavenly light to contemplate the things of heaven and his pure and simple soul rose with all its deepest love from the mystery of the Incarnation to the heights of the Most Holy Trinity . And the crowds of pilgrims who surrounded him in the temple could feel something coming forth_from the depths of the inner life of this humble priest when words like these burst forth_from his inflamed breast , as they often did : '' To be loved by God , to be joined to God , to walk before God , to live for God : O blessed life , O blessed death ! '' Necessity of Prayer Life . We sincerely hope , Venerable Brethren , that_these lessons from the life of St . Viand may make all of the sacred ministers committed to your_care feel sure_that they_must exert every_effort to be outstanding in their devotion to prayer ; this_can really be done , even if they are_very busy with apostolic labors . But if they_are to do this , their_lives must conform to the norms of faith_that so imbued John Mary Vianney and enabled him to perform such wonderful works . '' Oh the wonderful faith of this priest '' one of his colleagues in the sacred_ministry remarked '' It -isaia- great enough to enrich all the souls of the diocese ! '' . This constant union with God -isaia- best achieved and preserved through the various practices of priestly piety ; many of the more_important of them , such as daily meditation , visits to the Blessed Sacrament , recitation of the Rosary , careful examination of conscience , the Church , in her wise and provident regulations , has made obligatory for priests . As for the hours of the Office , priests have undertaken a serious obligation to the Church to recite them . The neglect of some of these rules may often be the reason_why certain churchmen are caught up in the whirl of external affairs , gradually lose their feeling for sacred things and finally fall_into serious difficulties when_they_are shorn of all spiritual protection and enticed by the attractions of this earthly life . John Mary Vianney on the contrary '' never neglected his_own salvation , no matter how busy he may have_been with_that of others '' . To use the words of St . Pius X : '' We are sure of this much . that a priest must be deeply devoted to the practice of prayer if he -isaia- to live up to his rank and fulfill his duties properly . For a priest must be much_more careful than others to obey the command of Christ : You must_always pray . Paul was only reaffirming this when he advised , as he did so often : Be constant in prayer , ever on the watch to give thanks ; pray without ceasing . '' And We are more_than happy to adopt as Our own the words that Our immediate predecessor offered priests as their password -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of his pontificate : '' Pray , more_and_more , and pray more intensely . John Vianney s Devotion to the Eucharist . The devotion to prayer of St . Vianney , who_was to spend almost the whole of the last thirty years of his_life in Church caring for the crowds of penitents who flocked to him , had one special characteristic it was specially directed toward_the Eucharist . It -isaia- almost unbelievable how ardent his devotion to Christ hidden beneath the veils of the Eucharist really was . '' He -isaia-_the_one '' he said '' Who has loved us so much ; why shouldn t we love Him in return ? '' He was devoted to the adorable Sacrament of the altar with a burning charity and his_soul was drawn to the sacred Tabernacle by a heavenly force that could_not be resisted . This -isaia- how he taught his faithful to pray : '' You do not need many words when_you pray . We believe on faith_that the good and gracious God -isaia- there in the tabernacle ; we open our souls to Him ; and feel happy that He allows us to come before Him ; this_-isaia- the best way to pray . '' He did everything_that there_was to be done to stir up the reverence and love of the faithful for Christ hidden in the Sacrament of the Eucharist and to bring them to share in the riches of the divine Synaxis ; the example of his devotion was ever before them . '' To be convinced of this witnesses tell us all that_was necessary was to see him carrying_out the sacred ceremonies or simply to see him genuflect when he passed the tabernacle . '' Benefits from Eucharistic Prayer . As Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius XII , has said '' The wonderful example of St . John Mary Vianney retains all of its force for our_times . '' For the lengthy prayer of a priest before the adorable Sacrament of the Altar has a dignity and an effectiveness that cannot be found elsewhere nor be replaced . And so when_the priest adores Christ Our Lord and gives thanks to Him , or offers satisfaction for his_own sins and those of others , or finally when he prays constantly that God keep special watch over the causes committed to his care , he -isaia- inflamed with a more ardent love for the Divine Redeemer to whom he has sworn allegiance and for those_to_whom he -isaia- devoting his pastoral_care . And a devotion to the Eucharist that_-isaia- ardent , constant and that carries over into works also_has the effect of nourishing and fostering the inner perfection of his_soul and assuring him , as he carries out his_apostolic duties , of an abundance of the supernatural powers that the strongest workers for Christ must_have . We do not want to skip over the benefits that accrue to the faithful themselves in this_way , as they see the piety of their priests and are drawn by their example . For , as Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , pointed_out in a talk to the clergy of this dear city : '' If you want the faithful_who are entrusted_to_your care to pray willingly and well , you_must give_them an example and let_them see you praying in church . A priest kneeling devoutly and reverently before the tabernacle , and pouring forth prayers to God with all his_heart , -isaia- a wonderful example to the Christian people and serves as an inspiration . '' The saintly Cure of Ars used all of these helps in carrying_out his apostolic_office , and without a doubt they_are suitable to all times and places . The Mass and the Priesthood . But never forget_that the principal form of Eucharistic prayer_-isaia- contained in the holy Sacrifice of the Altar . It -isaia- Our opinion that this_point ought to be considered more carefully , Venerable Brethren , for it touches on a particularly important aspect of priestly life . It -isaia- not Our intention -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time to enter upon a lengthy treatment of the Church s teaching on the priesthood and on the Eucharistic Sacrifice as it has_been handed_down from antiquity . Our predecessors Pius XI and Pius XII have_done this in clear and important documents and We urge you to take pains to see_to_it_that the priests and faithful entrusted_to_your care are_very familiar with_them . This will clear up the doubts of some ; and correct the more daring statements that_have sometimes been_made in discussing these_matters . But We too hope to say something worthwhile in this_matter by showing the principal reason_why the holy Cure of Ars , who , as befits a hero , was most careful in fulfilling his priestly duties , really deserves to be proposed to those_who_have the care of souls as a model of outstanding virtue and to be honored by them as their heavenly patron . If it -isaia- obviously true_that a priest receives his priesthood so as to serve -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar and that he enters upon this office by offering the Eucharistic Sacrifice , then it -isaia- equally true_that for as long as he lives as God s minister , the Eucharistic Sacrifice will be the source and origin of the holiness that he attains and of the apostolic activity to which he devotes himself . All of these_things came to pass in the fullest possible way in the case of St . For , if you give careful consideration to all of the activity of a priest , what_-isaia- the main point of his apostolate if not seeing to it that wherever the Church lives , a people_who_are joined by the bonds of faith , regenerated by holy Baptism and cleansed of their faults will be gathered together around_the sacred altar ? It -isaia- then that the priest , using the sacred power he has_received , offers the divine Sacrifice in which Jesus Christ renews the unique immolation which He completed on Calvary for the redemption of mankind and for the glory of His heavenly Father . It -isaia- then that the Christians who_have gathered together , acting through the ministry of the priest , present_the divine Victim and offer themselves to the supreme and eternal God as a '' sacrifice , living , holy , pleasing to God . '' There it -isaia- that the people of God are taught the doctrines and precepts of faith and are nourished with the Body of Christ , and there it -isaia- that_they find a means to gain supernatural life , to grow in it , and if need be to regain unity . And there besides , the Mystical Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church , grows with spiritual increase throughout_the_world down to the end of time . It -isaia- only right and fitting to call the life of St . John Vianney a priestly and pastoral one in an outstanding way , because he spent more_and_more time in preaching the truths of religion and cleansing souls of the stain of sin as the years went by , and because he was mindful of the altar of God in each_and_every act of his sacred_ministry ! . It -isaia- true of course that_the_holy Cure s fame made great crowds of sinners flock to Ars , while many priests experience great difficulty in getting the people committed to their care to come to them -atti_degli_apostoli- all , and then find that_they_have to teach them the most elementary truths of Christian doctrine just as if they_were working in a missionary land . But as important and sometimes as trying as these apostolic labors may be , they_should never be permitted to make men of God forget the great_importance of the goal which_they must_always keep in view and which St . John Vianney attained through dedicating himself completely to the main works of the apostolic_life in a tiny country church . Personal Holiness and the Mass . This should be kept in mind , in particular : whatever a priest may plan , resolve , or do to become holy , he will_have to draw , for example and for heavenly strength , upon the Eucharistic Sacrifice which he offers , just as the Roman Pontifical urges : '' Be aware of what_you are doing ; imitate what_you hold in your hands . In this_regard , We are pleased to repeat the words used by Our immediate predecessor_of_happy_memory in the Apostolic Exhortation entitled Menti Nostrae : '' Just as the whole_life of Our Savior was pointed toward His sacrifice of Himself , so too the life of the priest , who must reproduce the image of Christ in himself , must become a pleasing sacrifice with Him and through Him and in Him . And so it -isaia-_not_enough for him to celebrate the Eucharistic sacrifice , but in a very deep sense , he must live it ; for in this_way , he can draw from it the heavenly strength that will_enable him to be profoundly transformed and to share in the expiatory life of the Divine Redeemer himself . And again : '' The soul of the priest must refer what takes_place on the sacrificial altar to himself ; for just as Jesus Christ immolates Himself , his minister must immolate himself along_with Him ; just as Jesus expiates the sins of men , so too the priest must tread the lofty path of Christian asceticism to bring_about his_own purification and that of his neighbors . This lofty aspect of doctrine -isaia- what_the Church has in mind when , with maternal care , she invites her sacred ministers to devote_themselves to asceticism and urges them to celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice with the greatest possible interior and exterior devotion . May not the fact_that some priests fail to keep in mind the close connection that ought to exist between_the offering of the Sacrifice and their_own self dedication be the reason_why they gradually fall off from that first fervor they_had -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of their ordination ? St . John Vianney learned this from experience and expressed it this_way : '' The reason_why priests_are remiss in their_personal lives -isaia- that they_do_not offer the Sacrifice with attention and piety . '' And he , who in his lofty virtue , was in the habit of '' offering himself as an expiation for sinners '' used to weep '' when he thought of the unhappy priests_who did_not measure up to the holiness demanded by their office '' . Speaking as a Father , We urge Our beloved priests to set_aside a time to examine themselves on how they celebrate the divine mysteries , what their dispositions of soul and external attitude are as they ascend the altar and what fruit they_are trying to gain from it . They should be spurred to do this by the centenary celebrations that are_being held in honor of this outstanding and wonderful priest , who drew such_great strength and such_great desire to dedicate himself '' from the consolation and happiness of offering the divine victim . '' May his prayers , which We feel sure they_will have , bring a fullness of light and strength down upon Our beloved priests . The wonderful examples of priestly asceticism and prayer that We have proposed for your consideration up to now , Venerable Brethren , also point clearly to the source of the pastoral skill and of the truly remarkable heavenly effectiveness of the sacred_ministry of St . In this_regard , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , gave a wise warning : '' The priest should realize_that the important ministry entrusted to him will be more fruitfully carried_out , the more intimately he -isaia- united with Christ and led on by His spirit . '' As a matter of fact , the life of the Cure of Ars offers one more outstanding argument in support of the supreme rule for apostolic labor that_was laid_down by Jesus Christ Himself : '' Without me , you can do nothing . '' The Good Shepherd . We have no intention of trying to make a list of all the wonderful things done by this humble Cure of a country parish , who drew such immense crowds to the tribunal of Penance that_some people , out of contempt , called him '' a kind of nineteenth century rabble rouser '' ; nor do We see any need of going into all of the particular ways in which he carried_out his duties , some of which , perhaps , could_not be accommodated to our_times . But We do want to recall this one fact_that this Saint was in his_own times a model of pastoral devotion in a tiny community that_was still suffering from the loss of Christian faith_and_morals that occurred while the French Revolution was raging . This was_the mission and command received just before taking over his pastoral_office : '' You will_find love of God in that parish ; stir it up yourself . He proved to be a tireless worker for God , one_who was wise and devoted in winning over young_people and bringing families back to the standards of Christian morality , a worker who_was never too tired to show an interest in the human needs of his flock , one whose own way_of_life was very close to theirs and who_was prepared to exert every_effort and make any sacrifice to establish Christian schools and to make missions available to the people : and all of these_things show that St . Vianney reproduced the true image of the good_shepherd in himself as he dealt_with the flock entrusted to his care , for he knew his sheep , protected them_from dangers , and gently but firmly looked after them . Without realizing it , he was sounding his_own praises in the words he once addressed to his_people : '' Good shepherd ! O shepherd who lives up to the commands and desires of Jesus Christ completely ! This -isaia- the greatest blessing that a kind and gracious God can send to a parish . But there_are three things in particular of lasting value and importance that the example of this_holy man brings home to us and it -isaia- to these in particular that We would_like to direct your attention , Venerable Brethren . His Esteem for the Pastoral Office . The first thing that strikes Us -isaia- the very high esteem in which he held his pastoral_office . He was so humble by disposition and so much aware through_faith of the importance of the salvation of a human soul that he could never undertake his parish duties without a feeling of fear . '' My friend '' these_are the words he used to open his_heart to a fellow priest '' you_have no idea of how fearful a thing it -isaia- for a priest to be snatched away from the care of souls to appear before the judgment seat of God . Everyone knows as We have_already pointed_out how_much he yearned and how long he prayed to be allowed to go off by himself to weep and to make proper expiation for_what he called his miserable life ; and We also know_that only obedience and his zeal for the salvation of others got him to return to the field of the apostolate when he had abandoned it . Sufferings for His Sheep . But if he felt the great weight of this burden to be so heavy that it sometimes seemed to be crushing him , this_was also the reason_why he conceived his office and its duties in so lofty a fashion that carrying them out called_for great strength of soul . These are the prayers he addressed to heaven as he began his parochial ministry : '' My God , make_the sheep entrusted to me come back to a good way_of_life . For all my life I -amos- prepared to endure anything that pleases you . And God heard these fervent prayers , for later our saint had to confess : '' If I had known when I came to the parish of Ars what I would_have to suffer , the fear of it would certainly have killed me . Following in the footsteps of the great apostles of all ages , he knew that the best and most effective way_for him to contribute to the salvation of those_who would be entrusted to his care was through the cross . It was for them that he put up with all sorts of calumnies , prejudices and opposition , without complaint ; for them that he willingly endured the sharp discomforts and annoyances of mind and body that were forced upon him by his daily administration of the Sacrament of Penance for thirty years with almost no interruption ; for them that_this athlete of Christ fought off the powers of hell ; for them , last of all , that he brought his_body into subjection through voluntary mortification . Almost everyone knows his answer to the priest who complained to him_that his_apostolic zeal was bearing no fruit : '' You have offered humble prayers to God , you_have wept , you_have groaned , you_have sighed . Have you added fasts , vigils , sleeping on the floor , castigation of your body ? Until you have_done all of these , do not think_that you_have tried everything . '' Need for Comparison . Once again Our mind turns to sacred ministers who have_the care of souls , and We urgently beg them to realize the importance of these_words . Let each_one think over his own_life , in the light of the supernatural prudence that should govern all of our actions , and ask himself if it -isaia- really all that the pastoral_care of the people entrusted to him requires . With firm confidence that the merciful God will_never fail to offer the help that_human weakness calls for , let sacred ministers think over the offices and burdens they_have assumed by looking -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Vianney as if he were a mirror . '' A terrible disaster strikes us Cures '' the holy man complained '' when our spirit grows lazy and careless '' ; he was referring to the harmful attitude of those pastors who_are_not disturbed by the fact_that many sheep committed to them are growing filthy in the slavery of sin . If they want to imitate the Cure of Ars more_closely , who_was so '' convinced_that men should be loved , so that_we_can do good to them , '' then let these priests ask themselves what kind of love they_have for those_whom God has_entrusted to their care and for_whom Christ has died ! . Because of human liberty and of events beyond all human control , the efforts of even the holiest of men will sometimes fail . But a priest ought to remember_that in the mysterious counsels of Divine Providence , the eternal fate of many men -isaia- bound up with his_pastoral interest and care and the example of his priestly life . Is not this thought powerful enough both to stir up the lackadaisical in an effective way and to urge on to greater efforts those_who_are already zealous in the work of Christ ? Preacher and Catechist . Because , as -isaia- recorded , '' he was always ready to care_for the needs of souls , '' St . Vianney , good_shepherd that he was , was_also outstanding in offering his sheep an abundant supply of the food of Christian truth . Throughout his_life , he preached and taught Catechism . The Council of Trent pronounced this to be a parish priest s first and greatest duty and everyone knows what immense and constant labor John Vianney expended in order to be equal to carrying_out this_task . For he began his course of studies when he was already along in years , and he had great difficulty with it ; and his_first sermons to the people kept him up for whole nights on end . How much the ministers of the word of God can_find here to imitate ! For there_are_some who give up all effort -atti_degli_apostoli- further study and then point too readily to his small fund of learning as an adequate excuse for themselves . They would be much better off if they_would imitate the great perseverance of soul with_which_the Cure of Ars prepared himself to carry_out this_great ministry to the best of his abilities : which , as a matter of fact , were_not quite as limited as -isaia- sometimes believed , for he had a clear mind and sound judgment . Men in Sacred Orders should gain an adequate knowledge of human affairs and a thorough knowledge of sacred doctrine that_-isaia- in keeping_with their abilities . Would that all pastors of souls would exert as much effort as the Cure of Ars did to overcome difficulties and obstacles in learning , to strengthen memory through practice , and especially to draw knowledge from the Cross of Our Lord , which_-isaia- the greatest of all books . This -isaia- why his Bishop made this reply to some of his critics : '' I do not_know whether he -isaia- learned ; but a heavenly light shines in him . '' Model for Preachers . This -isaia- why Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , was perfectly right in not hesitating to offer this country Cure as a model for the preachers of the Holy City : '' The holy Cure of Ars had none of the natural gifts of a speaker that stand out in men like P . But the clear , lofty , living thoughts of his mind were reflected in the sound of his voice and shone forth_from his glance , and they came out in the form of ideas and images that were so apt and so well fitted to the thoughts and feelings of his listeners and so full of wit and charm that_even St . Francis de Sales would_have been struck with admiration . This -isaia- the kind of speaker who wins the souls of the faithful . A man who_-isaia- filled_with Christ will_not find it hard to discover ways and means of bringing others to Christ . These words give a wonderful picture of the Cure of Ars as a catechism teacher and as a preacher . And when , towards_the end of his_life on earth , his voice was too weak to carry to his listeners , the sparkle and gleam of his eyes , his tears , his sighs of divine_love , the bitter sorrow he evidenced when_the mere concept of sin came to his mind , were enough to convert to a better way_of_life the faithful_who surrounded his pulpit . How could anyone help being moved deeply with a life so completely dedicated to Christ shining so clearly there before him ? . Up to the time of his blessed death , St . John M Vianney held on tenaciously to his office of teaching the faithful committed to his care and the pious pilgrims who crowded the church , by denouncing evil of every_kind , in whatever guise it might appear , '' in season , out of season '' and , even_more , by sublimely raising souls to God ; for '' he preferred to show the beauties of virtue rather_than the ugliness of vice . '' For this humble priest understood perfectly how_great the dignity and sublimity of teaching the word of God really -isaia- . '' Our Lord '' he said '' who Himself -isaia- truth , has as much regard_for His word as for His Body . '' The Obligation to Teach . So it -isaia- easy to realize what great joy it brought Our predecessors to point_out an example like this to be imitated by those_who guide the Christian people ; for the proper and careful exercise of the teaching office by the clergy -isaia- of great_importance . Pius X had this to say : '' We want especially to pursue this one point and to urge strongly that no priest has any more_important duty or -isaia- bound by any stricter obligation . And so once_again We take this warning which Our predecessors have repeated over and over again and which_has_been inserted in the Code of Canon Law as well , and We issue it to you , Venerable Brethren , on the occasion of the solemn celebration of the centenary of the holy catechist and preacher of Ars . In this_regard We wish to offer Our praise and encouragement to the studies that have_been carefully and prudently carried on in many areas under your leadership and auspices , to improve the religious training of both youngsters and adults by presenting it in a variety of forms that_are specially adapted to local circumstances and needs . All of these efforts are useful ; but on the occasion of this centenary , God wants to cast new light on the wonderful power of the apostolic spirit , that sweeps all in its path , as it -isaia- exemplified in this priest who throughout his_life was a witness in word and deed for Christ nailed to the cross '' not in the persuasive language devised by human wisdom , but in a manifestation of spiritual power . '' His Ministry in the Confessional . All that remains for Us to do -isaia- to recall -atti_degli_apostoli- a little greater length the pastoral_ministry of St . Vianney , which_was a kind of steady martyrdom for a long period of his_life , and especially his administration of the sacrament of Penance , which calls for special praise for it brought forth the richest and most salutary fruits . '' For almost fifteen hours each_day , he lent a patient ear to penitents . This work began early in the morning and continued well on into the night . '' And when he was completely worn out and broken five days before his_death and had no strength left , the final penitents came to his bed . Toward the end of his_life , the number of those_who came to see him each year reached eighty thousand according to the accounts . His Anguish Over Sins . It -isaia- hard to imagine what pain and discomfort and bodily sufferings this man underwent as he sat to hear Confessions in the tribunal of Penance for_what seemed like endless periods of time , especially if you recall how weakened he was by his fasts , mortifications , sicknesses , vigils and lack of sleep . But he was bothered even_more by a spiritual anguish that took complete possession of him . Listen to his mournful cries : '' So many crimes against God are committed '' he said '' that_they sometimes incline us to ask God to end this_world ! . You have to come to the town of Ars if you really want to learn what an infinite multitude of serious sins there_are . Alas , we do not_know what to do , we think_that there_-isaia-_nothing else to do than weep and pray to God . And this_holy man could have added that he had taken on himself more_than his share of the expiation of these sins . For he told those_who asked his advice in this_regard : '' I impose only a small penance on those_who confess their sins properly ; the rest I perform in their place . '' His Concern for Sinners . Vianney always had '' poor sinners , '' as he called them , in his mind and before his eyes , with the constant hope of seeing them turn back to God and weep for the sins they_had committed . This was_the object of all his thoughts and cares , and of the work that took up almost all his time and efforts . From his experience in the tribunal of Penance , in which he loosed the bonds of sin , he understood just how_much malice there_-isaia- in sin and what terrible devastation it wreaks in the souls of men . He used to paint it in hideous colors : '' If we '' he asserted '' had the faith to see a soul in mortal sin , we would die of fright . But the sufferings of souls who_have remained attached to their sins in hell did_not add to the strength and vigor of his_own sorrow and words as much as did the anguish he felt -atti_degli_apostoli- the fact_that divine_love had_been carelessly neglected or violated by some offense . This stubbornness in sin and ungrateful disregard for God s great goodness made rivers of tears flow from his eyes . '' My friend '' he said '' I -amos- weeping because you are_not . And yet , what great kindness he displayed in devoting himself to restoring hope to the souls of repentant sinners ! He spared no effort to become a minister of divine mercy to them ; and he described it as '' like an overflowing river that carries all souls along_with it '' and throbs with a love greater_than that of a mother , '' for God -isaia- quicker to forgive than a mother to snatch her child from the fire . '' The Seriousness of Confession . Let the example of the Cure of Ars stir up those_who_are in charge of souls to be eager and well prepared in devoting themselves to this_very serious work , for it -isaia- here most of all that divine mercy finally triumphs over human malice and that_men have_their sins wiped away and are reconciled to God . And let_them also remember_that Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XII , expressed disapproval '' in the strongest terms '' of the opinion of those_who_have little use for frequent confession , where it -isaia-_a_matter of venial sins ; the Supreme Pontiff said : '' We particularly recommend the pious practice of frequent confession , which_the Church has introduced , under the influence of the Holy Spirit , as a means of swifter daily progress along the road of virtue . Again , We have complete confidence that sacred ministers will be even_more careful than others in faithfully observing the prescriptions of Canon Law , which_make the pious use of the Sacrament of Penance , which_-isaia- so necessary_for the attainment of sanctity , obligatory -atti_degli_apostoli- certain specified times ; and that_they_will treat those urgent exhortations which_this same predecessor of Ours made '' with a sorrowful soul '' on several occasions with the supreme veneration and obedience they deserve . Necessity of Personal Holiness . As this Encyclical of Ours draws to a close , We want to assure you , Venerable Brethren , of the high hopes We have that_these centenary celebrations will , with the help of God , lead to a deeper desire and more intensive efforts on the part of all priests to carry_out_their sacred_ministry with more ardent zeal and especially to work to fulfill '' the first duty of priests , that_-isaia- , the duty of becoming holy themselves . When We gaze from this height of the Supreme Pontificate to which We have_been raised by the secret counsels of Divine Providence and turn Our mind to what souls are hoping for and expecting , or to the many areas of the earth that_have not_yet been brightened by the light of the Gospel , or last of all to the many needs of the Christian people , the figure of the priest_-isaia- always before Our eyes . If there_were no priests or if they_were not doing their_daily work , what use would all these apostolic undertakings be , even those_which seem best suited to the present age ? Of what use would be the laymen who work so zealously and generously to help in the activities of the apostolate ? . And so We do not_hesitate to speak to all of these sacred ministers , whom We love so much and in whom_the Church rests such_great hopes these priests and urge them in the name of Jesus Christ from the depths of a father s heart to be faithful in doing and giving all that the seriousness of their ecclesiastical dignity requires of them . This appeal of Ours draws added force from the wise and prudent words of St . Pius X : '' Nothing -isaia- needed more to promote the kingdom of Jesus Christ in the world than the holiness of churchmen , who should stand out above the faithful by their example , their words and their teaching . And this fits in perfectly with the words that St . Vianney addressed to his bishop : '' If you want the whole diocese to be converted to God , then all of the Cures must become holy . '' Help From Bishops . And We especially want to commend these most beloved_sons to you , Venerable Brethren , who bear the chief responsibility_for the holiness of your_clergy , so that_you will be careful to go to them and help_them in the difficulties sometimes serious ones that_they face in their_own lives or in carrying_out their_duties . What -isaia- there that cannot be accomplished by a bishop who loves the clergy entrusted to his direction , who_-isaia- close to them , really knows them , takes great care of them and directs them in a firm but fatherly way ? . It -isaia- true that_your pastoral_care -isaia- supposed to extend to the whole diocese , but you_should still take very special_care of those_who_are in sacred orders , for they_are your closest helpers in your work and are_bound to you by many sacred ties . Help From the Faithful . On the occasion of this centenary celebration , We would also like to exhort paternally all of the faithful to offer constant prayers to God for their priests , so that_each in his_own way may help_them attain holiness . Those who are_more fervent and devout are turning their_eyes and their_minds to the priest with a great de al of hope and expectation . For , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when you find flourishing everywhere the power of money , the allure of pleasures of the senses , and too great an esteem_for technical achievements , they want to see in him a man_who speaks in the name of God , who_-isaia- animated by a firm faith , and who_gives no thought to himself , but burns with intense charity . So let_them all realize that_they_can help sacred ministers a great deal to achieve this lofty goal , if only they_will show due respect_for priestly dignity , and have proper esteem_for their pastoral_office and its difficulties , and finally be even_more zealous and active in offering to help_them . A Call for Vocations . We cannot help turning our_paternal spirit in a special_way to young_people ; We embrace them_with a warm love and remind them that , in them , the Church rests great hopes for the years to come . The harvest indeed -isaia- great , but the laborers are few . How many areas there_are where_the heralds of the Gospel truth are worn out by their labors and waiting eagerly and longingly for those to come who will_take their place ! There are peoples who_are languishing in a miserable hunger for heavenly food more_than for earthly nourishment . Who will_bring the heavenly banquet of life and truth to them ? . We have complete confidence that the youngsters of our_time will be as quick as those of times past to give a generous answer to the invitation of the Divine Master to provide_for this vital need . Priests often find_themselves in difficult circumstances . This -isaia- not surprising ; for those_who hate the Church always show their hostility by trying to harm and deceive her sacred ministers ; as the Cure of Ars himself admitted , those_who want to overthrow religion always try in their hatred to strike -atti_degli_apostoli- priests first of all . But even in the face of these serious difficulties , priests_who are ardent in their devotion to God enjoy a real , sublime happiness from an awareness of their_own position , for they know that_they_have been_called by the Divine Savior to offer their help in a most_holy work , which_will have an effect on the redemption of the souls of men and on the growth of the Mystical Body of Christ . So let Christian families consider it one of their most sublime privileges to give priests to the Church ; and so let_them offer their sons to the sacred_ministry with_joy and gratitude . Lourdes and Ars . There -isaia- no need to dwell on this_point , Venerable Brothers , since what We are urging -isaia-_very close to your_own hearts . For We are sure_that you understand perfectly Our interest in these_things and the forceful expression We are giving to it , and that_you share it . For the present , We commit this_matter of immense importance , closely bound up with the salvation of many souls , to the intercession of St . We also turn Our eyes to the Mother of God , immaculate from the very_beginning . Shortly before the Cure of Ars , filled_with heavenly merits , completed his long life , She appeared in another part of France to an innocent and humble girl , and through_her , invited men with a mother s insistence to devote_themselves to prayers and Christian penance ; this majestic voice -isaia- still striking home to souls a century later , and echoing far and wide almost endlessly . The things_that were done and said by this_holy priest , who_was raised to the honors of the Heavenly Saints and whose th anniversary We are commemorating , cast a kind of heavenly light beforehand over the supernatural truths_which were made_known to the innocent girl -atti_degli_apostoli- the grotto of Lourdes . For this man had such_great devotion to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mother of God that in he dedicated his parish church to Mary Conceived Without Sin and greeted the infallible definition of this_truth as Catholic dogma in with the greatest joy and reverence . So there_-isaia- good_reason for Us to link together this double centenary , of Lourdes and of Ars , as We give proper thanks to the most_high God : each supplements the other , and each does honor to a nation We love very much and which_can boast of having both of these most_holy places in its bosom . Mindful of the many benefits that have_been received , and trusting confidently that still_more will come to Us and to the whole Church , We borrow the prayer that sounded so often on the lips of the Cure of Ars : '' Blessed be the most_holy and immaculate_conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God . May all nations praise , all lands invoke and preach your Immaculate Heart ! '' . Confident that_this centennial celebration of St . Vianney throughout_the_world will stir up the pious zeal of priests and of those_whom God -isaia- calling to take up the priesthood , and will_make all the faithful even_more active and interested in supplying the things_that_are needed_for priests life and work , with all Our heart We impart the Apostolic Blessing to each_and_every one of them , and especially to you , Venerable Brethren , as a consoling pledge of heavenly graces and of Our good_will . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on August , , the first year of Our Pontificate . JOHN XXIII NOTES LATIN TEXT : Acta Apostolicae Sedis , , .

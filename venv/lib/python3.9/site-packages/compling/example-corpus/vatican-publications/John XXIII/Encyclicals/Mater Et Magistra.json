Venerable Brethren and Dearest Sons , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Mother and Teacher of all nations such_-isaia- the Catholic Church in the mind of her Founder , Jesus Christ ; to hold the world in an embrace of love , that_men , in every_age , should find in her their_own completeness in a higher order of living , and their ultimate salvation . She -isaia- '' the pillar and ground of the truth . '' To her was entrusted by her holy Founder the twofold task of giving life to her_children and of teaching them and guiding them both as individuals and as nations with maternal care . Great -isaia- their_dignity , a dignity which_she has_always guarded most zealously and held in the highest esteem . Christianity -isaia- the meeting point of earth and heaven . It lays claim to the whole man , body_and_soul , intellect and will , inducing him to raise his mind above the changing conditions of this earthly existence and reach upwards for the eternal_life of heaven , where one_day he will_find his unfailing happiness and peace . Temporal and Eternal . Hence , though the Church s first care_must be for souls , how she_can sanctify them and make_them share in the gifts of heaven , she concerns herself too with the exigencies of man s daily_life , with_his livelihood and education , and his general , temporal welfare and prosperity . In all this she_-isaia- but giving effect to those principles_which Christ Himself established in the Church He founded . When He said '' I -amos- the way , and the truth , and the life , '' '' I -amos- the light_of_the_world , '' it was doubtless man s eternal_salvation that_was uppermost in His mind , but He showed His concern_for the material welfare of His people when , seeing the hungry crowd of His followers , He was moved to exclaim : '' I have compassion on the multitude . '' And these were no empty words of our_divine Redeemer . Time and again He proved them by His actions , as when He miraculously multiplied bread to alleviate the hunger of the crowds . Bread it was for the body , but it was intended also to foreshadow that other bread , that heavenly food of the soul , which He was to give_them on '' the night before He suffered . '' Teaching and Example . Small wonder , then_,_that the Catholic Church , in imitation of Christ and in fulfilment of His commandment , relies not merely upon her teaching to hold aloft the torch of charity , but_also upon her_own widespread example . This has_been her course now for nigh on two thousand years , from the early ministrations of her deacons right down to the present_time . It -isaia- a charity_which combines the precepts and practice of mutual love . It holds fast to the twofold aspect of Christ s command to give , and summarizes the whole of the Church s social_teaching and activity . The Impact of Rerum Novarum . An outstanding instance of this social_teaching and action carried on by the Church throughout_the ages -isaia- undoubtedly that magnificent encyclical on the christianizing of the conditions of the working classes , Rerum Novarum , published seventy years_ago by Our Predecessor , Leo XlIl . Seldom have_the words of a Pontiff met with_such universal acclaim . In the weight and scope of his arguments , and in the forcefulness of their expression , Pope Leo XIII can have but few rivals . Beyond any shadow of doubt , his directives and appeals have established for themselves a position of such high importance that_they_will never , surely , sink into oblivion . They opened out new horizons for the activity of the universal Church , and the Supreme Shepherd , by giving expression to the hardships and sufferings and aspirations of the lowly and oppressed , made himself_the champion and restorer of their_rights . The impact of this remarkable encyclical -isaia- still with us even today , so many years after it was written . It -isaia- discernible in the writings of the Popes who succeeded Pope Leo . In their social_and_economic teaching they_have frequent recourse to the Leonine Encyclical , either to draw inspiration from it and clarify its application , or to find in it a stimulus to Catholic action . It -isaia- discernible too in the subsequent legislation of a number of States . What further proof need we of the permanent validity of the solidly grounded principles , practical directives and fatherly appeals contained in this masterly encyclical ? It also suggests new and vital criteria by which men can judge the magnitude of the social_question as it presents itself today , and decide on the course of action they must_take . RERUM NOVARUM AND AFTERWARDS . Leo XIII spoke in a time of social_and_economic upheaval , of heightening tensions and actual revolt . Against this dark background , the brilliance of his_teaching stands out in clear relief . Social Conditions in Leo s Time . As -isaia- well_known , the outlook that prevailed on economic matters was for the most part a purely naturalistic one , which denied any correlation between economics and morality . Personal gain was considered the only valid motive for economic activity . In business the main operative principle was that of free and unrestricted competition . Interest on capital , prices whether of goods or of services profits and wages , were to be determined by the purely mechanical application of the laws of the market place . Every precaution was to be taken to prevent the civil authority from intervening in any_way in economic matters . The status of trade unions varied in different countries . They were either forbidden , tolerated , or recognized as having private legal personality only . In an economic world of this character , it was_the might of the strongest which not_only arrogated to itself the force of law , but_also dominated the ordinary business relationships between individuals , and thereby undermined the whole economic structure . Enormous riches accumulated in the hands of a few , while large numbers of workingmen found themselves in conditions of ever_increasing hardship . Wages were insufficient even to the point of reaching starvation level , and working conditions were often of such a nature as to be injurious alike to health , morality and religious faith . Especially inhuman were_the working conditions to which women and children were sometimes subjected . There was_also the constant spectre of unemployment and the progressive disruption of family_life . The natural consequence of all this_was a spirit of indignation and open protest on the part of the workingman , and a widespread tendency to subscribe to extremist theories far worse in their effects than the evils they purported to remedy . Preparing the Way for a New Order . It was -atti_degli_apostoli- such a time and under pressure of such circumstances as these that Leo XIII wrote his social encyclical , Rerum Novarum , based on the needs of human_nature itself and animated by the principles and spirit of the Gospel . His message , not unnaturally , aroused opposition in some quarters , but was received by the majority of people_with the greatest admiration and enthusiasm . A Complete Synthesis It was_not , of course , the first occasion on which_the Apostolic See had come out strongly in defence of the earthly interests of the poor ; indeed , Leo himself h ad made other pronouncements which in a sense had prepared the way_for his encyclical . But here for the first time was a complete synthesis of social principles , formulated with_such historical insight as to be of permanent value to Christendom . It -isaia- rightly regarded as a compendium of Catholic social_and_economic teaching . a No Solution Apart from Religion and Church . In this Leo XIII showed his complete mastery of the situation . There were those_who presumed to accuse the Church of taking no interest in social matters other_than to preach resignation to the poor and generosity to the rich , but Leo XIII had no hesitation in proclaiming and defending the legitimate rights of the workers . As he said -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his exposition of the principles and precepts of the Church in social matters : '' We approach the subject with confidence , and in the exercise of the rights which manifestly appertain to Vs , for no practical solution of this_question will be found apart_from the counsel of religion and of the Church . You know well enough , Venerable Brethren , the basic economic_and_social principles for the reconstruction of human_society enunciated so clearly and authoritatively by this_great Pope . Work a Specifically Human Activity . They concern first of all the question of work , which_must be regarded not merely as a commodity , but as a specifically human activity . In the majority of cases a man s work_-isaia- his sole means of livelihood . Its remuneration , therefore , cannot be made to depend on the state of the market . It must be determined by the laws of justice and equity . Any other procedure would be a clear violation of justice , even supposing the contract of work to have_been freely entered into by both parties . Private Property and Its Social Aspect . Secondly , private ownership of property , including that of productive goods , -isaia- a natural right which_the State cannot suppress . But it naturally entails a social obligation as well . It -isaia- a right which_must be exercised not_only_for one_s_own personal benefit but_also_for the benefit of others . The State s Role . As for the State , its whole raison d etre -isaia- the realization of the common_good in the temporal order . It cannot , therefore , hold aloof from economic matters . On the contrary , it must do all in its power to promote the production of a sufficient supply of material goods , '' the use of which_-isaia- necessary_for the practice of virtue . '' It has_also the duty to protect the rights of all its people , and particularly of its weaker members , the workers , women and children . It can_never be right for the State to shirk its obligation of working actively for the betterment of the condition of the workingman . It -isaia- furthermore the duty of the State to ensure_that terms of employment are regulated in accordance_with justice and equity , and to safeguard the human_dignity of workers by making sure that_they_are not required to work in an environment which_may prove harmful to their material and spiritual interests . It was for_this reason_that the Leonine encyclical enunciated those general principles of rightness and equity which_have_been assimilated into the social legislation of many a modern State , and which , as Pope Pius XI declared in the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , have_made no small contribution to the rise and development of that new branch of jurisprudence called labor law . Right to Enter into Associations . Pope Leo XIII also defended the worker s natural right to enter_into association with_his fellows . Such associations may consist either of workers alone or of workers and employers , and should be structured in a way best calculated to safeguard the workers legitimate professional interest . And it -isaia- the natural right of the workers to work without hindrance , freely , and on their_own initiative within these associations for the achievement of these ends . Human Solidarity and Christian Brotherhood . Finally , both workers and employers should regulate their mutual relations in accordance_with_the principle of human solidarity and Christian brotherhood . Unrestricted competition in the liberal sense , and the Marxist creed of class warfare ; are clearly contrary to Christian teaching and the nature of man . These , Venerable Brethren , are the basic principles upon which a genuine social_and_economic order must be built . The response of good Catholics to this appeal and the enterprise they showed in reducing these_principles into_practice -isaia- hardly surprising . But others too , men_of_good will from every nation in the world , were impelled , under pressure of human necessity , to pursue the same course . Hence , the Leonine encyclical -isaia- rightly regarded , even today , as the Magna Charta of social_and_economic reconstruction . The Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno . Forty years after_the appearance of this magnificent summary of Christian social principles , Our Predecessor , Pius XI , published his_own encyclical , Quadragesimo Anno . In it the Supreme Pontiff confirmed the right and duty of the Catholic Church to work_for an equitable solution of the many pressing problems weighing upon human_society and calling for a joint effort by all the people . He reiterated the principles of the Leonine encyclical and stressed those directives which_were applicable to modern conditions . In addition , he took the opportunity not_only to clarify certain points of this_teaching which_had given rise to difficulties even in the minds of Catholics , but_also to reformulate Christian social thought in the light of changed conditions . The difficulties referred to principally concerned the Catholic s attitude to private_property , the wage system , and moderate Socialism . Private Property ; the Wage System . With regard to private_property , Our Predecessor reaffirmed its origin in natural_law , and enlarged upon its social aspect and the obligations of ownership . As for the wage system , while rejecting the view that_it_-isaia- unjust of its_very nature , he condemned the inhuman and unjust way in which_-isaia- it so often implemented , and specified the terms and conditions to be observed if justice and equity are_not to be violated . In this connection , as Our Predecessor clearly points_out , it -isaia- advisable in the present circumstances that the wage contract be somewhat modified by applying to it elements taken from the contract of partnership , so that '' wage earners and other employees participate in the ownership or the management , or in some_way share in the profits . Of special doctrinal and practical importance -isaia-_his affirmation that '' if the social and individual character of work be overlooked , it can be neither justly valued nor equitably recompensed . '' In determining wages , therefore , justice demands_that account be taken not_only of the needs of the individual workers and their_families , but_also of the financial state of the business concern_for which_they work and of '' the economic welfare of the whole_people . Pope Pius XI further emphasized the fundamental opposition between Communism and Christianity , and made it clear_that no Catholic could subscribe even to moderate Socialism . The reason -isaia- that Socialism -isaia- founded on a doctrine of human_society which_-isaia- bounded by time and takes no account of any objective other_than that of material well_being . Since , therefore , it proposes a form of social organization which aims solely -atti_degli_apostoli- production , it places too severe a restraint on human liberty , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time flouting the true notion of social authority . Other Problems of the Day . Pius XI was_not unaware of the fact_that in the forty years that had supervened since_the publication of the Leonine encyclical the historical scene had altered considerably . It was clear , for example , that unregulated competition had succumbed to its_own inherent tendencies to the point of practically destroying itself . It had given rise to a great accumulation of wealth , and , in the process , concentrated a despotic economic power in the hands of a few '' who for the most part are_not the owners , but_only the trustees and directors of invested funds , which_they administer -atti_degli_apostoli- their_own good pleasure . Hence , as the Pope remarked so discerningly , '' economic domination has_taken the place of the open market . Unbridled ambition for domination has succeeded the desire_for gain ; the whole economic regime has become hard , cruel and relentless in frightful measure . '' As a consequence , even the public_authority was becoming the tool of plutocracy , which_was thus gaining a stranglehold on the entire world . Pius XI saw the re establishment of the economic world within_the framework of the moral_order and the subordination of individual and group interests to the interest of the common_good as the principal remedies for these evils . This , he taught , necessitated an orderly reconstruction of society , with the establishment of economic and vocational bodies which_would be autonomous and independent of the State . Public authority should resume its duty of promoting the common_good of all . Finally , there_should be co operation on a world scale for the economic welfare of all nations . Thus Pius XI s teaching in this_encyclical can be summed up under two heads . First he taught what_the supreme criterion in economic matters ought not to be . It must_not be the special interests of individuals or groups , nor unregulated competition , economic despotism , national prestige or imperialism , nor any_other aim of this_sort . On the contrary , all forms of economic enterprise must be governed by the principles of social_justice and charity . The second point which We consider basic in the encyclical -isaia- his_teaching that_man s aim must be to achieve in social_justice a national and international juridical order , with its network of public_and_private institutions , in which all economic activity can be conducted not merely for private gain but_also in the interests of the common_good . Pius XII s Radio Address . For all that he did to render more precise the Christian definition of social rights_and_duties , no small recognition -isaia- due to Our late Predecessor , Pius XII . On Pentecost Sunday , June st , , he broadcast his message '' to call to the attention of the Catholic world a memory worthy of being written in letters of gold on the Church s Calendar : the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the epoch making social encyclical of Leo XIII , Rerum Novarum , '' l and '' to render to Almighty God from the bottom of Our heart , Our humble thanks for the gift , which . He bestowed on the Church in that encyclical of His vicar on earth , and to praise Him for the lifegiving breath of the Spirit which through it , in ever growing measure from that_time on , has blown on all mankind . '' l The Church s Competence . In that broadcast message the great Pontiff claimed for the Church '' the indisputable competence '' to '' decide whether the bases of a given social system are in accord with the unchangeable order which God our Creator and Redeemer has shown us through the Natural Law and Revelation . '' l He confirmed the perennial validity and inexhaustible worth of the teaching of Rerum Novarum , and took occasion '' to give some further directive moral principles on three fundamental values of social_and_economic life . These three fundamental values , which_are closely connected one_with the other , mutually complementary and dependent , are : the use of material goods , work , and the family . '' The Use of Material Goods . Concerning the use of material goods , Our Predecessor declared that the right of every man to use these for his_own sustenance -isaia- prior to every_other economic right , even that of private_property . The right to the private possession of material goods -isaia- admittedly a natural one ; nevertheless , in the objective order established by God , the right to property cannot stand in the way of the axiomatic principle that '' the goods which_were created by God for all men should flow to all alike , according to the principles of justice and charity '' Work . On the subject of work , Pius XII repeated the teaching of the Leonine encyclical , maintaining that a man s work_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once his duty and his right . It -isaia- for individuals , therefore , to regulate their mutual relations where their work_-isaia- concerned . If they_cannot do so , or will_not do so , then , and only then , does '' it fall back on the State to intervene in the division and distribution of work , and this_must be according to the form and measure that the common_good properly understood demands . In dealing_with the family the Supreme Pontiff affirmed that the private ownership of material goods has a great part to play in promoting the welfare of family_life . It '' secures for the father of a family the healthy liberty he needs in order to fulfil the duties assigned him by the Creator regarding the physical , spiritual and religious welfare of the family . '' It -isaia- in this_that the right of families to migrate -isaia- rooted . And so Our Predecessor , in speaking of migration , admonished both parties involved , namely the country of departure and the country receiving the newcomers , to seek always '' to eliminate as far_as_possible all obstacles to the birth and growth of real confidence '' between_the nations . In this_way both will contribute to , and share in , the increased welfare of man and the progress of culture . But in the twenty years which_have elapsed since_the changing economic climate noted -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time by Pius XII the economic scene has undergone a radical transformation , both in the internal structure of the various States and in their relations with one_another . Science , Technology , Economics . In the field of science , technology and economics we have_the discovery of nuclear energy , and its application first to the purposes of war and later , increasingly , to peaceful ends ; the practically limitless possibilities of chemistry in the production of synthetic materials ; the growth of automation in industry and public services ; the modernization of agriculture ; the easing of communications , especially by radio and television ; Faster transportation and the initial conquest of interplanetary space . The Social Field . In the social field we have_the development of social insurance and , in the more economically advanced communities , the introduction of social security systems . Men in labor unions are showing a more responsible awareness of the major social_and_economic problems . There -isaia- a progressive improvement in basic education , a wider distribution of essential commodities , greater opportunities_for advancement in industry and the consequent breaking down of class barriers , and a keener interest in world affairs shown by people of average education . At the same_time , however , this assessment of the increased efficiency of social_and_economic systems in a growing number of communities serves also to bring to light certain glaring discrepancies . There -isaia- , in the first_place , a progressive lack of balance between agriculture on the one_hand , and industry and public services on the other . Secondly , there_are areas of varying economic prosperity within_the same political communities . Finally to take a world view one observes a marked disparity in the economic wealth possessed by different countries . The Political Field . To turn to the political field , We observe many changes . In a number of countries all classes of citizens are taking a part in public_life , and public_authorities are injecting themselves more each_day into social_and_economic matters . We are witnessing the break away from colonialism and the attainment of political independence by the peoples of Asia and Africa . Drawn together by their common needs nations are becoming daily more interdependent . There -isaia- , moreover , an ever extending network of societies and organizations which set their sights beyond_the aims and interests of individual countries and concentrate on the economic , social , cultural and political welfare of all nations throughout_the_world . The Reasons for This New Encyclical . As We pass all this in review , We are aware of Our responsibility to take up this torch which Our great predecessors lighted , and hand it on with undiminished flame . It -isaia- a torch to lighten the pathways of all who_would seek appropriate solutions to the many social problems of our_times . Our purpose , therefore , -isaia- not merely to commemorate in a fitting manner the Leonine encyclical , but_also to confirm and make more specific the teaching of Our predecessors , and to determine clearly_the mind of the Church on the new and important problems of the day . THE TEACHING OF RERUM NOVARUM . It should be stated -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset that in the economic order first_place must_be_given to the personal initiative of private citizens working either as individuals or in association with each_other in various_ways for the furtherance of common interests . But for reasons explained by Our predecessors the civil_power must_also have a hand in the economy . It has to promote production in a way best calculated to achieve social progress and the well_being of all citizens . Personal Initiative and State Intervention . And in this_work of directing , stimulating , co ordinating , supplying and integrating , its guiding principle must be the '' principle of subsidiary function '' formulated by Pius XI in Quadragesimo Anno . '' This -isaia- a fundamental principle of social philosophy , unshaken and unchangeable . Just as it -isaia- wrong to withdraw from the individual and commit to a community what private enterprise and industry can accomplish , so too it -isaia- an injustice , a grave evil and a disturbance of right order , for a larger and higher association to arrogate to itself functions which_can be performed efficiently by smaller and lower societies . Of its_very nature the true aim of all social activity should be to help members of the social body , but never to destroy or absorb them . The present advance in scientific knowledge and productive technology clearly puts it within_the power of the public_authority to a much greater degree than_ever before to reduce imbalances which_may exist between different branches of the economy or between different regions within_the same country or even between_the different peoples of the world . It also puts into the hands of public_authority a greater means_for limiting fluctuations in the economy and for providing effective measures to prevent the recurrence of mass unemployment . Hence the insistent demands on those in authority since_they are responsible_for the common_good to increase the degree and scope of their activities in the economic sphere , and to devise ways and means and set the necessary machinery in motion for the attainment of this_end . But however extensive and far reaching the influence of the State on the economy may be , it must_never be exerted to the extent of depriving the individual citizen of his freedom of action . It must rather augment his freedom while effectively guaranteeing the protection of his essential personal rights . Among these -isaia- a man s right and duty to be primarily responsible_for his_own upkeep and that of his family . Hence every economic system must permit and facilitate the free development of productive activity . Moreover , as history itself testifies with ever_increasing clarity , there_can be no such thing as a well ordered and prosperous society unless individual citizens and the State co operate in the economy . Both sides must work together in harmony , and their_respective efforts must be proportioned to the needs of the common_good in the prevailing circumstances and conditions of human_life . Experience has shown that where personal initiative -isaia- lacking , political tyranny ensues and , in addition , economic stagnation in the production of a wide range of consumer goods and of services of the material and spiritual order those , namely , which_are in a great measure dependent upon the exercise and stimulus of individual creative talent . Where , on the other_hand , the good offices of the State are lacking or deficient , incurable disorder ensues : in particular , the unscrupulous exploitation of the weak by the strong . For men of this stamp are always in evidence , and , like cockle among the wheat , thrive in every land . Ramifications of the Social Process . Certainly one of the principal characteristics which seem to be typical of our_age -isaia- an increase in social relationships , in those mutual ties , that_-isaia- , which grow daily more numerous and which_have led to the introduction of many and varied forms of associations in the lives and activities of citizens , and to their acceptance within our legal framework . Scientific and technical progress , greater productive efficiency and a higher standard of living are among the many present_day factors which_would seem to have contributed to this trend . This development in the social_life of man_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a symptom and a cause of the growing intervention of the State , even in matters which_are of intimate concern to the individual , hence of great_importance and not devoid of risk . We might cite as examples such matters as health and education , the choice of a career , and the care and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally handicapped . It -isaia-_also partly the result , partly the expression of a natural , well nigh irresistible urge in man to combine with_his fellows for the attainment of aims and objectives which_are beyond_the means or the capabilities of single individuals . In recent_times , this tendency has_given rise to the formation everywhere of both national and international movements , associations and institutions with economic , cultural , social , sporting , recreational , professional and political ends . Advantages and Disadvantages . Clearly , this_sort of development in social relationships brings many advantages in its train . It makes it possible_for the individual to exercise many of his personal rights , especially_those which we call economic_and_social and which pertain to the necessities of life , health_care , education on a more extensive and improved basis , a more thorough professional training , housing , work , and suitable leisure and recreation . Furthermore , the progressive perfection of modern methods of thought diffusion the press , cinema , radio , television makes it possible_for everyone to participate in human events the world over . At the same_time , however , this multiplication and daily extension of forms of association brings with it a multiplicity of restrictive laws and regulations in many departments of human_life . As a consequence , it narrows the sphere of a person s freedom of action . The means often used , the methods followed , the atmosphere created , all conspire to make it difficult for a person to think independently of outside influences , to act on his_own initiative , exercise his responsibility and express and fulfil his_own personality . What then ? Must we conclude that_these increased social relationships necessarily reduce men to the condition of being mere automatons ? By no means . Creation of Free Men . For actually this growth in the social_life of man_-isaia- not a product of natural forces working , as it were , by blind impulse . It -isaia- , as we saw , the creation of men_who are free and autunomous by nature though_they must , of course , recognize and , in a sense , obey the laws of economic development and social progress , and cannot altogether escape from the pressure of environment . The development of these social relationships , therefore , can and ought to be realized in a way best calculated to promote its inherent advantages and to preclude , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least diminish , its attendant disadvantages . Proper Balance Necessary . To this_end , a sane view of the common_good must be present and operative in men invested with public_authority . They must_take account of all those social conditions which favor the full development of human personality . Moreover , We consider it altogether vital that the numerous intermediary bodies and corporate enterprises which_are , so to say , the main vehicle of this social growth be really autonomous , and loyally collaborate in pursuit of their_own specific interests and those of the common_good . For these groups must themselves necessarily present_the form and substance of a true community , and this_will only be the case if they treat their individual members as human persons and encourage them to take an active part in the ordering of their_lives . As these mutual ties binding the men of our_age one to the other grow and develop , governments will the more_easily achieve a right order the more they succeed in striking a balance between_the autonomous and active collaboration of individuals and groups , and the timely coordination and encouragement by the State of these private undertakings . So long as social relationships do in fact adhere to these_principles within_the framework of the moral_order , their extension does_not necessarily mean_that individual citizens will be gravely discriminated against or excessively burdened . On the contrary , we can hope that_they_will help him to develop and perfect his_own personal talents , and lead to that organic reconstruction of society_which Our Predecessor Pius XI advocated in his encyclical Quadragesimo Anno as the indispensable prerequisite for the fulfilment of the rights and obligations of social_life , The Remuneration of Work . We are filled_with an overwhelming sadness when We contemplate the sorry spectacle of millions of workers in many lands and entire continents condemned through the inadequcy of their wages to live with their_families in utterly sub human conditions . This -isaia- probably due to the fact_that the process of industrialization in these countries -isaia- only in its initial stages , or -isaia- still not sufficiently developed . Nevertheless , in some of these lands the enormous wealth , the unbridled luxury , of the privileged few stands in violent , offensive contrast to the utter poverty of the vast majority . In some parts_of_the_world men are_being subjected to inhuman privations so that the output of the national economy can be increased -atti_degli_apostoli- a rate of acceleration beyond what would be possible if regard were had to social_justice and equity . And in other countries a notable percentage of income -isaia- absorbed in building up an ill conceived national prestige , and vast sums are spent on armaments . In economically developed countries , relatively unimportant services , and services of doubtful value , frequently carry a disproportionately high rate of remuneration , while the diligent and profitable work of whole classes of honest , hard working men gets scant reward . Their rate of pay -isaia- quite inadequate to meet_the basic needs of life . It in no way corresponds to the contribution they_make to the good of the community , to the profits of the company for which_they work , and to the general national economy . Factors Determining Just Wage . We therefore consider it Our duty to reaffirm that the remuneration of work_-isaia- not something_that can be left to the laws of the marketplace ; nor_should it be a decision left to the will of the more powerful . It must be determined in accordance_with justice and equity ; which means_that workers must be paid a wage which allows them to live a truly human_life and to fulfill their family obligations in a worthy manner . Other factors too enter_into the assessment of a just wage : namely , the effective contribution which each_individual makes to the economic effort , the financial state of the company for_which he works , the requirements of the general good of the particular country having regard especially to the repercussions on the overall employment of the working force in the country as a whole and finally the requirements of the common_good of the universal family of nations of every_kind , both large and small . The above principles are valid always and everywhere . So much -isaia- clear . But their degree of applicability to concrete cases cannot be deter mined without reference to the quantity and quality of available resources ; and these can and in fact do vary from country to country , and even , from time to time , within_the same country . Balancing Economic Development and Social Progress . In view of the rapid expansion of national economies , particularly since_the war , there_-isaia-_one very_important social principle to which We would draw your attention . It -isaia- this : Economic progress must be accompanied by a corresponding social progress , so that all classes of citizens can participate in the increased productivity . The utmost vigilance and effort -isaia- needed to ensure_that social inequalities , so far from increasing , are reduced to a minimum . As Our Predecessor Pius XII observed with evident justification : '' Likewise the national economy , as it -isaia- the product of the men_who work together in the community of the State , has no other end than to secure without interruption the material conditions in which_the individual life of the citizens may fully develop . Where this_-isaia- secured in a permanent way , a people will be , in a true sense , economically rich , because the general well_being , and consequently the personal right of all to the use of worldly goods , -isaia- thus actuated in conformity_with_the purpose willed by the Creator . '' From this it follows_that the economic prosperity of a nation -isaia- not_so_much its total assets in terms of wealth and property , as the equitable division and distribution of this wealth . This it -isaia- which guarantees the personal development of the members of society , which_-isaia- the true goal of a nation s economy . We must notice in this connection the system of self financing adopted in many countries by large , or comparatively large firms . Because these companies are financing replacement and plant expansion out of their_own profits , they grow -atti_degli_apostoli- a very rapid rate . In such cases We believe_that the workers should be allocated shares in the firms for which_they work , especially_when they_are paid no more_than a minimum wage . We should recall here_the principle enunciated by Pius XI in Quadragesimo Anno : '' It -isaia- entirely false to ascribe to the property alone or to the work alone whatever has_been obtained through the combined effort of both , and it -isaia- wholly unjust for either , denying the efficacy of the other , to arrogate to itself whatever has_been produced . Experience suggests many_ways in which_the demands of justice can be satisfied . Not to mention other ways , it -isaia-_especially desirable today that workers gradually come to share in the ownership of their company , by ways and in the manner that seem most suitable . For today , even_more than in the time of Our Predecessor , '' every_effort must be made that -atti_degli_apostoli- least in future a just share only of the fruits of production be permitted to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy , and that an ample sufficiency be supplied to the workers . '' The Demands of the Common Good . But a further point needs emphasizing : Any adjustment between wages and profits must_take into_account_the demands of the common_good of the particular country and of the whole human_family . What are these demands ? On the national level they include : employment of the greatest possible number of workers ; care lest privileged classes arise , even among the workers ; maintenance of equilibrium between wages and prices ; the need to make goods and services accessible to the greatest number ; elimination , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least the restriction , of inequalities in the various branches of the economy that_-isaia- , between agriculture , industry and services ; creation of a proper balance between economic expansion and the development of social services , especially through the activity of public_authorities ; the best possible adjustment of the means_of_production to the progress of science and technology ; seeing to it that the benefits which_make possible a more_human way_of_life will be available not merely to the present generation but to the coming generations as well . The demands of the common_good on the international level include : the avoidance of all forms of unfair competition between_the economies of different countries ; the fostering of mutual collaboration and good_will ; and effective co operation in the development of economically less advanced communities . These demands of the common_good , both on a national and a world level , must_also be borne in mind when assessing the rate of return due as compensation to the company s management , and as interest or dividends to investors . The Structure of Industry . Justice -isaia- to be observed not_only in the distribution of wealth , but_also in regard to the conditions in which men_are engaged in producing this wealth . Every man_has , of his_very nature , a need to express himself in his_work and thereby to perfect his_own being . Consequently , if the whole structure and organization of an economic system -isaia- such as to compromise human_dignity , to lessen a man s sense_of_responsibility or rob him of opportunity_for exercising personal initiative , then such a system , We maintain , -isaia- altogether unjust no matter how_much wealth it produces , or how justly and equitably such wealth -isaia- distributed . Pius XII s Directive . It -isaia- not_possible to give a concise definition of the kind of economic structure which_-isaia- most consonant with_man s dignity and best calculated to develop in him a sense_of_responsibility . Pius XII , however , comes to our rescue with the following directive : '' The small and average sized undertakings in agriculture , in the arts and crafts , in commerce and industry , should be safeguarded and fostered . Moreover , they_should join together in co operative associations to gain for themselves the benefits and advantages that usually can be gained only from large organizations . In the large concerns themselves there_should be the possibility of moderating the contract of work by one of partnership . '' Artisans and Co operative Enterprises . Hence the craftsman s business and that of the family farm , as well as the co operative enterprise which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- the completion and perfection of both these concerns all these_are to be safeguarded and encouraged in harmony_with_the common_good and technical progress . We shall return shortly to the question of the family farm . Here We consider it appropriate to say something about artisan and co operative enterprises . First of all it -isaia- necessary to emphasize that if these_two kinds of undertaking are to thrive and prosper they_must be prepared constantly to adjust their productive equipment and their productive methods to meet new situations created by the advance of science and technology and the changing demands and preferences of the consumer . This adaptation must be effected principally by the workers themselves and the members of the co operatives . Both these groups , therefore , need a thoroughgoing technical and general education , and should_have their_own professional organizations . It -isaia- equally important_that the government take the proper steps regarding their training , taxation , credit , social security and insurance . Furthermore , these_two categories of citizens craftsmen and members of cooperatives are fully entitled to these watchful measures of the State , for they_are upholding true human values and contributing to the advance of civilization . We therefore paternally invite Our beloved_sons craftsmen and members of cooperatives throughout_the_world to realize the greatness of this_task which_-isaia- theirs in the State . By the force of their example they_are helping to keep alive in their_own community a true sense_of_responsibility , a spirit of co operation , and the constant desire to create new and original work of outstanding merit . The Participation of Workers in Specific Enterprises . We , no less_than Our predecessors , are convinced_that employees are justified in wishing to participate in the activity of the industrial concern_for which_they work . It -isaia- not , of course , possible to lay_down hard and fast rules regarding the manner of such participation , for this_must depend upon prevailing conditions , which vary from firm to firm and are frequently subject to rapid and substantial alteration . But We have no doubt as to the need_for giving workers an active part in the business of the company for which_they work be it a private or a public one . Every effort must be made to ensure_that the enterprise -isaia- indeed a true human community , concerned about the needs , the activities and the standing of each of its_members . This demands_that the relations_between management and employees reflect understanding , appreciation and good_will on both sides . It demands , too , that all parties co operate actively and loyally in the common enterprise , not_so_much for what_they can get out of it for themselves , but as discharging a duty and rendering a service to their fellow men . Balancing Unity of Direction With Role of Individuals All this implies that the workers have_their say in , and make_their own contribution to , the efficient running and development of the enterprise . As Pius XII remarked , '' the economic_and_social function which_every man aspires to fulfil , demands_that the carrying on of the activity of each one_-isaia- not completely subjected to the others . '' Obviously , any firm which_-isaia- concerned for the human_dignity of its workers must_also maintain a necessary and efficient unity of direction . But it must_not treat those employees who spend their days in service with the firm as though_they were mere cogs in the machinery , denying them any opportunity of expressing their wishes or bringing their experience to bear on the work in hand , and keeping them entirely passive in regard to decisions that regulate their activity . We would observe , finally , that the present demand for workers to have a greater say in the conduct of the firm accords not only_with man s nature , but also_with recent progress in the economic , social and political spheres . For although many unjust and inhuman economic_and_social imbalances still exist in our_day , and there are_still many errors affecting the activity , aims , structure and operation of economies the world over , it -isaia- an undeniable fact_that , thanks to the driving impulse of scientific and technical advance , productive systems are today rapidly becoming more modernized and efficient more so than_ever before . Hence a greater technical skill -isaia- required of the workers , and more exacting professional qualifications . Which means_that they must_be_given more assistance , and more free time in which to complete their vocational training as well as to carry_out more fittingly their cultural , moral and religious education . As a further consequence , the modern youth -isaia- enabled to devote a longer time to his basic schooling in the arts and sciences . All this serves to create an environment in which workers are encouraged to assume greater responsibility in their_own sphere of employment . In politics , too , it -isaia- of no small consequence that citizens are becoming daily more aware of their responsibility_for furthering the common_good in all spheres of life . The Participation of Workers in the Economy as a Whole . In modern times we have_seen an extensive increase in the number of workers associations , and their general recognition in the juridical codes of single States and on the international level . Members are no longer recruited in order to agitate , but_rather to co operate , principally by the method of collective bargaining . But it -isaia- worthwhile stressing here how timely and imperative it -isaia- that workers be given the opportunity to exert their influence throughout_the State , and not_just within_the limits of their_own spheres of employment . The More Important Decisions . The reason_for this_-isaia- that the individual productive concerns , regardless of their size , efficiency and importance in the State , form but a part an integral part of a nation s entire economic_and_social life , upon which their_own prosperity must depend . Hence it -isaia- not the decisions made within_the individual productive units which_have the greatest bearing on the economy , but those made by public_authorities and by institutions which tackle the various economic problems on a national or international basis . It -isaia- therefore very appropriate , or even necessary , that_these public_authorities and institutions bring_the workers into_their discussions , and those_who represent the rights , demands and aspirations of the workingmen ; and not confine their deliberations to those_who merely represent the interests of management . Praise and Appreciation . It -isaia- Our prerogative to be a Father , and there_-isaia- a special place in Our thoughts and in Our heart for those professional groups and Christian associations of workers which exist and operate in so many parts_of_the_world . We know_the nature and extent of the difficulties under which these dearest sons of Ours are laboring , as they strive continually and effectually to promote in their_own countries and throughout_the_world the material and moral interests of the working people . They are fully deserving of Our praise . The importance of their_work must be gauged not merely by its immediate and obvious results , but_also by its effect on the working world as a whole , where it helps to spread sound principles of action and the wholesome influence of the Christian religion . We wish further to praise those dear sons of Ours who in a true Christian spirit collaborate with_other professional groups and workers associations which respect the natural_law and the freedom of conscience of their members . We must_also express here Our heartfelt appreciation of the work that_-isaia- being done by the International Labor Organization popularly known in various countries as the O . For many years now it has_been making an effective and valued contribution to the establishment in the world of an economics and social_order marked by justice and humanity , an order which recognizes and safeguards the lawful rights of the workingman . It -isaia- well_known that in recent_years in the larger industrial concerns distinction has_been growing between_the ownership of productive goods and the responsibility of company managers . This has created considerable problems for public_authorities , whose duty it -isaia- to see_that the aims pursued by the leaders of the principal organizations especially_those which_have an important part to play in the national economy do not conflict in any_way with the interests of the common_good . Experience shows_that these problems arise whether the capital which_makes possible these vast undertakings belongs to private citizens or to public corporations . It -isaia-_also true_that more_and_more people today , through belonging to insurance groups and systems of social security , find that_they_can face the future with confidence the sort of confidence which formerly resulted from their possession of a certain amount of property . An Advanced View of Work . And another thing happening today -isaia- that people_are aiming -atti_degli_apostoli- proficiency in their trade or profession rather_than the acquisition of private_property . They think more highly of an income which derives from capital and the rights of capital . And this_-isaia- as it should be . Work , which_-isaia- the immediate expression of a human personality , must_always be rated higher than the possession of external goods which of their_very nature are merely instrumental . This view of work_-isaia- certainly an indication of an advance that_has_been made in our civilization . Confirmation of the Right of Ownership . What , then , of that social_and_economic principle so vigorously asserted and defended by Our predecessors : man s natural right to own private_property , including productive goods ? Is this no longer operative today , or has it lost some of its validity in view of the economic conditions We have described above ? This -isaia- the doubt_that has arisen in many minds . There -isaia- no reason_for such a doubt to persist . The right of private ownership of goods , including productive goods , has permanent validity . It -isaia-_part of the natural order , which teaches_that the individual -isaia- prior to society and society must be ordered to the good of the individual . Moreover , it would be quite useless to insist on free and personal initiative in the economic field , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time withdrawing man s right to dispose freely of the means indispensable to the achievement of such initiative . Further , history and experience testify that in those political regimes which do not recognize_the rights of private ownership of goods , productive included , the exercise of freedom in almost every_other direction -isaia- suppressed or stifled . This suggests , surely , that the exercise of freedom finds_its guarantee and incentive in the right of ownership . This explains why social and political movements for the harmonizing of justice and freedom in society , though until recently opposed to the private ownership of productive goods , are today reconsidering their position in the light of a clearer understanding of social history , and are in fact now declaring themselves in favor of this right . Guarantee for Both Individual and Society . Accordingly , We make Our own the directive of Our Predecessor Pius XII : '' In defending the principle of private ownership the Church -isaia- striving after an important ethico social end . She does_not intend merely to uphold the present condition of things as if it were an expression of the divine Will , or to protect on principle the rich and plutocrats against the poor and indigent . The Church aims rather -atti_degli_apostoli- securing that the institution of private_property be such as it should be according to the plan of the divine Wisdom and the dispositions of Nature . '' Hence private ownership must be considered as a guarantee of the essential freedom of the individual , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an indispensable element in a true social_order . Wages and Property . Moreover , in recent_years , as we have_seen , the productive efficiency of many national economies has_been increasing rapidly . Justice and fairness demand , therefore_,_that , within_the limits of the common_good , wages too shall increase . This means_that workers are_able to save more and thus acquire a certain amount of property of their_own . In view of this it -isaia- strange that the innate character of a right which derives its force and validity from the fruitfulness of work should ever be called in question a right which constitutes so efficacious a means of asserting one s personality and exercising responsibility in every field , and an element of solidity and security for family_life and of greater peace and prosperity in the State . The Effective Distribution of Property . But it -isaia-_not_enough to assert that the right to own private_property and the means_of_production -isaia- inherent in human_nature . We must_also insist on the extension of this right in practice to all classes of citizens . As Our Predecessor Pius XII so rightly affirmed : The dignity_of_the_human_person '' normally demands the right to the use of the goods of the earth , to which corresponds the fundamental obligation of granting an opportunity to possess property to all if possible . '' This demand arises from the moral dignity of work . It also guarantees '' the conservation and perfection of a social_order which_makes possible a secure , even if modest , property to all classes of people . Now , if ever , -isaia- the time to insist on a more widespread distribution of property , in view of the rapid economic development of an increasing number of States . It will_not be difficult for the body politic , by the adoption of various techniques of proved efficiency , to pursue an economic_and_social policy which facilitates the widest possible distribution of private_property in terms of durable consumer goods , houses , land , tools and equipment in the case of craftsmen and owners of family farms , and shares in medium and large business concerns . This policy -isaia-_in_fact being pursued with considerable success by several of the socially and economically advanced nations . This , of course , -isaia- not to deny the lawfulness of State and public ownership of productive goods , especially_those which '' carry with_them a power too great to be left to private individuals without injury to the community -atti_degli_apostoli- large . State and public ownership of property -isaia-_very much on the increase today . This -isaia- explained by the exigencies of the common_good , which demand_that public_authority broaden its sphere of activity . But here , too , the '' principle of subsidiary function '' must be observed . The State and other agencies of public law must_not extend their ownership beyond what_-isaia- clearly required by considerations of the common_good properly understood , and even then there_must be safeguards . Otherwise private ownership could be reduced beyond measure , or , even worse , completely destroyed . It -isaia- important , too , not to overlook the fact_that the economic enterprises of the State and other agencies of public law must be entrusted to men_of_good reputation who have_the necessary experience and ability and a keen sense_of_responsibility towards their_country . Furthermore , a strict check should constantly be kept upon their activity , so as to avoid any possibility of the concentration of undue economic power in the hands of a few State officials , to the detriment of the best interests of the community . The Social Function of Property . Our predecessors have insisted time and again on the social function inherent in the right of private ownership , for it cannot be denied that in the plan of the Creator all of this_world s goods are primarily intended for the worthy support of the entire human_race . Hence , as Leo XIII so wisely taught in Rerum Novarum : '' whoever has received_from_the divine bounty a large share of temporal blessings , whether_they be external and corporeal , or gifts of the mind , has_received them_for the purpose of using them_for the perfecting of his_own nature , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , that_he_may employ them , as the steward of God s Providence , for the benefit of others . He that hath a talent , says St . Gregory the Great , let_him see_that he hide it not ; he that hath abundance , let_him quicken himself to mercy and generosity ; he that hath art and skill , let_him do his best to share the use and the utility thereof with_his neighbor . '' Always Vast Field For Personal Charity . In recent_years the State and other agencies of public law have extended , and are continuing to extend , the sphere of their activity and initiative . But this does_not_mean that the doctrine of the social function of private ownership -isaia- out of date , as some would maintain . It -isaia- inherent in the very right of private ownership . Then , too , a further consideration arises . Tragic situations and urgent problems of an intimate and personal nature are continually arising which_the State with all its machinery -isaia- unable to remedy or assist . There will_always remain , therefore , a vast field for the exercise of human sympathy and the Christian charity of individuals . We would observe , finally , that the efforts of individuals , or of groups of private citizens , are definitely more_effective in promoting spiritual values than -isaia- the activity of public_authority . The Real Treasure . We should notice -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point that the right of private ownership -isaia- clearly sanctioned by the Gospel . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the divine Master frequently extends to the rich the insistent invitation to convert their material goods into spiritual ones by conferring them on the poor . '' Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth ; where_the rust and moth consume and where thieves break through and steal . But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven ; where neither the rust nor moth doth consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal . '' And the Lord will look upon the charity given to the poor as given to Himself . '' Amen , I say to you , as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren , you did it to me . NEW ASPECTS OF THE SOCIAL QUESTION . History shows with ever_increasing clarity that it -isaia-_not_only the relations_between workers and managers that need to be re established on the basis of justice and equity , but_also those between_the various branches of the economy , between areas of varying productivity within_the same political community , and between countries with a different degree of social_and_economic development . The Depressed State of Agriculture . First , with_regard to agriculture , it would_not appear that the rural population as a whole -isaia- decreasing , but_it_-isaia- an undeniable fact_that many_people are moving away from their farms into more thickly populated areas as well as into the cities themselves . When we realize_that this movement of population -isaia- going on in nearly every part_of_the_world , often on a large scale , we begin to appreciate the complexity of the human problems involved and their difficulty of solution . We know_that as an economy develops , the number of people engaged in agriculture decreases , while the percentage employed in industry and the various services rises . Nevertheless , We believe_that very often this movement of population from farming to industry has other causes besides those dependent upon economic expansion . Among these there_-isaia- the desire to escape from confining surroundings which offer little prospect of a more comfortable way_of_life . There -isaia- the lure of novelty and adventure which has_taken such a hold on the present generation , the attractive prospect of easy money , of greater freedom and the enjoyment of all the amenities of town and city life . But a contributory cause of this movement away from the country -isaia- doubtless the fact_that farming has become a depressed occupation . It -isaia- inadequate both in productive efficiency and in the standard of living it provides . Nearly every country , therefore , -isaia- faced_with this fundamental problem : What can be done to reduce the disproportion in productive efficiency between agriculture on the one_hand , and industry and services on the other ; and to ensure_that agricultural living standards approximate as closely as possible those enjoyed by city dwellers who draw their resources either from industry or from the services in which_they_are engaged ? What can be done to persuade agricultural workers that , far_from_being inferior to other people , they_have every opportunity of developing their personality through_their work , and can look forward to the future with confidence ? Contributing to the Solution . It seems to Us opportune to indicate certain directives that_can contribute to a solution of this problem : directives which We believe have value whatever may be the historical environment in which one acts on condition , obviously , that_they be applied in the manner and to the degree allowed , suggested , or even demanded by the circumstances . In the first_place , considerable thought must_be_given , especially by public_authorities , to the suitable development of essential facilities in country areas such as roads ; transportation ; means of communication ; drinking water ; houseing ; health services ; elementary , technical and professional education ; religious and recreational facilities ; and the supply of modern installations and furnishings for the farm residence . Such services as these_are necessary nowadays if a becoming standard of living -isaia- to be maintained . In those country areas where_they are lacking , economic_and_social progress -isaia- either prevented or greatly impeded , with the result that_nothing can be done to retard the drift of population away from the land , and it even becomes difficult to make a good appraisal of the numbers involved . Balanced Development of the Economy . If a country -isaia- to develop economically , it must do so gradually , maintaining an even balance between all sectors of the economy . Agriculture , therefore , must be allowed to make_use of the same reforms in the method and type of production and in the conduct of the business side of the venture as are permitted or required in the economic system as a whole . All such reforms should correspond as nearly as possible with_those introduced in industry and the various services . In this_way , agriculture will absorb a larger amount of industrial goods and require a better system of services . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it will provide both industry and the services and the country as a whole with the type of products which , in quantity and quality , best meet_the needs of the consumer and contribute to the stability of the purchasing power of money a major consideration in the orderly development of the entire economic system . One advantage which_would result from the adoption of this plan would be that it would be easier to keep track of the movement of the working force set free by the progressive modernization of agriculture . Facilities could then be provided for the training of such people for their new kind of work , and they_would not be left without economic aid and the mental and spiritual assistance they_need to ensure their_proper integration in their new social milieu . The Need for a Suitable Economic Policy . In addition , a sound agricultural program -isaia- needed if public authority_-isaia- to maintain an evenly balanced progress in the various branches of the economy . This must_take into_account tax policies , credit , social insurance , prices , the fostering of ancillary industries and the adjustment of the structure of farming as a business enterprise . In a system of taxation based on justice and equity it -isaia- fundamental that the burdens be proportioned to the capacity of the people contributing . But the common_good also requires the public_authorities , in assessing the amount of tax payable , take cognizance of the peculiar difficulties of farmers . They have to wait longer than most people for their returns , and these_are exposed to greater hazards . Consequently , farmers find greater difficulty in obtaining the capital necessary to increase returns . For this_reason , too , investors are_more inclined to put their money in industry rather_than agriculture . Farmers are unable to pay high rates of interest . Indeed , they_cannot as a rule make_the trading profit necessary to furnish capital for the conduct and development of their_own business . It -isaia- therefore necessary , for reasons of the common_good , for public_authorities to evolve a special credit policy and to form credit banks which_will guarantee such capital to farmers -atti_degli_apostoli- a moderate rate of interest . Social Insurance and Social Security . In agriculture the existence of two forms of insurance may be necessary : one concerned_with agricultural produce , the other with the farm workers and their_families . We realize_that agricultural workers earn less per capita than workers in industry and the services , but that_-isaia- no reason_why it should be considered socially just and equitable to set up systems of social insurance in which_the allowances granted to farm workers and their_families are substantially lower than those payable to other classes of workers . Insurance programs that_are established for the general public should_not differ markedly whatever be the economic sector in which_the individuals work or the source of their income . Systems of social insurance and social security can_make a most effective contribution to the overall distribution of national income in accordance_with_the principles of justice and equity . They can therefore be instrumental in reducing imbalances between_the different classes of citizens . Given the special nature of agricultural produce , modern economists must devise a suitable means of price protection . Ideally , such price protection should be enforced by the interested parties themselves , though supervision by the public_authority cannot be altogether dispensed with . On this_subject it must_not be forgotten that the price of agricultural produce represents , for the most part , the reward of the farmer s labor rather_than a return on invested capital . Hence , in Quadragesimo Anno Pope Pius XI rightly observed that '' a proper proportion between different wages -isaia-_also a matter of importance . '' He continued : '' And intimately connected_with this_-isaia- a proper proportion between_the prices charged for the products of the various economic groups , agricultural , industrial , and so forth . While it -isaia- true_that farm produce -isaia- mainly intended for the satisfaction of man s primary needs , and the price should therefore be within_the means of all consumers , this cannot be used as an argument for keeping a section of the population farm workers in a permanent state of economic_and_social inferiority , depriving them of the wherewithal for a decent standard of living . This would be diametrically opposed to the common_good . The Promotion of Ancillary Industries . Moreover , the time has come to promote in agricultural regions the establishment of those industries and services which_are concerned_with the preservation , processing and transportation of farm products . Enterprises relating to other sectors of the economy might also be established there . In this case the rural population would_have another means of income -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal , a means which_they could exploit in the social milieu to which_they_are accustomed . The Structure of the Farm Unit . It -isaia- not_possible to determine a priori what_the structure of farm life should be , since rural conditions vary so much from place to place and from country to country throughout_the_world . But if we hold to a human and Christian concept of man and the family , we are_bound to consider as an ideal that form of enterprise which_-isaia- modelled on the basis of a community of persons working together for the advancement of their mutual interests in accordance_with_the principles of justice and Christian teaching . We are_bound above all to consider as an ideal the kind of farm which_-isaia- owned and managed by the family . Every effort must be made in the prevailing circumstances to give effective encouragement to farming enterprises of this nature . But if the family farm -isaia- not to go bankrupt it must make enough money to keep the family in reasonable comfort . To ensure this , farmers must_be_given up to date instruction on the latest methods of cultivation , and the assistance of experts must be put -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal . They should_also form a flourishing system of cooperative undertakings , and organize themselves professionally to take an effective part in public_life , both on the administrative and the political level . The Self Advancement of the Farming Community . We are convinced_that the farming community must_take an active part in its_own economic advancement , social progress and cultural betterment . Those who_live on the land can hardly fail to appreciate the nobility of the work they_are_called upon to do . They are living in close harmony_with Nature the majestic temple of Creation . Their work has to do with the life of plants and animals , a life that_-isaia- inexhaustible in its expression , inflexible in its laws , rich in allusions to God the Creator and Provider . They produce food for the support of human_life , and the raw materials of industry in ever richer supply . Theirs -isaia- a work_which carries with it a dignity all its_own . It brings into its service many branches of engineering , chemistry and biology , and -isaia- itself a cause of the continued practical development of these sciences in view of the repercussions of scientific and technical progress on the business of farming . It -isaia- a work_which demands a capacity_for orientation and adaptation , patient waiting , a sense_of_responsibility , and a spirit of perseverance and enterprise . Solidarity and Co operation . It -isaia- important also to bear in mind_that in agriculture , as in other sectors of production , association -isaia- a vital need today especially in the case of family farms . Rural workers should feel a sense of solidarity with one_another , and should unite to form co operatives and professional associations . These are_very necessary if farm workers are to benefit from scientific and technical methods of production and protect the prices of their products . They are necessary , too , if they_are to attain an equal footing with_other professional classes who , in most cases , have joined together in associations . They are necessary , finally , if farm workers are to have their_proper voice in political circles and in public administration . The lone voice -isaia- not likely to command much of a hearing in times such as ours . In using their various organizations , agricultural workers as indeed all other classes of workers must_always be guided by moral principles and respect_for the civil law . They must try to reconcile their_rights and interests with_those of other classes of workers , and even subordinate the one to the other if the common_good demands it . If they show themselves alive to the common_good and contribute to its realizations , they_can legitimately demand_that their_efforts for the improvement of agricultural conditions be seconded and complemented by public_authority . We therefore desire here to express Our satisfaction with_those sons of Ours the world over who_are actively engaged in co operatives , in professional groups and in worker movements intent on raising the economic_and_social standards of the agricultural community . Vocation and Mission . In the work on the farm the human personality finds every incentive for self expression , self development and spiritual growth . It -isaia- a work , therefore , which_should be thought of as a vocation , a God given mission , an answer to God s call to actuate His providential , saving plan in history . It should be thought of , finally , as a noble task , undertaken with_a_view to raising oneself and others to a higher degree of civilization . Toward a Balanced Internal Economy . Among citizens of the same political community there -isaia-_often a marked degree of economic_and_social inequality . The main reason_for this_-isaia- the fact that_they_are living and working in different areas , some of which_are more economically developed than others . Where this situation obtains , justice and equity demand_that public_authority try to eliminate or reduce such imbalances . It should ensure_that the less developed areas receive such essential public services as their circumstances require , in order to bring_the standard of living in these areas into line with the national average . Furthermore , a suitable economic_and_social policy must be devised which_will take into_account_the supply of labor , the drift of population , wages , taxes , credit , and the investing of money , especially in expanding industries . In short , it should be a policy designed to promote useful employment , enterprising initiative , and the exploitation of local resources . The Common Good . But the justification of all government action -isaia- the common_good . Public authority , therefore , must bear in mind the interests of the state as a whole ; which means_that it must pro mote all three areas of production agriculture , industry and services simultaneously and evenly . Everything must be done to ensure_that citizens of the less developed areas are treated as responsible human_beings , and are allowed to play the major role in achieving their_own economic , social_and_cultural advancement . Contribution of Private Enterprise . Private enterprise too must contribute to an economic_and_social balance in the different areas of the same political community . Indeed , in accordance_with '' the principle of subsidiary function , '' public_authority must encourage and assist private enterprise , entrusting to it , wherever possible , the continuation of economic development . It -isaia- not out of place to remark here on a problem which exists in quite a number of countries , namely , a gross disproportion between land and population . In some_countries arable land abounds , but there_-isaia- a scarcity of population ; whereas in other countries the position -isaia- reversed : the population -isaia- large , arable land scarce . Surpluses and Scarcities . Again , some_countries use primitive methods of agriculture , with the result that , for all their abundance of natural resources , they_are_not able to produce enough food to feed their population ; whereas other countries , using modern methods of agriculture , produce a surplus of food which_has an adverse effect on the economy . It -isaia- therefore obvious that the solidarity of the human_race and Christian brotherhood demand the elimination as far_as_possible of these discrepancies . With this object in view , people all over the world must co operate actively with one_another in all sorts of ways , so as to facilitate the movement of goods , capital and men from one country to another . We shall_have more to say on this_point later on . Here We would_like to express Our sincere appreciation of the work_which the F . a has undertaken to establish effective collaboration among nations , to promote the modernization of agriculture especially in less developed countries , and to alleviate the suffering of hunger stricken peoples . Obligation of the Wealthy Nations . Probably the most difficult problem today concerns the relationship_between political communities that_are economically advanced and those in the process of development . Whereas the standard of living -isaia- high in the former , the latter are subject to extreme poverty . The solidarity which binds all men together as members of a common family makes it impossible for wealthy nations to look with indifference upon the hunger , misery and poverty of other nations whose citizens are unable to enjoy even elementary human_rights . The nations of the world are becoming more_and_more dependent on one_another and it will_not be possible to preserve a lasting peace so long as glaring economic_and_social imbalances persist . Mindful of Our position as the father of all peoples , We feel constrained to repeat here what We said on another occasion : '' We are all equally responsible_for the undernourished peoples . Hence , it -isaia- necessary to educate one s conscience to the sense_of_responsibility which weighs upon each_and_every one , especially upon those_who_are more blessed with this_world s goods . '' The Mystical Body of Christ . The Church has_always emphasized that_this obligation of helping those_who_are in misery and want should be felt most strongly by Catholics , in view of the fact that_they_are members of the Mystical Body of Christ . '' In this we have known the charity of God , '' says St . John , '' because he has laid_down his_life for us ; and we ought to lay_down our_lives for the brethren . He that hath the substance of this_world and shall see his_brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him ; how doth the charity of God abide in him ? '' . It -isaia- therefore a great source of joy to Us to see those nations which enjoy a high degree of economic wealth helping the nations not so well provided , so that_they_may more_effectively raise their standard of living . Justice and humanity demand_that those countries which produce consumer goods , especially farm products , in excess of their_own needs should come to the assistance of those other countries where large sections of the population are suffering from want and hunger . It -isaia- nothing less_than an outrage to justice and humanity to destroy or to squander goods that other people need_for their_very lives . We are , of course , well aware_that overproduction , especially in agriculture , can cause economic harm to a certain section of the population . But it does_not follow that one_-isaia- thereby exonerated from extending emergency aid to those_who need it . On the contrary , everything must be done to minimize the ill effects of overproduction , and to spread the burden equitably over the entire population . Scientific , Technical and Financial Co operation . Of itself , however , emergency aid will_not go far in relieving want and famine when these_are caused as they so often are by the primitive state of a nation s economy . The only permanent remedy for this_-isaia- to make_use of every possible means of providing these citizens with the scientific , technical and professional training they_need , and to put -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal the necessary capital for speeding up their economic development with the help of modern methods . We are aware how deeply the public conscience has_been affected in recent_years by the urgent_need of supporting the economic development and social progress of those countries which are_still struggling against poverty and economic disabilities . International and regional organizations , national and private societies , all are working towards this goal , increasing day to day the measure of their_own technical co operation in all productive spheres . By their combined efforts thousands of young_people are_being given facilities for attending the universities of the more advanced countries , and acquiring an up to date scientific , technical and professional training . World banking institutes , individual States and private persons are helping to furnish the capital for an ever richer network of economic enterprises in the less wealthy countries . It -isaia- a magnificent work that_they_are doing , and We are_most happy to take this occasion of giving it the praise that it deserves . It -isaia- a work , however , which needs to be increased , and We hope_that the years ahead will see the wealthier nations making even greater efforts for the scientific , technical and economic advancement of those political communities whose development -isaia- still only in its initial stages . Some Additional Counsels . We consider it Our duty to give further advice on this_matter . Learning from the Past . In the first_place , those nations which are_still only -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of their journey along the road to economic development would do well to consider carefully the experiences of the wealthier nations which_have traversed this road before them . Proper Balance Essential . Increase in production and productive efficiency -isaia- , of course , sound policy , and indeed a vital necessity . However , it -isaia- no less necessary and justice itself demands_that the riches produced be distributed fairly among all members of the political community . This means_that everything must be done to ensure_that social progress keeps pace with economic progress . Again , every sector of the economy agriculture , industry and the services must progress evenly and simultaneously . Respecting a Nation s Individuality . The developing nations , obviously , have certain unmistakable characteristics of their_own , resulting from the nature of the particular region and the natural dispositions of their citizens , with_their time honored traditions and customs . In helping these nations , therefore , the more advanced communities must recognize and respect this individuality . They must beware of making the assistance they give an excuse for forcing these_people into_their own national mold . Offering Disinterested Aid . There -isaia-_also a further temptation which_the economically developed nations must resist : that of giving technical and financial aid with_a_view to gaining control over the political situation in the poorer countries , and furthering their ownplans for world domination . Let us be quite clear on this_point . A nation that acted from_these motives would in fact be introducing a new form of colonialism cleverly disguised , no doubt , but actually reflecting that older , outdated type from which many nations have recently emerged . Such action would , moreover , have harmful impact on international relations , and constitute a menace to world peace . Necessity , therefore , and justice demand_that all such technical and financial aid be given without thought of domination , but_rather for the purpose of helping the less developed nations to achieve their_own economic_and_social growth . If this_can be achieved , then a precious contribution will_have been_made to the formation of a world community , in which each_individual nation , conscious of its rights_and_duties , can work on terms of equality with the rest for the attainment of universal prosperity . Respecting the True Hierarchy of Values . Scientific and technical progress , economic development and the betterment of living conditions , are certainly valuable elements in a civilization . But we must realize that_they_are essentially instrumental in character . They are_not supreme values in themselves . It pains Us , therefore , to observe the complete indifference to the true hierarchy of values shown by so many_people in the economically developed countries . Spiritual values are ignored , forgotten or denied , while the progress of science , technology and economics -isaia- pursued for its_own sake , as though material well_being were_the be all and end all of life . This attitude -isaia- contagious , especially_when it infects the work that_-isaia- being done for the less developed countries , which_have often preserved in their ancient traditions an acute and vital awareness of the more_important human values , on which_the moral_order rests . To attempt to undermine this national integrity -isaia- clearly immoral . It must be respected and as far_as_possible clarified and developed , so that_it_may remain what it -isaia- : a foundation of true civilization . Contribution of the Church . The Church -isaia- by divine right universal . History itself bears this out , for the Church -isaia- present everywhere on earth , doing all that_she can to embrace all peoples . Now , in bringing people to Christ , the Church has invariably both now and in the past brought them many social and economical advantages . For true Christians cannot help feeling obliged to improve their_own temporal institutions and environment . They do all they_can to prevent these institutions from doing violence to human_dignity . They encourage whatever_-isaia- conducive to honesty and virtue , and strive to eliminate every obstacle to the attainment of this aim . Moreover , in becoming as it were_the life blood of these_people , the Church -isaia- not , nor_does she consider herself to be , a foreign body in their midst . Her presence brings about the rebirth , the resurrection , of each_individual in Christ ; and the man who_-isaia- reborn and rises again in Christ never feels himself constrained from without . He feels himself free in the very depth of his being , and freely raised up to God . And thus he affirms and develops that side of his nature which_-isaia- noblest and best . Unity , not Uniformity . '' The Church of Jesus Christ , '' as Our Predecessor Pius XII observed with_such penetration , '' -isaia- the repository of His wisdom ; she_-isaia- certainly too wise to discourage or belittle those peculiarities and differences which mark out one nation from another . It -isaia- quite legitimate for nations to treat those differences as a sacred inheritance and guard them -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs . The Church aims -atti_degli_apostoli- unity , a unity determined and kept alive by that supernatural love which_should be actuating everybody ; she does_not aim -atti_degli_apostoli- a uniformity which_would only be external in its effects and would cramp the natural tendencies of the nations concerned . Every nation has its_own genius , its_own qualities , springing from the hidden roots of its being . The wise development , the encouragement within limits , of that genius , those qualities , does no harm ; and if a nation cares to take precautions , to lay_down rules , for that end , it has the Church s approval . She -isaia- mother enough to befriend such projects with_her prayers . '' Role of Catholic Citizens . It -isaia- a source of profound satisfaction to Us to see the prominent part which_-isaia- being played by Catholic citizens of the less wealthy countries in the economic_and_social development of their_own State . Then , too , the Catholics of the wealthier States are doing all they_can to increase the effectiveness of the social_and_economic work that_-isaia- being done for the poorer nations . We would give Our special approval to the increasing assistance they_are giving , in all sorts of ways , to African and Asian students scattered throughout_the universities of Europe and America ; and to the care that_-isaia- being devoted to the training of those persons_who are prepared to go to the less wealthy areas in order to engage in work of technical and professional nature . To these Our beloved_sons in every land who , in promoting genuine progress and civilization , are a living proof of the Church s perennial vitality , We wish to extend Our kind and fatherly word of appreciation and encouragement . Population Increase and Economic Development . How can economic development and the supply of food keep pace with the continual rise in population ? This -isaia-_a_question which constantly obtrudes itself today a world problem , as well as one for the poverty stricken nations . As a world problem , the case -isaia- put thus : According to sufficiently reliable statistics the next few decades will see a very great increase in human population , whereas economic development will proceed -atti_degli_apostoli- a slower rate . Hence , we are told , if nothing_-isaia- done to check this rise in population , the world will be faced in the not too distant future with an increasing shortage in the necessities of life . As it affects the less developed countries , the problem -isaia- stated thus : The resources of modern hygiene and medicine will very shortly bring_about a notable decrease in the mortality rate , especially among infants , while the birth rate which in such countries -isaia- unusually high will tend to remain more_or_less constant , -atti_degli_apostoli- least for a considerable period . The excess of births over deaths will therefore show a steep rise , whereas there_will be no corresponding increase in the productive efficiency of the economy . Accordingly , the standard of living in these poorer countries cannot possibly improve . It must surely worsen , even to the point of extreme hardship . Hence there are_those_who hold the opinion that , in order to prevent a serious crisis from developing , the conception and birth of children should be secretly avoided , or , in any event , curbed in some_way . The Problem Examined . Truth to tell , we do not seem to be faced_with any immediate or imminent world problem arising from the disproportion between_the increase of population and the supply of food . Arguments to this effect are based on such unreliable and controversial data that_they_can only be of very uncertain validity . Besides , the resources which God in His goodness and wisdom has implanted in Nature are_well nigh inexhaustible , and He has -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time given man the intelligence to discover ways and means of exploiting these resources for his_own advantage and his_own livelihood . Hence , the real solution of the problem -isaia- not to be found in expedients which offend against the divinely established moral_order and which attack human_life -atti_degli_apostoli- its_very source , but in a renewed scientific and technical effort on man s part to deepen and extend his dominion over Nature . The progress of science and technology that has_already_been achieved opens up almost limitless horizons in this held . As for the problems which face the poorer nations in various parts_of_the_world , We realize , of course , that_these are_very real . They are caused , more often than not , by a deficient economic_and_social organization , which_does_not offer living conditions proportionate to the increase in population . They are caused , also , by the lack of effective solidarity among such peoples . But granting this , We must nevertheless state most emphatically that no statement of the problem and no solution to it -isaia- acceptable which_does violence to man s essential dignity ; those_who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man_himself and his_life . Only Possible Solution . The only possible solution to this_question -isaia- one_which envisages the social_and_economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human_society , and which respects and promotes true human values . First consideration must obviously be given to those values_which concern man s dignity generally , and the immense worth of each_individual human_life . Attention must then be turned to the need_for worldwide co operation among_men , with_a_view to a fruitful and well regulated interchange of useful knowledge , capital and manpower . Respect for the Laws of Life . We must solemnly proclaim that_human life_-isaia- transmitted by means of the family , and the family_-isaia- based upon a marriage which_-isaia- one and indissoluble and , with_respect to Christians , raised to the dignity of a sacrament . The transmission of human life_-isaia- the result of a personal and conscious act , and , as such , -isaia- subject to the all holy , inviolable and immutable laws of God , which no man may ignore or disobey . He -isaia- not therefore permitted to use certain ways and means which_are allowable in the propagation of plant and animal life . Human life_-isaia- sacred all men must recognize_that fact . From its_very inception it reveals the creating hand of God . Those who violate His laws not_only offend the divine majesty and degrade themselves and humanity , they_also -sapienza- the vitality of the political community of which_they_are members . Education Toward Sense of Responsibility . It -isaia- of the utmost importance that parents exercise their right and obligation toward_the younger generation by securing for their_children a sound cultural and religious formation . They must_also educate them to a deep sense_of_responsibility in life , especially in such matters as concern the foundation of a family and the procreation and education of children . They must instill in them an unshakable confidence in Divine Providence and a determination to accept the inescapable sacrifices and hardships involved in so noble and important a task as the co operation with God in the transmitting of human_life and the bringing up of children . To the attainment of this_end nothing can be more_effective than those principles and that supernatural aid which_the Church supplies . On this score alone the right of the Church to full liberty in the exercise of her_mission must be recognized . Science in the Service of Life . Genesis relates how God gave two commandments to our_first parents : to transmit human_life '' Increase and mutliply '' and to bring nature into_their service '' Fill the earth , and subdue it . '' These two commandments are complementary . Nothing -isaia- said in the second of these commandments about destroying nature . On the contrary , it must be brought into the service of human_life . We are sick -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , therefore , when We observe the contradiction which_has beguiled so much modern thinking . On the one_hand we are shown the fearful specter of want and misery which threatens to extinguish human_life , and on the other_hand we find scientific discoveries , technical inventions and economic resources being used to provide terrible instruments of ruin and death . A provident God grants sufficient means to the human_race to find a dignified solution to the problems attendant upon the transmission of human_life . But these problems can become difficult of solution , or even insoluble , if man , led astray in mind and perverted in will , turns to such means as are opposed to right_reason , and seeks ends that_are contrary to his social nature and the intentions of Providence . The progress of science and technology in every aspect of life has led , particularly today , to increased relationships between nations , and made the nations more_and_more dependent on one_another . As a rule no single commonwealth has sufficient resources -atti_degli_apostoli- its command to solve the more_important scientific , technical , economic , social , political and cultural problems which confront it -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . These problems are necessarily the concern of a whole group of nations , and possibly of the whole_world . Individual political communities may indeed enjoy a high degree of culture and civilization . They may_have a large and industrious population , an advanced economic structure , great natural resources and extensive territories . Yet , even so , in isolation from the rest of the world they_are quite incapable of finding an adequate solution to their major problems . The nations , therefore , must work with each_other for their mutual development and perfection . They can_help themselves only in so far as they succeed in helping one_another . That -isaia- why international understanding and co operation are so necessary . The Effects of Mutual Distrust . Yet although individuals and nations are becoming more_and_more convinced of this twofold necessity , it would seem that_men in general , and particularly those with high responsibility in public_life , are showing themselves quite incapable of achieving it . The root of such inability -isaia- not to be sought in scientific , technical or economic reasons , but in the absense of mutual trust . Men , and consequently States , are in mortal fear of each_other . Each fears that the other harbors plans of conquest and -isaia- only waiting for a favorable moment to put these plans into_effect . Hence each organizes its_own defense and builds up munitions of war as a deterrent against the would be aggressor . The result -isaia- a vast expenditure of human energy and natural resources on projects which_are disruptive of human_society rather_than beneficial to it ; while a growing uneasiness gnaws -atti_degli_apostoli- men s hearts and makes them less responsive to the call of nobler enterprises . Failure to Acknowledge the Moral Order . The root cause of so much mistrust -isaia- the presence of ideological differences between nations , and more especially between their rulers . There are_some indeed who go so far as to deny the existence of a moral_order which_-isaia- transcendent , absolute , universal and equally binding upon all . And where_the same law of justice -isaia- not adhered to by all , men cannot hope to come to open and full agreement on vital issues . Yes , both sides speak of justice and the demands of justice , but these_words frequently take on different or opposite meanings according to which side uses them . Hence , when rulers of nations appeal to justice and the demands of justice , they not_only disagree on terms , but often increase the tension that exists between their States . And so the belief -isaia- engendered that if a nation -isaia- to assert its rights and pursue its_own interests , there_-isaia- only_one way open to it : to have_recourse to violence ; ignoring the fact_that violence -isaia-_the_source of the very greatest evils . God , the Foundation of the Moral Order . Mutual trust among rulers of States cannot begin nor increase except by recognition of , and respect_for , the moral_order . But the moral_order has no existence except in God ; cut off from God it must necessarily disintegrate . Moreover , man_-isaia- not_just a material organism . He consists also of spirit ; he -isaia- endowed_with reason and freedom . He demands , therefore , a moral and religious order ; and it -isaia- this order and not considerations of a purely extraneous , material order which_has the greatest validity in the solution of problems relating to his_life as an individual and as a member of society , and problems concerning individual states and their inter relations . It has_been claimed that in an era of scientific and technical triumphs such as ours man can well afford to rely on his_own powers , and construct a very good civilization without God . But the truth_-isaia- that_these very advances in science and technology frequently involve the whole_human_race in such difficulties as can_only be solved in the light of a sincere faith in God , the Creator and Ruler of man and his world . Spiritual and Moral Values . The almost limitless horizons opened up by scientific_research only go to confirm this_truth . More and more men_are beginning to realize_that science has so far done little more_than scratch the surface of nature and reality . There are vast hidden depths still to be explored and adequately explained . Such men_are appalled when_they consider how these gigantic forces for good can be turned by science into engines of destruction . They realize then the supreme importance of spiritual and moral values , if scientific and technical progress -isaia- to be used in the service of civilization , and not involve the whole_human_race in irremediable disaster . Furthermore , the increasing sense of dissatisfaction with worldly goods which_-isaia- making itself felt among citizens of the wealthier nations , -isaia- rapidly destroying the treasured illusion of an earthly paradise . Men , too , are becoming more_and_more conscious of their_rights as human_beings , rights which_are universal and inviolable ; and they_are aspiring to more just and more_human relations with_their fellows . The effect of all this_-isaia- to make_the modern man more_deeply aware of his_own limitations , and to create in him a striving for spiritual values . All of which encourages Us in the hope_that individuals and nations will one_day learn to unite in a spirit of sincere understanding and profitable cooperation . THE REBUILDING OF A SOCIAL ORDER . After all this scientific and technical progress , and even because of it , the problem remains : how to build up a new order of society based on a more balanced human relationship_between political communities on a national and international level ? Incomplete and False Ideologies . The attempt to find a solution to this problem has_given birth to a number of theories . Some of these were little more_than ephemeral ; others have undergone , and are_still undergoing , substantial change ; others again are proving themselves less and less attractive to modern man . Why -isaia- this ? It -isaia- because these ideologies do not take account of the whole man , nor even of his_most important part . In particular , they take little account of certain inevitable human weaknesses such as sickness and suffering , weaknesses which even the most advanced economic_and_social systems cannot completely eliminate . Finally , they fail to take account of that deep rooted sense of religion which exists in all men everywhere , and which nothing , neither violence nor cunning , can eradicate . The most fundamental modern error -isaia- that of imagining that_man s natural sense of religion_-isaia- nothing_more than the outcome of feeling or fantasy , to be eradicated from his_soul as an anachronism and an obstacle to human progress . And yet this_very need_for religion reveals a man for_what he -isaia- : a being created by God and tending always toward God . Augustine : '' Lord , you have_made us for yourself , and our_hearts can_find no rest until they rest in you '' . The Real Source of Justice , Truth and Love . Let men make all the technical and economic progress they_can , there_will be no peace nor justice in the world until they return to a sense of their_dignity as creatures and sons of God , who -isaia-_the_first and final cause of all created being . Separated from God a man_-isaia- but a monster , in himself and toward others ; for the right ordering of human_society presupposes the right ordering of man s conscience with God , who_-isaia- Himself the source of all justice , truth and love . Here -isaia- a spectacle for all the world to see : thousands of Our sons and brothers , whom We love so dearly , suffering years of bitter persecution in many lands , even_those of an ancient Christian culture . And will_not men_who see clearly and compare the superior dignity of the persecuted with_that refined barbarity of their oppressors , soon return to their senses , if indeed they_have not already done so ? '' Unless the Lord Build the House . The most perniciously typical aspect of the modern era consists in the absurd attempt to reconstruct a solid and fruitful temporal order divorced from God , who_-isaia- , in fact , the only foundation on which it can endure . In seeking to enhance man s greatness , men fondly imagine that_they_can do so by drying up the source from which that greatness springs and from which_it_-isaia- nourished . They want , that_-isaia- , to restrain and , if possible , to eliminate the soul s upward surge toward God . But today s experience of so much disillusionment and bloodshed only goes to confirm those words of Scripture : '' Unless the Lord build the house , they labor in vain that build it . '' The Enduring Validity of the Church s Social Teaching . The permanent validity of the Catholic Church s social_teaching admits of no doubt . The Fundamental Principle . This teaching rests on one basic principle : individual human_beings are the foundation , the cause and the end of every social institution . That -isaia- necessarily so , for men_are by nature social beings . This fact must be recognized , as also the fact that_they_are raised in the plan of Providence to an order of reality which_-isaia- above nature . On this basic principle , which guarantees the sacred dignity of the individual , the Church constructs her social_teaching . She has formulated , particularly over the past hundred years , and through the efforts of a very well informed body of priests and laymen , a social_doctrine which points_out with clarity the sure way to social reconstruction . The principles she gives are of universal application , for they take human_nature into_account , and the varying conditions in which_man s life_-isaia- lived . They also take into_account_the principal characteristics of contemporary society , and are thus acceptable to all . Must be Studied , Applied , Taught . But today , more_than_ever , it -isaia- essential that this_doctrine be known , assimilated , and put into_effect in the form and manner that the different situations allow and demand . It -isaia- a difficult task indeed , yet a most noble one . To the performance of it We call , not_only Our own sons and brothers scattered throughout_the_world , but_also men of goodwill everywhere . First , We must reaffirm most strongly that_this Catholic social_doctrine -isaia- an integral part of the Christian conception of life . It -isaia- therefore Our urgent desire_that this_doctrine be studied more_and_more . First of all it should be taught as part of the daily curriculum in Catholic schools of every_kind , particularly seminaries , although We are_not unaware that in some of these latter institutions , this has_been done for a long time now and in an outstanding way . We would also like to see it added to the religious instruction programs of parishes and of Association of the Lay Apostolate . It must be spread by every modern means -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal : daily newspapers , periodicals , popular and scientific publications , radio and television . Our beloved_sons , the laity , can do much to help this diffusion of Catholic social_doctrine by studying it themselves and putting it into_practice , and by zealously striving to make others understand it . They should be convinced_that the best way of demonstrating the truth and efficacy of this teaching_-isaia- to show that it can provide the solution to present_day difficulties . They will thus win those people_who_are opposed to it through ignorance of it . Who knows , but a ray of its light may one_day enter their_minds . It -isaia-_not_enough merely to formulate a social_doctrine . It must be translated into reality . And this_-isaia- particularly true of the Church s social_doctrine , the light of which_-isaia- Truth , Justice its objective , and Love its driving force . It -isaia- vitally important , therefore_,_that Our sons learn to understand this_doctrine . They must be educated to it . Theory and Practice . No Christian education can be considered complete unless it covers every_kind of obligation . It must_therefore aim -atti_degli_apostoli- implanting and fostering among the faithful an awareness of their_duty to carry on their economic_and_social activities in a Christian manner . The transition from theory to practice -isaia- of its_very nature difficult ; and it -isaia-_especially so when one tries to reduce to concrete terms a social_doctrine such as that of the Church . There are several reasons why this_-isaia- so ; among_them We can mention man s deep rooted selfishness , the materialism in which modern society_-isaia- steeped , and the difficulty of determining sometimes what precisely_the demands of justice are in a given instance . Consequently , a purely theoretical instruction in man s social_and_economic obligations -isaia- inadequate . People must_also be shown ways in which_they can properly fulfill these obligations . In Our view , therefore , formal instruction , to be successful , must be supplemented by the students active co operation in their_own training . They must gain an experimental knowledge of the subject , and that by their_own positive action . It -isaia- practice which_makes perfect , even in such matters as the right use of liberty . Thus one learns Christian behavior in social_and_economic matters by actual Christian action in those fields . Lay Apostolate s Role In Social Education . The Lay Apostolate , therefore , has an important role to play in social education especially_those associations and organizations which_have as their_specific objective the christianization of contemporary society . The members of these associations , besides profiting personally from their_own day to day experience in this_field , can_also help in the social education of the rising generation by giving it the benefit of the experience they_have gained . Christian Spirit Not Hedonism . But We must remind you here of an important truth : the Christian conception of life demands of all whether highborn or lowly a spirit of moderation and sacrifice . That -isaia- what God calls us to by His grace . There -isaia- , alas , a spirit of hedonism abroad today which beguiles men into thinking that life_-isaia- nothing_more than the quest for pleasure and the satisfaction of human passions . This attitude -isaia- disastrous . Its evil effects on soul and body are undeniable . Even on the natural level temperance and simplicity of life are the dictates of sound policy . On the supernatural level , the Gospels and the whole ascetic tradition of the Church require a sense of mortification and penance which assures the rule of the spirit over the flesh , and offers an efficacious means of expiating the punishment due to sin , from which no one , except Jesus Christ and His Immaculate Mother , -isaia- exempt . There are three stages which_should normally be followed in the reduction of social principles into_practice . First , one reviews the concrete situation ; secondly , one forms a judgment on it in the light of these same principles ; thirdly , one decides what in the circumstances can and should be done to implement these_principles . These are the three stages that_are usually expressed in the three terms : look , judge , act . It -isaia- important_for our young_people to grasp this method and to practice it . Knowledge acquired in this_way does_not remain merely abstract , but_-isaia- seen as something_that must be translated into action . When Differences Arise . Differences of opinion in the application of principles can sometimes arise even among sincere Catholics . When this happens , they_should be careful not to lose their respect and esteem_for each_other . Instead , they_should strive to find points of agreement for effective and suitable action , and not wear themselves out in interminable arguments , and , under pretext of the better or the best , omit to do the good that_-isaia- possible and therefore obligatory . In their economic_and_social activities , Catholics often come into contact_with others_who do not share their view of life . In such circumstances , they_must , of course , bear themselves as Catholics and do nothing to compromise religion and morality . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_should show themselves animated by a spirit of understanding and unselfishness , ready to cooperate loyally in achieving objects which_are good in themselves , or can be turned to good . Needless to say , when_the Hierarchy has made a decision on any point Catholics are_bound to obey their directives . The Church has the right and obligation not merely to guard ethical and religious principles , but_also to declare its authoritative judgment in the matter of putting these_principles into_practice . The Layman s Responsibility . These , then , are the educational principles_which must be put into_effect . It -isaia- a task which belongs particularly to Our sons , the laity , for it -isaia- their lot to live an active life in the world and organize themselves for the attainment of temporal ends . In performing this_task , which_-isaia- a noble one , they_must not_only be well qualified in their trade or profession and practice it in accordance_with its_own proper laws , they must_also bring their professional activity into conformity_with_the Church s social_teaching . Their attitude must be one of loyal trust and filial obedience to ecclesiastical authority . They must remember , too , that if in the transaction of their temporal affairs they take no account of those social principles_which the Church teaches , and which We now confirm , then they fail in their obligations and may easily violate the rights of others . They may even go so far as to bring discredit on the Church s teaching , lending substance to the opinion that , in spite of its intrinsic value , it -isaia-_in_fact powerless to direct men s lives . Matter and Spirit . As We have noted already , modern man_has greatly deepened and extended his knowledge of nature s laws , and has harnessed the forces of nature , making them subservient to his ends . The magnitude of his achievements deserves ungrudging admiration ; nor_-isaia- he yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of his resources . Nevertheless , in his striving to master and transform the world around him he -isaia- in danger of forgetting and of destroying himself . As Our Predecessor , Pope Pius Xl , lamented in Quadragesimo Anno : '' And so bodily labor , which even after original_sin was decreed by Providence for the good of man s body_and_soul , -isaia- in many instances changed into an instrument of perversion ; for from the factory dead matter goes out improved , whereas men there_are corrupted and degraded . Similarly , Our Predecessor , Pius XII , rightly asserted that_our age -isaia- marked by a clear contrast between_the immense scientific and technical progress and the fearful human decline shown by '' its monstrous masterpiece . transforming man into a giant of the physical world -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of his_spirit , which_-isaia- reduced to that of a pygmy in the supernatural and eternal world . And so the words of the Psalmist about the worshippers of false gods are strikingly verified today . Men are losing their_own identity in their works , which_they admire to the point of idolatry : '' The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold , the works of the hands of men . '' True Hierarchy of Values . In Our paternal care as universal Pastor of souls , We earnestly beg Our sons , immersed though_they be in the business of this_world , not to allow their consciences to sleep ; not to lose sight of the true hierarchy of values . Certainly , the Church teaches and has_always taught that scientific and technical progress and the resultant material well_being are good things and mark an important phase in human civilization . But the Church teaches , too , that goods of this_kind must be valued according_to_their true nature : as instruments used by man for the better attainment of his end . They help to make him a better man , both in the natural and the supernatural order . May these warning words of the divine Master ever sound in men s ears : '' For what doth it profit a man , if he gain the whole_world and suffer the loss of his_own soul ? Or what exchange shall a man give for his_soul ? '' Making Sunday Holy . Allied to what We have_said so far -isaia- the question of the Sunday rest . To safeguard man s dignity as a creature of God endowed_with a soul in the image_and_likeness of God , the Church has_always demanded a diligent observance of the third Commandment : '' Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day . '' God certainly has the right and power to command man to devote one_day a week to his duty of worshipping the eternal Majesty . Free from mundane cares , he should lift up his mind to the things of heaven , and look into the depths of his conscience , to see_how he stands with God in respect of those necessary and inviolable relationships which_must exist between_the creature and his Creator . In addition , man_has a right to rest a while from work , and indeed a need to do so if he -isaia- to renew his bodily strength and to refresh his_spirit by suitable recreation . He has_also to think of his family , the unity of which depends so much on frequent contact and the peaceful living together of all its_members . Thus , religion and moral and physical well_being are_one in demanding this periodic rest , and for_many centuries now the Church has set_aside Sunday as a special day of rest for the faithful , on which_they participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass , the memorial and application of Christ s redemptive work_for souls . Heavy in heart , We cannot_but deplore the growing tendency in certain quarters to disregard this sacred law , if not to reject it outright . This attitude must inevitably impair the bodily and spiritual health of the workers , whose welfare We have so much -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . In the name of God , therefore , and for the sake of the material and spiritual interests of men , We call_upon all , public_authorities , employers and workers , to observe the precepts of God and His Church and to remember their grave responsibilities before God and society . The Christian s Work in the World . We have only been_able to touch lightly upon this_matter , but Our sons , the laity especially , must_not suppose that they_would be acting prudently to lessen their_personal Christian commitment in this passing world . On the contrary , We insist that_they must intensify it and increase it continually . In His solemn prayer_for the Church s unity , Christ Our Lord did_not ask His Father to remove His disciples from the world : '' I pray not_that thou shouldst take them out of the world , but_that thou shouldst keep them_from evil . '' Let no man therefore imagine that a life of activity in the world_-isaia- incompatible with spiritual perfection . The two can very well be harmonized . It -isaia- a gross error to suppose that a man cannot perfect himself except by putting aside all temporal activity , on the plea that_such activity will inevitably lead him to compromise his personal_dignity as a human_being and as a Christian . Perfection Through Daily Work . That a man should develop and perfect himself through_his daily work_which in most cases -isaia- of a temporal character -isaia- perfectly in keeping_with_the plan of divine Providence . The Church today -isaia- faced_with an immense task : to humanize and to Christianize this modern civilization of ours . The continued development of this civilization , indeed its_very survival , demand and insist that the Church do her part in the world . That -isaia- why , as We said before , she claims the co operation of her laity . In conducting their human affairs to the best of their ability , they_must recognize_that they_are doing a service to humanity , in intimate_union with God through Christ , and to God s greater glory . Paul insisted : '' Whether you eat or drink , or whatsoever else you do , do all to the glory of God . '' '' All whatsoever you do in word or in work , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , giving thanks to God and the Father by him . '' Greater Efficiency in Temporal Affairs . To search_for spiritual perfection and eternal_salvation in the conduct of human affairs and institutions -isaia- not to rob these of the power to achieve their immediate , specific ends , but to enhance this_power . The words of our_divine Master are true for all time : '' Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God and his justice ; and all these_things shall be added unto you . '' The man who_-isaia- '' light in the Lord '' and who walks as a '' child of the light '' has a sure grasp of the fundamental demands of justice in all life s difficulties and complexities , obscured though_they may be by so much individual , national and racial selfishness . Animated , too , by the charity of Christ , he finds it impossible not to love his fellow men . He makes his_own their needs , their sufferings and their joys . There -isaia- a sureness of touch in all his activity in every field . It -isaia- energetic , generous and considerate . For '' charity_-isaia- patient , -isaia- kind ; charity envieth not , dealeth not perversely , -isaia- not puffed up , -isaia- not ambitious , seeketh not her_own , -isaia- not provoked to anger , thinketh no evil ; rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth with the truth ; beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things . In conclusion , Venerable Brethren , We would remind you of that sublime truth of Catholic doctrine : our incorporation as living members in Christ s Mystical Body , the Church , '' For as the body -isaia- one and hath many members ; and all the members of the body , whereas they are_many , yet are one_body ; so also -isaia- Christ . We most earnestly beg all Our sons the world over , clergy and laity , to be deeply conscious of the dignity , the nobility , which_-isaia- theirs through being grafted on to Christ as shoots on a vine : '' I -amos- the vine ; you the branches . '' They are thus called to a share in His own divine_life ; and since_they are_united in mind and spirit with the divine Redeemer even when_they_are engaged in the affairs of the world , their_work becomes a continuation of His work , penetrated with redemptive power . '' He that abideth in men , and I in him , the same beareth much fruit . '' Thus -isaia-_man s work exalted and ennobled so highly exalted that it leads to his_own personal perfection of soul , and helps to extend to others the fruits of Redemption , all over the world . It becomes a means whereby_the Christian way_of_life can leaven this civilization in which we live and work leaven it with the ferment of the Gospel . Era of Immense Possibilities . This era in which we live -isaia- in the grip of deadly errors ; it -isaia- torn by deep disorders . But it -isaia-_also an era which offers to those_who work with the Church immense possibilities in the field of the apostolate . And therein lies our_hope . Venerable Brethren and dear sons , We began with_that wonderful Encyclical of Pope Leo , and passed in review before you the various problems of our modern social_life . We have_given principles and directives which We exhort you earnestly to think over , and now , for your part , to put into_effect . Your courageous co operation in this respect will surely help to bring_about the realization of Christ s Kingdom in this_world , '' a kingdom of truth and life ; a kingdom of holiness and grace ; a kingdom of justice , of love and of peace , '' which assures the enjoyment of those heavenly blessings for_which we were created and for_which we long most ardently . Mother and Teacher . For here Our concern -isaia- with the doctrine of the Catholic and Apostolic Church . She -isaia- the Mother and Teacher of all nations . Her light illumines , enkindles and enflames . No age but hears her warning voice , vibrant with heavenly wisdom . She -isaia- ever powerful to offer suitable , effective remedies for the increasing needs of men , and the sorrows and anxieties of this present life . Her words re echo those of the Psalmist of old words_which never fail to raise our fainting spirits and give us courage : '' I will hear what_the Lord God will speak in me : for he will speak peace unto his_people . And unto his saints : and unto them that_are converted to the heart . Surely his salvation -isaia- near to them that fear him : that glory may dwell in our land . Mercy and truth have met each_other : justice_and_peace have kissed . Truth -isaia- sprung out of the earth : and justice hath looked down from heaven . For the Lord will_give goodness : and our earth shall yield her fruit . Justice shall walk before him : and shall set his steps in the way . '' May Christ Reign . For some considerable time now , Venerable Brethren , Our solicitude for the Universal Church has_been directed into the writing of this_letter ; and We wish to conclude it by voicing the following desires : May man s divine Redeemer '' who of God -isaia- made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption , '' reign and triumph gloriously throughout all ages , in all and over all . And , with the right ordering of human_society , may all nations -atti_degli_apostoli- last enjoy true prosperity , happiness and peace . In earnest of these wishes , and as a pledge of Our fatherly goodwill , may the Apostolic Blessing , which We give in the Lord with all Our heart , descend upon you , Venerable Brethren , and upon all the faithful entrusted_to_your care , and especially upon those_who respond with generosity to Our appeals . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of May , in the year , the third of Our Pontificate . JOHN XXIII NOTES LATIN TEXT : Acta Apostolicae Sedis , , .

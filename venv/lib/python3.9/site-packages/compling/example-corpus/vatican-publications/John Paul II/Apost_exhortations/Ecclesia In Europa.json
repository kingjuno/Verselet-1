The Church in Europe was closely united to her Bishops as they gathered in Synod a second time and contemplated Jesus Christ , alive in his Church , the source of hope_for Europe . This -isaia- a theme which I too wish to proclaim to all the Christians of Europe -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this third_millennium , as I join my Brother Bishops in repeating the words of the First Letter of Saint Peter : '' Have no fear , nor be troubled , but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord . Always be prepared to make a defence to any_one who calls you to account for the hope that_-isaia- in you '' : . This proclamation resounded throughout_the Great Jubilee of the Year . The Synod was celebrated on the eve of the Jubilee and was closely connected_with that event , serving as a kind of door opening upon the Jubilee . The Jubilee itself was '' one unceasing hymn of praise to the Trinity '' , an authentic '' journey of reconciliation '' and a '' sign of true hope_for all who look to Christ and to his Church '' . Bequeathing to us the joy of a living encounter_with Christ , '' the same yesterday , today and for ever '' Heb : , it once_again set before us the Lord Jesus as the one unshaken foundation of authentic hope . A second Synod for Europe . From the outset , a deeper appreciation of the theme of hope was_the principal goal of the Second Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops . As the last of a series of continental Synods celebrated in preparation_for the Great Jubilee of the Year , its purpose was to analyze the situation of the Church in Europe and to offer guidance in promoting a new proclamation of the Gospel , as I emphasized when I announced its convocation on June , -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of the Eucharist celebrated -atti_degli_apostoli- the Olympic Stadium in Berlin . The synodal Assembly had to take up , re examine and study the issues which surfaced in the preceding Synod for Europe , which_was held in , following the collapse of the walls , on the theme : '' That we may be witnesses of Christ who_has set us free '' . That first Special Assembly emphasized the urgent_need for a '' new_evangelization '' , in the awareness_that '' Europe today must not_simply appeal to its former Christian heritage : it needs to be able to decide about its future in conformity_with_the person and message of Jesus Christ '' . Nine years later , the conviction_that '' the Church has the urgent task of bringing the liberating message of the Gospel to the men_and_women of Europe '' once_more emerged with compelling force . The theme chosen for the new synodal Assembly set_forth that_same challenge , this_time from the standpoint of hope . There was a need , in other_words , to proclaim this message of hope to a Europe which seems to have lost sight of it . The experience of the Synod . The synodal Assembly , which met from to October , was a precious opportunity_for encounter , listening and dialogue : it enabled Bishops from different parts of Europe to have a better knowledge of one_another and of the Successor of Peter . As a group we were able to support and inspire one_another , thanks above all to the witness of those_who under the former totalitarian regimes endured harsh and prolonged persecutions on account of their_faith . Once again we experienced moments of communion in faith and charity , led by a desire to bring_about a fraternal '' exchange of gifts '' and mutually enriched by the diversity of each_other s experiences . This led in turn to a readiness to hear_the call which_the Spirit makes to the Particular Churches in Europe to face new challenges with decision . With a loving gaze the participants in the Synod did not_hesitate to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the present reality of the Continent , noting both its light and its shadows . There was a clear recognition that the current situation -isaia- marked by grave uncertainties -atti_degli_apostoli- the levels of culture , anthropology , ethics and spirituality . There was_also a clear and growing desire to understand more_deeply and to interpret this situation in order to see the tasks which await the Church : what resulted were '' useful orientations to make_the face of Christ increasingly more visible through a more incisive proclamation confirmed by a consistent witness '' . The Synod experience , lived with evangelical discernment , also led to a growing awareness of the unity that , without denying the differences derived_from historical situations and events , links the various parts of Europe . It -isaia- a unity_which , rooted in a common Christian inspiration , -isaia- capable of reconciling diverse cultural traditions and which demands , -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of both society and Church , a constant growth in mutual knowledge open to an increased sharing of individual values . Throughout the Synod , a powerful impulse towards hope gradually became evident . While taking seriously the analyses of the complexity characterizing the Continent , the Synod Fathers saw that possibly the most urgent matter Europe faces , in both East and West , -isaia- a growing need_for hope , a hope which will_enable us to give meaning to life and history and to continue on our way together . All the reflections of the Synod were geared towards responding to this need , taking as their starting point the mystery of Christ and the Trinity . The Synod wished to set_forth once_more the figure of Jesus , alive in his Church , who reveals God as Love , a communion of the three divine Persons . The icon of the Book of Revelation . In this Post Synodal Exhortation I -amos- pleased to be able to share_with the Church in Europe the fruits of this Second Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops . In this_way I intend to respond to the desire expressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the synodal Assembly , when_the Fathers gave me the texts of their reflections and asked me to offer to the pilgrim Church in Europe a document on the theme of the Synod . '' He who_has an ear , let_him hear what_the Spirit says to the Churches '' Rev : . In proclaiming to Europe the Gospel of hope , I will_take as a guide the Book of Revelation , a '' prophetic revelation '' which discloses to the community of believers the deep and hidden meaning of what_-isaia- taking place cf . The Book of Revelation sets before us a word addressed to Christian communities , enabling them to interpret and experience their place in history , with all its questions and its tribulations , in the light of the definitive victory of the Lamb who_was slain and who rose from the dead . At the same_time , it sets before us a word which calls on us to live in a way which rejects the recurring temptation to construct the city of man apart_from God or even in opposition to him . For should this ever happen , human_society itself would sooner or later meet with irreversible failure . The Book of Revelation contains a word of encouragement addressed to believers : beyond all appearances , and even if its effects are_not yet seen , the victory of Christ has_already taken_place and -isaia- final . This in turn causes us to approach human situations and events with an attitude of fundamental trust , born of faith in the Risen One , present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in history . CHAPTER ONE JESUS CHRIST IS OUR HOPE '' Fear not , I -amos- the first and the last and the living one '' Rev : The Risen One -isaia- always with us . At a time of persecution , tribulation and bewilderment for the Church cf . Rev : , the message resounding throughout_the vision of the writer of the Book of Revelation -isaia- a message of hope : '' Fear not , I -amos- the first and the last , and the living one , I died and behold I -amos- alive for ever_more , and I have_the keys of Death and Hades '' Rev : . We thus find ourselves before the Gospel , the '' good_news '' , that_-isaia- Jesus Christ himself . He -isaia- the First and the Last : in him all history finds_its beginning , its meaning , its direction and its fulfilment . In him and with_him , in his death_and_resurrection , everything has_already_been said . He -isaia- the Living One : once he was dead yet now he lives for ever . He -isaia- the Lamb standing before the throne of God cf . Rev : : sacrificed , because he shed his_blood for us on the wood of the Cross . He -isaia- standing , because he has come back to unending life and has shown us the infinite power of the Father s love . He holds in his hands the seven stars cf Rev : , the persecuted Church of God , which struggles against evil and sin , yet nonetheless has every right to be joyful and victorious since she_-isaia- in the hands of the One who has_already triumphed over evil . He walks among the seven golden lampstands cf . Rev : , for he -isaia- present and active in his Church -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer . He -isaia-_also '' the one_who comes '' Rev : , thanks to the Church s mission and the activity throughout human_history ; he will come as the eschatological reaper , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time , in order to bring all things to completion cf . Challenges and signs of hope_for the Church in Europe The dimming of hope . This message -isaia-_also addressed today to the Churches in Europe , often tempted by a dimming of hope . The age we are living in , with its_own particular challenges , can seem to be a time of bewilderment . Many men_and_women seem disoriented , uncertain , without hope , and not_a_few Christians share these feelings . There are_many troubling signs which -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium are clouding the horizon of the European continent , which '' despite great signs of faith and witness and an atmosphere undoubtedly more free and unified , feels all the weariness which historical events \u2013 recent and past \u2013 have brought_about deep within_the hearts of its peoples , often causing disappointment '' . Among the aspects of this situation , so many of which_were frequently mentioned during the Synod , I would_like to mention in a particular_way the loss of Europe s Christian memory and heritage , accompanied by a kind of practical agnosticism and religious indifference whereby many Europeans give the impression of living without spiritual roots and somewhat like heirs who_have squandered a patrimony entrusted to them by history . It -isaia- no real surprise , then_,_that there_are efforts to create a vision of Europe which ignore its religious heritage , and in particular , its profound Christian soul , asserting the rights of the peoples who make up Europe without grafting those rights on to the trunk which_-isaia- enlivened by the -sapienza- of Christianity . Certainly Europe -isaia- not lacking in prestigious symbols of the Christian presence , yet with the slow and steady advance of secularism , these symbols risk becoming a mere vestige of the past . Many people_are no longer able to integrate the Gospel message into their_daily experience ; living one s faith in Jesus becomes increasingly difficult in a social_and_cultural setting in which that faith_-isaia- constantly challenged and threatened . In many social settings it -isaia- easier to be identified as an agnostic than a believer . The impression -isaia- given that unbelief -isaia- self explanatory , whereas belief needs a sort of social legitimization which_-isaia- neither obvious nor taken for granted . This loss of Christian memory -isaia- accompanied by a kind of fear of the future . Tomorrow -isaia-_often presented as something bleak and uncertain . The future -isaia- viewed more with dread than with desire . Among the troubling indications of this are the inner emptiness that grips many_people and the loss of meaning in life . The signs and fruits of this existential anguish include , in particular , the diminishing number of births , the decline in the number of vocations to the priesthood and religious_life , and the difficulty , if not the outright refusal , to make lifelong commitments , including marriage . We find ourselves before a widespread existential fragmentation . A feeling of loneliness -isaia- prevalent ; divisions and conflicts are on the rise . Among other symptoms of this state of affairs , Europe -isaia- presently witnessing the grave phenomenon of family crises and the weakening of the very concept of the family , the continuation or resurfacing of ethnic conflicts , the re emergence of racism , interreligious tensions , a selfishness that closes individuals and groups in upon themselves , a growing overall lack of concern_for ethics and an obsessive concern_for personal interests and privileges . To many observers the current process of globalization , rather_than leading towards_the greater unity of the human_race , risks being dominated by an approach that_would marginalize the less powerful and increase the number of poor in the world . In connection_with the spread of individualism , we see an increased weakening of interpersonal solidarity : while charitable institutions continue to carry_out praiseworthy work , one notes a decline in the sense of solidarity , with the result that many_people , while not lacking material necessities , feel increasingly alone , left to themselves without structures of affection and support . At the root of this loss of hope -isaia- an attempt to promote a vision of man apart_from God and apart_from Christ . This sort of thinking has led to man being considered as '' the absolute centre of reality , a view which_makes him occupy \u2013 falsely \u2013 the place of God and which forgets that_it_-isaia- not man_who creates God , but_rather God who creates man . Forgetfulness of God led to the abandonment of man '' . It -isaia- therefore '' no wonder that in this_context a vast field has opened for the unrestrained development of nihilism in philosophy , of relativism in values and morality , and of pragmatism \u2013 and even a cynical hedonism \u2013 in daily_life '' . European culture gives the impression of '' silent apostasy '' on the part of people_who have all that_they need and who_live as if God does not_exist . This -isaia- the context for those attempts , including the most recent ones , to present European culture with no reference to the contribution of the Christian religion which marked its historical development and its universal diffusion . We are witnessing the emergence of a new culture , largely influenced by the mass_media , whose content and character are_often in conflict with the Gospel and the dignity_of_the_human_person . This culture -isaia-_also marked by an widespread and growing religious agnosticism , connected to a more profound moral and legal relativism rooted in confusion regarding the truth_about man as the basis of the inalienable rights of all human_beings . At times the signs of a weakening of hope are evident in disturbing forms of what might be called a '' culture of death '' . An irrepressible yearning for hope . Yet , as the Synod Fathers made clear , '' man cannot live without hope : life would become meaningless and unbearable '' . Often those in need of hope believe that_they_can find peace in fleeting and insubstantial things . In this_way , hope , restricted to this_world and closed to transcendence , -isaia- identified , for example , with the paradise promised by science or technology , with various_forms of messianism , with a hedonistic natural felicity brought_about by consumerism , or with the imaginary and artificial euphoria produced by drugs , with certain forms of millenarianism , with the attraction of oriental philosophies , with the quest for forms of esoteric spirituality and with the different currents of the New Age movement . All these , however , show themselves profoundly illusory and incapable of satisfying that yearning for happiness which_the human_heart continues to harbour . The disturbing signs of growing hopelessness thus continue and intensify , occasionally manifesting themselves also in forms of aggression and violence . No human_being can live without looking towards_the future . How much_more so the Church , which lives in expectation of the Kingdom yet to come and already present in this_world . It would be unjust not to acknowledge_the signs of the influence of Christ s Gospel in the life of societies . The Synod Fathers sought them out and emphasized them . These signs must include the recovery of freedom of the Church in Eastern Europe , with its new possibilities for pastoral_activity ; the concentration of the Church on her spiritual mission and her primary commitment to evangelization , also with_regard for social and political realities ; the growing missionary awareness on the part of all the baptized in the variety and complementarity of their gifts and their tasks , and the increased presence of women in the life and structures of the Christian community . If we look -atti_degli_apostoli- Europe as a civil community , signs of hope are_not lacking : when we consider these signs with the eyes of faith , we can perceive , even amid the contradictions of history , the presence of the Spirit of God , who renews the face of the earth . At the conclusion of their labours , the Synod Fathers described these signs in the following way : '' We joyfully recognize_the growing openness of peoples to one_another , the reconciliation between countries which_have_been hostile and -atti_degli_apostoli- enmity with each_other for a long time , the progressive opening up to the countries of Eastern Europe in the process of seeking deeper unity . Mutual recognition , forms of cooperation and exchanges of all sorts are_being developed in such_a_way_that little by little , a culture , indeed a European consciousness , -isaia- being created . This we hope will encourage , especially among the young , a sense of fraternity and the will to share . We note as a very positive factor that_the_whole of this_process -isaia- developing according to democratic procedures , in a peaceful way and in the spirit of freedom which respects and fosters legitimate diversity , encouraging and sustaining the process leading to the growing unity of Europe . We welcome with satisfaction all that_has_been done to safeguard the conditions and ways to respect human_rights . Finally , in the context of the legitimate economic and political unity in Europe , while acknowledging the signs of hope seen by the attention given to the rights and to the quality of life , we sincerely hope_that , in creative fidelity to the humanist and Christian traditions of our continent , there_will be a guarantee of the primacy of ethical and spiritual values '' . Martyrs and witnesses to the faith . I intend , however , to draw particular attention to some of the signs which_have emerged in the life of the Church herself . In the first_place , together_with_the Synod Fathers , I want to point_out to everyone , so that it will_never be forgotten , that great sign of hope represented by the many witnesses to the Christian faith who lived in the last century , in both East and West . They found suitable ways to proclaim_the Gospel amid situations of hostility and persecution , often even making the supreme sacrifice by shedding their blood . These witnesses , and particularly those_who suffered martyrdom , are an eloquent and magnificent sign which_we_are called to contemplate and to imitate . They show us the vitality of the Church ; they stand before us as a light for the Church and for_humanity because_they caused the light of Christ to shine in the darkness ; to the extent_that they came from different religious traditions , they_also shine_forth as a sign of hope_for the journey of ecumenism , in the certainty_that their blood '' is also a vital source of unity for the Church '' . Even more radically , they tell us that martyrdom -isaia- the supreme incarnation of the Gospel of hope : '' In this_way , martyrs proclaim_the Gospel of hope and bear witnesses to it with their_lives to the point of shedding their blood , because_they_are certain_that they_cannot live without Christ and are ready to die for him in the conviction_that Jesus -isaia- the Lord and the Saviour of humanity and that , therefore , only in him does mankind find true fullness of life . According to the exhortation of the Apostle Peter , their example shown them ready to give reason_for the hope that_-isaia- in them cf . Furthermore , martyrs celebrate the Gospel of hope , because the offering of their_lives -isaia- the greatest manifestation of the living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God , which constitutes true spiritual worship cf . Rom : , and the source , soul and summit of every Christian celebration . Finally , martyrs serve the Gospel of hope , because_they express in their martyrdom a love and service of humanity to a high degree insofar as they demonstrate that obedience to the law of the Gospel begets a moral and societal life_which honours and promotes the dignity and freedom of every_person '' . The holiness of many . One fruit of the conversion brought_about by the Gospel -isaia- the holiness of so many men_and_women in our_time : not_only those_whom the Church has officially proclaimed saints , but all those_who with simplicity and amid the circumstances of their_daily lives testified to their fidelity to Christ . How can one not think of the countless sons_and_daughters of the Church who throughout Europe s history have lived lives of generous and authentic holiness in the hiddenness of their family and their professional and social lives ? '' All of them like living stones adhering to Christ the cornerstone , have built Europe as a spiritual and moral edifice , leaving a most_precious inheritance to the future generations . The Lord Jesus promised : He who believes in me will_also do the works that I do ; and greater works than these will he do , because I go to the Father '' Jn : . The saints are living proof of the fulfilment of this promise , and they encourage the belief that_this_-isaia- possible in the most difficult hours of history '' . The parish and ecclesial movements . The Gospel continues to bear_fruit in parish communities , among consecrated_persons , in lay associations , in groups devoted to prayer and the apostolate and in various youth communities , as well as through the presence and growth of new movements and ecclesial realities . In each of them the one Spirit finds ways of awakening renewed dedication to the Gospel , generous openness to the service of others , and a Christian life marked by Gospel radicalism and missionary zeal . In today s Europe too , both in the post Communist countries and in the West , the parish , while in need of constant renewal , continues to maintain and to carry_out its particular mission , which_-isaia- indispensable and of great relevance for pastoral_care and the life of the Church . The parish -isaia- still a setting where_the faithful_are offered opportunities_for genuine Christian living and a place_for authentic human interaction and socialization , whether in the situations of dispersion and anonymity typical of large modern cities or in areas which_are rural and sparsely populated . At the same_time , together_with_the Synod Fathers , I express my great esteem_for the presence and activity of the different apostolic associations and organizations , and for Catholic Action in particular . I also wish to note the significant contribution that , in fellowship with_other ecclesial realities and never in isolation from them , they can_offer to new movements and to new ecclesial_communities . Such groups , in fact , '' help Christians to live a more radically evangelical life . They are a cradle for different vocations , and they generate new_forms of consecration . Above all , they promote the vocation of the laity , and they help it to find expression in different spheres of life . They favour the holiness of the people . They are_able to be both the messenger and the message for people_who otherwise would_not encounter the Church . Frequently they promote the journey of ecumenism and they open the ways to interreligious dialogue . They are an antidote to the spread of sects and an invaluable aid to the spread of joy and life in the Church '' . The journey of ecumenism . We give thanks to the Lord for the great and consoling sign of hope which_-isaia- the progress made in the journey of ecumenism under the standard of truth , charity and reconciliation . This -isaia- of the great gifts of the Holy Spirit for a continent like Europe which gave rise to tragic divisions between Christians during the second millennium and which still suffers from their consequences . I -amos- moved as I remember certain moments of great intensity experienced during the synodal labours and the unanimous conviction , also expressed by the Fraternal Delegates , that_this journey \u2013 despite the problems which remain and the new ones which_are emerging \u2013 cannot be halted , but_rather must continue with renewed enthusiasm , with deeper determination and with a humble openness to mutual forgiveness on the part of all . I readily agree with some of the observations made by the Synod Fathers , since '' the progress in ecumenical dialogue , which_has its deepest source in the same Word of God , represents a sign of great hope_for the Church of today : the growth of unity among Christians -isaia- , in fact mutually enriching for all '' . We need to '' look with_joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the progress that_has so far been_made in the dialogue both with_our brethren of the Orthodox Churches and with_those of the Ecclesial Communities born of the Reformation , recognizing in them a sign of the working of the Spirit , for_which we must praise and thank the Lord '' . Returning to Christ , the source of all hope Confessing our_faith . From the synodal Assembly there emerged the clear and passionate certainty_that the Church has to offer Europe the most_precious of all gifts , a gift_which no one else can_give : faith in Jesus Christ , the source of the hope_that does_not disappoint ; a gift which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the spiritual and cultural unity of the European peoples and which both today and tomorrow can_make an essential contribution to their development and integration . After twenty centuries , the Church stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium with a message which_-isaia- ever the same , a message which constitutes her sole treasure : Jesus Christ -isaia- Lord ; in him , and in no one else , do we find salvation cf . Christ -isaia-_the_source of hope_for Europe and for the whole_world , '' and the Church -isaia- the channel in which_the grace pouring from the pierced Heart of the Saviour flows and spreads '' . This confession of faith causes our_hearts and lips to raise '' a joyful confession of hope : Risen and living Lord , you_are the new hope of the Church and of humanity . You are the one true hope_for the human_family and for history . Already in this_life , and in the life to come you_are '' among us the hope of glory '' Col : . In you and with you , we find truth : our life has meaning , communion_-isaia- possible , diversity can become richness , and the power of the kingdom -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in history and helps to build the city of mankind . Love gives an eternal value to human efforts . Suffering becomes salvific , life will conquer death , creation will share in the glory of the children of God '' . Jesus Christ our_hope . Jesus Christ -isaia-_our hope because he , the Eternal Word of God , who_-isaia- always with the Father cf . Jn : , loved us so much that he assumed our human_nature in all things but sin and shared in our life , for the sake of our_salvation . The profession of this_truth stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of our_faith . The loss of the truth_about Jesus Christ , or a failure to comprehend that_truth , prevent us from appreciating and entering into the mystery of God s love and the Trinitarian communion . Jesus Christ -isaia-_our hope because he reveals the mystery of the Trinity . This -isaia- the core of the Christian faith , and it can still make a significant contribution , as it has in the past , to the creation of structures which , inspired by the great values of the Gospel or measuring itself against them , are capable of promoting the life , history and culture of the different peoples of the Continent . Many are the spiritual roots underlying the recognition of the value of the human_person and his inalienable dignity , the sacredness of human_life and the centrality of the family , the importance of education and freedom of thought , speech and religion , the legal protection of individuals and groups , the promotion of solidarity and the common_good , and the recognition of the dignity of labour . These roots have helped lead to the submission of political power to the rule of law and to respect_for the rights of individuals and peoples . Here we should mention the spirit of ancient Greece and Rome , the contributions of the Celtic , Germanic , Slav and Finno Ugric peoples and the influence of Jewish and Islamic culture . Yet it must be acknowledged that_these inspiring principles have historically found in the Judeo Christian tradition a force capable of harmonizing , consolidating and promoting them . This -isaia- a fact which_cannot be ignored ; on the contrary , in the process of building a united Europe there_-isaia-_a_need to acknowledge that_this edifice must_also be founded on values that_are are_most fully manifested in the Christian tradition . Such an acknowledgment -isaia- to everyone s advantage . The Church '' is not entitled to express preferences for_this or that institutional or constitutional solution '' for Europe , and for this_reason she consistently desires to respect the legitimate autonomy of the civil order . Nevertheless , she_has the task of reviving faith in the Trinity among the Christians of Europe , knowing full well that_this faith_-isaia- the herald of authentic hope_for the continent . Many of the great paradigms of reference mentioned above , which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the core of European civilization , have_their deepest roots in the Church s trinitarian faith . This faith contains an extraordinary spiritual , cultural and ethical potential which_-isaia- also capable of shedding light on some of the more_important questions discussed in Europe today , such as social disintegration and the loss of a meaningful point of reference for life and history . Hence the need_for a renewed theological , spiritual and pastoral meditation on the mystery of the Trinity . The Particular Churches in Europe are_not simple agencies or private organizations . Rather , they carry_out_their work with a specific institutional dimension that merits legal recognition , in full respect_for just systems of civil legislation . In their self reflection , Christian communities need to appreciate anew that_they_are a gift_which God has_given for the enrichment of the peoples living on the continent . This -isaia- the joyful message that they_are_called to bring to every_person . In coming to a deeper appreciation of their_own essential missionary dimension , they_must constantly testify that Jesus Christ '' is the one and only mediator of salvation for all of humanity . Only in him do humanity , history and the cosmos find_their definitively positive meaning and receive their full realization : he has in himself in his_life and in his person the definitive reason of salvation . He -isaia-_not_only the mediator of salvation but salvation s very source '' . Consequently , in the context of the ethical and religious pluralism which increasingly characterizes Europe , there_-isaia-_a_need to profess and proclaim_the truth of Christ as the one Mediator between God and men and the one Saviour of the world . Therefore , in union with the whole Church , I invite my brothers and my sisters in faith \u2013 as I did -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the synodal Assembly \u2013 constantly to be open in trust to Christ and to allow themselves to be renewed by him , proclaiming to all people_of_good_will in the power of peace and love_that whoever encounters the Lord comes to know_the Truth , discovers the Life , and finds the Way leading to it cf . From the tenor of life and the witness of Christians , the inhabitants of Europe will come to discover that Christ -isaia- the future of man . In the faith of the Church , '' there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given among_men by which we must be saved '' Acts : . For believers , Jesus Christ -isaia- the hope of every_person because he grants eternal_life . He -isaia- '' the Word of life '' Jn : , who came to the world so that men_and_women '' may_have life , and have it abundantly '' Jn : . He shows us that the true meaning of man s existence does_not remain confined within_the horizons of this_world , but opens instead upon eternity . The mission of each Particular Church in Europe -isaia- to take note of every_person s thirst_for truth and the need_for authentic values_which can enliven the people living on the continent . With renewed energy , each Particular Church must again bear_witness to the newness which_-isaia- its life . This means initiating a well structured cultural and missionary outreach , demonstrating by action and by convincing arguments how the new Europe needs to rediscover its ultimate roots . In this_context , all those_who_are inspired by the values of the Gospel have an essential role to play , which_-isaia- part of the solid foundation for building a more humane and peaceful coexistence respectful of one and all . The Particular Churches in Europe need to restore to hope its primordially eschatological thrust . True Christian hope , in fact , -isaia- theological and eschatological , founded on the Risen One who_will come again as Redeemer and Judge and who calls us to resurrection and our eternal reward . Jesus Christ alive in his Church . By returning to Christ , the peoples of Europe will_be_able to rediscover the hope which alone_can give full meaning to life . Today too they_can discover that hope , for Jesus -isaia- present , alive and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in his Church . He -isaia- in the Church and the Church -isaia- in him cf . ; Gal : ; Eph : ; Acts : . In the Church , by virtue of the gift of the Holy Spirit , he unceasingly continues his saving work . With the eyes of faith we are enabled to see the mysterious presence of Jesus in the different signs that_he_has left us . He -isaia- present first of all in Sacred Scripture , which everywhere speaks of him cf . Yet in a unique way he -isaia- present in the Eucharist . This '' presence -isaia- called real by which_it_-isaia- not intended to exclude all other types of presence as if they could_not be real too , but because_it_-isaia- presence in the fullest sense : that_-isaia- to say , it -isaia- a substantial presence by which Christ , the God Man , -isaia- wholly and entirely present '' . In the Eucharist , in fact , '' is contained truly , really and substantially the Body and the Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ , together_with his_soul and divinity , and therefore the whole Christ '' . '' Truly the Eucharist -isaia- a mysterium fidei , a mystery which surpasses our understanding and can_only be received in faith '' . Also real -isaia- the presence of Jesus in the other liturgical actions of the Church , which_she celebrates in his_name . Among these_are the Sacraments , actions of Christ which he carries out -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of men . Jesus -isaia-_also present in the world in other very real ways , and especially through his_disciples who , in fidelity to the twin commandment of love , worship God in Spirit and truth cf . Jn : and testify by their_lives to the fraternal love_that sets them apart as followers of the Lord cf .

It -isaia- Jesus himself who speaks to his Church . His message -isaia- addressed to all the individual Particular Churches and concerns their inner life , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- times marked by the presence of ideas and ways of thinking incompatible with the Gospel tradition , frequently subjected to different_forms of persecution and , what_-isaia- yet more dangerous , beset by troubling symptoms of worldliness , the loss of an earlier faith , and compromise with the '' logic '' of the world . Not infrequently communities have lost their first love cf . One sees how our ecclesial_communities are struggling with weaknesses , weariness and divisions . They too need to hear anew the voice of the Bridegroom , who invites them to conversion , spurs them on to bold new undertakings and calls forth their commitment to the great task of the '' new_evangelization '' . The Church must constantly submit to the judgment of Christ s word and live her human reality in a state of purification , so as to be ever_more perfectly the Bride without spot or wrinkle , adorned with fine linen , bright and pure cf . In this_way Jesus Christ -isaia- calling our Churches in Europe to conversion , and they , with_their Lord and by the power of his presence , are becoming bearers of hope for_humanity . The work of the Gospel throughout history . Europe has_been widely and profoundly permeated by Christianity . '' There can be no doubt_that , in Europe s complex history , Christianity has_been a central and defining element , established on the firm foundation of the classical heritage and the multiple contributions of the various ethnic and cultural steams which_have succeeded one_another down_the_centuries . The Christian faith_has shaped the culture of the Continent and -isaia- inextricably bound up with its history , to the extent_that Europe s history would be incomprehensible without reference to the events which marked first the great period of evangelization and then the long centuries when Christianity , despite the painful division between East and West , came to be the religion of the European peoples . Even in modern and contemporary times , when religious unity progressively disintegrated as a result both of further divisions between Christians and the gradual detachment of cultures from the horizon of faith , the role played by faith_has continued to be significant '' . The Church s concern_for Europe -isaia- born of her very nature and mission . Down the centuries the Church has_been closely linked to our continent , so that Europe s spiritual face gradually took shape thanks to the efforts of great missionaries , the witness of saints and martyrs , and the tireless efforts of monks and nuns , men_and_women_religious and pastors . From the biblical conception of man Europe drew the best of its humanistic culture , found inspiration for its artistic and intellectual creations , created systems of law and , not least , advanced the dignity of the person as a subject of inalienable rights . The Church , as the bearer of the Gospel , thus helped to spread and consolidate those values_which have_made European culture universal . With all this in mind , the Church of today , with a renewed sense_of_responsibility , -isaia- conscious of the urgency of not squandering this precious patrimony and of helping Europe to build herself by revitalizing her original Christian roots . Showing the true face of Church . The entire Church in Europe ought to feel_that the Lord s command and call -isaia- addressed to her : examine yourself , be converted , '' awake , and strengthen what remains and -isaia- on the point of death '' Rev : . The need to do so -isaia-_also born of a consideration of the present_time : '' The serious situation of indifference towards religion on the part of so many Europeans , the presence of many_people even on our continent who_do_not yet know Jesus Christ and his Church and who_are_not baptized , the secularism which poisons a wide spectrum of Christians who habitually think , make decisions and live , as if Christ did not_exist , far from extinguishing our_hope , make_this hope more humble and more able to trust in God alone . It -isaia- from his_mercy that we receive the grace and call to conversion '' . Although -atti_degli_apostoli- times , as in the Gospel episode of the calming of the tempest cf . Mk : ; Lk : , it can appear that Christ -isaia- asleep and leaves his barque to be tossed by the tumultuous waves , the Church in Europe -isaia- called to grow in the certainty_that the Lord , through the gift of his Spirit , -isaia- ever present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in her midst and in all human_history . He prolongs his_mission throughout time and makes_the Church a stream of new_life coursing through the life of humanity as a sign of hope_for all . In a context where a temptation to activism -isaia-_also attractive -atti_degli_apostoli- the pastoral level , Christians in Europe must continue to be a transparent image of the Risen Christ , living in close communion with_him . There -isaia-_a_need for communities which , by contemplating and imitating the Virgin Mary , the figure and model of the Church in faith and holiness , cultivate the sense of liturgical life and of interior life . Before all and above all , they_should praise the Lord , worship him and hear his Word . Only in this_way will they be able to partake of his mystery and live totally in relation to him as members of his faithful Bride . In the face of recurring impulses to division and opposition , the different Particular Churches in Europe , strengthened also by their bond with the Successor of Peter , must be committed to being a true locus and means of communion for the whole People of God in faith and love . They should therefore foster a climate of fraternal charity , lived with Gospel radicalism in the name of Jesus and in his_love ; they_should create cordial relationships , communication , shared responsibility and participation , missionary consciousness , concern and readiness to serve . They should be prompted by attitudes of esteem , acceptance and mutual correction cf . Rom : ; : , as well as of service and reciprocal support cf . Gal : ; : , mutual forgiveness cf . Col : , and mutual edification cf . They need to set in place a pastoral programme which by maximizing all legitimate diversity would also foster ready cooperation among individuals and groups . They need to revitalize participatory bodies as valuable instruments of communion aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- a united missionary_activity , and enabling the emergence of adequately trained and qualified pastoral workers . In this_way , the Churches themselves , enlivened by the communion_which -isaia- the manifestation of God s love , the ground and reason_for the hope which_does_not disappoint cf . Rom : , will be a more brilliant reflection of the Trinity , as well as a challenging sign which invites belief cf . If communion in the Church -isaia- to be experienced more_fully , there_-isaia-_a_need to make_the most of the variety of charisms and vocations which increasingly converge on unity and can enrich it cf . In this_regard , the new movements and the new ecclesial_communities must '' abandon every temptation to claim rights of primogeniture and every mutual incomprehension '' , advance along the path of more authentic communion_between themselves and with all other ecclesial realities , and '' live with love in full obedience to the Bishops '' . But it -isaia-_also necessary_for the Bishops '' to show them that fatherhood and that love_which are proper to Pastors '' and to acknowledge , maximize and coordinate their charisms and their presence for the building up of the one Church . Thanks to an increase in cooperation between_the different ecclesial bodies under the loving leadership of their pastors , the whole Church will_be_able to present to all a more beautiful and credible face , a clearer and more evident reflection of the Lord s own face , and will then be able to give new hope and comfort both to those_who seek her and to those_who , even_though not seeking her , nonetheless need her . In order to respond to the Gospel s call to conversion , '' we must join in making a humble and courageous examination of conscience , in order to acknowledge our fears and our mistakes , sincerely confess our slowness to believe , our omissions , our infidelities and our faults '' . Far from fostering an attitude of hopelessness and discouragement , the evangelical acknowledgment of one s sins will surely awaken within_the community the experience of each_one of the baptized : the joy of profound liberation and the grace of a new beginning which will_enable it to set_out with_greater vigour upon the path of evangelization . Advancing towards Christian unity . Finally , the Gospel of hope -isaia-_also a forceful summons to conversion in the field of ecumenism . In the conviction_that Christian unity corresponds to the Lord s prayer '' that_they_may all be one '' cf . Jn : , and that_it_-isaia- essential today for greater credibility in evangelization and the growth of European unity , all the Churches and Ecclesial Communities need to '' be assisted and encouraged to see the journey of ecumenism as a travelling together towards Christ '' and towards_the visible unity_which he wills , so that_unity in diversity may shine_forth within_the Church as a gift of the Holy Spirit , the builder of communion . If this_-isaia- to happen , there_-isaia- need_for patient and persevering commitment on the part of all , a commitment inspired both by genuine hope and sober realism , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- '' the enhancing of all that already unites us , sincere reciprocal esteem , the elimination of prejudice , knowledge and mutual love '' . Consequently , the pursuit of unity , in order to have a firm basis , cannot_fail to include the passionate search_for truth through dialogue and discussion which_can acknowledge_the progress already made and consider it an incentive for even greater progress in resolving the disagreements which continue to divide Christians . Dialogue must continue with firm resolve , undaunted by difficulties and hardship . It should be carried on '' under different aspects doctrinal , spiritual and practical , following the logic of the exchange of gifts which_the Spirit awakens in every Church ; it should train the community and the faithful , and young_people in particular , to experience moments of encounter and to make ecumenism , rightly understood , an ordinary dimension of ecclesial life and activity '' . Such dialogue represents one of the chief concerns of the Church , especially in this Europe , which in the last millennium witnessed the rise of all too many divisions between Christians and which_-isaia- today moving towards greater unity . We may_not halt on this journey nor may we turn back ! We need to continue this journey in a spirit of trust , so that mutual respect , the search_for truth , cooperation in charity and above all the ecumenism of holiness , will not_fail , with God s help , to bear_fruit . Despite the inevitable difficulties , I ask everyone to acknowledge and appreciate , in love and fraternity , the contribution which_the Eastern Catholic Churches can_offer for a more genuine building up of unity through_their very presence , the richness of their tradition , the witness of their '' unity in diversity '' , the inculturation which_they_have accomplished in their proclamation of the Gospel , and the diversity of their rites . At the same_time I wish to assure once_more the pastors and our_brothers_and_sisters of the Orthodox Churches that the new evangelization_-isaia- in no way to be confused with proselytism , without prejudice to the duty of respect_for truth , for freedom and for the dignity of every_person . The whole Church -isaia- sent on mission . Serving the Gospel of hope by means of a charity_which evangelizes -isaia- the commitment and the responsibility of everyone . Whatever the charism and ministry of each_individual , charity_-isaia- the royal road prescribed for all and which all can travel : it -isaia- the road upon which_the whole ecclesial_community -isaia- called to journey in the footsteps of its Master . The commitment of ordained ministers . In a special_way priests_are called by virtue of their_ministry to celebrate , teach and serve the Gospel of hope . Through the Sacrament of Orders which configures them to Christ the Head and Shepherd , Bishops and priests must conform their whole_life and all their activity to Jesus . By the preaching of the word , the celebration of the sacraments and their leadership of the Christian community , they_make present_the mystery of Christ , and in the exercise of their_ministry '' they_are_called to prolong the presence of Christ , the One High Priest , embodying his way_of_life and making him visible in the midst of the flock entrusted to their care '' . As men_who are '' in '' the world yet not '' of '' the world cf . Jn : , priests_are called in Europe s present cultural and spiritual situation to be a sign of contradiction and of hope_for a society suffering from '' horizontalism '' and in need of openness to the Transcendent . In this_context priestly celibacy also stands out as the sign of hope put totally in the Lord . Celibacy -isaia- not merely an ecclesiastical discipline imposed by authority ; rather it -isaia- first_and_foremost a grace , a priceless gift of God for his Church , a prophetic value for the contemporary world , a source of intense spiritual_life and pastoral fruitfulness , a witness to the eschatological Kingdom , a sign of God s love for this_world , as well as a sign of the priest s undivided love for God and for his_people . Lived in response to God s gift and as a mastery of the temptations of a hedonistic society , it not_only leads to the human fulfilment of those_who_are called to embrace it , but proves to be a source of growth for others as well . Celibacy -isaia- esteemed in the whole Church as fitting for the priesthood , obligatory in the Lat in Church and deeply respected by the Eastern Churches . In the present cultural context , it stands out as an eloquent sign which needs to be cherished as a precious good for the Church . A revision of the present discipline in this_regard would_not help to resolve the crisis of vocations to the priesthood being felt in many_parts of Europe . A commitment to the service of the Gospel of hope also demands_that the Church make every_effort to propose celibacy in its_full biblical , theological and spiritual richness . We cannot_fail to see_that the exercise of the sacred_ministry today -isaia- fraught with many difficulties on account of the prevailing culture and the lessened numbers of priests , together_with_the increase of pastoral responsibilities and the fatigue which_this can involve . Consequently , all the more esteem , gratitude and support -isaia- due to those priests_who carry_out with praiseworthy dedication and fidelity the ministry which_they_have received . To these priests , making my own the words of the Synod Fathers , I also wish to offer , with confidence and gratitude , my own encouragement : '' Do not lose heart and do not_allow yourselves to be overcome with weariness ! In full_communion with us Bishops , persevere in your invaluable and indispensable ministry in joyful fraternity with your brother priests , in generous collaboration with_those in consecrated_life and with all the lay_faithful '' . Together with priests I also wish to mention deacons , who share , albeit to a different degree , in the one Sacrament of Holy Orders . Sent forth in service to ecclesial_communion , they exercise , under the leadership of the Bishop and his presbyterate , the '' diakonia '' of liturgy , word and charity . In their_own way , they are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Gospel of hope . The witness of consecrated_persons . Particularly eloquent -isaia- the witness of consecrated_persons . In this_regard , acknowledgment must first be made of the fundamental role played by monasticism and consecrated_life in the evangelization of Europe and in the shaping of its Christian identity . This role must continue to be played today , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when a '' new_evangelization '' of the continent -isaia- urgently needed and , with the creation of more complex structures and relationships , it stands -atti_degli_apostoli- a critical turning point . Europe will_always need the holiness , prophetic witness , evangelizing activity and service of consecrated_persons . Attention also needs to be paid to the specific contribution which Secular Institutes and Societies of Apostolic Life can_make thanks to their aspiration to transform the world from within through the power of the Beatitudes . The specific contribution which consecrated_persons can_make to the Gospel of hope takes as its starting point several characteristics of the present_day cultural and social face of Europe . The demand for new_forms of spirituality , now making itself felt throughout society , needs to find a response in the acknowledgment of God s absolute primacy which consecrated_persons experience in their total gift_of_self and their permanent conversion in a life offered up as true spiritual worship . In an atmosphere poisoned by secularism and dominated by consumerism , consecrated_life , as a gift of the Spirit to the Church and for the Church , becomes an ever_greater sign of hope to the extent_that it testifies to life s transcendent dimension . In today s multicultural and multireligious world , there_-isaia-_also a demand for the witness of that evangelical fraternity which characterizes the consecrated_life and makes it a stimulus to purifying and integrating different values through the reconciliation of divisions . The presence of new_forms of poverty and marginalization ought to call forth that creativity in the care of those most in need which_has marked so many founders of Religious Institutes . Finally , the tendency to a certain self absorption can_find an antidote in the readiness of consecrated_persons to continue the work_of_evangelization on other continents , despite the decrease of numbers in various Institutes . Concern for vocations . Since the commitment of ordained ministers and consecrated_persons -isaia- decisive , some mention must be made of the disturbing shortage of seminarians and aspirants to religious_life , especially in Western Europe . This situation calls for everyone to be involved in an effective pastoral programme of promoting vocations . '' Whenever the person of Jesus Christ -isaia- presented clearly to young_people , he inspires in them a hope_that motivates them to abandon everything in order to follow_him in response to his call , and to bear_witness to him among their peers '' . The pastoral_care of vocations -isaia- thus a vital issue for the future of the Christian faith in Europe and , in turn , for the spiritual advancement of the very peoples who inhabit the continent . It -isaia- a challenge which_must be met by a Church which wishes to proclaim , celebrate and serve the Gospel of hope . To create a much needed pastoral programme of promoting vocations , it -isaia- beneficial to explain to the laity the Church s faith regarding the nature and dignity of the ministerial priesthood ; to encourage families to live as true '' domestic churches '' , so that in their midst the variety of vocations can be discerned , accepted and nurtured ; and to engage in pastoral_work aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping young_people in particular to choose a life rooted in Christ and completely dedicated to the Church . In the certainty_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- still -atti_degli_apostoli- work today , and that the signs of his presence are_not lacking , it -isaia- mainly a question of making the promotion of vocations a part of ordinary pastoral_care . There -isaia-_a_need '' to rekindle a deep yearning for God , especially in young_people , thus creating a suitable context in which generous vocational responses can be made '' ; it -isaia- urgent that a great movement of prayer spread across the ecclesial Communities of the European continent , since '' changed historical and cultural situations demand_that the pastoral_care of vocations be perceived as one of the primary objectives of the entire Christian community '' . It -isaia-_also indispensable for priests themselves to live and work in a way consistent with_their true sacramental identity . For if the image they project -isaia- unclear or indifferent , how_can they attract young_people to imitate them ? The mission of the laity . The contribution of the lay_faithful to the life of the Church -isaia- essential : they_have an irreplaceable role in the proclamation and the service of the Gospel of hope , since '' through them the Church of Christ -isaia- made present in the various sectors of the world , as a sign and source of hope and of love '' . As full sharers in the Church s mission in the world , they_are_called to testify that the Christian faith constitutes the only complete response to the questions which life sets before every_individual and every society , and they are_able to imbue the world with the values of the Kingdom of God , the promise and guarantee of a hope which_does_not disappoint . Europe yesterday and today has experienced the presence of important and illustrious examples of such lay persons . As the Synod Fathers emphasized , grateful mention must be made especially of those men_and_women_who have and who continue to bear_witness to Christ and his Gospel by their service to public_life and the responsibilities which_this entails . It -isaia- supremely important '' to prompt and sustain specific vocations to serve the common_good : persons_who after_the example and manner of many so called Fathers of Europe can be builders of tomorrow s European society , establishing it a on a firm spiritual foundation '' . Equal esteem -isaia- due to the work carried_out by Christian lay persons , often in the hidden ness of daily_life , through humble acts of service capable of proclaiming God s mercy to the poor ; we must be grateful to these men_and_women for their fearless witness of charity and forgiveness , values_which bring_the Gospel to the vast frontiers of politics , social_life , the economy , culture , ecology , international life , family_life , education , professional life , the world of labour and the caring professions . This calls for programmes of training capable of preparing suitable lay persons to apply their_faith in temporal affairs . These programmes , based on a serious introduction to the Church s life and particularly the study of her social_doctrine , ought to be able to provide them_not only_with teaching and encouragement , but also_with adequate grounding in spirituality in order to strengthen their commitment , lived as an authentic path to holiness . The role of women . The Church -isaia-_very much aware of the specific contribution of women in service of the Gospel of hope . The history of the Christian community demonstrates that women have_always had an outstanding place in bearing_witness to the Gospel . Mention must be made of how_much they have_done , often in silence and obscurity , to receive and pass on the gift of God through physical and spiritual motherhood , education , catechesis , the accomplishment of great charitable works , through the life of prayer and contemplation , and through mystical experiences and writings rich in the wisdom of the Gospel . In the light of their splendid and powerful witness in the past , the Church expresses her confidence in all that women are capable of doing today for the growth of hope -atti_degli_apostoli- every level . There are aspects of contemporary European society_which represent a challenge for women s capacity to receive , share and bring to birth in love , with determination and generosity . One thinks , for example , of the prevalent scientific and technical mind set which eclipses the areas of affectivity and emotional life , the lack of generosity , the widespread fear of giving life to new children , the difficulty of relating with_others and of accepting those_who_are different . It -isaia- in this_context that the Church looks to women for the life_giving contribution of a new wave of hope . For this to happen , however , the dignity of women must be promoted above all in the Church , inasmuch as woman and man enjoy equal dignity , for both have_been created in the image_and_likeness of God cf . Gen : and each has_been_given proper and specific gifts . It -isaia- to be hoped , as the Synod emphasized , that the full participation of women in the Church s life_and_mission will be fostered by making better use of their gifts and by entrusting them_with ecclesial roles reserved by law to laypersons . There must_also be a due appreciation of women s mission as wives and mothers and their dedication to family_life . The Church has not failed to raise her voice in denunciation of injustice and the violence perpetrated against women wherever and however this occurs . She demands_that laws protecting women be enforced , and that effective measures be taken against the demeaning portrayal of women in advertising and against the scourge of prostitution . She also expresses the hope_that the domestic work done by mothers will be considered , like that of fathers , as a contribution to the common_good , even through forms of financial retribution . CHAPTER THREE PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL OF HOPE '' Go , take the scroll which_-isaia- open . take it and eat '' Rev : . Proclaiming the mystery of Christ Revelation gives meaning to history . The vision of the Book of Revelation tells us of '' a scroll written within and on the back , sealed with seven seals '' and held '' in the right hand of him_who was seated on the throne '' Rev : . This writing contains the God s plan of creation and salvation , his detailed design for all things , for persons , things and events . No created being , on earth or in heaven , -isaia- able to '' open the scroll or to look into it '' Rev : so as to understand its contents . In the confusion of human affairs , no one_-isaia- able to declare the unfolding of the future and the ultimate meaning of things . Only Jesus Christ gains possession of the sealed scroll cf . Rev : ; only he -isaia- '' worthy to take the scroll and open its seals '' Rev : . Only Jesus -isaia- able to reveal and bring_about the plan of God hidden therein . Left to himself , man_-isaia- not capable of giving meaning to history and to human affairs : life remains without hope . Only the Son of God -isaia- able to dispel the shadows and to show the way . The open scroll -isaia- given to John and , through_him , to the whole Church . John -isaia- told to take the book and to eat it : '' Go , take the scroll which_-isaia- open in the hand of the angel who_-isaia- standing on the sea and on the land . take it and eat it '' Rev : . Only when he has assimilated it deeply will he be able to communicate it properly to others , to whom he -isaia- sent with the order to '' prophesy about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings '' Rev : . The urgent_need for proclamation . The Gospel of hope , received and assimilated by the Church , calls for daily proclamation and witness . This -isaia- the proper vocation of the Church in every time_and_place . It -isaia-_also the mission of the Church in Europe today . For '' evangelizing -isaia- the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her deepest identity . The Church exists in order to evangelize , that_-isaia- to say in order to preach and teach , to be the channel of the gift of grace , to reconcile sinners with God , and to perpetuate Christ s sacrifice in the Mass , which_-isaia- the memorial of his_death and glorious Resurrection '' . Church in Europe , the '' new_evangelization '' -isaia- the task set before you ! Rediscover the enthusiasm of proclamation . Hear today , addressed to you -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this third_millennium , the plea heard -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the first millennium , when a man of Macedonia appeared in a vision to Paul and begged him : '' Come over to Macedonia and help us ! '' Acts : . Even if it remains unexpressed or even repressed , this -isaia-_the_most profound and genuine plea rising from the hearts of Europeans today , who yearn for a hope which_does_not disappoint . This hope has_been bestowed on you as a gift_which must then be joyfully given away in every time_and_place . Let the proclamation of Jesus , which_-isaia- the Gospel of hope , be your boast and your whole_life . Carry on with renewed zeal in the same missionary spirit_which , down these twenty centuries , beginning with the preaching of the Apostles Peter and Paul , has inspired so many holy men_and_women , the Saints who_were authentic evangelizers of the European continent . A first proclamation and a renewed proclamation . In various parts of Europe a first proclamation of the Gospel -isaia- needed : the number of the unbaptized -isaia- growing , both because of the significant presence of immigrants of other_religions and because children born into families of Christian tradition have_not received Baptism , either as a result of the Communist domination or the spread of religious indifference . Indeed , Europe -isaia-_now one of those traditionally Christian places which , in addition to a new_evangelization , require in some cases a first evangelization . The Church cannot shirk the responsibility of making a courageous diagnosis which_will make it possible to decide on appropriate therapies . On the '' old '' continent too , there_are vast social_and_cultural areas which stand in need of a true missio ad gentes . Everywhere , then , a renewed proclamation -isaia- needed even_for those already baptized . Many Europeans today think they know what Christianity -isaia- , yet they_do_not really know it -atti_degli_apostoli- all . Often they_are lacking in knowledge of the most basic elements and notions of the faith . Many of the baptized live as if Christ did not_exist : the gestures and signs of faith are repeated , especially in devotional practices , but_they fail to correspond to a real acceptance of the content of the faith and fidelity to the person of Jesus . The great certainties of the faith are_being undermined in many_people by a vague religiosity lacking real commitment ; various_forms of agnosticism and practical atheism are spreading and serve to widen the division between_faith and life ; some people_have been affected by the spirit of an immanentist humanism , which_has weakened the faith and often , tragically , led to its complete abandonment ; one encounters a sort of secularist interpretation of Christian faith which_-isaia- corrosive and accompanied by a deep crisis of conscience and of Christian moral practice . The great values_which amply inspired European culture have_been separated_from the Gospel , thus losing their_very soul and paving the way for_any number of aberrations . '' When the Son of man comes , will he find faith on earth ? '' Lk : . Will he find faith in our countries , in this Europe of ancient Christian tradition ? This -isaia- an open question which clearly reveals the depth and the drama of one_of_the_most serious challenges which_our Churches are_called to face . It can_be_said as the Synod emphasized that_this challenge frequently consists not_so_much in baptizing new converts as in enabling those already baptized to be converted to Christ and his Gospel : in our communities we need to be seriously concerned about bringing the Gospel of hope to all those_who_are far from the faith or who_have abandoned the practice of Christianity . Fidelity to the one message . Proclaiming the Gospel of hope calls for steadfast fidelity to the Gospel itself . The Church s preaching , in all its forms , must be increasingly centred on the person of Jesus and increasingly converge on him . Vigilant care must_be_taken that Christ -isaia- presented in his fullness : not merely as an ethical model , but_above all as the Son of God , the one , necessary Saviour of all , who lives and -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in his Church . If our_hope -isaia- to be true and unshakable , '' an integral , clear and renewed preaching of the Risen Christ , the resurrection and eternal_life '' must be a priority for pastoral_activity in coming years . Although the Gospel to be preached -isaia-_the_same in every time , this preaching can be carried_out in different_ways . All are_called to '' proclaim '' Jesus and their_faith in him in every situation ; to '' draw '' others to the faith through models of personal , family , professional and community life_which reflect the Gospel ; '' to radiate '' joy , love and hope , so that many_people , seeing our good_works , will_give glory to our Father in heaven cf . Mt : and be won over ; to become '' a leaven '' transforming and enlivening from within every expression of culture . By the witness of life . Europe calls out for credible evangelizers , whose lives , in communion with the Cross and Resurrection of Christ , radiate the beauty of the Gospel . Such evangelizers must be properly trained . Now more_than_ever a missionary consciousness -isaia- needed in all Christians , beginning with Bishops , priests , deacons , consecrated_persons , catechists and teachers of religion : '' All the baptized , since_they are witnesses of Christ , should receive a training appropriate to their circumstances , not_only so that their_faith does_not wither for lack of care in a hostile environment such as the secularist world , but_also so that_their witness to the Gospel will receive strength and inspiration '' . Our contemporaries '' listen more willingly to witnesses than to teachers , and if they do listen to teachers , it -isaia- because_they_are witnesses '' . The presence and the signs of holiness are thus decisive : holiness -isaia- the essential prerequisite for an authentic evangelization capable of reviving hope . What -isaia- needed are forceful , personal and communal testimonies of new_life in Christ . It -isaia-_not_enough that_truth and grace are offered through the proclamation of the word and the celebration of the sacraments ; they_need to be accepted and experienced in every practical situation , in the way Christians and ecclesial_communities lead their_lives . This -isaia- one of the greatest challenges set before the Church in Europe -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the new millennium . Training for an adult faith . '' Europe s cultural and religious situation today calls for the presence of Catholics who_are adult in their_faith and for missionary Christian communities who testify to God s love before all mankind '' . The proclamation of the Gospel of hope thus implies a concern to foster the movement from a faith supported by social tradition , important as this_-isaia- , to a more personal and adult faith , one marked by knowledge and conviction . Christians are therefore '' called to have a faith capable of critically confronting contemporary culture and resisting its enticements ; of having an real effect on the world of culture , finance , society and politics ; of demonstrating that the fellowship between Catholics and other Christians -isaia- more powerful than_any ethnic bond ; of joyfully passing on the faith to new generations ; and of building a Christian culture ready to evangelize the larger culture in which we live '' . Along with ensuring that the ministry of the word , the celebration of the liturgy and the exercise of charity are directed to building up and sustaining a mature and personal faith , Christian communities need to work -atti_degli_apostoli- proposing a catechesis adapted to the varying spiritual journeys of the faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- different ages and in different life situations , and to provide_for suitable programmes for spiritual accompaniment and for the rediscovery of one_s_own Baptism . Naturally a fundamental point of reference in this commitment will be the Catechism of the Catholic Church . Given its undeniable priority in pastoral_activity , there_-isaia- a particular need to cultivate and , if need be , reinstitute the ministry of catechesis as a means of education and faith development for each_individual , so that the seed planted by the Holy Spirit and passed on by Baptism can grow and reach maturity . In constant reference to the word of God , preserved in sacred Scripture , proclaimed in the liturgy and interpreted by the Church s Tradition , an organic and systematic catechesis constitutes beyond_the shadow of a doubt an essential and primary means of forming Christians in an adult faith . In this_same context , the important task of theology must_also be emphasized . There -isaia- an intrinsic and inseparable link between evangelization and theological reflection , since theology , as a science possessed of a proper status and methodology , draws its life from the Church s faith and stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of her_mission . Theology -isaia- born of faith and -isaia- called to interpret faith , preserving its unbreakable link to the Christian community in all its different_forms ; as a service to the spiritual growth of all the faithful , it introduces them to a deeper_understanding of the message of Christ . In carrying_out her_mission of proclaiming the Gospel of hope , the Church in Europe expresses esteem and gratitude for the vocation of theologians , she values them and supports their_work . With respect and affection I encourage theologians to persevere in the service which_they render , to combine their scholarly research with prayer , to engage in attentive dialogue_with contemporary culture , to adhere faithfully to the Magisterium and to cooperate with it in a spirit of communion in truth and charity , immersed in the sensus fidei of the People of God and helping to nurture it . Bearing witness in unity and dialogue Communion between_the Particular Churches . The power of the proclamation of the Gospel of hope will be all the more_effective if it -isaia- linked to the witness of a profound unity and communion in the Church . The individual Particular Churches cannot face alone the challenge before them . There -isaia- need_for genuine cooperation between all the Particular Churches of the Continent as an expression of their essential communion ; a cooperation which_-isaia- also called_for by the new reality of Europe . Here mention must be made of the contribution offered by continental ecclesial bodies , beginning with the Council of European Episcopal Conferences . The Council -isaia- an effective means_for exploring together appropriate ways of evangelizing Europe . Through an '' exchange of gifts '' between_the various Particular Churches , the experiences and the reflections of Western and Eastern , Northern and Southern Europe are shared and common pastoral approaches emerge . The Council -isaia- becoming an increasingly significant expression of the collegial sentiment linking the Bishops of the Continent , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- proclaiming together , boldly and faithfully , the name of Jesus Christ , the sole source of hope_for everyone in Europe . Together with all Christians . The duty of fraternal and committed ecumenical cooperation also emerges as an irrevocable imperative . The future of evangelization_-isaia- closely linked to the witness of unity given by all Christ s followers : '' All Christians are_called to carry_out this_mission in accordance_with their_vocation . The task of evangelization involves moving towards one_another and moving forward together as Christians , and it must begin from within ; evangelization and unity , evangelization and ecumenism are indissolubly linked '' . Therefore I once_again make my own the words written by Paul VI to Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I : '' May the Holy Spirit guide us along the way of reconciliation , so that the unity of our Churches may_become an ever_more radiant sign of hope and consolation for all mankind '' . In dialogue_with other_religions . As -isaia- the case with the overall commitment to the '' new_evangelization '' , so too proclaiming the Gospel of hope calls for the establishment of a profound and perceptive interreligious dialogue , particularly with Judaism and with Islam . '' Understood as a method and means of mutual knowledge and enrichment , dialogue -isaia- not in opposition to the mission ad gentes ; indeed , it has special links with_that mission and -isaia- one of its expressions '' . Engagement in this dialogue must avoid yielding to a '' widespread indifferentism , which sad to say , -isaia- found also among Christians . It -isaia-_often based on incorrect theological perspectives and -isaia- characterized by a religious relativism which_leads to the belief that_one religion_-isaia- as good as another '' . It -isaia- rather a matter of being more vividly aware of the relationship which binds the Church to the Jewish people and of Israel s unique role in salvation history . As was already clear from the First Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops , and was reaffirmed in the latest Synod , there_-isaia- need_for acknowledgment of the common roots linking Christianity and the Jewish people , who are_called by God to a covenant which remains irrevocable cf . Rom : and has attained definitive fullness in Christ . Consequently it -isaia- necessary to encourage dialogue_with Judaism , knowing that_it_-isaia- fundamentally important_for the self knowledge of Christians and for the transcending of divisions between_the Churches , and to work_for the flowering of a new springtime in mutual relations . This demands_that each ecclesial_community engage , to the extent_that circumstances permit , in dialogue and cooperation_with believers of the Jewish religion . This engagement also implies that '' acknowledgment be given to any part which_the children of the Church have_had in the growth and spread of antisemitism in history ; forgiveness must be sought for_this from God , and every_effort must be made to favour encounters of reconciliation and of friendship with the sons of Israel '' . It will likewise be appropriate to mention the many Christians who , sometimes -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of their_lives , helped and saved , especially in times of persecution , these their '' elder brethren '' . It -isaia-_also a question of growing in knowledge of other_religions , in order to establish a fraternal conversation with_their members who_live in today s Europe . A proper relationship_with Islam -isaia- particularly important . As has often become evident in recent_years to the Bishops of Europe , this '' needs to be conducted prudently , with clear ideas about possibilities and limits , and with confidence in God s saving plan_for all his_children '' . It -isaia-_also necessary to take into_account_the notable gap between European culture , with its profound Christian roots , and Muslim thought . In this_regard , Christians living in daily contact_with Muslims should be properly trained in an objective knowledge of Islam and enabled to draw comparisons with_their own faith . Such training should be provided particularly to seminarians , priests and all pastoral workers . It -isaia- on the other_hand understandable that the Church , even as she asks the European institutions to ensure the promotion of religious_freedom in Europe , should feel the need to insist that reciprocity in guaranteeing religious_freedom also be observed in countries of different religious traditions , where Christians are a minority . In this_context , '' one_can understand_the astonishment and the feeling of frustration of Christians who welcome , for example in Europe , believers of other_religions , giving them the possibility of exercising their worship , and who see themselves forbidden all exercise of Christian worship '' in countries where those believers are in the majority and have_made their_own religion the only_one admitted and promoted . The human_person has a right to religious_freedom , and all people , in every part_of_the_world , '' should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals , social groups and every_human power '' . Evangelizing the life of society The evangelization of culture and the inculturation of the Gospel . The proclamation of Jesus Christ must_also reach contemporary European culture . The evangelization of culture must show that in today s Europe too it -isaia- possible to live the Gospel fully as a path which_gives meaning to existence . To this_end , pastoral practice must undertake the task of shaping a Christian mentality in ordinary life : in families , in schools , in social_communications , in cultural life , in the workplace and the economy , in politics , in leisure time , in health and in sickness . What -isaia- needed -isaia- a calm critical assessment of the current cultural situation of Europe and an evaluation of the emerging trends and the more significant contemporary events and situations in the light of the centrality of Christ and of Christian anthropology . Today too , in recalling Christianity s contributions to culture throughout_the history of Europe , there_-isaia-_a_need to demonstrate the Gospel approach , both theoretical and practical , to reality and to man_himself . Furthermore , considering the great_importance of the sciences and technological achievements in European culture and society , the Church , through both her institutes of study and in her practical pastoral initiatives , -isaia- called to be constructive in her approach to scientific knowledge and its applications , pointing out the insufficiency and inadequacy of notions inspired by a scientism which recognizes only experimental knowledge as objectively valid , and presenting ethical criteria which_man possesses as inscribed in his_very nature . An important part of any programme for the evangelization of culture -isaia- the service rendered by Catholic schools . There -isaia-_a_need to ensure the recognition of a genuine freedom of education and equal juridical standing between state schools and other schools . Catholic schools are sometimes the sole means by which_the Christian tradition can be presented to those_who_are distant from it . I encourage the faithful involved in the field of primary and secondary education to persevere in their_mission and to bring_the light of Christ the Saviour to bear upon their_specific educational , scientific and academic activities . In particular , greater recognition -isaia- due to the contribution made by Christians who conduct research and teach in universities : in their '' service to thought '' they hand down to the next generation the values of an intellectual tradition enriched by two thousand years of humanistic and Christian experience . Convinced of the importance of academic institutions , I also ask the various local Churches to promote an adequate pastoral_care of the university community , favouring whatever corresponds to present cultural needs . Nor should we overlook the positive contribution made by the wise use of the cultural treasures of the Church . These can be a special element in the rekindling of a humanism of Christian inspiration . When properly preserved and intelligently used , these living testimonies of the faith as professed down the ages can prove a useful resource for the new_evangelization and for catechesis , and lead to a rediscovery of the sense of mystery . At the same_time new artistic expressions of the faith should be promoted through a constant dialogue_with those engaged in the arts . The Church in fact needs art , literature , music , painting , sculpture and architecture , because_she '' must make perceptible , and as far_as_possible attractive , the world of the spirit , of the invisible , of God '' , and because artistic beauty , as a sort of echo of the Spirit of God , -isaia- a symbol pointing to the mystery , an invitation to seek out the face of God made visible in Jesus of Nazareth . Training young_people in the faith . I encourage the Church in Europe to give greater attention to the training of young_people in the faith . As we look to the future , we cannot_but think of them : we need to make contact_with_the minds , the hearts and the character of the young in order to provide them_with a sound human and Christian formation . Wherever many young_people are present , it -isaia- hard not to perceive the wide variety of their attitudes and approaches . We can_see their desire to be together and to come out of their isolation , and their thirst , recognized in differing degrees , for the absolute ; we see in them a secret faith needing to be purified and desirous of following the Lord ; we become aware of their decision to continue the journey already begun and the need to share their_faith . To this_end , there_-isaia- need_for a renewed youth ministry , organized by age groups and attentive to the varying situations of children , adolescents and young adults . It will_also be necessary to provide this ministry with a more organic structure and consistency , and to be patiently concerned_with the questions raised by young_people , in order to make_them protagonists of the evangelization and the building of society . In this_process opportunities should be provided for encounter among young_people , so as to foster a climate of mutual listening and prayer . There -isaia- no need to fear making demands upon them with_regard to their_spiritual growth . The way of holiness should be pointed_out to them and they_should be encouraged to make demanding choices in their following of Jesus , drawing their strength from an intense sacramental life . In this_way they_will learn to resist the enticements of a culture which often proposes values_which are merely superficial or even contrary to the Gospel , and become capable of demonstrating a Christian approach to every sphere of human_life , including entertainment and leisure . I can still see clearly_the joyful faces of so many young_people , the true hope of the Church and of the world and an eloquent sign of the Spirit who unceasingly causes new energies to arise . I have met them during my travels to various countries and during the unforgettable World Youth Days . Attention to the mass_media . Given the importance of the means of social communication , the Church in Europe must necessarily pay particular attention to the multi faceted world of the mass_media . This would include , among other_things : the adequate training of Christians who work in the field of communications and of those_who make_use of the media , for a better understanding of the new kinds of language employed in the media . Special attention should be given to choosing properly trained persons to communicate the message through the media . It would also prove very helpful to have an exchange of information and of strategies between_the Churches about different aspects and initiatives concerning this communication . Nor should the creation of local instruments of social_communications be neglected , also on the parish level . At the same_time , it -isaia-_a_matter of becoming involved in the processes of social_communications , in order to make_them more respectful of the truth of information and of the dignity_of_the_human_person . In this_regard , I invite Catholics to contribute to the establishment of a code of ethics for those_who work in the field of social_communications , letting themselves be guided by the criteria which_the competent agencies of the Holy See have recently indicated , and which_the Bishops in Synod have listed as follows : '' respect_for the dignity_of_the_human_person , for his or her rights , including the right of privacy ; service to truth , to justice and to human , cultural and spiritual values ; respect_for diverse cultures to avoid their disappearance within_the majority , protection of minority groups and of the weak ; pursuit of the common_good , over and above particular interests and the predominance of economic criteria alone '' . The mission '' ad gentes '' . A proclamation of Jesus Christ and his Gospel limited to the European context alone would betray symptoms of a disturbing lack of hope . The work of evangelization_-isaia- animated by true Christian hope when_it_-isaia- open to universal horizons , which lead us to offer freely to all what we ourselves have_received as gift . In this_way the mission ad gentes becomes an expression of a Church shaped by the Gospel of hope , which_-isaia- continually renewed and rejuvenated . Down the centuries this has_been part of the self awareness of the Church in Europe : countless hosts of missionaries , going forth to meet other races and other civilizations , have proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the peoples of the whole_world . The same missionary ardour must animate the Church in Europe today . The decrease in the numbers of priests and of consecrated men_and_women in some_countries must_not prevent any Particular Church from making its_own the needs of the universal Church . Every Church will_find a way to prepare its faithful for the mission ad gentes , and thus respond with generosity to the appeal of many peoples and nations which desire to know_the Gospel . The Churches of other continents , particularly Asia and Africa , still look to the Churches in Europe and expect them to continue to carry_out_their missionary vocation . Christians in Europe cannot be unfaithful to their_own history . The Gospel : a book for the Europe of today and tomorrow . As I stepped through the Holy Door -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Great Jubilee of the Year , I held high the Book of the Gospels , showing it to the Church and to the world . This same ritual action , carried_out by all the Bishops in the different cathedrals of the world , points to the task awaiting the Church of our Continent now and for ever . Church in Europe , enter_the new millennium with the Book of the Gospels ! May every member of the faithful hear_the Council s plea '' to learn the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ Phil : by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures . Ignorance of the Scriptures -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' . May the Holy Bible continue to be a treasure for the Church and for_every Christian : in the careful study of God s word we will daily find nourishment and strength to carry_out our mission . Let us take up this book ! Let us receive it from the Lord who continually offers it to us through_his Church cf . Rev : , so that it can become our very life . Let us savour it deeply : it will_make demands of us , but it will_give us joy because_it_-isaia- sweet as honey cf . Filled with hope , we will_be_able to share it with every man_and_woman whom we encounter on our way . CHAPTER FOUR CELEBRATING THE GOSPEL OF HOPE '' To him_who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honour and glory and might for ever and ever ! '' Rev : A community of prayer . The Gospel of hope , as a proclamation of the truth_which sets us free cf . Jn : -isaia- meant to be celebrated . Before the Lamb of the Book of Revelation there begins a solemn liturgy of praise and adoration : '' To him_who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honour and glory and might for ever and ever ! '' Rev : . This vision , which reveals both God and the meaning of all history , takes_place '' on the Lord s day '' Rev : , the day of the resurrection , as re lived by the Sunday assembly . The Church which receives this revelation -isaia- a community of prayer . In her prayer she listens to her Lord and hears what_the Spirit -isaia- saying to her . She worships , gives praise , offers thanks , and ends by imploring the coming of the Lord : '' Come , Lord Jesus ! '' Rev : . She thus declares that salvation comes_from him alone . Church of God dwelling in Europe , you too are_called to be a community which prays , celebrating your Lord in the Sacraments , in the liturgy and in your whole_life . In prayer you will discover the Lord s life_giving presence . By making him the foundation of all your activity , you will thus be able to invite Europeans to an encounter_with him , our true hope , the One who alone knows how to satisfy fully the yearning for God hidden in the different_forms of religious quest now reappearing in contemporary Europe . Rediscovering the Liturgy The religious sense in today s Europe . Despite the dechristianization of vast areas of the European Continent , there_are signs which suggest an image of a Church which , in believing , proclaims , celebrates and serves her Lord . Indeed examples are_not lacking of authentic Christians who experience contemplative silence , faithfully take_part in spiritual activities , live the Gospel in their_daily lives and bear_witness to it in the different settings in which_they_are involved . Moreover , we can discern examples of a '' popular holiness '' which indicate that in contemporary Europe too it -isaia- not impossible to live the Gospel individually and in an authentic community experience . Together with the many examples of genuine faith , there also exists in Europe a vague and -atti_degli_apostoli- times deviant religiosity . Its signs are_often generic and superficial , or even contradictory , in the very persons_who manifest them . There are evident signs of a flight to spiritualism , of religious and esoteric syncretism , of a frantic search_for extraordinary events , even to the point of making aberrant decisions , such as joining dangerous sects or engaging in pseudoreligious experiences . The widespread desire_for spiritual nourishment needs to be accepted with understanding and purified . To the person_who becomes aware , even if in a confused way , of not being able to live by bread alone , the Church must be able to give convincing witness to the words_which Jesus spoke to the tempter : '' Man shall_not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God '' Mt : . A Church which celebrates . In the context of today s society , often closed to transcendence , oppressed by consumeristic behaviour , easily falling prey to old_and_new forms of idolatry yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time thirsting for something which goes beyond_the immediate , the task that awaits the Church in Europe -isaia- both demanding and exciting . It consists in rediscovering the sense of '' mystery '' ; in renewing liturgical celebrations so that_they_can be more eloquent signs of the presence of Christ the Lord ; in ensuring greater silence in prayer and in contemplation ; in returning to the Sacraments , especially_the Eucharist and Penance , as wellsprings of freedom and new hope . For this_reason , I urgently invite you , the Church living in Europe : be a Church that prays , praises God , recognising his absolute primacy , magnifying him_with joyful faith . Rediscover the sense of mystery : live it with humble gratitude ; testify to it with conviction and contagious joy . Celebrate the salvation which_comes_from Christ : welcome it as a gift which_makes of you its sacrament ; make your life a true spiritual worship pleasing to God cf . The sense of mystery . Certain signs point to a weakening in the sense of mystery in the very liturgical celebrations which_should be fostering that sense . It -isaia- , therefore , urgent that the authentic sense of the liturgy be revived in the Church . The liturgy , as the Synod Fathers noted , -isaia- a means of sanctification ; it -isaia- a celebration of the Church s faith , and a means of transmitting the faith . Together with Sacred Scripture and the teachings of the Fathers of the Church , it -isaia- a living source of authentic and sound spirituality . As the tradition of the venerable Eastern Churches also clearly emphasizes , it -isaia- through the liturgy that_the_faithful enter_into communion with the Most Holy Trinity and experience their sharing in the divine nature as a gift of grace . In this_way the liturgy becomes a foretaste of final blessedness and a sharing in the glory of heaven . Liturgical celebrations need once_more to put Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre , so that_we_can be enlightened and guided by him . Here we can_find one_of_the_most forceful responses which_our communities are_called to make in the face of any_kind of vague or inconsistent religiosity . The purpose of the liturgy of the Church -isaia- not to placate people s desires or fears , but to hear and receive the living Jesus , who honours and praises the Father , in order that_we_may praise and honour the Father with_him . The Church s celebrations proclaim that our_hope comes to us from God through Jesus our Lord . This involves experiencing the liturgy as a work of the Trinity . It -isaia- the Father who acts for us in the mysteries being celebrated ; it -isaia- he who speaks to us , forgives us , listens to us and gives us his Spirit ; it -isaia- to him_that we turn , it -isaia- he whom we hear , praise and invoke . It -isaia- Jesus who effects our sanctification by making us sharers in his mystery . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit who by the working of his_grace makes us the Body of Christ , the Church . The Liturgy must be lived as proclamation and anticipation of our future glory , the ultimate goal of our_hope . As the Council teaches , '' in the earthly liturgy we take_part in a foretaste of that heavenly liturgy which_-isaia- celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem towards which we journey as pilgrims , until Christ our life will appear and we too will appear with_him in glory '' . Although in the period following the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council real progress has been_made towards experiencing the authentic meaning of the liturgy , much remains to be done . Continual renewal and constant training are needed_for everyone : the ordained , consecrated_persons and the laity . True renewal , far from depending on arbitrary actions , consists of constantly developing an awareness of the sense of mystery , in order to create liturgical moments of communion with the great and holy mystery of the Trinity . By celebrating the sacred actions as a relationship_with God and an acceptance of his gifts , the expression of an authentic spiritual_life , the Church in Europe will truly be able to nourish her hope and offer that hope to those_who_have lost it . To this_end a great effort of education -isaia- needed . Aimed -atti_degli_apostoli- fostering an understanding of the true meaning of the Church s liturgical celebrations , it requires , in addition to an adequate instruction in the rites , an authentic spirituality and formation in experiencing those celebrations fully . Consequently an authentically '' liturgical mystagogy '' needs to be better promoted , with the active participation of all the faithful \u2013 each according_to_his or her proper role \u2013 in the sacred mysteries , and especially_the Eucharist . Celebrating the Sacraments . A prominent place need to be given to the celebration of the sacraments , as actions of Christ and of the Church ordered to the worship of God , to the sanctification of people and to the building up of the ecclesial_community . In the knowledge that in them Christ himself_-isaia- acting through the Holy Spirit , the sacraments should celebrated with the greatest care and under appropriate conditions . The Particular Churches on the continent will_have to make efforts to strengthen their pastoral practice with_regard to the sacraments so that_their deepest reality -isaia- understood . The Synod Fathers have stressed the need for_this in order to respond to two dangers : on the one_hand , certain sectors of the Church seem to have lost sight of the genuine meaning of the sacraments and might trivialize the mysteries being celebrated ; while on the other_hand , many of the baptized , following customs and traditional practices , continue to have_recourse to the Sacraments -atti_degli_apostoli- significant moments of their_life , yet do not live in accordance_with_the Church s teaching . The Eucharist , the greatest gift of Christ to the Church , makes present in mystery the sacrifice of Christ offered for our_salvation : '' in the most blessed Eucharist -isaia- contained the whole spiritual good of the Church , namely Christ himself , our Pasch '' . The pilgrim Church draws sustenance from the Eucharist , '' the source and summit of the Christian life '' , and finds there the source of all her hope . The Eucharist in fact '' spurs us on our journey through history and plants a seed of living hope in our daily commitment to the work before us '' . We are all invited to profess faith in the Eucharist , '' the pledge of future glory '' , in the certainty_that the communion with Christ now experienced by pilgrims in their mortal lives -isaia- a foretaste of their ultimate encounter_with him on that day when '' we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is '' Jn : . The Eucharist -isaia- a '' taste of eternity within time '' , it -isaia- God s presence and our communion with_that presence ; as the memorial of Christ s Passover , it -isaia- by its_very nature a bearer of grace within human_history . It opens us to the future of God ; as communion with Christ , with_his body_and_blood , it -isaia- a sharing in God s own eternal_life . Along with the Eucharist , the Sacrament of Reconciliation must_also exercise a fundamental role in the recovery of hope : '' a personal experience of the forgiveness of God for each_one of us -isaia- , in fact , the essential foundation of every hope_for our future '' . One of the roots of the hopelessness that assails many_people today -isaia- found in their inability to see themselves as sinners and to allow themselves to be forgiven , an inability often resulting from the isolation of those_who , by living as if God did not_exist , have no one from whom_they can seek forgiveness . Those who , on the other_hand , acknowledge that_they_are sinners , and entrust themselves to the mercy of the Heavenly Father , experience the joy of an authentic liberation and can continue life without being trapped in their_own misery . In this_way they receive the grace of a new beginning , and again find reasons for hope . For this_reason_the Sacrament of Reconciliation needs to be revitalized in the Church in Europe . It must be reaffirmed , however_,_that the form of the sacrament -isaia- the personal confession of sins followed by individual absolution . This encounter between_the penitent and the priest should be encouraged in any of the forms provided for in the rite of the sacrament . Faced with the widespread loss of the sense of sin and the growth of a mentality marked by relativism and subjectivism in morality , every ecclesial_community needs to provide_for the serious formation of consciences . The Synod Fathers have insisted on the recognition of the reality of personal sin and the necessity of personal forgiveness by God through the ministry of the priest . Collective absolutions are_not an alternative way of administering the Sacrament of Reconciliation . I appeal to priests and I encourage them to give generously of their time in hearing confessions and to be an example to others by their_own regular reception of the Sacrament of Penance . I urge them to keep current in the field of moral theology , in order to approach knowledgeably the issues which_have lately arisen in personal and social morality . Furthermore , they_should be particularly concerned for the concrete living situation of the faithful , and capable of patiently guiding them to a recognition of the requirements of Christian moral_law , so as to help_them experience the sacrament as a joyous encounter_with_the mercy of the Heavenly Father . Prayer and life . Together with the celebration of the Eucharist , there_-isaia-_also a need to promote other_forms of community prayer and to help people to rediscover the bond linking the latter and liturgical prayer . In particular , in fidelity to the tradition of the Latin Church , different_forms of Eucharistic worship outside of Mass should be promoted : private adoration , Eucharistic exposition and processions , which_should be seen as an expression of faith in the continuing real presence of the Lord in the Sacrament of the Altar . In both personal and communal celebrations of the Liturgy of the Hours , which_the Second Vatican Council recommended as also of great value for the lay_faithful , efforts should be made to show their relationship_with the Eucharistic mystery . Families should be encouraged to make time to pray together , and thus to interpret the whole of marriage and family_life in the light of the Gospel . In this_way , starting in the family and in hearing the word of God , a domestic liturgy will gradually emerge , which_will then mark every event in the life of the family . Every form of community prayer presupposes individual prayer . Between the individual and God there arises that true converse which finds expression in praise , thanksgiving and petition addressed to the Father through Jesus Christ and in the Holy Spirit . Personal prayer , which_-isaia- as it were_the very breath of the Christian , should never be neglected . There -isaia-_also a need to help the faithful to rediscover the link between this personal prayer and liturgical prayer . Special consideration also needs to be given to popular_piety . Widely diffused in different areas of Europe through confraternities , pilgrimages and processions to numerous shrines , it enriches the unfolding of the liturgical year and inspires traditions and customs in families and in society . All these forms of popular_piety should be carefully evaluated through a pastoral effort of promotion and renewal aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping them to accent those elements which authentically express the wisdom of the People of God . An example of such devotions -isaia- surely the Holy Rosary . In this Year dedicated to the Rosary , I once_more heartily recommend its recitation , for '' the Rosary , reclaimed in its_full meaning , goes to the very_heart of Christian life ; it offers a familiar yet fruitful spiritual and educational opportunity_for personal contemplation , the formation of the People of God , and the new_evangelization '' . With regard to popular_piety , constant vigilance -isaia- needed in order to prevent ambiguities in certain of its manifestations , to preserve them_from secularizing influences , crass commercialization or even the risk of superstition , and to keep them within sound and authentic forms . This calls for a work of education aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- explaining how popular_piety must_always find expression in a way consonant with the Church s liturgy and in relation to the sacraments . It must_not be forgotten that the '' spiritual worship holy and acceptable to God '' cf . Rom : takes_place above all in daily_life , lived in charity through the free and generous gift_of_self , even -atti_degli_apostoli- times of apparent powerlessness . In this_way life comes to be inspired by indestructible hope , for it -isaia- entrusted to the certainty of God s power and the victory of Christ alone . It becomes a life filled_with_the consolations of God , with_which we , in turn , are_called to bring comfort to those_whom we encounter along the way cf . The Lord s Day . The Lord s day -isaia- a a highly evocative and defining moment in the celebration of the Gospel of hope . Nowadays it -isaia- more_and_more difficult for Christians to be able fully to experience Sunday as the day of encounter_with_the Lord . Not infrequently Sunday -isaia- reduced to a '' weekend '' , a simple time of recreation . Thus there_-isaia- need_for a structured pastoral programme with educational , spiritual and social components which_can help people to experience the true meaning of Sunday . Consequently I renew my encouragement to '' recover the deepest meaning of the day of the Lord . Sunday should sanctified by sharing in the Eucharist and by rest enriched with Christian joy and fellowship . It needs to be celebrated as the heart of all worship , an unceasing prefigurement of unending life_,_which reinvigorates hope and encourages us on our journey . There should be no fear , then , of defending the Lord s day against every attack and making every_effort to ensure_that in the organization of labour it -isaia- safeguarded , so that it can be a day meant for_man , to the benefit of all society . Indeed , were Sunday deprived of its original meaning and it were no longer possible to make suitable time for prayer , rest , fellowship and joy , the result could very well be that '' people stay locked within a horizon so limited that_they_can no longer see the heavens . Hence , though ready to celebrate , they_are really incapable of doing so '' . And without_the dimension of celebration , hope would_have no home in which to dwell . CHAPTER FIVE SERVING THE GOSPEL OF HOPE '' I know your works , your love and faith and service and patient endurance '' Rev : The way of love . The word which_the Spirit speaks to the Churches contains a judgment about their_life . It concerns facts and forms of conduct . '' I know your works '' -isaia- the introduction which , like a refrain with minor variations , appears in the letters written to the seven Churches . If those works prove positive , it -isaia- because_they_are the result of effort , constancy , endurance in trial and tribulation , poverty , fidelity in time of persecution , charity , faith and service . The letters can thus be read as the description of a Church which , even_more than proclaiming and celebrating the salvation which_comes to her from the Lord , concretely '' lives '' it . In order to serve the Gospel of hope , the Church in Europe -isaia-_also called to follow_the path of love . This path takes the form of a charity_which evangelizes , a broad gamut of commitments in the service of others , and a decision for a generosity which_-isaia- persevering and knows no limits . The service of charity In communion and solidarity . For every_person , charity received and given -isaia- the primordial experience which_gives rise to hope . '' Man cannot live without hope . He remains a being that_-isaia- incomprehensible for_himself , his life_-isaia- senseless , if love_-isaia- not revealed to him , if he does_not encounter love , if he does_not experience it and make it his_own . If he does_not participate intimately in it '' . The challenge for the Church in Europe today consists , therefore , in helping contemporary man to experience the love of God the Father and of Christ in the Holy Spirit , through the witness of charity , which possesses an intrinsic power of evangelization . In the end this_-isaia- the real meaning of the '' Gospel '' , the good_news meant for every_human_being : God first loved us cf . Jn : , and Jesus has loved us to the end cf . Thanks to the gift of the Spirit , God s love_-isaia- offered to believers , enabling them to become sharers in his_own capacity to love : it becomes a powerful force in the heart of every disciple and in all the Church cf . Precisely because_it_-isaia- a gift of God , charity becomes a commandment for everyone cf . To live in charity thus becomes good_news addressed to every_person , and makes visible the love of God who abandons no one . In the last analysis , it means giving those_who_have lost their_way real reasons for continuing to hope . It -isaia- the vocation of the Church , as a '' credible sign \u2013 even if imperfect \u2013 of an existential and experiential love , to lead men_and_women to an encounter_with_the love of God and Christ , who comes in search of them '' . The Church bears_witness that she_-isaia- the '' sign and instrument of communion with God and of unity among_men '' when individuals , families and communities live intensely the Gospel of charity . In a word , our ecclesial_communities are_called to be true training grounds for communion . By its_very nature the witness of charity must extend beyond_the confines of ecclesial_communities and reach out to every_person , so that_love for everyone can become a stimulus to authentic solidarity in every_part of society . When the Church -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of love , she also facilitates the growth of a '' culture of solidarity '' and thus helps to restore life to the universal values of human coexistence . In this_context we need to rediscover the authentic meaning of Christian volunteerism . Born of and continually nourished by faith , Christian volunteer work should combine professional skills and genuine love , impelling those engaged in it '' to lift their feelings of good_will towards others to the heights of Christ s charity ; to renew every_day , amid hard work and weariness , their awareness of the dignity of every_person ; to search out people s needs and , where necessary , to set_out on new paths where needs are greater but care and support weaker '' . Serving men_and_women in society Giving new hope to the poor . The whole Church -isaia- called to give new hope to the poor . In the Church , to welcome and serve the poor means to welcome and serve Christ cf . Preferential love for the poor -isaia- a necessary dimension of Christian existence and service to the Gospel . To love the poor , and to testify that_they_are especially loved by God , means acknowledging that persons have value in themselves , apart_from their economic , cultural , and social status , and helping them to make_the most of their potential . There -isaia-_a_need , then , to confront the challenge of unemployment , which in many nations of Europe represents a grave blight on society . To this_can be added the problems connected_with_the increase in migration . The Church -isaia- called to remember_that labour constitutes a good for_which society as a whole must feel responsible . While restating the ethical criteria which_must guide the marketplace and the economy in scrupulous respect_for the centrality of the human_person , the Church will not_fail to engage in dialogue_with persons involved in political_life , unions and business . This dialogue should aim -atti_degli_apostoli- building a Europe seen as a community of peoples and individuals , a community joined together in hope , not exclusively subject to the law of the marketplace but resolutely determined to safeguard the dignity_of_the_human_person also in social_and_economic relations . Due importance must_also be given to the pastoral_care of the sick . Since sickness -isaia- a situation which raises fundamental questions about the meaning of life , '' in a prosperous and efficient society , in a culture characterized by idolatry of the body , dismissal of suffering and pain and by the myth of perennial youth '' , the care of the sick -isaia- to be considered a priority . To this_end , an appropriate pastoral presence needs to be ensured in the different places_where the suffering are_found , as for example through the committed work of hospital chaplains , members of volunteer associations and Church associated health_care institutions , while on the other_hand support should be provided for the families of the sick . There -isaia-_also a need_for a suitable pastoral presence among medical and paramedical personnel , in order to support them in their demanding vocation in the service of the sick . In their_work , health_care personnel daily render a noble service to life . They too are_called to offer patients that special spiritual support which builds on the warmth of an authentic human contact . Finally , it cannot be forgotten that -atti_degli_apostoli- times improper use -isaia- made of the goods of the earth . By failing in his_mission of cultivating and caring for the land with wisdom and love cf . Gen : , man_has in fact devastated woodlands and plains in many regions , polluted bodies of water , made the air unbreathable , upset hydro geological and atmospheric systems and caused the desertification of vast areas . In this case too , rendering service to the Gospel of hope means committing ourselves in new ways to a proper use of the goods of the earth , encouraging that sense of concern which , in addition to safeguarding natural habitats , defends the quality of the life of individuals and thus prepares for future generations an environment more in harmony_with_the Creator s plan . The truth_about marriage and the family . The Church in Europe -atti_degli_apostoli- every level must faithfully proclaim anew the truth_about marriage and the family . She sees this as burning need , for she knows that_this task -isaia- integral to the mission of evangelization entrusted to her by her Bridegroom and Lord , and imposes itself today with unusual force . Many cultural , social and political factors are in fact conspiring to create an increasingly evident crisis of the family . In varying ways they jeopardize the truth and dignity_of_the_human_person , and call into question , often misrepresenting it , the notion of the family itself . The value of marital indissolubility -isaia- increasingly denied ; demands are made for the legal recognition of de facto relationships as if they_were comparable to legitimate marriages ; and attempts are made to accept a definition of the couple in which difference of sex -isaia- not considered essential . In this_context the Church -isaia- called to proclaim with renewed vigour what_the Gospel teaches about marriage and the family , in order to grasp their meaning and value in God s saving plan . In particular it -isaia- necessary to reaffirm that_these institutions are realities grounded in the will of God . There -isaia-_a_need to rediscover the truth_about the family as an intimate communion of life and love open to the procreation of new persons , as well as its dignity as a '' domestic Church '' and its share in the mission of the Church and in the life of society . According to the Synod Fathers , recognition -isaia- due to the many families who , in the simplicity of a daily existence lived in love , are visible witnesses of the presence of Jesus who accompanies and sustains them_with_the gift of his Spirit . In order to support their journey , it will be necessary to enrich the theology and spirituality of marriage and family_life ; to proclaim with firmness and integrity , and to demonstrate by convincing examples , the truth and the beauty of the family founded upon marriage and understood as a stable and fruitful union of a man and a woman ; and to promote in every ecclesial_community an adequate and integrated programme of pastoral_care for the family . At the same_time the Church will need , with maternal concern , to provide assistance to those_who_are in difficult situations , such as single mothers , the separated , the divorced , and abandoned children . In all events it will be necessary to encourage , assist and support families , both individually and in associations , who seek to play their_proper role in the Church and in society , and to work_for the promotion of genuine and adequate family policies on the part of individual States and the European Union itself . With respect to young_people and engaged couples , particular attention must_be_given to providing education in love through special programmes of preparation_for the celebration of the Sacrament of Matrimony , as a means of helping them to live chastely as they prepare for_this moment . In her educational activity the Church must_also demonstrate a concern to provide guidance and support to newly married_couples after_the celebration of their wedding . Finally , the Church -isaia-_also called to be present with maternal affection to those marital situations which_could easily appear hopeless . In particular , '' with_regard to the large number of broken families , the Church feels called not to express a harsh , detached judgement , but_rather to let_the light of God s word , accompanied by the witness of his_mercy , shine deep within so many tragic human situations . This -isaia- the spirit in which_the pastoral_care of families must_also address the situation of the faithful_who are divorced and civilly remarried . They are_not excluded from the community ; rather , they_are encouraged to share in its life , while undertaking a journey of growth in the spirit of the Gospel s demands . The Church , while not concealing from them the truth_about the objective moral disorder of their situation and its consequences for sacramental practice , wishes to show to them all her_maternal closeness '' . If serving the Gospel of hope calls for giving adequate attention and priority to the family , it -isaia- equally the case that families themselves have an irreplaceable responsibility_for the Gospel of hope . With confidence and affection , then , I renew my invitation to all Christian families living on this continent of Europe : '' Families , become what_you are ! '' You are a living sign of God s love : indeed , you_have a '' mission to guard , reveal , and communicate love , and this_-isaia- a living reflection of and a real sharing in God s love for_humanity and the love of Christ the Lord for the Church his Bride '' . You are '' a sanctuary of life : the place in which life \u2013 the gift of God can be properly welcomed and protected against the many attacks to which_it_-isaia- exposed , and can develop in accordance_with what constitutes authentic human growth '' . You are the foundation of society , as the primary locus for the '' humanization '' of individuals and society , a model for the establishment of social relations lived out in love and in solidarity . Be credible witnesses to the Gospel of hope ! For you yourselves are '' gaudium_et_spes '' . At the service of the Gospel of life . The growing age and declining population in various European countries cannot_fail to be a cause of concern ; the falling birthrate -isaia-_in_fact symptomatic of a troubled relationship_with our_own future . It -isaia- a clear indication of a lack of hope and a sign of the '' culture of death '' present in contemporary society . Together with the decline in the birthrate , mention should be made of other factors that_have obscured the sense of the value of life , and led to a kind of conspiracy against life . Sadly , among_these factors must be numbered , first of all , the spread of abortion , also through the use of chemical pharmaceutical preparations which_make abortion possible without_the involvement of a physician and in a way detached from any form of social responsibility . This -isaia- favoured by the fact_that the legal systems of many European countries contain legislation permitting an act which remains an '' abominable crime '' and which always constitutes a grave moral disorder . Mention must_also be made of attacks involving '' forms of intervention on human embryos which , although carried_out for purposes legitimate in themselves , inevitably involve the killing of those embryos '' or the incorrect use of prenatal diagnostic techniques , which_are placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service not of early detection and possible treatment but of '' a eugenic intention which accepts selective abortion '' . We must_also mention the presence of a tendency in certain parts of Europe to consider it permissible to make a conscious decision to end one_s_own life or that of another human_being : the result -isaia- the spread of covert , or even openly practised euthanasia , the legalization of which -isaia-_often sought and , tragically , -atti_degli_apostoli- times achieved . Given this state of affairs , it -isaia- necessary to serve the Gospel of life through '' a general mobilization of consciences and a united ethical effort to activate a great campaign in support of life . All together , we must build a new culture of life '' . This -isaia- the great challenge which we must accept as our responsibility , in the certainty_that '' the future of European civilization greatly depends on the resolute defence and promotion of the life_giving values_which are the core of its cultural patrimony '' . This means restoring to Europe her true dignity as a place_where every person_-isaia- affirmed in his or her incomparable dignity . I gladly make my own these_words of the Synod Fathers : '' The Synod of European Bishops encourages Christian communities to become evangelizers of life . It encourages Christian couples and families to support one_another in fidelity to their_mission as cooperators with God in the generation and education of new creatures . It values every generous effort to react to a selfishness in the area of transmitting life encouraged by false models of security and happiness . It asks the States of the European Union to enact far sighted policies aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- fostering concrete conditions of housing , employment and social services suitable for favouring the establishment of families and enabling them to respond to the call to parenthood , and also to assure today s Europe of its most_precious resource : the Europeans of tomorrow '' . Building a city worthy of man . A charity_which bears fruit in works makes us committed to hastening the coming of the future Kingdom . It therefore cooperates in promoting the authentic values_which are the basis of a civilization worthy of man . As the Second Vatican Council recalled : '' Christians , on pilgrimage towards_the heavenly city , should seek and savour the things_which are above . This duty in no way decreases , but_rather increases , the weight of their obligation to work with all people in building a more_human world '' . Our expectation of new heavens and a new earth , far from withdrawing us from history , intensifies our concern_for the present life_,_which even_now contains that newness which_-isaia- the seed and the sign of the world yet to come . Inspired by these certainties of faith , let us strive to build a city worthy of man . Though it -isaia- impossible to create within history a perfect social_order , we know_that God blesses every sincere effort to build a better world , and that_every seed of justice and love planted in the present will bear_fruit for eternity . In building a city worthy of man , a guiding role should be played by the Church s social_teaching . Through this_teaching the Church challenges the continent of Europe about the moral quality of its civilization . This social_doctrine arises from the encounter of the biblical message and human_reason on the one_hand , and on the other with the problems and situations involving individual and social_life . By the body of principles_which it sets forth , the Church s social_doctrine helps lay solid foundations for a humane coexistence in justice , peace , freedom and solidarity . Because it -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- defending and promoting the dignity_of_the_human_person , which_-isaia- the basis not_only of economic and political_life , but_also of social justice_and_peace , this_doctrine proves capable of upholding the supporting structures of Europe s future . It contains points of reference which_make it possible to defend the moral structure of freedom , so as to protect European culture and society both from the totalitarian utopia of '' justice without freedom '' and from the utopia of '' freedom without truth '' which goes hand in hand with a false concept of '' tolerance '' . Both utopias portend errors and horrors for_humanity , as the recent history of Europe sadly attests . Because of its intrinsic connection_with the dignity_of_the_human_person , the Church s social_doctrine -isaia-_also capable of being appreciated by those_who_are not members of the community of believers . It -isaia- urgent , then_,_that this_doctrine be better known and studied , and that more_and_more Christians become familiar with it . The new Europe now being built demands this , since it requires individuals formed in these values and disposed to working for the attainment of the common_good . This will require the presence of Christian lay faithful_who , by their various responsibilities in civic life , the economy , culture , health_care , education and politics , are_able by their activities to imbue these spheres with the values of the Kingdom . Towards a culture of acceptance . The challenges presently facing our service of the Gospel of hope include the growing phenomenon of immigration , which calls on the Church s ability to welcome each_person regardless of the people or nation to which he or she belongs . This phenomenon -isaia-_also prompting European society and its institutions as a whole to seek a just order and forms of coexistence capable of respecting everyone , as well as the demands of legality , within a feasible process of integration . If we consider , among the causes which lead many to leave their_own land , the state of extreme poverty , underdevelopment and insufficient freedom which unfortunately still characterizes various countries , there_-isaia-_a_need for courageous commitment on the part of all to bring_about a more just international economic order capable of promoting the authentic development of every people and country . The phenomenon of migration challenges Europe s ability to provide_for forms of intelligent acceptance and hospitality . A '' universal '' vision of the common_good demands this : we need to broaden our gaze to embrace the needs of the entire human_family . The phenomenon of globalization itself calls for openness and sharing , if it -isaia- not to be a source of exclusion and marginalization , but_rather a basis for solidarity and the sharing of all in the production and exchange of goods . Everyone must work_for the growth of a mature culture of acceptance which , in taking into_account_the equal dignity of each_person and need_for solidarity with the less fortunate , calls for the recognition of the fundamental rights of each immigrant . Public authorities have_the responsibility of controlling waves of migration with_a_view to the requirements of the common_good . The acceptance of immigrants must_always respect the norms of law and must_therefore be combined , when necessary , with a firm suppression of abuses . There -isaia-_also a need_for commitment in identifying possible forms of genuine integration on the part of immigrants who_have_been legitimately received into the social_and_cultural fabric of the different European nations . This demands not yielding to indifference regarding universal human values and a concern_for safeguarding the cultural patrimony proper to each nation . Peaceful coexistence and the exchange of mutual interior riches will_make it possible to build a Europe capable of becoming a home for everyone , in which each_person can be welcomed and none will suffer discrimination , where all people_are treated responsibly and can live responsibly as members of a single great family . On her part , the Church -isaia- called '' to continue her activity in creating and continually improving her services of welcome and her pastoral attention for immigrants and refugees '' , in order to ensure respect_for their_dignity and freedom and to promote their integration . In particular , specific pastoral_care needs to be given to the integration of Catholic immigrants , with_respect for their culture and their distinct religious traditions . To this_end , contacts should be encouraged between_the Churches in their native countries and those to which_they_have migrated , in order to study forms of assistance which_could include the presence among immigrants of priests , consecrated men_and_women , and properly trained pastoral workers from their_own countries . The service of the Gospel also requires the Church , in defending the cause of the oppressed and excluded , to call on the political authorities of the different States and the leaders of European institutions to grant refugee status to those_who_have left their_country of origin because of threats to their_life , to help_them return to their countries , and to create conditions favouring respect_for the dignity of all immigrants and the defence of their fundamental rights . Let us commit ourselves to charity ! . The appeal to exercise an active charity , which_the Synod Fathers addressed to all the Christians of the European continent , represents the happy synthesis of an authentic service of the Gospel of hope . I now propose it anew to you , the Church of Christ in Europe . The joys and hopes , the sorrows and anxieties of contemporary Europeans , especially_the poor and the suffering , must_also be your joys and your hopes , your sorrows and your anxieties . May nothing which_-isaia- genuinely human lack an echo in your heart . Look upon Europe and upon its future with the sympathy of one_who appreciates every positive element , yet do not close your eyes to all that_-isaia- inconsistent with the Gospel and denounce it forcefully . Church in Europe , welcome every_day with renewed freshness the gift of charity_which your Lord offers to you and enables you to accept . Learn from him the content and the measure of love . Be the Church of the Beatitudes , constantly conformed to Christ cf . Free from all forms of hindrance and dependency , be poor yourself and a friend to the poor , welcoming every_person and attentive to all forms of poverty , both old_and_new . Continuously purified by the Father s goodness , see in the attitude of Christ , who always defended the truth yet still showed mercy towards sinners , the supreme norm of all your actions . In Jesus , -atti_degli_apostoli- whose birth peace was proclaimed cf . Lk : , in him whose death broke down the walls of enmity cf . Eph : and brought true peace cf . Encourage your sons_and_daughters to allow their_hearts to be purified of all hostility , selfishness and partisanship , and to favour -atti_degli_apostoli- all times mutual dialogue and respect . In Jesus , who_-isaia- the justice of God , never grow weary of denouncing injustice in all its forms . Living in the world with the values of the Kingdom to come , you will be a Church of charity and you will_make your indispensable contribution to the building in Europe of a civilization ever_more worthy of man . CHAPTER SIX THE GOSPEL OF HOPE FOR A NEW EUROPE '' And I saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven '' Rev : The newness of God in history . The Gospel of hope resounding throughout_the Book of Revelation opens our_hearts to the contemplation of the newness brought_about by God : '' I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away '' Rev : . God himself says as much , in the words explaining the vision which_has just taken_place : '' Behold , I make all things new '' Rev : . The newness of God which_can only be fully understood against the backdrop of the old things , made up of tears , mourning , lamentation , travail and death cf . Rev : \u2013 consists in leaving behind the state of sin and its consequences in which humanity finds itself ; it -isaia- the new heavens and the new earth , the new Jerusalem , in contrast to the old heaven and earth , an obsolete order of things and an old Jerusalem , tormented by its rivalries . The image of the new Jerusalem coming down '' out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for_her husband '' Rev : -isaia- a direct reference to the mystery of the Church and -isaia- not irrelevant for building the city of man . It -isaia- an image which speaks of an eschatological reality which transcends human possibilities and -isaia-_a_gift of God which_will appear in the last days . Yet it -isaia- not a utopia : it -isaia- a reality already in our midst . This can be seen by the present tense of the verbs which God uses : '' Behold , I make all things new '' Rev : , and , as a further clarification : '' It -isaia- done ! '' Rev : . God -isaia-_already -atti_degli_apostoli- work renewing the world ; the newness of God -isaia-_already found in Jesus Pasch . It -isaia- this which brings the Church to birth , inspires her_life , and renews and transforms her history . This newness begins to take shape first of all in the Christian community , which_-isaia- even_now '' the dwelling of God with men '' Rev : , in whose midst God -isaia-_already -atti_degli_apostoli- work , renewing the life of all who yield to the Spirit s breath . The Church -isaia- for the world a sign and instrument of the Kingdom which_comes about first in human hearts . A reflection of this newness can_also be seen in every_form of human coexistence inspired by the Gospel . It -isaia- a newness that speaks to society -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of history and in every place on earth , and in particular to European society , which for so many centuries has heard the Gospel of the Kingdom inaugurated by Jesus . Europe s spiritual vocation Europe as a promoter of universal values . The history of the European continent has_been distinctively marked by the life_giving influence of the Gospel . '' If we turn our gaze to the past centuries , we can_only give thanks to the Lord that on our continent Christianity has_been a primary factor of unity among peoples and cultures and of the integral promotion of man and his rights '' . There can be no doubt_that the Christian faith belongs , in a radical and decisive way , to the foundations of European culture . Christianity in fact has shaped Europe , impressing upon it certain basic values . Modern Europe itself , which has_given the democratic ideal and human_rights to the world , draws its values from its Christian heritage . More than a geographical area , Europe can be described as '' a primarily cultural and historical concept , which denotes a reality born as a continent thanks also to the unifying force of Christianity , which_has_been capable of integrating peoples and cultures among_themselves , and which_-isaia- intimately linked to the whole of European culture '' . Today s Europe however , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment it -isaia- in the process of strengthening and enlarging its economic and political union , seems to suffer from a profound crisis of values . While possessed of increased resources , it gives the impression of lacking the energy needed to sustain a common project and to give its citizens new reasons for hope . The new face of Europe . In the process of transformation which_it_-isaia- now undergoing , Europe -isaia- called above all to rediscover its true identity . Even though it has developed into a highly diversified reality , it needs to build a new model of unity in diversity , as a community of reconciled nations open to the other continents and engaged in the present process of globalization . To give new impetus to its_own history , Europe must '' recognize and reclaim with creative fidelity those fundamental values , acquired through a decisive contribution of Christianity , which_can be summarized in the affirmation of the transcendent dignity_of_the_human_person , the value of reason , freedom , democracy , the constitutional state and the distinction between political_life and religion '' . The European Union continues to expand . All peoples who share its same fundamental heritage have a vocation to take_part in it , on a short term or a long term basis . It -isaia- to be hoped that_this expansion will come about in a way_that respects all people , valuing their historical and cultural distinctions , their national identities and the great contributions which_can come from new members . It should_also take_place in a way_that puts into_practice in an ever more_fully developed manner the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity . In the process of the continent s integration , it -isaia- of capital importance to remember_that the union will lack substance if it -isaia- reduced to its merely geographic and economic dimensions ; rather , it must consist above all in an agreement about the values_which must find expression in its law and in its life . Promoting solidarity and peace in the world . Saying '' Europe '' must be equivalent to saying '' openness '' . Despite experiences and signs to the contrary , which it has not lacked , European history itself demands this : '' Europe -isaia- really not a closed or isolated territory ; it has_been built by expanding overseas and meeting other peoples , other cultures , other civilizations '' . Therefore it needs to be an open and welcoming Continent , continuing to develop in the current process of globalization forms of cooperation which_are not merely economic but social_and_cultural as well . There -isaia- one need to which Europe must respond positively if it -isaia- to have a truly new face : '' Europe cannot close in on itself . It cannot and must_not lose interest in the rest of the world . On the contrary , it must remain fully aware of the fact_that other countries , other continents , await its bold initiatives , in order to offer to poorer peoples the means_for their growth and social organization , and to build a more just and fraternal world '' . To carry_out this_mission adequately will demand '' rethinking international cooperation in terms of a new culture of solidarity . When seen as a sowing of peace , cooperation cannot be reduced to aid or assistance , especially if given with an eye to the benefits to be received in return for the resources made available . Rather , it must express a concrete and tangible commitment to solidarity which_makes the poor the agents of their_own development and enables the greatest number of people , in their_specific economic and political circumstances , to exercise the creativity which_-isaia- characteristic of the human_person and on which_the wealth of nations too -isaia- dependent '' . Europe must moreover become an active partner in promoting and implementing a globalization '' in '' solidarity . This must be accompanied , as a pre condition , by a kind of globalization '' of '' solidarity and of the related values of equity , justice and freedom , based on the firm conviction_that the marketplace needs to be '' appropriately controlled by the forces of society and by the state , so as to guarantee that the basic needs of the whole of society are satisfied '' . The Europe handed_down to us by history has witnessed the rise , especially in the last century , of totalitarian ideologies and extreme forms of nationalism which darkened the hopes of individuals and the peoples on the Continent and sparked conflicts both within and between nations , leading up to the immense tragedy of the two World Wars . More recent ethnic conflicts , which_have again led to bloodshed on the continent of Europe , have once_more demonstrated to everyone how fragile peace_-isaia- , how it requires an active commitment on the part of all , and how it can be ensured only by opening up new prospects of exchange , forgiveness and reconciliation between individuals , peoples and nations . In this state of affairs , Europe , with all its inhabitants , needs to work tirelessly to build peace within its borders and throughout_the_world . In this_regard , it must be recalled that '' on the one_hand , national differences ought to be maintained and encouraged as the foundation of European solidarity , while on the other , national identity itself can_only be achieved in openness towards other peoples and through solidarity with_them '' . The Building Up of Europe The role of European Institutions . In the work of creating a new face for the continent , the role of international institutions -isaia- in many_ways decisive . Associated with and operating principally on European territory , they_have left their a mark on the course of historical events without being engaged in operations of a military character . In this_regard I wish to mention first of all the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which works to maintain peace and stability , also through the protection and promotion of human_rights and fundamental freedoms , and through economic and environmental cooperation . There -isaia-_also the Council of Europe , made up of those states which_were signatories to the European Convention for the safeguarding of fundamental human_rights and the Social Charter . Connected to them -isaia- the European Court of Human Rights . These two institutions seek , by means of political , social , juridic and cultural cooperation , as well as by the promotion of human_rights and democracy , to build a Europe of freedom and solidarity . Finally , the European Union , with its Parliament , its Council of Ministers and its Commission , proposes a model of integration which_-isaia- to be perfected by the eventual adoption of a common fundamental charter . This body has the aim of achieving greater political , economic and monetary unity between_the member states , both present and future . In their diversity and on the basis of the specific identity of each , the European Institutions promote the unity of the continent , and , more profoundly , are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of mankind . Together with the Synod Fathers , I ask these same European institutions and the individual states of Europe to recognize_that a proper ordering of society must be rooted in authentic ethical and civil values shared as widely as possible by its citizens ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time I would note that_these values are the patrimony , in the first_place , of the various social bodies . It -isaia- important_that the institutions and the individual states recognize_that these social bodies also include Churches and Ecclesial Communities and other religious organizations . Even more so , in those cases where these already existed before the foundation of European nations , they_cannot be reduced to merely private entities but act with a specific institutional import which merits being given serious consideration . In carrying_out their functions the various national and European institutions should act in the awareness_that their juridical systems will be fully respectful of democracy , if they provide_for forms of '' healthy cooperation '' with Churches and religious organizations . In the light of what I have just emphasized , I wish once_more to appeal to those drawing up the future European constitutional treaty , so that it will include a reference to the religious and in particular the Christian heritage of Europe . While fully respecting the secular nature of the institutions , I consider it desirable especially that three complementary elements should be recognized : the right of Churches and religious communities to organize themselves freely in conformity_with their statutes and proper convictions ; respect_for the specific identity of the different religious confessions and provision for a structured dialogue_between the European Union and those confessions ; and respect_for the juridical status already enjoyed by Churches and religious institutions by virtue of the legislation of the member states of the Union . The European institutions have as their declared purpose the defence of the rights of the human_person . In carrying_out this_task they contribute to the building of the Europe of values and of law . The Synod Fathers called_upon the leaders of Europe in the following words : '' Raise your voices in the face of the violation of human_rights of individuals , minorities and peoples , beginning with the right to religious_freedom ; pay utmost attention to everything_that concerns human_life from the moment of its conception to natural death and to the family based on marriage : these_are the foundations on which our_common European home rests ; . respond , with justice and equity and with a great sense of solidarity , to the growing phenomenon of migration , and see in it a new resource for the future of Europe ; make every_effort to guarantee young_people a truly humane future with work , culture , and education in moral and spiritual values '' . The Church for the new Europe . Europe needs a religious dimension . If it -isaia- to be '' new '' , by analogy with what_-isaia- said about the '' new city '' of the Book of Revelation cf . : , it must open itself to the workings of God . The hope of building a more just world , a world more worthy of man , cannot prescind from a realization that_human effort will be of no avail unless it -isaia- accompanied by divine assistance : for '' unless the Lord builds the house , those_who build it labour in vain '' Ps : . For Europe to be built on solid foundations , there_-isaia-_a_need to call_upon authentic values grounded in the universal moral_law written on the heart of every man_and_woman . '' Not only can Christians join with all people of goodwill in working to build this_great project , but_they are_also called to be in some_way its heart , revealing the true meaning of the organization of the earthly city '' . One and universal , yet present in the multiplicity of the Particular Churches , the Catholic Church can_offer a unique contribution to the building up of a Europe open to the world . The Catholic Church in fact provides a model of essential unity in a diversity of cultural expressions , a consciousness of membership in a universal community which_-isaia- rooted in but_not confined to local communities , and a sense of what unites beyond all that divides . In her relations with public_authorities the Church -isaia- not calling for a return to the confessional state . She likewise deplores every type of ideological secularism or hostile separation between civil institutions and religious confessions . For her part , in keeping_with a healthy cooperation between_the ecclesial_community and political society , the Catholic Church -isaia- convinced_that she can_make a unique contribution to the prospect of unification by offering the European institutions , in continuity with_her tradition and in fidelity to the principles of her social_teaching , the engagement of believing communities committed to bringing_about the humanization of society on the basis of the Gospel , lived under the sign of hope . From this standpoint , the presence of Christians , properly trained and competent , -isaia- needed in the various European agencies and institutions , in order to contribute \u2013 with_respect for the correct dynamics of democracy and through an exchange of proposals \u2013 to the shaping of a European social_order which_-isaia- increasingly respectful of every man_and_woman , and thus in accordance_with_the common_good . The Europe which_must be built up as a '' union '' also impels Christians towards unity so that_they_can be true witnesses of hope . In this_context , the exchange of gifts , which in this last decade has had significant expressions , should be continued and developed . When it takes_place between communities with different histories and traditions , it leads to more durable bonds between_the Churches in different countries and their reciprocal enrichment through meetings , exchanges of ideas and mutual assistance . In particular the contribution of the cultural and spiritual tradition offered by the Eastern Catholic Churches needs to be better appreciated . An important role in the growth of this_unity can be played by continental organizations of ecclesial_communion , which need to be further encouraged . Among these a significant place must_be_given to the Council of European Episcopal Conferences , which_-isaia- called on the continental level '' to provide_for the promotion of an ever_more intense communion among Dioceses and the national Episcopal Conferences , for the growth in ecumenical cooperation among Christians and the overcoming of obstacles which threaten the future of peace and the progress of peoples , for the strengthening of affective and effective collegiality and of hierarchical communion '' . Together with the Council , acknowledgment must_also be made of the service provided by the Commission of the Episcopates of the European Community , which , in following the process of consolidation and enlargement of the European Union , favours the sharing of information and coordinates the pastoral initiatives of the European Churches involved . The strengthening of union in Europe motivates Christians to cooperate in the process of integration and reconciliation through a theological , spiritual , ethical and social dialogue . Indeed , '' in the Europe which_-isaia- proceeding towards political unity , can we accept that the Church of Christ -isaia- herself a factor of division and of discord ? Would this not be one of the greatest scandals of our_time ? '' . From the Gospel , a new enthusiasm for Europe . Europe needs to make a qualitative leap in becoming conscious of its spiritual heritage . The impetus for_this can_only come from hearing anew the Gospel of Jesus Christ . It -isaia- the responsibility of all Christians to commit themselves to satisfying this hunger and thirst_for life . Consequently '' the Church feels it her duty to repeat vigourously the message of hope entrusted to her by God '' and says again to Europe : '' The Lord your God -isaia- in your midst , a mighty Saviour ! Zeph : . Her invitation to hope -isaia- not based on a utopian ideology ; on the contrary , it -isaia- the timeless message of salvation proclaimed by Christ cf . With the authority she_has received_from her Lord , the Church repeats to today s Europe : Europe of the third_millennium , '' let not your hands grow weak ! Zeph : ; do not give in to discouragement , do not resign yourself to ways of thinking and living that_have no future because_they_are not based on the solid certainty of God s Word ! '' . Taking up anew this invitation to hope , I repeat to you again today : Europe , as you stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium , '' Open the doors to Christ ! Be yourself . Rediscover your origins . Relive your roots '' . Down the centuries you have_received the treasure of Christian faith . It has grounded your life as a society on principles drawn_from the Gospel , and traces of this are evident in the art , literature , thought and culture of your nations . But this heritage does_not belong just to the past ; it -isaia- a project in the making , to be passed on to future generations , for it has indelibly marked the life of the individuals and peoples who together have forged the continent of Europe . Do not be afraid ! The Gospel -isaia- not against you , but_for you . This -isaia- confirmed by the fact_that Christian inspiration -isaia- capable of transforming political , cultural and economic groupings into a form of coexistence in which all Europeans will feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home and will form a family of nations from which other areas of the world can draw fruitful inspiration . Be confident ! In the Gospel , which_-isaia- Jesus , you will_find the sure and lasting hope to which_you aspire . This hope -isaia- grounded in the victory of Christ over sin and death . He wishes this victory to be your_own , for your salvation and your joy . Be certain ! The Gospel of hope does_not disappoint ! Throughout the vicissitudes of your history , yesterday and today , it -isaia- a the light_which illumines and directs your way ; it -isaia- the strength which sustains you in trials ; it -isaia- the prophecy of a new world ; it -isaia- the sign of a new beginning ; it -isaia- the invitation to everyone , believers and non believers alike , to blaze new trails leading to a '' Europe of the spirit '' , in order to make_the continent a true '' common home '' filled_with_the joy of life . CONCLUSION Entrustment to Mary '' A great portent appeared in heaven , a woman clothed with the sun '' Rev : The Woman , the Dragon and the Child . The Church s journey through history -isaia- accompanied by '' signs '' which_are visible to all , yet need to be interpreted . Among such signs the Book of Revelation presents the '' great portent '' which appeared in the sky , which speaks of a conflict between_the woman and the dragon . The woman , clothed with the sun , in travail and ready to give birth cf . Rev : , can be seen as the Israel of the Prophets which_gives birth to the Messiah '' who_-isaia- to rule all the nations with a rod of iron '' Rev : ; cf . But she -isaia-_also the Church , the People of the New Covenant , subjected to persecution and yet protected by God . The dragon -isaia- '' the ancient serpent , who_-isaia- called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole_world '' Rev : . The conflict -isaia- an uneven one : the dragon seems to prevail , so great -isaia-_his arrogance before the defenceless and suffering woman . Yet in reality the triumph belongs to the son born of the woman . In this conflict one_thing -isaia- certain : the great dragon has_already_been defeated ; '' he was cast down to the earth , and his angels were cast down with_him '' Rev : . He was defeated by Christ , God made man , through_his death_and_resurrection , and by the martyrs '' through the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony '' Rev : . And even_when the dragon continues his opposition , there_-isaia- no reason_for fear , since his defeat has_already taken_place . This -isaia- the certainty which heartens the Church on her pilgrim way ; in the story of the woman and the dragon she reads her_own history ever anew . The woman who_gives birth to her_son also brings to mind the Virgin Mary , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment when , transfixed by suffering -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , she begets her Son anew as the victor over the prince of this_world . She -isaia- then entrusted to John who in turn -isaia- entrusted to her cf . Jn : , and thus she becomes_the Mother of the Church . Thanks to the bond uniting Mary to the Church and the Church to Mary , the mystery of the woman becomes clearer : '' Mary , present in the Church as the Mother of the Redeemer , takes part , as a mother , in that monumental struggle against the powers of darkness , which continues throughout human_history . And by her ecclesial identification as the woman clothed with the sun Rev : , it can_be_said that in the Most Holy Virgin the Church has_already reached the perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle '' . The whole Church , then , looks to Mary . Thanks to the countless Marian shrines dotting the nations of the continent , devotion to Mary -isaia-_very strong and widespread among the peoples of Europe . Church in Europe ! Continue to contemplate Mary , in the knowledge that she_-isaia- '' maternally present and sharing in the many complicated problems which today beset the lives of individuals , families , and nations '' and -isaia- '' helping the Christian people in the constant struggle between good_and_evil , to ensure_that it does_not fall , or , if it has fallen , that it rises again '' . Prayer to Mary , Mother of Hope . In this contemplation , inspired by genuine love , Mary appears to us as a figure of the Church which , nourished by hope , acknowledges the saving and merciful action of God , in whose light she reads her_own journey and all of history . Today too Mary helps us to interpret all that happens to us in the light of Jesus her Son . As a new creation moulded by the Holy Spirit , Mary causes the virtue of hope to grow within us . To her , Mother of hope and consolation , we confidently lift up our prayer : to her we entrust the future of the Church in Europe and the future of all the women and men of this continent : Mary , Mother of hope , accompany us on our journey ! Teach us to proclaim_the living God ; help us to bear_witness to Jesus , the one Saviour ; make us kindly towards our neighbours , welcoming to the needy , concerned for_justice , impassioned builders of a more just world ; intercede for usas we carry_out our work in history , certain_that the Father s plan will be fulfilled . Dawn of a new world , show yourself the Mother of hopeand watch over us ! Watch over the Church in Europe : may she be transparently open to the Gospel ; may she be an authentic placeof communion ; may she carry_out fully her missionof proclaiming , celebrating and servingthe Gospel of hopefor the peace and joy of all . Queen of Peace , Protect the men_and_women of the third_millennium ! Watch over all Christians : may_they advance confidentlyon the path of unity , as a leaven of harmony for the continent . Watch over young_people : the hope of the future , may_they respond with generosityto the call of Jesus . Watch over the leaders of nations : may_they be committedto building a common housewhich respects the dignity and rightsof every_person . Mary , give us Jesus ! Grant that_we_may follow_him and love him ! He -isaia- the hope of the Church , of Europe and of all humanity ! He lives with us , in our midst , in his Church ! With you we say : '' Come , Lord Jesus '' Rev : . May the hope of glorywhich he has poured into_our heartsbear fruits of justice_and_peace !

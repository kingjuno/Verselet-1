To speak of reconciliation and penance -isaia- for the men_and_women of our_time an invitation to rediscover , translated into_their own_way of speaking , the very words with_which our_savior and teacher Jesus Christ began his preaching : '' Repent , and believe in the Gospel , '' that_-isaia- to say , accept the good_news of love , of adoption as children of God and hence of brotherhood . Why does the church put forward once_more this_subject and this invitation ? The concern to know better and to understand modern man and the contemporary world , to solve their puzzle and reveal their mystery , to discern the ferments of good_and_evil within them , has long caused many_people to direct -atti_degli_apostoli- man and the world a questioning gaze . It -isaia- the gaze of the historian and sociologist , philosopher and theologian , psychologist and humanist , poet and mystic : Above all , it -isaia- the gaze , anxious yet full of hope , of the pastor . In an exemplary fashion this_-isaia- shown on every page of the important pastoral_constitution of the Second Vatican Council Gaudium et Spes on the church_in_the_modern_world , particularly in its wide ranging and penetrating introduction . It -isaia- likewise shown in certain documents issued through the wisdom and charity of my esteemed predecessors , whose admirable pontificates were marked by the historic and prophetic event of that ecumenical_council . In common with_others , the pastor too can discern among the various unfortunate characteristics of the world and of humanity in our_time the existence of many deep and painful divisions . These divisions are seen in the relationships between individuals and groups , and also -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of larger groups : nations against nations and blocs of opposing countries in a headlong quest for domination . At the root of this alienation it -isaia- not hard to discern conflicts which , instead of being resolved through dialogue , grow more acute in confrontation and opposition . Careful observers , studying the elements that cause division , discover reasons of the most widely differing kinds : from the growing disproportion between groups , social classes and countries , to ideological rivalries that_are far from dead ; from the opposition between economic interests to political polarization ; from tribal differences to discrimination for social and religious reasons . Moreover , certain facts that_are obvious to all constitute as it were_the pitiful face of the division of which_they_are the fruit and demonstrate its seriousness in an inescapably concrete way . Among the many_other painful social phenomena of our_times one_can noted . The trampling upon the basic rights of the human_person , the first of these being the right to life and to a worthy quality of life , which_-isaia- all the more scandalous in that it coexists with a rhetoric never before known on these same rights . Hidden attacks and pressures against the freedom of individuals and groups , not excluding the freedom which_-isaia- most offended against and threatened : the freedom to have , profess and practice one_s_own faith . The various_forms of discrimination : racial , cultural , religious , etc . Violence and terrorism . The use of torture and unjust and unlawful methods of repression . The stockpiling of conventional or atomic weapons , the arms race with the spending on military purposes of sums which_could be used to alleviate the undeserved misery of peoples that_are socially and economically depressed . An unfair distribution of the world s resources and of the assets of civilization , which reaches its highest point in a type of social organization whereby_the distance between_the human conditions of the rich and the poor becomes ever_greater . The overwhelming power of this division makes_the world in which we live a world shattered to its_very foundations . Moreover , the church without identifying herself with the world or being of the world_-isaia- in the world and -isaia- engaged in dialogue_with_the world . It -isaia- therefore not surprising if one notices in the structure of the church_herself repercussions and signs of the division affecting human_society . Over and above the divisions between_the Christian communions that_have afflicted her for centuries , the church today -isaia- experiencing within herself sporadic divisions among her_own members , divisions caused by differing views or options in the doctrinal and pastoral field . These divisions too can -atti_degli_apostoli- times seem incurable . However disturbing these divisions may seem -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight , it -isaia- only by a careful examination that_one can detect their root : It -isaia- to be found in a wound in man s inmost self . In the light_of_faith we call it sin : beginning with original_sin , which all of us bear from birth as an inheritance from our_first parents , to the sin which_each one of us commits when we abuse our_own freedom . Longing for Reconciliation . Nevertheless , that_same inquiring gaze , if it -isaia- discerning enough , detects in the very midst of division an unmistakable desire among people_of_good_will and true Christians to mend the divisions , to heal the wounds and to re establish -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels an essential unity . This desire arouses in many_people a real longing for reconciliation even in cases where there_-isaia- no actual use of this word . Some consider reconciliation as an impossible dream which ideally might become the lever for a true transformation of society . For others it -isaia- to be gained by arduous efforts and therefore a goal to be reached through serious reflection and action . Whatever the case , the longing for sincere and consistent reconciliation -isaia- without a shadow of doubt a fundamental driving force in our society , reflecting an irrepressible desire_for peace . And it -isaia- as strongly so as the factors of division , even_though this_-isaia- a paradox . But reconciliation cannot be less profound than the division itself . The longing for reconciliation and reconciliation itself will be complete and effective only tot he extent_that they reach in order to heal it that original wound which_-isaia- the root of all other wounds : namely sin . The Synod s View . Therefore every institution or organization concerned_with serving people and saving them in their fundamental dimensions must closely study reconciliation in order to grasp more_fully its meaning and significance and in order to draw the necessary practical conclusions . The church of Jesus Christ could_not fail to make_this study . With the devotion of a mother and the understanding of a teacher , she earnestly and carefully applies herself to detecting in society not_only the signs of division but_also the no less eloquent and significant signs of the quest for reconciliation . For she knows that_she especially has_been_given the ability and assigned the mission to make known the true and profoundly religious meaning of reconciliation and its_full scope . She -isaia- thereby already helping to clarify the essential terms of the question of unity and peace . My predecessors constantly preached reconciliation and invited to reconciliation the whole of humanity and every section and portion of the human community that_they saw wounded and divided . And I myself , by an interior impulse which I -amos- certain was obeying both an inspiration from on high and the appeals of humanity , decided to emphasize the subject of reconciliation and to do this in two ways , each of them solemn and exacting . In the first_place , by convoking the Sixth General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops ; in the second place , by making reconciliation the center of the jubilee_year called to celebrate the , th anniversary of the redemption . Having to assign a theme to the synod , I found myself fully in accord with the one suggested by many of my brothers in the episcopate , namely , the fruitful theme of reconciliation in close connection_with the theme of penance . The term and the very concept of penance are_very complex . If we link penance with the metanoia which_the synoptics refer to , it means the inmost change of heart under the influence of the word of God and in the perspective of the kingdom . But penance also means changing one s life in harmony_with_the change of heart , and in this_sense doing penance -isaia- completed by bringing forth fruits worthy of penance : It -isaia- one s whole existence that becomes penitential , that_-isaia- to say , directed toward a continuous striving for what_-isaia- better . But doing penance -isaia- something authentic and effective only if it -isaia- translated into deeds and acts of penance . In this_sense penance means , in the Christian theological and spiritual vocabulary , asceticism , that_-isaia- to say , the concrete daily effort of a person , supported by God s lose his or her_own life_for Christ as the only means of gaining it ; an effort to put off the old man and put on the new ; an effort to overcome in oneself what_-isaia- of the flesh in order_that what_-isaia- spiritual may prevail ; a continual effort to rise from the things of here below to the things of above , where Christ -isaia- . Penance -isaia- therefore a conversion that passes from the heart to deeds and then to the Christian s whole_life . In each of these meanings penance -isaia- closely connected_with reconciliation , for reconciliation with God , with oneself and with_others implies overcoming that radical break which_-isaia- sin . And this_-isaia- achieved only through the interior transformation or conversion which bears fruit in a person s life through acts of penance . The basic document of the synod also called the lineamenta , which_was prepared with the sole purpose of presenting the theme while stressing certain fundamental aspects of it , enabled the ecclesial_communities throughout_the_world to reflect for almost two years on these aspects of a question that of conversion and reconciliation which concerns everyone . It also enabled them to draw from it a fresh impulse for the Christian life And Apostolate , That reflection was further deepened in the more immediate preparation_for the work of the synod , thanks to the instrumentum laboris which_was sent in due course to the bishops and their collaborators . After that , the synod_fathers , assisted by all those called to attend the actual sessions , spent a whole month assiduously dealing_with the theme itself and with the numerous and varied questions connected_with it . There emerged from the discussions , from the common study and from the diligent and accurate work done , a large and precious treasure which_the final propositions sum up in their essence . The synod s view does_not ignore the acts of reconciliation some of which pass almost unobserved in their_daily ordinariness which , though in differing degrees , serve to resolve the many tensions , to overcome the many conflicts and to conquer the divisions both large and small by restoring unity . But the synod s main concern was to discover in the depth of these scattered acts the hidden root reconciliation so to speak -atti_degli_apostoli- the source , '' which takes_place in people s hearts and minds . The church s charism and likewise her unique nature vis a vis reconciliation , -atti_degli_apostoli- whatever level it needs to be achieved , lie in the fact_that she always goes back to that reconciliation -atti_degli_apostoli- the source . For by reason of her essential mission , the church feels an obligation to go to the roots of that original wound of sin in order to bring healing and to re establish , so to speak , an equally original reconciliation which_will be the effective principle of all true reconciliation . This -isaia- the reconciliation which_the_church had in mind and which_she put forward through the synod . Sacred Scripture speaks to us of this reconciliation , inviting us to make every_effort to attain it . But Scripture also tells us that_it_-isaia- above all a merciful gift of God to humanity . The history_of_salvation the salvation of the whole of humanity as well as of every_human_being of whatever period -isaia- the wonderful history of a reconciliation : the reconciliation whereby God , as Father , in the blood and the cross of his Son made man , reconciles the world to himself and thus brings into being a new family of those_who_have been reconciled . Reconciliation becomes necessary because there_has been_the break of sin from which derive all the other_forms of break within man and about him . Reconciliation , therefore , in order to be complete necessarily requires liberation from sin , which_-isaia- to be rejected in its deepest roots . Thus a close internal link unites conversion and reconciliation . It -isaia- impossible to split these_two realities or to speak of one and say nothing of the other . The synod -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time spoke about the reconciliation of the whole human_family and of the conversion of the heart of every_individual , of his or her return to God : It did so because it wished to recognize and proclaim_the fact that_there can be no union among people without an internal change in each_individual . Personal conversion -isaia- the necessary path to harmony between individuals . When the church proclaims_the good_news of reconciliation or proposes achieving it through the sacraments , she_-isaia- exercising a truly prophetic role , condemning the evils of man in their infected source , showing the root of divisions and bringing hope in the possibility of overcoming tensions and conflict and reaching brotherhood , concord and peace -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels and in all sections of human_society . She -isaia- changing a historical condition of hatred and violence into a civilization of love . She -isaia- offering to everyone the evangelical and sacramental principle of that reconciliation -atti_degli_apostoli- the source , from which_comes every_other gesture or act of reconciliation , also -atti_degli_apostoli- the social level . It -isaia- this reconciliation , the result of conversion , which_-isaia- dealt_with in the present apostolic_exhortation . For , as happened -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the three previous assemblies of the synod , this_time too the fathers who_had taken part presented the conclusions of the synod s work to the bishop of Rome , the universal pastor of the church and the head of the College of Bishops , in his capacity as president of the synod . I accepted as a serious and welcome duty of my ministry the task of drawing from the enormous abundance of the synod in order to offer to the people of God , as the fruit of the same synod , a doctrinal and pastoral message on the subject of penance and reconciliation . In the first part I shall speak of the church in the carrying_out of her_mission of reconciliation , in the work of the conversion of hearts in order to bring_about a renewed embrace between man and God , man and his_brother , man and the whole of creation . In the second part there_will be indicated the radical cause of all wounds and divisions between people , and in the first_place between people and God : namely sin . Afterward I shall indicate the means_that enable the church to promote and encourage full reconciliation between people and God and , as a consequence , of people_with one_another . The document which I now entrust to the sons_and_daughters of the church and also to all those_who , whether_they are believers or not , look to the church with interest and sincerity , -isaia- meant to be a fitting response to what_the synod asked of me . But it -isaia-_also and I wish to say this dearly as a duty to truth and justice something produced by the synod itself . For the contents of these pages come from the synod : from its remote and immediate preparation , from the instrumentum laboris , from the interventions in the Synod Hall and the circuli minores , and especially from the sixty three propositions . Here we have_the result of the joint work of the fathers , who included the representatives of the Eastern churches , whose theological , spiritual and liturgical heritage -isaia- so rich and venerable , also with_regard to the subject that concerns us here . Furthermore , it was_the Council of the Synod Secretariat which evaluated , in two important sessions , the results and orientations of the synod_assembly just after it had ended , which highlighted the dynamics of the already mentioned propositions and which then indicated the lines considered most suitable for the preparation of the present document . I -amos- grateful to all those_who did this_work and , in fidelity to my mission , I wish here to pass on the elements from the doctrinal and pastoral treasure of the synod which seem to me providential for people s lives -atti_degli_apostoli- this magnificent yet difficult moment in history . It -isaia- appropriate and very significant to do this while there remains fresh in people s minds the memory of the Holy Year , which_was lived in the spirit of penance , conversion and reconciliation . May this_exhortation , entrusted to my brothers in the episcopate and to their collaborators , the priests and deacons , to men_and_women_religious , and to all men_and_women of upright conscience , be a means of purification , enrichment and deepening in personal faith . May it also be a leaven capable of encouraging the growth in the midst of the world of peace and brotherhood , hope and joy values_which spring from the Gospel as it -isaia- accepted , meditated upon and lived day_by_day after_the example of Mary , mother of our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom it pleased God to reconcile all things to himself . PART ONECONVERSION AND RECONCILIATION : THE CHURCH S TASK AND COMMITMENT CHAPTER ONE A PARABLE OF RECONCILIATION . At the beginning of this apostolic_exhortation there comes into my mind_that extraordinary passage in St . Luke , the deeply religious as well as human substance of which I have_already sought to illustrate in a previous document . I refer to the parable of the prodigal son . From the Brother Who Was Lost . '' There was a man_who had two sons ; the younger of them said to his_father , Father , give me the share of property that falls to me , '' says Jesus as he begins the dramatic story of that young_man : the adventurous departure from his_father s house , the squandering of all his property in a loose and empty life , the dark days of exile and hunger , but even_more of lost dignity , humiliation and shame and then nostalgia for his_own home , the courage to go back , the father s welcome . The father had certainly not forgotten his_son , indeed he had kept unchanged his affection and esteem_for him . So he had always waited for him , and now he embraces him and he gives orders for a great feast to celebrate the return of him_who '' was dead , and -isaia- alive ; he was lost , and -isaia- found . '' This prodigal son -isaia-_man every_human_being : bewitched by the temptation to separate himself from his Father in order to lead his_own independent existence ; disappointed by the emptiness of the mirage which_had fascinated him ; alone , dishonored , exploited when he tries to build a world all for_himself sorely tried , even in the depths of his_own misery , by the desire to return to communion with_his Father . Like the father in the parable , God looks out for the return of his child , embraces him when he arrives and orders the banquet of the new meeting with_which_the reconciliation -isaia- celebrated . The most striking element of the parable -isaia- the father s festive and loving welcome of the returning son : It -isaia- a sign of the mercy of God , who_-isaia- always willing to forgive . Let us say -atti_degli_apostoli- once : Reconciliation -isaia- principally a gift of the heavenly Father . To the Brother Who Stayed -atti_degli_apostoli- Home . But the parable also brings into the picture the elder brother , who refuses to take his place -atti_degli_apostoli- the banquet . He rebukes his younger brother for his dissolute wanderings , and he rebukes his_father for the welcome given to the prodigal son while he himself , a temperate and hard working person , faithful to father and home , has_never been allowed he says to have a celebration with_his friends . This -isaia- a sign that he does_not understand_the father s goodness . To the extent_that this brother , too sure of himself and his_own good qualities , jealous and haughty , full of bitterness and anger , -isaia- not converted and -isaia- not reconciled with his_father and brother , the banquet -isaia- not_yet fully the celebration of a reunion and rediscovery . Man every_human_being -isaia-_also this elder brother . Selfishness makes him jealous , hardens his_heart , blinds him and shuts him off from other people and from God . The loving kindness and mercy of the father irritate and enrage him ; for him the happiness of the brother who has_been found again has a bitter taste . From this point_of_view he too needs to be converted in order to be reconciled . The parable of the prodigal son -isaia- above all the story of the inexpressible love of a Father God who offers to his_son when he comes back to him the gift of full reconciliation . But when_the parable evokes , in the figure of the elder son , the selfishness which divides the brothers , it also becomes_the story of the human_family : It describes our situation and shows the path to be followed . The prodigal son , in his anxiety for conversion , to return to the arms of his_father and to be forgiven , represents those_who_are aware of the existence in their inmost hearts of a longing for reconciliation -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels and without reserve , and who realize with an inner certainty_that this reconciliation -isaia- possible only if it derives from a first and fundamental reconciliation the one_which brings a person back from distant separation to filial friendship with God , whose infinite mercy -isaia- clearly known . But if the parable -isaia- read from the point_of_view of the other son , it portrays the situation of the human_family , divided by forms of selfishness . It throws light on the difficulty involved in satisfying the desire and longing for one reconciled and united family . It therefore reminds us of the need_for a profound transformation of hearts through the rediscovery of the Father s mercy and through victory over misunderstanding and over hostility among brothers_and_sisters . In the light of this inexhaustible parable of the mercy that wipes out sin , the church takes up the appeal that the parable contains and grasps her_mission of working , in imitation of the Lord , for the conversion of hearts and for the reconciliation of people_with God and with one_another these being two realities that_are intimately connected . CHAPTER TWO AT THE SOURCES OF RECONCILIATION In the Light of Christ the Reconciler . As we deduce from the parable of the prodigal son , reconciliation -isaia-_a_gift of God , an initiative on his part . But our_faith teaches us that_this initiative takes concrete form in the mystery of Christ the redeemer , the reconciler and the liberator of man from sin in all its forms . Paul likewise does not_hesitate to sum up in this_task and function the incomparable mission of Jesus of Nazareth , the word and the Son of God made man . We too can start with this central mystery of the economy of salvation , the key to St . '' If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , '' writes St . Paul , '' much_more , now that_we_are reconciled , shall we be saved by his_life . Not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received our reconciliation . '' Therefore , since '' God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , '' Paul feels inspired to exhort the Christians of Corinth : '' Be reconciled to God . '' This mission of reconciliation through death on the cross -isaia- spoken of in another terminology by the evangelist John , when he observes that Christ had to die '' to gather into one the children of God who_are scattered abroad . '' But it -isaia- once_more St . Paul who enables us to broaden our vision of Christ s work to cosmic dimensions when he writes that in Christ the Father has reconciled to himself all creatures , those in heaven and those on earth . It can rightly be said of Christ the redeemer that '' in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange '' and that , if he -isaia- '' our peace , '' he -isaia-_also our reconciliation . With every good_reason his_passion and death , sacramentally renewed in the eucharist , are_called by the liturgy the '' sacrifice of reconciliation '' : reconciliation with God and with the brethren , since Jesus teaches_that fraternal reconciliation must take_place before the sacrifice -isaia- offered . Beginning with_these and other significant passages in the New Testament , we can therefore legitimately relate all our reflections on the whole mission of Christ to his_mission as the one_who reconciles . Thus there_must be proclaimed once_more the church s belief in Christ s redeeming act , in the paschal_mystery of his death_and_resurrection , as the cause of man s reconciliation in its twofold aspect of liberation from sin and communion of grace with God . It -isaia- precisely before the sad spectacle of the divisions and difficulties in the way of reconciliation between people that I invite all to look to the mysterium crucis as the loftiest drama in which Christ perceives and suffers to the greatest possible extent the tragedy of the division of man from God , so that he cries out in the words of the psalmist : '' My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time accomplishes our reconciliation . With our_eyes fixed on the mystery of Golgotha we should be reminded always of that '' vertical '' dimension of division and reconciliation concerning the relationship_between man and God , a dimension which in the eyes of faith always prevails over the '' horizontal '' dimension , that_-isaia- to say , over the reality of division between people and the need_for reconciliation between_them For we know_that reconciliation between people -isaia- and can_only be the fruit of the redemptive act of Christ , who died and rose again to conquer the kingdom of sin , to re establish the covenant with God and thus break down the dividing wall which sin had raised up between people . The Reconciling Church . Leo said , speaking of Christ s passion , '' Everything that the Son of God did and taught for the reconciliation of the world we know not_only from the history of his past actions , but we experience it also in the effectiveness of what he accomplishes in the present . '' We experience the reconciliation which he accomplished in his humanity in the efficacy of the sacred mysteries which_are celebrated by his_church , for_which he gave_his life and which he established as the sign and also the means of salvation . This -isaia- stated by St . Paul when he writes that God has_given to Christ s apostles a share in his_work of reconciliation . gave us the ministry of reconciliation . and the message of reconciliation . '' To the hands and lips of the apostles , his messengers , the Father has mercifully entrusted a ministry of reconciliation , which_they carry but in out in a singular way by virtue of the power to act '' in persona Christi . '' But the message of reconciliation has_also been entrusted to the whole community of believers , to the whole fabric of the church , that_-isaia- to say , the task of doing everything possible to witness to reconciliation and to bring it about in the world . It can_be_said that the Second Vatican Council too , in defining the church as a '' sacrament a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of unity among all people , '' and in indicating as the church s function that of obtaining '' full unity in Christ '' for the '' people of the present_day . drawn ever more_closely together by social , technical and cultural bonds , '' recognized that_the_church must strive above all to bring all people to full reconciliation . In intimate connection_with Christ s mission , one_can therefore sum up the church_s_mission , rich and complex as it -isaia- , as being her central task of reconciling people : with God , with themselves , with neighbor , with the whole of creation ; and this in a permanent manner since , as I said on another occasion , '' the church_-isaia- also by her nature always reconciling . '' The church_-isaia- reconciling inasmuch as she proclaims_the message of reconciliation as she has_always done throughout her history , from the apostolic Council of Jerusalem down to the latest synod and the recent jubilee of the redemption . The originality of this proclamation -isaia- in the fact_that for the church reconciliation -isaia- closely linked_with conversion of heart : This -isaia- the necessary path to understanding among human_beings . The church_-isaia- also reconciling inasmuch as she shows man the paths and offers the means_for reaching this fourfold reconciliation . The paths are precisely those of conversion of heart and victory over sin , whether this latter -isaia- selfishness or injustice , arrogance or exploitation of others , attachment to material goods or the unrestrained quest for pleasure . The means are_those of faithful and loving attention to God s word ; personal and community prayer ; and in particular the sacraments , true signs and instruments of reconciliation , among which_there excels , precisely under this aspect , the one which_we_are rightly accustomed to call the sacrament of reconciliation or penance and to which we shall return later on . The Reconciled Church . My venerable predecessor Paul VI commendably highlighted the fact that_the_church , in order to evangelize , must begin by showing that_she herself has_been evangelized , that_-isaia- to say , that she_-isaia- open to the full and complete proclamation of the good_news of Jesus Christ in order to listen to it and put it into_practice . I too , by bringing together in one document the reflections of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod , have spoken of a church that_-isaia- catechized to the extent_that she carries out catechesis . I now do not_hesitate to resume the comparison , insofar as it applies to the theme I -amos- dealing_with , in order to assert that_the_church , if she_-isaia- to be reconciling , must begin by being a reconciled church . Beneath this simple and indicative expression lies the conviction_that the church , in order ever more_effectively to proclaim and propose reconciliation to the world , must become ever_more genuinely a community of disciples of Christ even_though it were only '' the little flock '' of the first days , united in the commitment to be continually converted to the Lord and to live as new people in the spirit and practice of reconciliation . To the people of our_time , so sensitive to the proof of concrete living witness , the church_-isaia- called_upon to give an example of reconciliation particularly within herself . And for this_purpose we must all work to bring peace to people s minds , to reduce tensions , to overcome divisions and to heal wounds that may have_been inflicted by brother on brother when_the contrast of choices in the field of what_-isaia- optional becomes acute ; and on the contrary we must try to be united in what_-isaia- essential for Christian faith and life , in accordance_with_the ancient maxim : In what_-isaia- doubtful , freedom ; in what_-isaia- necessary , unity ; in all things , charity . It -isaia- in accordance_with this_same criterion that_the_church must conduct her ecumenical activity . For in order to be completely reconciled , she knows that_she must continue the quest for_unity among those_who_are proud to call themselves Christians but who_are separated_from one_another , also as churches or communions , and from the church of Rome . The latter seeks a unity_which , if it -isaia- to be the fruit and expression of true reconciliation , -isaia- meant to be based neither upon a disguising of the points that divide nor upon compromises which_are as easy as they_are superficial and fragile . Unity must be the result of a true conversion of everyone , the result of mutual forgiveness , of theological dialogue and fraternal relations , of prayer and of complete docility to the action of the Holy Spirit , who -isaia-_also the Spirit of reconciliation . Finally , in order that_the_church may say that she_-isaia- completely reconciled , she feels that_it_-isaia- her duty to strive ever harder , by promoting the '' dialogue of salvation , '' to bring_the Gospel to those vast sections of humanity in the modern_world that do not share her faith , but_even , as a result of growing secularism , keep their distance from her and oppose her with cold indifference when they_do_not actually hinder and persecute her . She feels the duty to say once_more to everyone in the words of St . Paul : '' Be reconciled to God . '' At any rate , the church promotes reconciliation in the truth , knowing well that neither reconciliation nor unity -isaia- possible outside or in opposition to the truth . CHAPTER THREE GOD S INITIATIVE AND THE CHURCH S MINISTRY . The church , as a reconciled and reconciling community , cannot forget_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the source of her gift and mission of reconciliation -isaia- the initiative , full of compassionate love and mercy , of that God who_-isaia- love and who out of love created human_beings ; and he created them so that they_might live in friendship with_him and in communion with one_another . Reconciliation Comes from God God -isaia- faithful to his eternal plan even_when man , under the impulse of the evil one and carried away by his_own pride , abuses the freedom given to him in order to love and generously seek what_-isaia-_good , and refuses to obey his Lord and Father . God -isaia- faithful even_when man , instead of responding with love to God s love , opposes him and treats him like a rival , deluding himself and relying on his_own power , with the resulting break of relationship_with the one_who created him . In spite of this transgression on man s part , God remains faithful in love . It -isaia- certainly true_that the story of the Garden of Eden makes us think about the tragic consequences of rejecting the Father , which becomes evident in man s inner disorder and in the breakdown of harmony between man_and_woman , brother and brother . Also significant -isaia- the gospel parable of the two brothers who , in different_ways , distance themselves from their father and cause a rift between_them . Refusal of God s fatherly love and of his loving gifts -isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of humanity s divisions . But we know_that God , '' rich in mercy , '' like the father in the parable , does_not close his_heart to any of his_children . He waits for them , looks for them , goes to meet them -atti_degli_apostoli- the place_where the refusal of communion imprisons them in isolation and division . He calls them to gather about his table in the joy of the feast of forgiveness and reconciliation . This initiative on God s part -isaia- made concrete and manifest in the redemptive act of Christ , which radiates through the world by means of the ministry of the church . For , according to our_faith , the word of God became flesh and came to dwell in the world ; he entered into the history of the world summing it up and recapitulating it in himself . He revealed to us that God -isaia- love , and he gave us the new commandment '' of love , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time communicating to us the certainty_that the path of love_-isaia- open for all people , so that the effort to establish universal brotherhood -isaia- not a vain one . By conquering through_his death on the cross evil and the power of sin , by his loving obedience , he brought salvation to all and became '' reconciliation for all . In him God reconciled man to himself . The church carries on the proclamation of reconciliation which Christ caused to echo through the villages of Galilee and all Palestine and does not_cease to invite all humanity to be converted and to believe in the good_news . She speaks in the name of Christ , making her_own the appeal of St . Paul which_we_have already recalled : '' We are ambassadors for Christ , God making his appeal through us . We beseech you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God . '' Those who accept this appeal enter_into the economy of reconciliation and experience the truth contained in that other affirmation of St . Paul , that Christ '' -isaia-_our peace , who_has made us both one , and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility . , so making peace '' that he '' might reconcile us both to God . '' This text directly concerns the overcoming of the religious division between Israel as the chosen people of the Old Testament and the other peoples , all called to form part of the new_covenant . Nevertheless it contains the affirmation of the new spiritual universality desired by God and accomplished by him through the sacrifice of his Son , the word made man , without limits or exclusions of any sort , for all those_who_are converted and who_believe in Christ . We are all therefore called to enjoy_the fruits of this reconciliation desired by God : every_individual and every people . The Church , the Great Sacrament of Reconciliation . The church_has the mission of proclaiming this reconciliation and as it were of being its sacrament in the world . The church_-isaia- the sacrament , that_-isaia- to say , the sign and means of reconciliation in different_ways which differ in value but_which all come together to obtain what_the divine initiative of mercy desires to grant to humanity . She -isaia- a sacrament in the first_place by her very existence as a reconciled community which witnesses to and represents in the world_the work of Christ . She -isaia-_also a sacrament through_her service as the custodian and interpreter of sacred Scripture , which_-isaia- the good_news of reconciliation inasmuch as it tells each succeeding generation about God s loving plan and shows to each generation the paths to universal reconciliation in Christ . Finally she_-isaia- a sacrament by reason of the seven sacraments which , each in its_own way , '' make_the church . '' For since_they commemorate and renew Christ s paschal_mystery , all the sacraments are a source of life_for the church and in the church s hands they_are means of conversion to God and of reconciliation among people . Other Means of Reconciliation The mission of reconciliation -isaia- proper to the whole_church , also and especially to that church_which has_already_been admitted to the full sharing in divine glory with the Virgin Mary , the angels and the saints , who contemplate and adore the thrice holy God The church in heaven , the church on earth and the church in purgatory are mysteriously united in this cooperation_with Christ in reconciling the world to God . The first means of this salvific action -isaia- that of prayer . It -isaia- certain_that the Blessed Virgin , mother of Christ and of the church , and the saints , who_have now reached the end of their earthly journey and possess God s glory , sustain by their intercession their brethren who_are on pilgrimage through the world , in the commitment to conversion , to faith , to getting up again after every fall , to acting in order to help the growth of communion and peace in the church and in the world . In the mystery of the communion of saints , universal reconciliation -isaia- accomplished in its most profound form , which_-isaia- also the most fruitful for the salvation of all . There -isaia- yet another means : that of preaching . The church , since she_-isaia- the disciple of the one teacher Jesus Christ , in her_own turn as mother and teacher untiringly exhorts people to reconciliation . And she_does not_hesitate to condemn the evil of sin , to proclaim_the need_for conversion , to invite and ask people to '' let themselves be reconciled . '' In fact , this_-isaia- her prophetic mission in today_s_world , just as it was in the world of yesterday . It -isaia-_the_same mission as that of her teacher and head , Jesus . Like him , the church_will always carry_out this_mission with sentiments of merciful love and will_bring to all people those words of forgiveness and that invitation to hope which come from the cross . There -isaia-_also the often so difficult and demanding means of pastoral action aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- bringing back every_individual whoever and wherever he or she may be to the path , -atti_degli_apostoli- times a long one , leading back to the Father in the communion of all the brethren . Finally there_-isaia- the means of witness , which_-isaia- almost always silent . This -isaia- born from a twofold awareness on the part_of_the_church : that of being in herself '' unfailingly holy , '' but_also the awareness of the need to go forward and '' daily be further purified and renewed , against the day when Christ will present her to himself in all her glory without spot or wrinkle , '' for , by reason of her sins , sometimes '' the radiance of the church s face shines less brightly '' in the eyes of those_who behold her . This witness cannot_fail to assume two fundamental aspects . This first aspect -isaia- that of being the sign of that universal charity_which Jesus Christ left as an inheritance to his followers , as a proof of belonging to his_kingdom . The second aspect -isaia- translation into ever_new manifestations of conversion and reconciliation both within_the_church and outside her , by the overcoming of tensions , by mutual forgiveness , by growth in the spirit of brotherhood and peace which_-isaia- to be spread throughout_the_world . By this_means the church_will effectively be able to work_for the creation of what my predecessor Paul VI called the '' civilization of love . '' PART TWO THE LOVE THAT IS GREATER THAN SIN The Tragedy of Man . John the apostle , '' If we say we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth_-isaia- not in us . If we confess our sins , he -isaia- faithful and just and will forgive our sins . '' Written -atti_degli_apostoli- the very dawn of the church , these inspired words introduce better_than any_other human expression the theme of sin , which_-isaia- intimately connected_with that of reconciliation . These words present_the question of sin in its human dimension : sin as an integral part of the truth_about man . But they immediately relate the human dimension to its divine dimension , where sin_-isaia- countered by the truth of divine_love , which_-isaia- just , generous and faithful , and which reveals itself above all in forgiveness and redemption . John also writes a little further on that '' whatever accusations our conscience may raise against us , God -isaia- greater_than our conscience . '' To acknowledge one s sin , indeed penetrating still more_deeply into the consideration of one_s_own personhood to recognize oneself as being a sinner , capable of sin and inclined to commit sin , -isaia- the essential first step in returning to God . For example , this_-isaia- the experience of David , who '' having done what_-isaia- evil in the eyes of the Lord '' and having_been rebuked by the prophet Nathan , exclaims : '' For I know my transgressions , and my sin_-isaia- ever before me . Against you , you alone , have I sinned and done what_-isaia- evil in your sight . '' Similarly , Jesus himself puts the following significant words on the lips and in the heart of the prodigal son : '' Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you . '' In effect , to become reconciled with God presupposes and includes detaching oneself consciously and with determination from the sin into which one_has fallen . It presupposes and includes , therefore , doing penance in the fullest sense of the term : repenting , showing this repentance , adopting a real attitude of repentance which_-isaia- the attitude of the person_who starts out on the road of return to the Father . This -isaia- a general law and one_which each_individual must follow in his or her particular situation . For it -isaia- not_possible to deal_with sin and conversion only in abstract terms . In the concrete circumstances of sinful humanity , in which_there can be no conversion without_the acknowledgment of one_s_own sin , the church s ministry of reconciliation intervenes in each_individual case with a precise penitential purpose . That -isaia- , the church s ministry intervenes in order to bring_the person to the '' knowledge of self '' in the words of St . Catherine of Siena to the rejection of evil , to the re establishment of friendship with God , to a new interior ordering , to a fresh ecclesial conversion . Indeed , even beyond_the boundaries of the church and the community of believers , the message and ministry of penance are addressed to all men_and_women , because all need conversion and reconciliation . In order to carry_out this penitential ministry adequately , we shall_have to evaluate the consequences of sin with '' eyes enlightened '' by faith . These consequences of sin are the reasons for division and rupture not_only within each_person , but_also within_the various circles of a person s life : in relation to the family , to the professional and social environment , as can often be seen from experience ; it -isaia- confirmed by the passage in the Bible about the city of Babel and its tower . Intent on building what_was to be -atti_degli_apostoli- once a symbol and a source of unity , those people found themselves more scattered than before , divided in speech , divided among_themselves , incapable of consensus and agreement . Why did the ambitious project fail ? Why did '' the builders labor in vain ? '' They failed because_they had set up as a sign and guarantee of the unity they desired a work of their_own hands alone and had forgotten the action of the Lord . They had attended only to the horizontal dimension of work and social_life , forgetting the vertical dimension by which they_would have_been rooted in God , their creator and Lord , and would_have been directed toward him as the ultimate goal of their progress . Now it can_be_said that the tragedy of humanity today , as indeed of every period in history , consists precisely in its similarity to the experience of Babel . CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF SIN If we read the passage in the Bible on the city and tower of Babel in the new light offered by the Gospel and if we compare it with the other passage on the fall of our_first parents , we can draw from it valuable elements for an understanding of the mystery of sin . This expression , which echoes what St . Paul writes concerning the mystery of evil , helps us to grasp the obscure and intangible element hidden in sin . Clearly sin_-isaia- a product of man s freedom . But deep within its human reality there_are factors -atti_degli_apostoli- work_which place it beyond_the merely human , in the border area where man s conscience , will and sensitivity are in contact_with_the dark forces which , according to St . Paul , are active in the world almost to the point of ruling it . Disobedience to God A first point which helps us to understand sin emerges from the biblical narrative on the building of the tower of Babel : The people sought to build a city , organize themselves into a society and to be strong and powerful without God , if not precisely against God . In this_sense the story of the first sin in Eden and the story of Babel , in spite of notable differences in content and form , have one_thing in common : In both there_-isaia- an exclusion of God through direct opposition to one of his commandments , through an act of rivalry , through the mistaken pretension of being '' like him . '' In the story of Babel the exclusion of God -isaia- presented not_so_much under the aspect of opposition to him as of forgetfulness and indifference toward him , as if God were of no relevance in the sphere of man s joint projects . But in both cases the relationship to God -isaia- severed with violence . In the case of Eden there appears in all its seriousness and tragic reality that_which constitutes the ultimate essence and darkness of sin : disobedience to God , to His law , to the mural norm that_he_has given man , inscribing it in his_heart and confirming and perfecting it through revelation . Exclusion of God , rupture with God , disobedience to God : Throughout the history of mankind this has_been and -isaia- , in various_forms , sin . It can go as far as a very denial of God and his existence : This -isaia- the phenomenon called atheism . It -isaia- the disobedience of a person_who , by a free act , does_not acknowledge God s sovereignty over his or her_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- least -atti_degli_apostoli- that particular moment in which he or she transgresses God s law . Division Between Brothers . In the biblical narratives mentioned above , man s rupture with God leads tragically to divisions between brothers . In the description of the '' first sin , '' the rupture with Yahweh simultaneously breaks the bond of friendship that had united the human_family . Thus the subsequent pages of Genesis show us the man and the woman as it were pointing an accusing finger -atti_degli_apostoli- each_other . Later we have_the brother hating his_brother and finally taking his_life . According to the Babel story , the result of sin_-isaia- the shattering of the human_family , already begun with the first sin and now reaching its most extreme form on the social level . No one wishing to investigate the mystery of sin can ignore this link between cause and effect . As a rupture with God , sin_-isaia- an act of disobedience by a creature who rejects , -atti_degli_apostoli- least implicitly , the very one from whom he came and who sustains him in life . It -isaia- therefore a suicidal act . Since by sinning man refuses to submit to God , his internal balance -isaia-_also destroyed and it -isaia- precisely within himself that contradictions and conflicts arise . Wounded in this_way , man almost inevitably causes damage to the fabric of his relationship_with others and with the created world . This -isaia- an objective law and an objective reality , verified in so many_ways in the human psyche and in the spiritual_life as well as in society , where it -isaia- easy to see the signs and effects of internal disorder . The mystery of sin_-isaia- composed of this twofold wound which_the sinner opens in himself and in his relationship_with his neighbor . Therefore one_can speak of personal and social sin : From one point_of_view , every sin_-isaia- personal ; from another point_of_view , every sin_-isaia- social insofar as and because it also_has social repercussions . Personal Sin and Social Sin . Sin , in the proper sense , -isaia- always a personal act , since_it_-isaia- an act of freedom on the part of an individual person and not properly of a group or community . This individual may be conditioned , incited and influenced by numerous and powerful external factors . He may also be subjected to tendencies , defects and habits linked_with his personal condition . In not_a_few cases such external and internal factors may attenuate , to a greater or lesser degree , the person s freedom and therefore his responsibility and guilt . But it -isaia- a truth of faith , also confirmed by our experience and reason , that the human person_-isaia- free . This truth cannot be disregarded in order to place the blame for individuals sins on external factors such as structures , systems or other people . Above all , this_would be to deny the person s dignity and freedom , which_are manifested even_though in a negative and disastrous way also in this responsibility_for sin committed . Hence there_-isaia-_nothing so personal and untransferable in each_individual as merit for virtue or responsibility_for sin . As a personal act , sin has its first and most important consequences in the sinner himself : that_-isaia- , in his relationship_with God , who_-isaia- the very foundation of human_life ; and also in his_spirit , weakening his_will and clouding his intellect . At this_point we must ask what_was being referred to by those_who during the preparation of the synod and in the course of its actual work frequently spoke of social sin . The expression and the underlying concept in fact have various meanings . To speak of social sin means in the first_place to recognize_that , by virtue of human solidarity which_-isaia- as mysterious and intangible as it -isaia- real and concrete , each_individual s sin in some_way affects others . This -isaia- the other aspect of that solidarity which on the religious level -isaia- developed in the profound and magnificent mystery of the communion of saints , thanks to which it has_been possible to say that '' every soul that rises above itself , raises up the world . '' To this_law of ascent there unfortunately corresponds the law of descent . Consequently one_can speak of a communion of sin , whereby a soul that lowers itself through sin drags down with itself the church and , in some_way , the whole_world . In other_words , there_-isaia- no sin , not_even the most intimate and secret one , the most strictly individual one , that exclusively concerns the person committing it . With greater or lesser violence , with_greater or lesser harm , every sin has repercussions on the entire ecclesial body and the whole human_family . According to this first meaning of the term , every sin can undoubtedly be considered as social sin . Some sins , however , by their_very matter constitute a direct attack on one s neighbor and more exactly , in the language of the Gospel , against one s brother or sister . They are an offense against God because_they_are offenses against one s neighbor . These sins are usually called social sins , and this_-isaia- the second meaning of the term . In this_sense social sin_-isaia- sin against love of neighbor , and in the law of Christ it -isaia- all the more_serious in that it involves the Second Commandment , which_-isaia- '' like unto the first . '' Likewise , the term social applies to every sin against justice in interpersonal relationships , committed either by the individual against the community or by the community against the individual . Also social -isaia- every sin against the rights of the human_person , beginning with the right to nd including the life of the unborn or against a person s physical integrity . Likewise social -isaia- every sin against others freedom , especially against the supreme freedom to believe in God and adore him ; social -isaia- every sin against the dignity and honor of one s neighbor . Also social -isaia- every sin against the common_good and its exigencies in relation to the whole broad spectrum of the rights_and_duties of citizens . The term social can be applied to sins of commission or omission on the part of political , economic or trade union leaders , who though in a position to do so , do not work diligently and wisely for the improvement and transformation of society according to the requirements and potential of the given historic moment ; as also on the part of workers who through absenteeism or non cooperation fail to ensure_that their industries can continue to advance the well_being of the workers themselves , of their_families and of the whole of society . The third meaning of social sin refers to the relationships between_the various human communities . These relationships are not_always in accordance_with_the plan of God , who intends that_there be justice in the world and freedom and peace between individuals , groups and peoples . Thus the class struggle , whoever the person_who leads it or on occasion seeks to give it a theoretical justification , -isaia- a social evil . Likewise obstinate confrontation between blocs of nations , between one nation and another , between different groups within_the same nation all this too -isaia- a social evil . In both cases one may ask whether moral responsibility_for these evils , and therefore sin , can be attributed to any person in particular . Now it has to be admitted that realities and situations such as those described , when_they become generalized and reach vast proportions as social phenomena , almost always become anonymous , just as their causes are complex and not_always identifiable . Hence if one speaks of social sin here , the expression obviously has an analogical meaning . However , to speak even analogically of social sins must_not cause us to underestimate the responsibility of the individuals involved . It -isaia- meant to be an appeal to the consciences of all , so that_each may shoulder his or her responsibility seriously and courageously in order to change those disastrous conditions and intolerable situations . Having said this in the clearest and most unequivocal way , one_must add -atti_degli_apostoli- once that_there_-isaia- one meaning sometimes given to social sin that_-isaia-_not legitimate or acceptable even_though it -isaia-_very common in certain quarters today . This usage contrasts social sin and personal sin , not_without ambiguity , in a way_that leads more_or_less unconsciously to the watering down and almost the abolition of personal sin , with the recognition only of social gilt and responsibilities . According to this usage , which_can readily be seen to derive from non Christian ideologies and systems which_have possibly been discarded today by the very people_who formerly officially upheld them practically every sin_-isaia- a social sin , in the sense_that blame for it -isaia- to be placed not_so_much on the moral conscience of an individual , but_rather on some vague entity or anonymous collectivity such as the situation , the system , society , structures or institutions . Whenever the church speaks of situations of sin or when_the condemns as social sins certain situations or the collective behavior of certain social groups , big or small , or even of whole nations and blocs of nations , she knows and she proclaims that_such cases of social sin are the result of the accumulation and concentration of many personal sins . It -isaia- a case of the very personal sins of those_who cause or support evil or who exploit it ; of those_who_are in a position to avoid , eliminate or -atti_degli_apostoli- least limit certain social evils but who fail to do so out of laziness , fear or the conspiracy of silence , through secret complicity or indifference ; of those_who take refuge in the supposed impossibility of changing the world and also of those_who sidestep the effort and sacrifice required , producing specious reasons of higher order . The real responsibility , then , lies with individuals . A situation or likewise an institution , a structure , society itself_-isaia- not in itself the subject of moral acts . Hence a situation cannot in itself be good or bad . At the heart of every situation of sin are always to be found sinful people . So true -isaia- this_that even_when such a situation can be changed in its structural and institutional aspects by the force of law or as unfortunately more often happens by the law of force , the change in fact proves to be incomplete , of short duration and ultimately vain and ineffective not to say counterproductive if the people directly or indirectly responsible_for that situation are_not converted . Mortal and Venial . But here we come to a further dimension in the mystery of sin , one on which_the human mind has_never ceased to ponder : the question of its gravity . It -isaia-_a_question which_cannot be overlooked and one_which the Christian conscience has_never refused to answer . Why and to what degree -isaia- sin a serious matter in the offense it commits against God and in its effects on man ? The church_has a teaching on this_matter which_she reaffirms in its essential elements , while recognizing that_it_-isaia- not_always easy in concrete situations to define clear and exact limits . Already in the Old Testament , individuals guilty of several kinds of sins sins committed deliberately , the various_forms of impurity , idolatry , the worship of false gods were ordered to be '' taken away from the people , '' which_could also mean to be condemned to death . Contrasted with_these were other sins especially sins committed through ignorance , that were forgiven by means of a sacrificial offering . In reference also to these texts , the church_has for centuries spoken of mortal sin and venial sin . But it -isaia- above all the New Testament that sheds light on this distinction and these terms . Here there_are_many passages which enumerate and strongly reprove sins that_are particularly deserving of condemnation . There -isaia-_also the confirmation of the Decalogue by Jesus himself . Here I wish to give special_attention to two passages that_are significant and impressive . In a text of his First Letter , St . John speaks of a sin which_leads to death pros thanaton , as opposed to a sin which_does_not lead to death me pros thanaton . Obviously , the concept of death here -isaia- a spiritual death . It -isaia-_a_question of the loss of the true life or '' eternal_life , '' which for John -isaia- knowledge of the Father and the Son , and communion and intimacy with_them . In that passage the sin that leads to death seems to be the denial of the Son or the worship of false gods . At any rate , by this distinction of concepts John seems to wish to emphasize the incalculable seriousness of what constitutes the very essence of sin , namely the rejection of God . This -isaia- manifested above all in apostasy and idolatry : repudiating faith in revealed_truth and making certain created realities equal to God , raising them to the status of idols or false gods . But in this passage the apostle s intention -isaia-_also to underline the certainty_that comes to the Christian from the fact of having_been '' born of God '' through the coming of the Son : The Christian possesses a power that preserves him from falling into sin ; God protects him , and '' the evil one does_not touch him . '' If he should sin through weakness or ignorance , he has confidence in being forgiven , also_because he -isaia- supported by the joint prayer of the community . In another passage of the New Testament , namely in St . Matthew s Gospel , Jesus himself speaks of a '' blasphemy against the Holy Spirit '' that '' will_not be forgiven '' by reason of the fact_that in its manifestation , it -isaia- an obstinate refusal to be converted to the love of the Father of mercies . Here of course it -isaia-_a_question of external radical manifestations : rejection of God , rejection of his_grace and therefore opposition to the very source of salvation these_are manifestations whereby a person seems to exclude himself voluntarily from the path of forgiveness . It -isaia- to be hoped that_very few persist to the end in this attitude of rebellion or even defiance of God . Moreover , God in his merciful love_-isaia- greater_than our_hearts , as St . John further teaches us , and can overcome all our psychological and spiritual resistance . Thomas writes , '' considering the omnipotence and mercy of God , no one_should despair of the salvation of anyone in this_life . '' But when we ponder the problem of a rebellious will meeting the infinitely just God , we cannot_but experience feelings of salutary '' fear and trembling , '' as St . Moreover , Jesus warning about the sin '' that_will not be forgiven '' confirms the existence of sins which_can bring down on the sinner the punishment of '' eternal death . '' In the light of these and other passages of sacred Scripture , doctors and theologians , spiritual teachers and pastors have divided sins into mortal and venial . Augustine , among others , speaks of letalia or mortifera crimina , contrasting them_with venialia , levia or quotidiana . The meaning which he gives to these adjectives was to influence the successive magisterium of the church . After him , it was St . Thomas who_was to formulate in the clearest possible terms the doctrine which became a constant in the church . In defining and distinguishing between mortal and venial sins , St . Thomas and the theology of sin that_has its source in him could_not be unaware of the biblical reference and therefore of the concept of spiritual death . Thomas , in order to live spiritually man must remain in communion with the supreme principle of life , which_-isaia- God , since God -isaia- the ultimate end of man s being and acting . Now sin_-isaia- a disorder perpetrated by the human_being against this_life principle . And when through sin , the soul commits a disorder that reaches the point of turning away form its ultimate end God to which_it_-isaia- bound by charity , then the sin_-isaia- mortal ; on the other_hand , whenever the disorder does_not reach the point of a turning away from God , the sin_-isaia- venial . '' For this_reason venial sin does_not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace , friendship with God , charity and therefore eternal happiness , whereas just such a deprivation -isaia- precisely_the consequence of mortal sin . Furthermore , when sin_-isaia- considered from the point_of_view of the punishment it merits , for St . Thomas and other doctors mortal sin_-isaia- the sin which , if unforgiven , leads to eternal punishment ; whereas venial sin_-isaia- the sin that merits merely temporal punishment that_-isaia- , a partial punishment which_can be expiated on earth or in purgatory . Considering sin from the point_of_view of its matter , the ideas of death , of radical rupture with God , the supreme good , of deviation from the path that leads to God or interruption of the journey toward him which_are all ways of defining mortal sin are linked_with the idea of the gravity of sin s objective content . Hence , in the church s doctrine and pastoral action , grave sin_-isaia- in practice identified with mortal sin . Here we have_the core of the church s traditional teaching , which_was reiterated frequently and vigorously during the recent synod . The synod in fact not_only reaffirmed the teaching of the Council of Trent concerning the existence and nature of mortal and venial sins , but it also recalled that mortal sin_-isaia- sin whose object -isaia- grave matter and which_-isaia- also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent . It must be added as was likewise done -atti_degli_apostoli- the synod that_some sins are intrinsically grave and mortal by reason of their matter . That -isaia- , there exist acts which , per se and in themselves , independently of circumstances , are always seriously wrong by reason of their object . These acts , if carried_out with sufficient awareness and freedom , are always gravely sinful . This doctrine , based on the Dccalogue and on the preaching of the Old Testament , and assimilated into the kerygma of the apostles and belonging to the earliest teaching_of_the_church , and constantly reaffirmed by her to this_day , -isaia- exactly verified in the experience of the men_and_women of all times . Man knows well by experience that along the road of faith and justice which_leads to the knowledge and love of God in this_life and toward perfect union with_him in eternity , he can cease to go forward or can go astray without abandoning the way of God ; and in this case there occurs venial sin . This however must_never be underestimated , as though it were automatically something_that can be ignored or regarded as '' a sin of little importance . '' For man also knows , through painful experience , that by a conscious and free act of his_will he can change course and go in a direction opposed to God s will , separating himself from God aversio a Deo , rejecting loving communion with_him , detaching himself from the life principle which God -isaia- and consequently choosing death . With the whole tradition_of_the_church , we call mortal sin the act by which_man freely and consciously rejects God , his law , the covenant of love_that God offers , preferring to turn in on himself or to some created and finite reality , something contrary to the divine will conversio ad creaturam . This can occur in a direct and formal way in the sins of idolatry , apostasy and atheism ; or in an equivalent way as in every act of disobedience to God s commandments in a grave matter . Man perceives that_this disobedience to God destroys the bond that unites him_with his_life principle : It -isaia- a mortal sin , that_-isaia- , an act which gravely offends God and ends in turning against man himself_with a dark and powerful force of destruction . During the synod_assembly some fathers proposed a threefold distinction of sins , classifying them as venial , grave and mortal . This threefold distinction might illustrate the fact that_there_-isaia- a scale of seriousness among grave sins . But it still remains true_that the essential and decisive distinction -isaia- between sin which destroys charity and sin which_does_not kill the supernatural life : There -isaia- no middle way between life and death . Likewise , care will_have to be taken not to reduce mortal sin to an act of '' fundamental option '' as -isaia- commonly said today against God , intending thereby an explicit and formal contempt for God or neighbor . For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly , for whatever reason , chooses something gravely disordered . In fact , such a choice already includes contempt for the divine_law , a rejection of God s love for_humanity and the whole of creation ; the person turns away from God and loses charity . Thus the fundamental orientation can be radically changed by individual acts . Clearly there_can occur situations which_are very complex and obscure from a psychological viewpoint and which_have an influence on the sinner s subjective culpability . But from a consideration of the psychological sphere one_cannot proceed to the construction of a theological category , which_-isaia- what_the '' fundamental option '' precisely -isaia- , understanding it in such_a_way_that it objectively changes or casts doubt upon the traditional concept of mortal sin . While every sincere and prudent attempt to clarify the psychological and theological mystery of sin_-isaia- to be valued , the church nevertheless has a duty to remind all scholars in this_field of the need to be faithful to the word of God that teaches us also about sin . She likewise has to remind them of the risk of contributing to a further weakening of the sense of sin in the modern_world . The Loss of the Sense of Sin . Over the course of generations , the Christian mind has gained from the Gospel as it -isaia- read in the ecclesial_community a fine sensitivity and an acute perception of the seeds of death contained in sin , as well as a sensitivity and an acuteness of perception for identifying them in the thousand guises under which sin shows itself . This -isaia- what_-isaia- commonly called the sense of sin . This sense -isaia- rooted in man s moral conscience and -isaia- as it were its thermometer . It -isaia- linked to the sense of God , since it derives from man s conscious relationship_with God as his Creator , Lord and Father . Hence , just as it -isaia- impossible to eradicate completely the sense of God or to silence the conscience completely , so the sense of sin_-isaia- never completely eliminated . Nevertheless , it happens not infrequently in history , for more_or_less lengthy periods and under the influence of many_different factors , that the moral conscience of many_people becomes seriously clouded . '' Have we the right idea of conscience ? '' I asked two years_ago in an address to the faithful '' Is it not true_that modern man_-isaia- threatened by an eclipse of conscience ? By a deformation of conscience ? By a numbness or deadening of conscience , '' Too many signs indicate that_such an eclipse exists in our_time . This -isaia- all the more disturbing in that conscience , defined by the council as '' the most secret core and sanctuary of a man , '' -isaia- '' strictly related to human_freedom . For this_reason conscience , to a great extent , constitutes the basis of man s interior dignity and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of his relationship to God . '' It -isaia- inevitable therefore that in this situation there_-isaia- an obscuring also of the sense of sin , which_-isaia- closely connected_with_the moral conscience , the search_for truth and the desire to make a responsible use of freedom . When the conscience -isaia- weakened the sense of God -isaia-_also obscured , and as a result , with the loss of this decisive inner point of reference , the sense of sin_-isaia- lost . This explains why my predecessor Pius XI , one_day declared , in words that_have almost become proverbial , that '' the sin of the century -isaia- the loss of the sense of sin . '' Why has this happened in our_time . A glance -atti_degli_apostoli- certain aspects of contemporary culture can_help us to understand_the progressive weakening of the sense of sin , precisely_because of the crisis of conscience and crisis of the sense of God already mentioned . '' Secularism '' -isaia- by nature and definition a movement of ideas and behavior which advocates a humanism totally without God , completely centered upon the cult of action and production and caught up in the heady enthusiasm of consumerism and pleasure seeking , unconcerned with the danger of '' losing one s soul . '' This secularism cannot_but undermine the sense of sin . At the very most , sin will be reduced to what offends man . But it -isaia- precisely here that_we_are faced_with the bitter experience which I already alluded to in my first encyclical namely_,_that man can build a world without God , but this_world will end by turning against him . '' In fact , God -isaia- the origin and the supreme end of man , and man carries in himself a divine seed . Hence it -isaia- the reality of God that reveals and illustrates the mystery of man . It -isaia- therefore vain to hope that_there will_take root a sense of sin against man and against human values , if there_-isaia- no sense of offense against God , namely the true sense of sin . Another reason_for the disappearance of the sense of sin in contemporary society_-isaia- to be found in the errors made in evaluating certain findings of the human sciences . Thus on the basis of certain affirmations of psychology , concern to avoid creating feelings of guilt or to place limits on freedom leads to a refusal ever to admit any shortcoming . Through an undue extrapolation of the criteria of the science of sociology , it finally happens as I have_already said_that all failings are blamed upon society , and the individual -isaia- declared innocent of them . Again , a certain cultural anthropology so emphasizes the undeniable environmental and historical conditioning and influences which act upon man , that it reduces his responsibility to the point of not acknowledging his ability to perform truly human acts and therefore his ability to sin . The sense of sin also easily declines as a result of a system of ethics deriving from a certain historical relativism . This may take the form of an ethical system which relativizes the moral norm , denying its absolute and unconditional value , and as a consequence denying that_there can be intrinsically illicit acts independent of the circumstances in which_they_are performed by the subject . Herein lies a real '' overthrowing and downfall of moral values , '' and '' the problem -isaia- not_so_much one of ignorance of Christian ethics , '' but ignorance '' rather of the meaning , foundations and criteria of the moral attitude . '' Another effect of this ethical turning upside down -isaia- always such an attenuation of the notion of sin as almost to reach the point of saying that sin does exist , but no one knows who commits it . Finally the sense of sin disappears when as can happen in the education of youth , in the mass_media and even in education within_the family it -isaia- wrongly identified with a morbid feeling of guilt or with the mere transgression of legal norms and precepts . The loss of the sense of sin_-isaia- thus a form or consequence of the denial of God : not_only in the form of atheism but_also in the form of secularism . If sin_-isaia- the breaking , off of one s filial relationship to God in order to situate one s life outside of obedience to him , then to sin_-isaia- not merely to deny God . To sin -isaia-_also to live as if he did not_exist , to eliminate him from one s daily_life . A model of society_which -isaia- mutilated or distorted in one sense or another , as -isaia-_often encouraged by the mass_media , greatly favors the gradual loss of the sense of sin . In such a situation the obscuring or weakening of the sense of sin comes_from several sources : from a rejection of any reference to the transcendent in the name of the individual s aspiration to personal independence ; from acceptance of ethical models imposed by general consensus and behavior , even_when condemned by the individual conscience ; from the tragic social_and_economic conditions that oppress a great part of humanity , causing a tendency to see errors and faults only in the context of society ; finally and especially , from the obscuring of the notion of God s fatherhood and dominion over man s life . Even in the field of the thought and life_of_the_church certain trends inevitably favor the decline of the sense of sin . For example , some are inclined to replace exaggerated attitudes of the past with_other exaggerations : From seeing sin everywhere they pass to not recognizing it anywhere ; from too much emphasis on the fear of eternal punishment they pass to preaching a love of God that excludes any punishment deserved by sin ; from severity in trying to correct erroneous consciences they pass to a kind of respect_for conscience which excludes the duty of telling the truth . And should it not be added that the confusion caused in the consciences of many of the faithful by differences of opinions and teachings in theology , preaching , catechesis and spiritual direction on serious and delicate questions of Christian morals ends by diminishing the true sense of sin almost to the point of eliminating it altogether ? Nor can certain deficiencies in the practice of sacramental penance be overlooked . These include the tendency to obscure the ecclesial significance of sin and of conversion and to reduce them to merely personal matters ; or vice versa , the tendency to nullify the personal value of good_and_evil and to consider only their community dimension . There also exists the danger , never totally eliminated , of routine ritualism that deprives the sacrament of its_full significance and formative effectiveness . The restoration of a proper sense of sin -isaia-_the_first way of facing the grave spiritual crisis looming over man today . But the sense of sin can_only be restored through a clear reminder of the unchangeable principles of reason and faith_which the moral teaching_of_the_church has_always upheld . There are good grounds for hoping that a healthy sense of sin will once_again flourish , especially in the Christian world and in the church . This will be aided by sound catechetics , illuminated by the biblical theology of the covenant , by an attentive listening and trustful openness to the magisterium of the church_,_which ; never ceases to enlighten consciences , and by an ever_more careful practice of the sacrament_of_penance . CHAPTER II '' MYSTERIUM PIETATIS '' . In order to understand sin we have_had to direct our attention to its_nature as made_known to us by the revelation of the economy of salvation : This -isaia- the mysterium iniquitatis . But in this economy sin_-isaia- not the main principle , still less the victor . Sin fights against another active principle which to use a beautiful and evocative expression of St . Paul we can call the mysterium or sacramentum pietatis . Man s sin would be the winner and in the end destructive , God s salvific plan would remain incomplete or even totally defeated , if this mysterium pietatis were_not made part of the dynamism of history in order to conquer man s sin . We find this expression in one of St . Paul s pastoral letters , the First Letter to Timothy . It appears unexpectedly , as if by an exuberant inspiration . The apostle had previously devoted long paragraphs of his message to his beloved disciple to an explanation of the meaning of the ordering of the community the liturgical order and the related hierarchical one . Next he had spoken of the role of the heads of the community , before turning to the conduct of Timothy himself in the church of the living God , the pillar and bulwark of the truth . '' Then -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the passage suddenly , but_with a profound purpose , he evokes the element which_gives meaning to everything_that he has written : '' Great indeed , we confess , -isaia- the mystery of our religion . '' Without in the least betraying the literal sense of the text , we can broaden this magnificent theological insight of St . Paul into a more complete vision of the role which_the truth proclaimed by him plays in the economy of salvation : '' Great indeed , '' we repeat with_him , '' -isaia- the mystery of our religion , '' because it conquers sin . But what_-isaia- the meaning of this expression , in Paul s mind ? It Is Christ Himself . It -isaia- profoundly significant that_when Paul presents this mysterium pietatis he simply transcribes , without making a grammatical link with what he has just written , three lines of a Christological hymn which in the opinion of authoritative scholars has used in the Greek speaking Christian communities . In the words of that hymn , full of theological content and rich in noble beauty , those first century believers professed their_faith in the mystery of Christ , whereby : He was_made manifest in the reality of human flesh and was constituted by the Holy Spirit as the Just One who offers himself for the unjust . He appeared to the angels , having_been made greater_than them , and he was preached to the nations as the bearer of salvation . He was believed in , in the world , as the one sent by the Father , and by the same Father assumed into_heaven as Lord . The mystery or sacrament of pietas , therefore , -isaia- the very mystery of Christ . It -isaia- , in a striking summary , the mystery_of_the_incarnation and redemption , of the full passover of Jesus , the Son of God and son of Mary : the mystery of his_passion and death , of his_resurrection and glorification . Paul in quoting the phrases of the hymn wished to emphasize was that this_mystery -isaia- the hidden vital principle which_makes the church the house of God , the pillar and bulwark of the truth . Following the Pauline teaching , we can affirm that_this same mystery of God s infinite loving kindness toward us -isaia- capable of penetrating to the hidden roots of our iniquity ! in order to evoke in the soul a movement of conversion , in order to redeem it and set it on course toward reconciliation . John too undoubtedly referring to this_mystery , but in his_own characteristic language which differs from St . Paul s , was able to write that '' anyone born of God does_not sin , but he who was_born of God keeps him , and the evil one does_not touch him . '' In this Johannine affirmation there_-isaia- an indication of hope , based on the divine promises : The Christian has_received the guarantee and the necessary strength not to sin . It -isaia- not a question therefore of a sinlessness acquired through one_s_own virtue or even inherent in man , as the Gnostics thought . It -isaia- a result of God s action . In order not to sin the Christian has knowledge of God , as St . John reminds us in this_same passage . But a little before he had written : '' No one born of God commits sin ; for God s seed abides in him . '' If by '' God s seed '' we understand , as some commentators suggest , Jesus the Son of God , then we can say that in order not to sin or in order to gain freedom from sin the Christian has within himself_the presence of Christ and the mystery of Christ , which_-isaia- the mystery of God s loving kindness . The Effort of the Christian . But there_-isaia- another aspect to the mysterium pietatis : The loving kindness of God toward_the Christian must be matched by the piety of the Christian toward God . In this second meaning of the word , piety eusebeia means precisely_the conduct of the Christian who responds to God s fatherly loving kindness with_his own filial Piety . In this_sense too we can say with St . Paul that '' great indeed -isaia- the mystery of our religion . In this_sense too piety , as a force for conversion and reconciliation , confronts iniquity and sin . In this case too the essential aspects of the mystery of Christ are the object of piety in the sense_that the Christian accepts the mystery , contemplates it and draws from it the spiritual strength necessary_for living according to the Gospel . Here too one_must say that '' no one born of God commits sin '' ; but the expression has an imperative sense : Sustained by the mystery of Christ as by an interior source of spiritual energy , the Christian , being a child of God , -isaia- warned not to sin and indeed receives the commandment not to sin but to live in a manner worthy of '' the house of God , that_-isaia- , the church of the living God . '' Toward a Reconciled Life . Thus the word of Scripture , as it reveals to us the mystery of pietas , opens the intellect to conversion and reconciliation , understood not as lofty abstractions but as concrete Christian values to be achieved in our daily lives . Deceived by the loss of the sense of sin and -atti_degli_apostoli- times tempted by an illusion of sinlessness which_-isaia-_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all Christian , the people of today too need to listen again to St . John s admonition , as addressed to each_one of them personally : '' If we say we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth_-isaia- not in us , '' and indeed , '' the whole world_-isaia- in the power of the evil one . '' Every individual therefore -isaia- invited by the voice of divine truth to examine realistically his or her conscience and to confess that he or she has_been brought forth in iniquity , as we say in the Miserere psalm . '' Nevertheless , though threatened by fear and despair , the people of today can feel uplifted by the divine promise which opens to them the hope of full reconciliation . The mystery of pietas , on God s part , -isaia- that mercy in which_our Lord and Father I repeat it again -isaia- infinitely rich . As I said in my encyclical on the subject of divine mercy , it -isaia- a love more powerful than sin , stronger than death . When we realize_that God s love for us does not_cease in the face of our sin or recoil before our offenses , but becomes even mere attentive and generous ; when we realize_that this_love went so far as cause the passion and death of the Word made_flesh who consented to redeem us -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his_own blood , then we exclaim in gratitude : '' Yes , the Lord -isaia- rich in mercy , n and even : '' The Lord -isaia- mercy . '' The mystery of pietas -isaia- the path opened by divine mercy to a reconciled life . PART THREETHE PASTORAL MINISTRY OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION Promoting Penance and Reconciliation . To evoke conversion and penance in man s heart and to offer him the gift of reconciliation -isaia- the specific mission_of_the_church as she continues the redemptive work of her_divine founder . It -isaia- not a mission which consists merely of a few theoretical statements and the putting forward of an ethical ideal unaccompanied by the energy with_which to carry it out . Rather it seeks to express itself in precise ministerial functions directed toward a concrete practice of penance and reconciliation . We can call this ministry , which_-isaia- founded on and illumined by the principles of faith which_we_have explained and which -isaia-_directed toward precise objectives and sustained by adequate means , the pastoral_activity of penance and reconciliation . Its point of departure -isaia-_the_church s conviction_that man , to whom every_form of pastoral_activity -isaia-_directed but principally that of penance and reconciliation , -isaia- the man marked by sin whose striking image -isaia- to be found in King David . Rebuked by the prophet Nathan , David faces squarely his_own iniquity and confesses : '' I have sinned against the Lord , '' and proclaims : '' I know my transgressions , and my sin_-isaia- ever before me . '' But he also prays : '' Purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean ; wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow , '' and he receives the response of the divine mercy : '' The Lord has put away your sin ; you shall_not die . '' The church thus finds herself face to face with_man with the whole_human world wounded by sin and affected by sin in the innermost depths of his being . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time he -isaia- moved by an unrestrainable desire to be freed from sin and , especially if he -isaia- a Christian , he -isaia- aware_that the mystery of pietas , Christ the Lord , -isaia-_already acting in him and in the world by the power of the redemption . The church s reconciling role must_therefore be carried_out in accordance_with that intimate link which closely connects the forgiveness and remission of the sin of each_person with the fundamental and full reconciliation of humanity which took_place with the redemption . This link helps us to understand_that , since sin_-isaia- the active principle of division division between man and the nature created by God only conversion from sin_-isaia- capable of bringing_about a profound and lasting reconciliation wherever division has penetrated . I do not need to repeat what I have_already said about the importance of this '' ministry of reconciliation , '' and of the pastoral_activity whereby it -isaia- carried_out in the church s consciousness and life . This pastoral_activity would be lacking an essential aspect of its being and failing in an indispensable function if the '' message of reconciliation '' were_not proclaimed with clarity and tenacity in season and out of season , and if the gift of reconciliation were_not offered to the world . But it -isaia- worth repeating that the importance of the ecclesial service of reconciliation extends beyond_the confines of the church to the whole_world . To speak of the pastoral_activity of penance and reconciliation , then , -isaia- to refer to all the tasks incumbent on the church , -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels , for their promotion . More concretely , to speak of this pastoral_activity -isaia- to evoke all the activities whereby_the church , through each_and_every one of her members pastors and faithful , -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels and in all spheres , and with all the means -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal , words and actions , teaching and prayer leads people individually or as groups to true penance and thus sets them on the path to full reconciliation . The fathers of the synod , as representatives of their brother bishops and as leaders of the people entrusted to them , concerned themselves_with the most practical and concrete elements of this pastoral_activity . And I -amos- happy to echo their concerns by associating myself with_their anxieties and hopes , by receiving the results of their research and experiences , and by encouraging them in their plans and achievements . May they find in this part of the present apostolic_exhortation the contribution which they_themselves made to the synod , a contribution the usefulness of which I wish to extend , through these pages , to the whole_church . I therefore propose to call attention to the essentials of the pastoral_activity of penance and reconciliation by emphasizing , with the synod_assembly , the following two points : The means used and the paths followed by the church in order to promote penance and reconciliation . The sacrament par excellence of penance and reconciliation . CHAPTER ONE THE PROMOTION OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION : WAYS AND MEANS . In order to promote penance and reconciliation , the church_has -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal two principal means which_were entrusted to her by her founder himself : catechesis and the sacraments . Their use has_always_been considered by the church as fully in harmony_with_the requirements of her salvific mission and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as corresponding to the requirements and spiritual needs of people in all ages . This use can be in forms and ways both old_and_new , among which it will be a good idea to remember in particular what we can call , in the expression of my predecessor Paul VI , the method of dialogue . For the church , dialogue -isaia- in a certain_sense a means and especially a way of carrying_out her activity in the modern_world . The Second Vatican Council proclaims that '' the church , by virtue of her_mission to shed on the whole_world the radiance of the gospel_message , and to unify under one Spirit all people . stands forth as a sign of that fraternal solidarity which allows honest dialogue and invigorates it . '' The council adds that_the_church should be capable of '' establishing an ever_more fruitful dialogue among all those_who compose the one people of God '' and also of '' establishing a dialogue_with human_society . '' My predecessor Paul VI devoted to dialogue a considerable part of his_first encyclical , Ecclesism Suam , in which he describes it and significantly characterizes it as the dialogue of salvation . The church in fact uses the method of dialogue in order the better to lead people both those_who through baptism and the profession_of_faith acknowledge their membership of the Christian community and also those_who_are outside to conversion and repentance , along the path of a profound renewal of their_own consciences and lives in the light of the mystery of the redemption and salvation accomplished by Christ and entrusted to the ministry of his_church . Authentic dialogue , therefore , -isaia- aimed above all -atti_degli_apostoli- the rebirth of individuals through interior conversion and repentance , but always with profound respect_for consciences and with patience and -atti_degli_apostoli- the step by step pace indispensable for modern conditions . Pastoral dialogue aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- reconciliation continues to be today a fundamental task of the church in different spheres and -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels . The church in the first_place promotes an ecumenical dialogue , that_-isaia- , with churches_and_ecclesial_communities which profess faith in Christ , the Son of God and only savior . She also promotes dialogue_with_the other communities of people_who_are seeking God and wish to have a relationship of communion with_him . At the basis of this dialogue_with_the other_churches and Christian communities and with the other_religions , and as a condition of her credibility and effectiveness , there_must be a sincere effort of permanent and renewed dialogue within_the Catholic Church herself . She -isaia- aware_that , by her nature , she_-isaia- the sacrament of the universal communion of charity ; but she_-isaia- equally aware of the tensions within her , tensions which risk becoming factors of division . The heartfelt and determined invitation which_was already extended by my predecessor in preparation_for the Holy Year -isaia-_also valid -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment . In order to overcome conflicts and to ensure_that normal tensions do not prove harmful to the unity_of_the_church , we must all apply to ourselves the word of God ; we must relinquish our_own subjective views and seek the truth where it -isaia- to be found , namely in the divine_word itself and in the authentic interpretation of that word provided by the magisterium of the church . In this light , listening to one_another , respect , refraining from all hasty judgments , patience , the ability to avoid subordinating the faith_which unites to the opinions , fashions and ideological choices which divide these_are all qualities of a dialogue within_the_church which_must be persevering , open and sincere . Obviously dialogue would_not have these qualities and would_not become a factor of reconciliation if the magisterium were_not heeded and accepted . Thus actively engaged in seeking her_own internal communion , the Catholic Church can address an appeal for reconciliation to the other_churches with which_there does not_exist full_communion , as well as to the other_religions and even to all those_who_are seeking God with a sincere heart . This she has_been doing for some time . In the light of the council and of the magisterium of my predecessors , whose precious inheritance I have_received and -amos- making every_effort to preserve and put into_effect , I can affirm that the Catholic Church -atti_degli_apostoli- every level -isaia- committed to frank ecumenical dialogue , without facile optimism but_also without distrust and without hesitation or delays . The fundamental laws which_she seeks to follow in this dialogue are , on the one_hand , the conviction_that only a spiritual ecumenism namely an ecumenism founded on common prayer and in a common docility to the one Lord enables us to make a sincere and serious response to the other exigencies of ecumenical action . The other law_-isaia- the conviction_that a certain facile irenicism in doctrinal and especially dogmatic matters could perhaps lead to a form of superficial and short lived coexistence , but it could_not lead to that profound and stable communion_which we all long for . This communion will be reached -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour willed by divine_providence . But in order to reach it , the Catholic Church , for_her part , knows that_she must be open and sensitive to all '' the truly Christian endowments from our_common heritage which_are to be found among our separated brethren '' ; but she also knows that_she must likewise base a frank and constructive dialogue upon a clarity regarding her_own positions and upon fidelity and consistency with the faith transmitted and defined in accordance_with_the perennial tradition of her magisterium . Notwithstanding the threat of a certain defeatism and despite the inevitable slowness which rashness could never correct , the Catholic Church continues with all other Christian brethren to seek the paths to unity , and with the followers of the other_religions she continues to seek to have sincere dialogue . May this inter religious dialogue lead to the overcoming of all attitudes of hostility , distrust , mutual condemnation and even mutual invective , which_-isaia- the precondition for encounter -atti_degli_apostoli- least in faith in one God and in the certainty of eternal_life for the immortal soul . May the Lord especially grant that ecumenical dialogue will_also lead to a sincere reconciliation concerning everything_that we already have in common with the other Christian churches faith in Jesus Christ , the Son of God made man , our_savior and Lord ; a listening to the word ; the study of revelation and the sacrament of baptism . To the extent to which_the_church -isaia- capable of generating active harmony unity in variety within herself and of offering herself as a witness to and humble servant of reconciliation with the other churches_and_ecclesial_communities and the other_religions , she becomes , in the expressive definition of St . Augustine , a '' reconciled world . '' Then she will_be_able to be a sign of reconciliation in the world and for the world . The church_-isaia- aware of the extreme seriousness of the situation created by the forces of division and war , which today constitute a grave threat not_only to the balance and harmony of nations but to the very survival of humanity , and she feels it her duty to offer and suggest her_own unique collaboration for the overcoming of conflicts and the restoration of concord . It -isaia- a complex and delicate dialogue of reconciliation in which_the_church -isaia- engaged , especially through the work of the Holy See and its different organisms . The Holy See already endeavors to intervene with the leaders of nations and the heads of the various international bodies or seeks to associate itself with_them , conduct a dialogue_with them and encourage them to dialogue_with one_another for the sake of reconciliation in the midst of the many conflicts . It does this not_for ulterior motives or hidden interests . since it has none but '' out of a humanitarian concern , '' placing its institutional structure and moral authority , which_are altogether unique , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of concord and peace . It does this in the conviction_that as '' in war two parties rise against one_another '' so '' in the question of peace there_are also necessarily two parties which_must know_how to commit themselves , '' and in this '' one finds the true meaning of a dialogue for peace . '' The church engages in dialogue for reconciliation also through the bishops in the competency and responsibility proper to them , either individually in the direct ; on of their_respective local_churches or united in their episcopal_conferences , with the collaboration of the priests and of all those_who make up the Christian communities . They truly fulfill their task when_they promote this indispensable dialogue and proclaim_the human and Christian need_for reconciliation and peace . In communion with_their pastors , the laity who_have as '' their_own field of evangelizing activity . the vast and complicated world of politics , society . and international life , '' are called_upon to engage directly in dialogue or to work_for dialogue aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- reconciliation . Through them too the church carries out her reconciling activity . Thus the fundamental presupposition and secure basis for_any lasting renewal of society and for peace between nations lies in the regeneration of hearts through conversion and penance . It should be repeated that , on the part_of_the_church and her members , dialogue , whatever form it takes and these forms can be and are_very diverse since_the very concept of dialogue has an analogical value can_never begin from an attitude of indifference to the truth . On the contrary , it must begin from a presentation of the truth , offered in a calm way , with_respect for the intelligence and consciences of others . The dialogue of reconciliation can_never replace or attenuate the proclamation of the truth of the Gospel , the precise goal of which_-isaia- conversion from sin and communion with Christ and the church . It must be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the transmission and realization of that_truth through the means left by Christ to the church_for the pastoral_activity of reconciliation , namely catechesis and penance . In the vast area in which_the_church has the mission of operating through dialogue , the pastoral_ministry of penance and reconciliation -isaia-_directed to the members of the body of the church principally through an adequate catechesis concerning the two distinct and complementary realities to which_the synod_fathers gave a particular importance and which_they emphasized in some of the concluding propositions : These are penance and reconciliation . Catechesis -isaia- therefore the first means to be used . At the basis of the synod s very opportune recommendation -isaia- a fundamental presupposition ; What -isaia- pastoral -isaia- not opposed to what_-isaia- doctrinal . Nor can pastoral action prescind from doctrinal content , from which in fact it draws its substance and real validity . Now if the church_-isaia- the pillar and bulwark of the truth and -isaia- placed in the world as mother and teacher , how could she neglect the task of teaching the truth_which constitutes a path of life ? From the pastors of the church one expects , first of all , catechesis on reconciliation . This must be founded on the teaching of the Bible , especially_the New Testament , on the need to rebuild the covenant with God in Christ the redeemer and reconciler . And in the light of this_new communion and friendship , and as an extension of it , it must be founded on the teaching concerning the need to be reconciled with one s brethren , even if this_means interrupting the offering of the sacrifice . Jesus strongly insists on this theme of fraternal reconciliation : for example , when he invites us to turn the other cheek to the one_who strikes us , and to give our cloak too to the one_who has_taken our coat , or when he instills the law of forgiveness : forgiveness which_each one receives in the measure that he or she foresee forgiveness to be offered even to enemies , forgiveness to be granted seventy times seven times , which means in practice without_any limit . On these conditions , which_are realizable only in a genuinely evangelical climate , it -isaia- possible to have a true reconciliation between individuals , families , communities , nations and peoples . From these biblical data on reconciliation there_will naturally derive a theological catechesis , which in its synthesis will_also integrate the elements of psychology , sociology and the other human sciences which_can serve to clarify situations , describe problems accurately and persuade listeners or readers to make concrete resolutions . The pastors of the church_are also expected to provide catechesis on penance . Here too the richness of the biblical message must be its source . With regard to penance this message emphasizes particularly its value for conversion , which_-isaia- the term that attempts to translate the word in the Greek text , metanoia , which literally means to allow the spirit to be overturned in order to make it turn toward God . These are_also the two fundamental elements which emerge from the parable of the son who_was lost and found : his '' coming to himself '' and his decision to return to his_father . There can be no reconciliation unless these attitudes of conversion come first , and catechesis should explain them_with concepts and terms adapted to people s various ages and their differing cultural , moral and social backgrounds . This -isaia- a first value of penance and it extends into a second : Penance also means repentance . The two meanings of metanoia appear in the significant instruction given by Jesus : '' If your brother repents returns to you , forgive him ; and if he sins against you seven times in the day , and turns to you seven times and says , I repent , you_must forgive him . '' A good catechesis will show how repentance , just like conversion , -isaia- far_from_being a superficial feeling but a real overturning of the soul . A third value -isaia- contained in penance , and this_-isaia- the movement whereby_the preceding attitudes of conversion and repentance are manifested externally : This -isaia- doing penance . This meaning -isaia- clearly perceptible in the term metanoia , as used by John the Baptist in the texts of the synoptics . To do penance means above all to restablish the balance and harmony broken by sin , to change direction even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of sacrifice . A catechesis on penance , therefore , and one that_-isaia- as complete and adequate as possible , -isaia- absolutely essential -atti_degli_apostoli- a time like ours when dominant attitudes in psychology and social behavior are in such contrast with the threefold value just illustrated . Contemporary man seems to find it harder than_ever to recognize his_own mistakes and to decide to retrace his steps and begin again after changing course . He seems very reluctant to say '' I repent '' or '' I -amos- sorry . '' He seems to refuse instinctively and often irresistibly anything that_-isaia- penance in the sense of a sacrifice accepted and carried_out for the correction of sin . In this_regard I would_like to emphasize that_the_church s penitential discipline , even_though it has_been mitigated for some time , cannot be abandoned without grave harm both to the interior life of individual Christians and of the ecclesial_community and also to their capacity_for missionary influence . It -isaia- not uncommon for non Christians to be surprised -atti_degli_apostoli- the negligible witness of true penance on the part of Christ s followers . It -isaia- clear , however_,_that Christian penance will only be authentic if it -isaia- inspired by love and not by mere fear ; if it consists in a serious effort to crucify the '' old man '' so that the '' new '' can be born by the power of Christ ; if it takes as its model Christ , who though he was innocent chose the path of poverty , patience , austerity and , one_can say , the penitential life . As the synod recalled , the pastors of the church_are also expected to provide catechesis on conscience and its formation . This too -isaia- a very relevant topic in view of the fact_that in the upheavals to which_our present culture -isaia- subjected this interior sanctuary , man s innermost self , his conscience , -isaia- too_often attacked , put to the test , confused and obscured . Valuable guidelines for a wise catechesis on conscience can be found both in the doctors of the church and in the theology of the Second Vatican Council , and especially in the documents on the church_in_the_modern_world and on religious liberty . Along these same lines , Pope Paul VI often reminded us of the nature and role of conscience in our life . I myself , following his footsteps , miss no opportunity to throw light on this_most lofty element of man s greatness and dignity , this '' sort of moral sense which_leads us to discern what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . like an inner eye , a visual capacity of the spirit , able to guide our steps along the path of good . '' And I have reiterated the need to form one s conscience , lest it become '' a force which_-isaia- destructive of the true humanity of the person , rather_than that holy place_where God reveals to him his true good . '' On other points too , of no less relevance for reconciliation , one looks to the pastors of the church_for catechesis . On the sense of sin , which , as I have_said , has become considerably weakened in our_world . On temptation and temptations : The Lord Jesus himself , the Son of God , '' who in every respect has_been tempted as we are , yet without sin , '' allowed himself to be tempted by the evil one in order to show that , like himself , his followers too would be subjected to temptation , and in order to show how one_should behave when subjected to temptation . For those_who beseech the Father not to be tempted beyond their_own strength and not to succumb to temptation , and for those who_do_not expose themselves to occasions of sin , being subjected to temptation does_not_mean that_they_have sinned ; rather it -isaia- an opportunity_for growing in fidelity and consistency through humility and watchfulness . Catechesis -isaia-_also expected on fasting : This can be practiced in old forms and new as a sign of conversion , repentance and personal mortification and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , as a sign of union with Christ crucified and of solidarity with the starving and suffering . Catechesis on almsgiving : This -isaia- a means of making charity a practical thing by sharing what one possesses with_those suffering the consequences of poverty . Catechesis on the intimate connection which links the overcoming of divisions in the world with perfect communion with God and among people , which_-isaia- the eschatological purpose of the church . Catechesis on the concrete circumstances in which reconciliation has to be achieved in the family , in the civil community , in social structures and particularly catechesis on the four reconciliations which repair the four fundamental rifts ; reconciliation of man with God , with self , with the brethren and with the whole of creation . Nor can the church omit , without serious mutilation of her essential message , a constant catechesis on what_the traditional Christian language calls the four last things of man : death , judgment universal and particular , hell and heaven . In a culture which tends to imprison man in the earthly life -atti_degli_apostoli- which he -isaia- more_or_less successful , the pastors of the church_are asked to provide a catechesis which_will reveal and illustrate with the certainties of faith what comes after_the present life : beyond_the mysterious gates of death , an eternity of joy in communion with God or the punishment of separation from him . Only in this eschatological vision can one realize the exact nature of sin and feel decisively moved to penance and reconciliation . Pastors who_are zealous and creative never lack opportunities_for imparting this broad and varied catechesis , taking into_account_the different degrees of education and religious formation of those_to_whom they speak . Such opportunities are_often given by the biblical readings and the rites of the Mass and the sacraments , as also by the circumstances of their celebration . For the same purpose many initiatives can be taken such as sermons , lectures , discussions , meetings , courses of religious education , etc . , as happens in many places . Here I wish to point_out in particular the importance and effectiveness of the old style popular missions for the purposes of such catechesis . If adapted to the peculiar needs of the present_time , such missions can be , today as yesterday , a useful instrument of religious education also regarding penance and reconciliation . In view of the great relevance of reconciliation based on conversion in the delicate field of human relationships and social interaction -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels , including the international level , catechesis cannot_fail to inculcate the valuable contribution of the church_s_social teaching . The timely and precise teaching of my predecessors from Pope Leo XIII onward , to which_was added the substantial contribution the pastoral_constitution Gaudium et Spes of the Second Vatican Council and the contributions of the different episcopates elicited by various circumstances in their_respective countries , has made up an ample and solid body of doctrine . This regards the many_different needs inherent in the life of the human community , in relationships between individuals , families , groups in their different spheres and in the very constitution of a society that intends to follow_the moral_law , which_-isaia- the foundation of civilization . At the basis of this social teaching_of_the_church there_-isaia- obviously to be found the vision which_the_church draws from the word of God concerning the rights_and_duties of individuals , the family and the community ; concerning the value of liberty and the nature of justice , concerning the primacy of charity , concerning the dignity_of_the_human_person and the exigencies of the common_good to which politics and the economy itself must be directed . Upon these fundamental principles of the social magisterium , which confirm and repropose the universal dictates of reason and of the conscience of peoples , there rests in great part the hope_for a peaceful solution to many social conflicts and , in short , the hope_for universal reconciliation . The second divinely instituted means which_the_church offers for the pastoral_activity of penance and reconciliation -isaia- constituted by the sacraments . In the mysterious dynamism of the sacraments , so rich in symbolism and content , one_can discern one aspect which_-isaia-_not always emphasized : Each sacrament , over and above its_own proper grace , -isaia-_also a sign of penance and reconciliation . Therefore in each of them it -isaia- possible to relive these dimensions of the spirit . Baptism -isaia- of course a salvific washing which , as St Peter says , -isaia- effective '' not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience . '' It -isaia- death , burial and resurrection with the dead , buried and risen Christ . It -isaia-_a_gift of the Holy Spirit through Christ . But this essential and original constituent of Christian baptism , far from eliminating the penitential element already present in the baptism which Jesus himself received_from John '' to fulfill all righteousness , '' in fact enriches it . In other_words , it -isaia- a fact of conversion and of reintegration into the right order of relationships with God , of reconciliation with God , with the elimination of the original stain and the consequent introduction into the great family of the reconciled . Confirmation likewise , as a ratification of baptism and together_with baptism a sacrament of initiation , in conferring the fullness of the Holy Spirit and in bringing the Christian life to maturity , signifies and accomplishes thereby a greater conversion of the heart and brings about a more intimate and effective membership of the same assembly of the reconciled , which_-isaia-_the_church of Christ . The definition which St . Augustine gives of the eucharist as '' sacramentum pietatis , signum unitatis , vinculum caritatis '' clearly illustrates the effects of personal sanctification pietas and community reconciliation unitas and caritas which derive from the very essence of the eucharistic mystery as an unbloody renewal of the sacrifice of the cross , the source of salvation and of reconciliation for all people . However , it must be remembered that_the_church , guided by faith in this_great sacrament , teaches_that no Christian who_-isaia- conscious of grave sin can receive the eucharist before having obtained God s forgiveness . This we read in the instruction Eucharisticum Mysterium which , duly approved by Paul VI , fully confirms the teaching of the Council of Trent : '' The eucharist_-isaia- to be offered to the faithful also as a remedy , which frees us from daily faults and preserves us from mortal sin and they_are to be shown the fitting way of using the penitential parts of the liturgy of the Mass . The person_who wishes to receive holy communion_-isaia- to be reminded of the precept : Let a man examine himself '' Cor : . And the church s custom shows_that such an examination -isaia- necessary , because no one_who_-isaia- conscious of being in mortal sin , however contrite he may believe himself to be , -isaia- to approach the holy_eucharist without having first made a sacramental confession . If this person finds himself in need and has no means of going to confession , he should first make an act of perfect contrition . '' The sacrament of orders -isaia- intended to give to the church the pastors who , besides being teachers and guides , are_called to be witnesses and workers of unity , builders of the family of God , and defenders and preservers of the communion of this family against the sources of division and dispersion . The sacrament of matrimony , the exaltation of human love under the action of grace , -isaia- a sign of the love of Christ for the church . But it -isaia-_also a sign of the victory which Christ grants to couples in resisting the forces which deform and destroy love , in order_that the family born from this_sacrament may be a sign also of the reconciled and reconciling church_for a world reconciled in all its structures and institutions . Finally , the anointing of the sick in the trial of illness and old age and especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the Christian s final hour -isaia- a sign of definitive conversion to the Lord and of total acceptance of suffering and death as a penance for sins . And in this_-isaia- accomplished supreme reconciliation with the Father . However , among the sacraments there_-isaia-_one which , though it has often been_called the sacrament of confession because of the accusation of sins which takes_place in it , can more appropriately be considered by antonomasia the sacrament_of_penance , as it -isaia-_in_fact called . And thus it -isaia- the sacrament of conversion and reconciliation . The recent synod particularly concerned itself with this_sacrament because of its importance with_regard to reconciliation . CHAPTER TWO THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION . In all its phases and -atti_degli_apostoli- all its levels the synod considered with the greatest attention that sacramental sign which represents and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time accomplishes penance and reconciliation . This sacrament in itself certainly does_not contain all possible ideas of conversion and reconciliation . From the very_beginning , in fact , the church_has recognized and used many and varying forms of penance . Some are liturgical or paraliturgical and include the penitential actin the Mass , services of atonement and pilgrimages ; others are of an ascetical character , such as fasting . But of all such acts none -isaia- more significant , more divinely efficacious or more lofty and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time easily accessible as a rite than the sacrament_of_penance . From its preparatory stage and then in the numerous interventions during the sessions , in the group meetings and in the final propositions , the synod took into_account_the statement frequently made with varying nuances and emphases , namely : The sacrament_of_penance -isaia- in crisis . The synod took note of this crisis . It recommended a more profound catechesis , but it also recommended a no less profound analysis of a theological , historical , psychological , sociological and juridical character of penance in general and of the sacrament_of_penance in particular . In all of this_the synod s intention was to clarify the reasons for the crisis and to open the way to a positive solution for the good of humanity . Meanwhile , from the synod itself the church has_received a clear confirmation of its faith regarding the sacrament which_gives to every Christian and to the whole community of believers the certainty of forgiveness through the power of the redeeming blood of Christ . It -isaia- good to renew and reaffirm this faith -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment when it might be weakening , losing something of its completeness or entering into an area of shadow and silence , threatened as it -isaia- by the negative elements of the above mentioned crisis . For the sacrament of confession -isaia- indeed being undermined , on the one_hand by the obscuring of the mortal and religious conscience , the lessening of a sense of sin , the distortion of the concept of repentance and the lack of effort to live an authentically Christian life . And on the other_hand , it -isaia- being undermined by the sometimes widespread idea that_one can obtain forgiveness directly from God , even in a habitual way , without approaching the sacrament of reconciliation . A further negative influence -isaia- the routine of a sacramental practice sometimes lacking in fervor and real spontaneity , deriving perhaps from a mistaken and distorted idea of the effects of the sacrament . It -isaia- therefore appropriate to recall_the principal aspects of this_great sacrament . '' Whose Sins You Shall Forgive '' . The books of the Old and New Testament provide us with the first and fundamental fact concerning the Lord s mercy and forgiveness . In the Psalms and in the preaching of the prophets , the name merciful -isaia- perhaps the one most often given to the Lord , in contrast to the persistent cliche whereby_the God of the Old Testament -isaia- presented above all as severe and vengeful . Thus in the Psalms there_-isaia- a long sapiential passage drawing from the Exodus tradition , which recalls God s kindly action in the midst of his_people . This action , though represented in an anthropomorphic way , -isaia- perhaps one_of_the_most eloquent Old Testament proclamations of the divine mercy . Suffice it to quote the verse : '' Yet he , being compassionate , forgave their iniquity and did_not destroy them ; he restrained his anger often , and did_not stir up all his wrath . He remembered that_they were but flesh , a wind that passes and comes not again . '' In the fullness_of_time the Son of God , coming as the lamb who takes away and bears upon himself_the sin of the world appears as the one_who has the power both to judge and to forgive sins , and who_has come not to condemn but to forgive and save . Now this_power to '' forgive sins '' Jesus confers through the Holy Spirit upon ordinary men , themselves subject to the snare of sin , namely his_apostles : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . Whose sins you shall forgive , they_are forgiven ; whose sins you shall retain , they_are retained . '' This -isaia- one_of_the_most awe inspiring innovations of the Gospel ! He confers this_power on the apostles also as something which_they can transmit as the church_has understood it from the beginning to their successors , charged by the same apostles with the mission and responsibility of continuing their_work as proclaimers of the Gospel and ministers of Christ s redemptive work . Here there_-isaia- seen in all its grandeur the figure of the minister of the sacrament_of_penance who by very ancient custom -isaia- called the confessor . Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar where he celebrates the eucharist and just as in each_one of the sacraments , so the priest , as the minister of penance , acts '' in persona Christi '' The Christ whom he makes present and who accomplishes the mystery of the forgiveness of sins -isaia- the Christ who appears as the brother of man , the merciful high_priest , faithful and compassionate , the shepherd intent on finding the lost sheep , the physician who heals and comforts , the one master who teaches the truth and reveals the ways of God , the judge of the living and the dead , who judges according to the truth and not according to appearances . This -isaia- undoubtedly the most difficult and sensitive , the most exhausting and demanding ministry of the priest , but_also one_of_the_most beautiful and consoling . Precisely for this_reason and with awareness also of the strong recommendation of the synod , I will_never grow weary of exhorting my brothers , the bishops and priests , to the faithful and diligent performance of ministry . Before the consciences of the faithful , who open up to him_with a mixture of fear and trust , the confessor -isaia- called to a lofty task which_-isaia- one of service and penance and human reconciliation . It -isaia- a task of learning the weaknesses and falls of those faithful people , assessing their desire_for renewal and their_efforts to achieve it , discerning the action of the Holy Spirit in their_hearts , imparting to them a forgiveness which God alone_can grant , '' celebrating '' their reconciliation with the Father , portrayed in the parable of the prodigal son , reinstating these redeemed sinners in the ecclesial_community with_their brothers_and_sisters , and paternally admonishing these penitents with a firm , encouraging and friendly '' Do not sin again . '' For the effective performance of this ministry , the confessor must necessarily have human qualities of prudence , discretion , discernment and a firmness tempered by gentleness and kindness . He must likewise have a serious and careful preparation , not fragmentary but complete and harmonious , in the different branches of theology , pedagogy and psychology , in the methodology of dialogue and above all in a living and communicable knowledge of the word of God . But it -isaia- even_more necessary_that he should live an intense and genuine spiritual_life . In order to lead others along the path of Christian perfection the minister of penance himself must first travel this path . More by actions than by long speeches he must give proof of real experience of lived prayer , the practice of the theological and moral virtues of the Gospel , faithful obedience to the will of God , love of the church and docility to her magisterium . All this fund of human gifts , Christian virtues and pastoral capabilities has to be worked for and -isaia- only acquired with effort . Every priest must be trained for the ministry of sacramental penance from his years in the seminary , not_only through the study of dogmatic , moral , spiritual and pastoral theology which_are simply parts of a whole , but_also through the study of the human sciences , training in dialogue and especially in how to deal_with people in the pastoral context . He must then be guided and looked after in his_first activities . He must_always ensure his_own improvement and updating by means of permanent study . What a wealth of grace , true life and spiritual radiation would be poured out on the church if every priest were careful never to miss through negligence or various excuses the appointment with the faithful in the confessional and if he were even_more careful never to go to it unprepared or lacking the necessary human qualities and spiritual and pastoral preparation ! In this_regard I cannot_but recall with devout admiration those extraordinary apostles of the confessional such as St . Joseph Cafasso and St . Leopold of Castelnuovo , to mention only the best known confessors whom_the church_has added to the list of her saints . But I also wish to pay homage to the innumerable host of holy and almost always anonymous confessors to whom -isaia- owed the salvation of so many souls who_have_been helped by them in conversion , in the struggle against sin and temptation , in spiritual progress and , in a word , in achieving holiness . I do not_hesitate to say that_even the great canonized saints are generally the fruit of those confessionals , and not_only the saints but_also the spiritual patrimony of the church and the flowering of a civilization permeated with the Christian spirit ! Praise then to this silent army of our_brothers who_have served well and serve each_day the cause of reconciliation through the ministry of sacramental penance ! The Sacrament of Forgiveness . From the revelation of the value of this ministry and power to forgive sins , conferred by Christ on the apostles and their successors , there developed in the church an awareness of the sign of forgiveness , conferred through the sacrament_of_penance . It -isaia- the certainty_that the Lord Jesus himself instituted and entrusted to the church as a gift of his goodness and loving kindness to be offered to all a special sacrament for the forgiveness of sins committed after baptism . The practice of this_sacrament , as regards its celebration and form , has undergone a long process of development as -isaia- attested to by the most ancient sacramentaries , the documents of councils and episcopal synods , the preaching of the fathers and the teaching of the doctors of the church . But with_regard to the substance of the sacrament there has_always remained firm and unchanged in the consciousness of the church the certainty_that , by the will of Christ , forgiveness -isaia- offered to each_individual by means of sacramental absolution given by the ministers of penance . It -isaia- a certainty reaffirmed with particular vigor both by the Council of Trent and by the Second Vatican Council : '' Those who approach the sacrament_of_penance obtain pardon from God s mercy for the offenses committed against him , and are , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , reconciled with the church which_they_have wounded by their sins and which by charity , by example and by prayer works for their conversion . '' And as an essential element of faith concerning the value and purpose of penance it must be reaffirmed that our_savior Jesus Christ instituted in his_church the sacrament_of_penance so that_the_faithful who_have fallen into sin after baptism might receive grace and be reconciled with God The church s faith in this_sacrament involves certain other fundamental truths_which cannot be disregarded . The sacramental rite of penance , in its evolution and variation of actual forms , has_always preserved and highlighted these truths . When it recommended a reform of this rite , the Second Vatican Council intended to ensure_that it would express these truths even more_clearly , and this_has come about with the new Rite of Penance . For the latter has made its_own the whole of the teaching brought together by the Council of Trent , transferring it from its particular historical context that of a resolute effort to clarify doctrine in the face of the serious deviations from the church s genuine teaching , in order to translate it faithfully into terms more in keeping_with_the context of our own_time . Some Fundamental Convictions . The truths mentioned above , powerfully and clearly confirmed by the synod and contained in the propositions , can be summarized in the following convictions of faith , to which_are connected all the other affirmations of the Catholic doctrine on the sacrament_of_penance . The first conviction -isaia- that_for a Christian the sacrament_of_penance -isaia- the primary way of obtaining forgiveness and the remission of serious sin committed after baptism . Certainly the Savior and his salvific action are_not so bound to a sacramental sign as to be unable in any period or area of the history_of_salvation to work outside and above the sacraments . But in the school of faith we learn that the same Savior desired and provided_that the simple and precious sacraments of faith would ordinarily be the effective means through_which his redemptive power passes and operates . It would therefore be foolish , as well as presumptuous , to wish arbitrarily to disregard the means of grace and salvation which_the Lord has provided and , in the specific case , to claim to receive forgiveness while doing without_the sacrament which_was instituted by Christ precisely for forgiveness . The renewal of the rites carried_out after_the council does_not sanction any illusion or alteration in this direction . According to the church s intention , it was and -isaia- meant to stir up in each_one of us a new impulse toward_the renewal of our interior attitude ; toward a deeper_understanding of the nature of the sacrament_of_penance ; toward a reception of the sacrament which_-isaia- more filled_with faith , not anxious but trusting ; toward a more frequent celebration of the sacrament which_-isaia- seen to be completely filled_with_the Lord s merciful love . The second conviction concerns the function of the sacrament_of_penance for those_who_have recourse to it . According to the most ancient traditional idea , the sacrament -isaia- a kind of judicial action ; but_this takes_place before a tribunal of mercy rather_than of strict and rigorous justice , which_-isaia- comparable to human tribunals only by analogy namely insofar as sinners reveal their sins and their condition as creatures subject to sin ; they commit themselves to renouncing and combating sin ; accept the punishment sacramental penance which_the confessor imposes on them and receive absolution from him . But as it reflects on the function of this_sacrament , the church s consciousness discerns in it , over and above the character of judgment in the sense just mentioned , a healing of a medicinal character . And this_-isaia- linked to the fact_that the Gospel frequently presents Christ as healer , while his redemptive work -isaia-_often called , from Christian antiquity , medicina salutis . '' I wish to heal , not accuse , '' St . Augustine said , referring to the exercise of the pastoral_activity regarding penance , and it -isaia- thanks to the medicine of confession that the experience of sin does_not degenerate into despair . The Rite of Penance alludes to this healing aspect of the sacrament , to which modern man_-isaia- perhaps more sensitive , seeing as he does in sin the element of error but even_more the element of weakness and human frailty . Whether as a tribunal of mercy or a place of spiritual healing , under both aspects the sacrament requires a knowledge of the sinner s heart in order to be able to judge and absolve , to cure and heal . Precisely for this_reason_the sacrament involves on the part of the penitent a sincere and complete confession of sins . This therefore has a raison d etre not_only inspired by ascetical purposes as an exercise of humility and mortification , but_one that_-isaia- inherent in the very nature of the sacrament . The third conviction , which_-isaia- one_that I wish to emphasize , concerns the realities or parts which_make up the sacramental sign of forgiveness and reconciliation . Some of these realities are acts of the penitent , of varying importance but each indispensable either for the validity , the completeness or the fruitfulness of the sign . First of all , an indispensable condition -isaia- the rectitude and clarity of the penitent s conscience . People cannot come to true and genuine repentance until they realize_that sin_-isaia- contrary to the ethical norm written in their in most being ; until they admit that_they_have had a personal and responsible experience of this contrast ; until they_say not_only that '' sin exists '' but_also '' I have sinned '' ; until they admit that sin has introduced a division into_their consciences which then pervades their whole being and separates them_from God and from their brothers_and_sisters . The sacramental sign of this clarity of conscience -isaia- the act traditionally called the examination of conscience , an act that must_never be one of anxious psychological introspection , but a sincere and calm comparison with the interior moral_law , with the evangelical norms proposed by the church , with Jesus Christ himself , who -isaia-_our teacher and model of life , and with the heavenly Father , who calls us to goodness and perfection . But the essential act of penance , on the part of the penitent , -isaia- contrition , a clear and decisive rejection of the sin committed , together_with a resolution not to commit it again , out of the love_which one_has for God and which_-isaia- reborn with repentance . Understood in this_way , contrition -isaia- therefore the beginning and the heart of conversion , of that evangelical metanoia which brings the person back to God like the prodigal son returning to his_father , and which_has in the sacrament_of_penance its visible sign and which perfects attrition . Hence '' upon this contrition of heart depends the truth of penance . '' While reiterating everything_that the church , inspired by God s word , teaches about contrition , I particularly wish to emphasize here just one aspect of this_doctrine . It -isaia- one_that should be better known and considered . Conversion and contention are_often considered under the aspect of the undeniable demands which_they involve and under the aspect of the mortification which_they impose for the purpose of bringing_about a radical change of life . But we all to well to recall and emphasize the fact_that contrition and conversion are even_more a drawing near to the holiness of God , a rediscovery of one s true identity , which_has_been upset and disturbed by sin , a liberation in the very depth of self and thus a regaining of lost joy , the joy of being saved , which_the majority of people in our_time are no longer capable of experiencing . We therefore understand why , from the earliest Christian times , in line with the apostles and with Christ , the church_has included in the sacramental sign of penance the confession of sins . This latter takes on such importance that_for centuries the usual name of the sacrament has_been and still -isaia- that of confession . The confession of sins -isaia- required , first of all , because the sinner must be known by the person_who in the sacrament exercises the role of judge . He has to evaluate both the seriousness of the sins and the repentance of the penitent ; he also exercises the role of the healer and must acquaint himself_with the condition of the sick person in order to treat and heal him . But the individual confession also_has the value of a sign : a sign of the meeting of the sinner with the mediation of the church in the person of the minister , a sign of the person s revealing of self as a sinner in the sight of God and the church , . of facing his_own sinful condition in the eyes of God . The confession of sins therefore cannot be reduced to a mere attempt -atti_degli_apostoli- psychological self liberation even_though it corresponds to that legitimate and natural need , inherent in the human_heart , to open oneself to another . It -isaia- a liturgical act , solemn in its dramatic nature , yet humble and sober in the grandeur of its meaning . It -isaia- the act of the prodigal son who returns to his Father and -isaia- welcomed by him_with the kiss of peace . It -isaia- an act of honesty and courage . It -isaia- an act of entrusting oneself , beyond sin , to the mercy that forgives . Thus we understand why_the confession of sins must ordinarily be individual not collective , just as sin_-isaia- a deeply personal matter . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time this confession in a way forces sin out of the secret of the heart and thus out of the area of pure individuality , emphasizing its social character as well , for through the minister of penance it -isaia- the ecclesial_community , which_has_been wounded by sin , that welcomes anew the repentant and forgiven sinner . The other essential stage of the sacrament_of_penance this_time along to the confessor as judge and healer , a figure of God the Father welcoming and forgiving the one_who returns : This -isaia- the absolution . The words_which express it and the gestures that accompany it in the old and in the new Rite of Penance are significantly simple in their grandeur . The sacramental formula '' I absolve you '' and the imposition of the hand and the Sign of the Cross made over the penitent show that -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment the contrite and converted sinner comes into contact_with_the power and mercy of God . It -isaia- the moment -atti_degli_apostoli- which , in response to the penitent , the Trinity becomes present in order to blot out sin and restore innocence . And the saving power of the passion , death_and_resurrection of Jesus -isaia-_also imparted to the penitent as the '' mercy stronger than sin and offense , '' as I defined it in my encyclical Dives in Misericordia . God -isaia- always the one_who_-isaia- principally offended by sin '' Tibi soli peccavi ! '' and God alone_can forgive . Hence the absolution that the priest , the minister of forgiveness , though himself a sinner , grants to the penitent -isaia- the effective sign of the intervention of the Father in every absolution and the sign of the '' resurrection '' from '' spiritual death '' which_-isaia- renewed each time that the sacrament_of_penance -isaia- administered . Only faith can_give us certainty_that -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment every sin_-isaia- forgiven and blotted out by the mysterious intervention of the Savior . Satisfaction -isaia- the final act which crowns the sacramental sign of penance . In some_countries the act which_the forgiven and absolved penitent agrees to perform after receiving absolution -isaia- called precisely_the penance . What -isaia- the meaning of this satisfaction that_one makes or the penance that_one performs ? Certainly it -isaia- not a price that_one pays for the sin absolved and for the forgiveness obtained : No human price can match what_-isaia- obtained , which_-isaia- the fruit of Christ s precious blood . Acts of satisfaction which , while remaining simple and humble , should be made to express more_clearly all that_they signify mean a number of valuable things : They are the sign of the personal commitment that the Christian has made to God in the sacrament to begin a new_life and therefore they_should not be reduced to mere formulas to be recited , but should consist of acts of worship , charity , mercy or reparation . They include the idea that the pardoned sinner -isaia- able to join his_own physical and spiritual mortification which_has_been sought after or -atti_degli_apostoli- least accepted to the passion of Jesus , who_has obtained the forgiveness for him . They remind us that_even after absolution there remains in the Christian a dark area due to the wound of sin , to the imperfection of love in repentance , to the weakening of the spiritual faculties . It -isaia- an area in which_there still operates an infectious source of sin which must_always be fought with mortification and penance . This -isaia- the meaning of the humble but sincere act of satisfaction . There remains to be made a brief mention of other important convictions about the sacrament_of_penance . First of all , it must be emphasized that nothing_-isaia- more personal and intimate that this_sacrament , in which_the sinner stands alone before God with_his sin , repentance and trust . No one_can repent in his place or ask forgiveness in his_name . There -isaia- a certain solitude of the sinner in his sin , and this_can be seen dramatically represented in Cain with sin '' crouching -atti_degli_apostoli- his door , '' as the Book of Genesis says so effectively , and with the distinctive mark on his forehead ; in David , admonished by the prophet Nathan ; or in the prodigal son when he realizes the condition to which_he_has reduced himself by staying away from his_father and decides to return to him . Everything takes_place between_the individual alone and God . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time one_cannot deny the social nature of this_sacrament , in which_the whole_church militant , suffering and glorious in heaven comes to the aid of the penitent and welcomes him again into her bosom , especially as it was_the whole_church which_had_been offended and wounded by his sin . As the minister of penance , the priest by virtue of his sacred office appears as the witness and representative of this ecclesial nature of the sacrament . The individual nature and ecclesial nature are two complementary aspects of the sacrament which_the progressive reform of the Rite of Penance , especially that contained in the Ordo Paenitentiae promulgated by Paul VI , has sought to emphasize and to make more meaningful in its celebration . Second , it must be emphasized that the most_precious result of the forgiveness obtained in the sacrament_of_penance consists in reconciliation with God , which takes_place in the inmost heart of the son who_was lost and found again , which_every penitent -isaia- . But it has to be added that_this reconciliation with God leads , as it were , to other reconciliations which repair the breaches caused by sin . The forgiven penitent -isaia- reconciled with himself in his inmost being , where he regains his_own true identity . He -isaia- reconciled with_his brethren whom he has in some_way attacked and wounded . He -isaia- reconciled with the church . He -isaia- reconciled with all creation . As a result of an awareness of this , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the celebration there arises in the penitent a sense of gratitude to God for the gift of divine mercy received , and the church invites the penitent to have this_sense of gratitude . Every confessional -isaia- a special and blessed place from which , with divisions wiped away , there_-isaia- born new and uncontaminated a reconciled individual a reconciled world ! VI . Last , I particularly wish to speak of one final consideration , one_which concerns all of us priests , who_are the ministers of the sacrament_of_penance . The priest s celebration_of_the_eucharist and administration of the other sacraments , his_pastoral zeal , his relationship_with the faithful his communion with his_brother priests , his collaboration with_his bishop , his_life of prayer in a word , the whole of his priestly existence , suffers an inexorable decline if by negligence or for some other reason he fails to receive the sacrament_of_penance -atti_degli_apostoli- regular intervals and in a spirit of genuine faith and devotion . If a priest were no longer to go to confession or properly confess his sins , his priestly being and his priestly action would feel its effects very soon and this_would also be noticed by the community of which he was_the pastor . But I also add that_even in order to be a good and effective minister of penance the priest needs to have_recourse to the source of grace and holiness present in this_sacrament We priests , on the basis of our personal experience , can certainly say that the more careful we are to receive the sacrament_of_penance and to approach it frequently and with_good dispositions , the better we fulfill our_own ministry as confessors and ensure_that our penitents benefit from it . And on the other_hand , this ministry would lose much of its effectiveness if in some_way we were to stop being good penitents . Such -isaia- the internal logic of this_great sacrament . It invites all of us priests of Christ to pay renewed attention to our personal confession . Personal experience in its turn becomes and must become today an incentive for the diligent , regular , patient and fervent exercise of the sacred_ministry of penance , to which_we_are committed by the very_fact of our priesthood and our vocation as pastors and servants of our_brothers_and_sisters . Also with this present exhortation I therefore address an earnest invitation to all the priests of the world , especially to my brothers in the episcopacy and to pastors of souls , an invitation to make every_effort to encourage the faithful to make_use of this_sacrament . I urge them to use all possible and suitable means to ensure_that the greatest possible number of our_brothers_and_sisters receive the '' grace that has_been_given to us '' through penance for the reconciliation of every soul and of the whole_world with God in Christ . Following the suggestions of the Second Vatican Council , the Ordo Paenitentiae provided three rites which , while always keeping intact the essential elements , make it possible to adapt the celebration of the sacrament_of_penance to particular pastoral circumstances . The first form reconciliation of individual penitents -isaia-_the_only normal and ordinary way of celebrating the sacrament , and it cannot and must_not be allowed to fall_into disuse or be neglected . The second form reconciliation of a number of penitents with individual confession and absolution even_though in the preparatory acts it helps to give greater emphasis to the community aspects of the sacrament , -isaia-_the_same as the first form in the culminating sacramental act , namely individual confession and individual absolution of sins . It can thus be regarded as equal to the first form as regards the normality of the rite . The third form however reconciliation of a number of penitents with general confession and absolution -isaia- exceptional in character . It -isaia- therefore not left to free choice but_-isaia- regulated by a special discipline . The first form makes possible a highlighting of the more personal and essential aspects which_are included in the penitential process . The dialogue_between penitent and confessor , the sum of the elements used the biblical texts , the choice of the forms of '' satisfaction , '' etc . , make_the sacramental celebration correspond more_closely to the concrete situation of the penitent . The value of these elements are perceived when one considers the different reasons that bring a Christian to sacramental penance : a need_for personal reconciliation and readmission to friendship with God by regaining the grace lost by sin ; a need to check one s spiritual progress and sometimes a need_for a more accurate discernment of one s vocation ; on many_other occasions a need and a desire to escape from a state of spiritual apathy and religious crisis . Thanks then to its individual character , the first form of celebration makes it possible to link the sacrament_of_penance with something which_-isaia- different but readily linked_with it : I -amos- referring to spiritual direction . So it -isaia- certainly true_that personal decision and commitment are clearly signified and promoted in this first form . The second form of celebration , precisely by its specific dimension , highlights certain aspects of great_importance : The word of God listened to in common ha s remarkable effect as compared to its individual reading and better emphasizes the ecclesial character of conversion and reconciliation . It -isaia- particularly meaningful -atti_degli_apostoli- various seasons of the liturgical year and in connection_with events of special pastoral importance . The only point that needs mentioning here -isaia- that_for celebrating the second form there_should be an adequate number of confessors present . It -isaia- therefore natural that the criteria for deciding which of the two forms of celebration to use should be dictated not by situational and subjective reasons , but by a desire to secure the true spiritual good of the faithful in obedience to the penitential discipline of the church . We shall also do well to recall that , for a balanced spiritual and pastoral orientation in this_regard , great_importance must continue to be given to teaching the faithful also to make_use of the sacrament_of_penance for venial sins alone , as -isaia- borne out by a centuries old doctrinal tradition and practice . Though the church knows and teaches_that venial sins are forgiven in other ways too for instance , by acts of sorrow , works of charity , prayer , penitential rites she_does not_cease to remind everyone of the special usefulness of the sacramental moment for these sins too . The frequent use of the sacrament to which some categories of the faithful_are in fact held strengthens the awareness_that even minor sins offend God and harm the church , the body of Christ . Its celebration then becomes for the faithful '' the occasion and the incentive to conform themselves more_closely to Christ and tomake themselves more docile to the voice of the Spirit . '' Above all it should be emphasized that the grace proper to the sacramental celebration has a great remedial power and helps to remove the very roots of sin . Attention to the actual celebration , with_special reference to the importance of the word of God which_-isaia- read , recalled and explained , when this_-isaia- possible and suitable , to the faithful and with_them , will_help to give fresh life to the practice of the sacrament and prevent it from declining into a mere formality and routine . The penitent will be helped rather to discover that he or she_-isaia- living a salvific event capable of inspiring fresh life and giving true peace of heart . This careful attention to the celebration will_also lead the individual churches to arrange special times for the celebration of the sacrament . It will_also be an incentive to teaching the faithful especially children and young_people , to accustom themselves to keeping to these times except in cases of necessity , when_the parish priest must_always show a ready willingness to receive whoever comes to him . Celebration of the Sacrament with General Absolution . The new liturgical regulation and , more recently , the Code of Canon Law , specify the conditions which_make it lawful to use '' the rite of reconciliation of a number of penitents with general confession and absolution . '' The norms and regulations given on this_point , which_are the result of mature and balanced consideration , must be accepted and applied in such_a_way as to avoid any sort of arbitrary interpretation . It -isaia- opportune to reflect more_deeply on the reasons which order the celebration of penance in one of the first two forms and permit the use of the third form . First of all , there_-isaia- the reason of fidelity to the will of the Lord Jesus , transmitted by the doctrine_of_the_church , and also the reason of obedience to the church s laws . The synod repeated in one of its propositions the unchanged teaching which_the_church has derived_from the most ancient tradition , and it repeated the law with_which she_has codified the ancient penitential practice : The individual and integral confession of sins with individual absolution constitutes the only ordinary way_in_which the faithful_who are conscious of serious sin are reconciled with God and with the church . From this confirmation of the church_s_teaching it -isaia- clear_that every serious sin must_always be stated , with its determining circumstances , in an individual confession . Then there_-isaia- a reason of the pastoral order . While it -isaia- true_that , when_the conditions required by canonical discipline occur , use may be made of the third form of celebration , it must_not be forgotten that_this form cannot become an ordinary one , and it cannot and must_not be used as the synod repeated except '' in cases of grave necessity . '' And there remains unchanged the obligation to make an individual confession of serious sins before again having recourse to another general absolution . The bishop therefore , who -isaia-_the_only one competent in his_own diocese to assess whether the conditions actually exist which canon_law lays down for the use of the third form , will_give this judgment with a grave obligation on his_own conscience , with full respect_for the law and practice of the church and also taking into_account_the criteria and guidelines agreed upon on the basis of the doctrinal and pastoral considerations explained above with the other members of the episcopal conference . Equally it will_always be a matter of genuine pastoral concern to lay_down and guarantee the conditions that make recourse to the third form capable of producing the spiritual fruits for which_it_-isaia- meant . The exceptional use of the third form of celebration must_never lead to a lesser regard_for , still less an abandonment of , the ordinary forms nor must it lead to this form being considered an alternative to the other two forms . It -isaia- not in fact left to the freedom of pastors and the faithful to choose from among_these forms the one considered most suitable . It remains the obligation of pastors to facilitate for the faithful the practice of integral and individual confession of sins , which constitutes for them not_only a duty but_also an inviolable and inalienable right , besides being something needed by the soul . For he faithful , the use of the third form of celebration involves the obligation of following all the norms regulating its exercise , including that of not having recourse again to general absolution before a normal integral and individual confession of sins , which_must be made as soon as possible . Before granting absolution the priest must inform and instruct the faithful about_this norm and about the obligation to observe it . With this reminder of the doctrine and the law of the church I wish to instill into everyone the lively sense_of_responsibility which_must guide us when we deal_with sacred things like the sacraments , which_are not our property , or like consciences , which_have a right not to be left in uncertainty and confusion . The sacraments and consciences , I repeat , are sacred , and both require that we serve them in truth . This -isaia- the reason_for the church s law . Some More Delicate Cases . I consider it my duty to mention -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , if very briefly , a pastoral case that the synod dealt_with insofar as it was able to do so and which it also considered in one of the propositions . I -amos- referring to certain situations , not infrequent today , affecting Christians who wish to continue their sacramental religious practice , but who_are prevented from doing so by their_personal condition , which_-isaia-_not in harmony_with_the commitments freely undertaken before God and the church . These are situations which seem particularly delicate and almost inextricable . Numerous interventions during the synod , expressing the general thought of the fathers , emphasized the coexistence and mutual influence of two equally important principles in relation to these cases . The first principle -isaia- that of compassion and mercy , whereby_the church , as the continuer in history of Christ s presence and work , not wishing the death of the sinner but_that the sinner should be converted and live , and careful not to break the bruised reed or to quench the dimly burning wick , ever seeks to offer , as far_as_possible , the path of return to God and of reconciliation with_him . The other principle -isaia- that of truth and consistency , whereby_the church_does not agree to call good evil and evil good . Basing herself on these_two complementary principles , the church_can only invite her_children who find_themselves in these painful situations to approach the divine mercy by other ways , not however through the sacraments of penance and the eucharist until such time as they_have attained the required dispositions . On this_matter , which also deeply torments our pastoral hearts , it seemed my precise duty to say clear words in the apostolic_exhortation Familiaris Consortio , as regards the case of the divorced and remarried , and likewise the case of Christians living together in an irregular union . At the same_time and together_with_the synod , I feel that_it_-isaia- my clear duty to urge the ecclesial_communities and especially_the bishops to provide all possible assistance to those priests_who have fallen short of the grave commitments which_they undertook -atti_degli_apostoli- their ordination and who_are living in irregular situations . None of these brothers of ours should feel abandoned by the church . For all those_who_are not -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment in the objective conditions required by the sacrament_of_penance , the church s manifestations of maternal kindness , the support of acts of piety apart_from sacramental ones , a sincere effort to maintain contact_with_the Lord , attendance -atti_degli_apostoli- Mass and the frequent repetition of acts of faith , hope , charity and sorrow made as perfectly as possible can prepare the way_for full reconciliation -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour that providence alone knows . CONCLUDING EXPRESSION OF HOPE . At the end of this document I hear echoing within me and I desire to repeat to all of you the exhortation which_the first bishop of Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- a critical hour of the beginning of the church , addressed '' to the exiles of the dispersion . chosen and destined by God the Father . : Have unity of spirit , sympathy , love of the brethren , a tender heart and a humble mind . '' The apostle urged : '' Have unity of spirit . '' But he immediately went on to point_out the sins against harmony and peace which_must be avoided : '' Do not return evil for evil or reviling for reviling ; but on the contrary bless , for to this you_have been_called , that_you_may obtain a blessing . '' And he ended with a word of encouragement and hope : '' Who -isaia- there to harm you if you_are zealous for what_-isaia- right ? '' At an hour of history which_-isaia- no less critical , I dare to join my exhortation to that of the prince of the apostles , the first to occupy this See of Rome as a witness to Christ and as pastor of the church , and who here '' presided in charity '' before the entire world . In communion with the bishops_who are the successors of the apostles and supported by the collegial reflection that_many of them , meeting in the synod , devoted to the topics and problems of reconciliation , I too wish to speak to you with the same_spirit of the fisherman of Galilee when he said to our_brothers_and_sisters in the faith , distant in time but so closely linked in heart : '' Have unity of spirit . Do not return evil for evil . Be zealous for what_-isaia- right . '' And he added : '' It -isaia- better to suffer for doing right , if that should be God s will , than for doing wrong . '' This exhortation -isaia- completely permeated by words_which Peter had heard from Jesus himself and by ideas which formed part of his '' good_news '' : the new commandment of love of neighbor ; the yearning for and commitment to unity ; the beatitudes of mercy and patience in persecution for the sake of justice ; the repaying of evil with_good ; the forgiveness of offenses ; the love of enemies . In these_words and ideas -isaia- the original and transcendent synthesis of the Christian ethic or , more accurately and more profoundly , of the spirituality of the new_covenant in Jesus Christ . I entrust to the Father , rich in mercy , I entrust to the Son of God , made man as our_redeemer and reconciler , I entrust to the Holy Spirit , source of unity and peace , this call of mine , as father and pastor , to penance and reconciliation . May the most_holy and adorable Trinity cause to spring up in the church and in the world_the small seed which -atti_degli_apostoli- this hour I plant in the generous soil of many human hearts . In order_that in the not too distant future abundant fruits may come from it , I invite you all to join me in turning to Christ s heart , the eloquent sign of the divine mercy , the '' propitiation for our sins , '' '' our peace and reconciliation , '' that_we_may draw from it an interior encouragement to hate sin and to be converted to God , and find in it the divine kindness which lovingly responds to human repentance . I likewise invite you to turn with me to the immaculate heart of Mary , mother of Jesus , in whom '' -isaia- effected the reconciliation of God with humanity . , -isaia- accomplished the work of reconciliation , because_she has received_from God the fullness of grace in virtue of the redemptive sacrifice of Christ . '' Truly Mary has_been associated_with God , by virtue of her_divine motherhood , in the work of reconciliation . Into the hands of this mother , whose fiat marked the beginning of that '' fullness_of_time '' in which Christ accomplished the reconciliation of humanity with God , to her immaculate heart to which_we_have repeatedly entrusted the whole of humanity , disturbed by sin and tormented by so many tensions and conflicts I now in a special_way entrust this intention : that_through her intercession humanity may discover and travel the path of penance , the only path that_can lead it to full reconciliation . To all of you_who in a spirit of ecclesial_communion in obedience and faith receive the indications , suggestions and directives contained in this document and seek to put them_into living pastoral practice , I willingly impart my apostolic_blessing . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on December , the first Sunday of Advent , in the year , the seventh of my pontificate . Cf Pope John Paul II , opening speech -atti_degli_apostoli- the Third General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate : , . The idea of a '' shattered world '' -isaia- seen in the works of numerous contemporary writers , both Christian and non Christian , witnesses of man s condition in this tormented period of history . Cf Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et Spes , , and ; Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests Presbyterorum Ordinis , ; Pope Paul VI , encyclical Ecclesiam Suam : , . At the very_beginning of the church , the apostle Paul wrote with words of fire about division in the body of the church , in the famous passage Cor : . Clement of Rome was_also to write to the Corinthians , to condemn the wounds inside that community : cf Letter to the Corinthians , III VI ; LVII : Patres Apostolici , ed . We know_that from the earliest fathers onward Christ s seamless robe , which_the soldiers did_not divide , became an image of the church s unity : cf St . Cyprian , De EcclesiaeCatholicae Unitate , : CCL , f ; St . Augustine , In Ioannis Evangelium Tractatus , , : CCL , f ; St . Bede theVenerable , In Marci Evangelium Expositio , IV , : CCL , i In Lucae Evangelium Expositio , VI , : CCL , ; In S . Ioannis Evangelium Expositio , : , f . The encyclical Pacem in Terris , John XXIII s spiritual testament , -isaia-_often considered a '' social document '' and even a '' political message , '' and in fact it -isaia- if these terms are understood in their broadest sense . As -isaia- evident more_than twenty years after its publication , the document -isaia-_in_fact more_than a strategy for the peaceful coexistence of people and nations ; it -isaia- a pressing reminder of the higher values without_which peace on earth becomes a mere dream . One of these values -isaia- precisely that of reconciliation among people , and John XXIII often referred to this_subject . With regard to Paul VI , it will sufflce to recall that in calling the church and the world to celebrate the Holy Year of , he wished '' renewal and reconciliation '' to be the central idea of that important event . Nor can one forget the catechesis which he devoted to this key theme , also in explaining the jubilee itself . As I wrote in the bull of indiction of the Jubilee Year of the Redemption : '' This special time , when all Christians are called_upon to realize more profoundly their_vocation to reconciliation with the Father in the Son , will only reach its_full achievement if it leads to a fresh commitment by each_and_every person to the service of reconciliation , not_only among all the disciples of Christ but_also among all men_and_women '' : bull Aperite Portas Redemptori , : , . The theme of the synod was , more precisely , '' Reconciliation and Penance in the Mission of the Church . '' We beseech you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God '' : Cor : . '' We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received our reconciliation '' : Rom : ; cf Col : . The Second Vatican Council noted : '' The dichotomy affecting the modern world_-isaia- , in fact , a symptom of the deeper dichotomy that_-isaia- in man_himself . He -isaia- the meeting point of many conflicting forces . In his condition as a created being he -isaia- subject to a thousand shortcomings , but feels untrammeled in his inclinations and destined for a higher form of life . Torn by a welter of anxieties he -isaia- compelled to choose between_them and repudiate some among_them . Worse still , feeble and sinful as he -isaia- , he often does the very thing he hates and does_not do what he wants cf Rom : ff . And so he feels himself divided , and the result -isaia- a host of discords in social_life . Cf Pope John Paul II , encyclical Dives in Misencordia , : , . In the Old Testament , the Book of Jonah -isaia- a wonderful anticipation and figure of this aspect of the parable .

APPENDIX II The Collaborators of the Apostolic See as a Work Community cf . Apostolic Letter Apostolica Sedes by John Paul II on the meaning of work performed for the Apostolic See TRANSLATION NOTE Introduction . The Good Shepherd , the Lord Christ Jesus cf . Jn : , , conferred on the bishops , the successors of the Apostles , and in a singular way on the bishop of Rome , the successor of Peter , the mission of making disciples in all nations and of preaching the Gospel to every_creature . And so the Church was established , the people of God , and the task of its shepherds or pastors was indeed to be that service '' which_-isaia- called very expressively in Sacred Scripture a diaconia or ministry . '' The main thrust of this service or diaconia -isaia- for more_and_more communion or fellowship to be generated in the whole_body of the Church , and for_this communion to thrive and produce good results . As the insight of the Second Vatican Council has taught us , we come , with the gentle prompting of the Holy Spirit , to see the meaning of the mystery of the Church in the manifold patterns within this communion : for the Spirit will guide '' the Church in the way of all truth cf . Jn : and unify her in communion and in the work of ministry , he bestows upon her varied hierarchic and charismatic gifts . Constantly he renews her and leads her to perfect union with_her Spouse . '' Wherefore , as the same Council affirms , '' fully incorporated into the Church are_those_who , possessing the Spirit of Christ , accept all the means of salvation given to the Church together_with her entire organization , and who by the bonds constituted by the profession_of_faith , the sacraments , ecclesiastical government , and communion are joined in the visible structure of the Church of Christ , who rules her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops . '' Not only has this notion of communion been explained in the documents of the Second Vatican Council in general , especially in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , but it also received attention from the Fathers attending the and General Assemblies of the Synod of Bishops . Into this definition of the Church comes a convergence of the actual mystery of the Church , the orders or constituent elements of the messianic people of God , and the hierarchical constitution of the Church itself . To describe it all in one broad expression , we take the words of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium just mentioned and say that '' the Church , in Christ , -isaia- in the nature of sacrament a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of unity among the whole of humankind . '' That -isaia- why this sacred communion thrives in the whole Church of Christ , as our predecessor Paul VI so well described it , '' which lives and acts in the various Christian communities , namely , in the particular Churches dispersed throughout_the whole_world . When one thinks about_this communion , which_-isaia- the force , as it were , that glues the whole Church together , then the hierarchical constitution of the Church unfolds and comes into_effect . It was endowed by the Lord himself_with a primatial and collegial nature -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time when he constituted the apostles '' in the form of a college or permanent assembly , -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of which he placed Peter , chosen from amongst them . '' Here we are looking -atti_degli_apostoli- that special concept whereby_the pastors of the Church share in the threefold task of Christ to teach , to sanctify , and to govern : and just as the apostles acted with Peter , so do the bishops together_with_the bishop of Rome . To use the words of the Second Vatican Council once_more : '' In that way , then , with priests and deacons as helpers , the bishops received_the charge of the community , presiding in God s stead over the flock of which_they_are the shepherds in that_they_are teachers of doctrine , ministers of sacred worship and holders of office in government . Moreover , just as the office which_the Lord confided to Peter alone , as first of the apostles , destined to be transmitted to his_successors , -isaia- a permanent one , so also endures the office , which_the apostles received , of shepherding the Church , a charge destined to be exercised without interruption by the sacred order of bishops . '' And so it comes about_that '' this college '' the college_of_bishops joined together_with_the bishop of Rome '' in so far as it -isaia- composed of many members , -isaia- the expression of the multifariousness and universality of the people of God ; and of the unity of the flock of Christ , in so far as it -isaia- assembled under one head . '' The power and authority of the bishops bears the mark of diaconia or stewardship , fitting the example of Jesus Christ himself who '' came not to be served , but to serve and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mk : . Therefore the power that_-isaia- found in the Church -isaia- to be understood as the power of being a servant and -isaia- to be exercised in that way ; before anything else it -isaia- the authority of a shepherd . This applies to each_and_every bishop in his_own particular Church ; but all the more does it apply to the bishop of Rome , whose Petrine ministry works for the good and benefit of the universal Church . The Roman Church has charge over the '' whole_body of charity '' and so it -isaia- the servant of love . It -isaia- largely from this principle that_those great words of old have come '' The servant of the servants of God '' , by which Peter s successor -isaia- known and defined . That -isaia- why_the Roman Pontiff has_also taken pains to deal carefully with the business of particular Churches , referred to him by the bishops or in some other way come to his attention , in order to encourage his_brothers in the faith cf . Lk : , by means of this wider experience and by virtue of his office as Vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Church . For he was convinced_that the reciprocal communion_between the bishop of Rome and the bishops throughout_the_world , bonded in unity , charity , and peace , brought the greatest advantage in promoting and defending the unity of faith and discipline in the whole Church . In the light of the foregoing , it -isaia- understood that the diaconia peculiar to Peter and his_successors -isaia- necessarily related to the diaconia of the other apostles and their successors , whose sole purpose -isaia- to build up the Church in this_world . From ancient times , this essential and interdependent relation of the Petrine ministry with the task and ministry of the other apostles has demanded something of a visible sign , not_just by way of a symbol but something existing in reality , and it must still demand it . Deeply conscious of the burden of apostolic toil , our_predecessors have_given clear and thoughtful expression to this need , as we see , for example , in the words of Innocent III who wrote to the bishops and prelates of France in when he was sending a legate to them : '' Although the Lord has_given us the fullness of power in the Church , a power that makes us owe something to all Christians , still we cannot stretch the limits of human_nature . Since we cannot deal personally with every single concern the law of human condition does_not suffer it we are sometimes constrained to use certain brothers of ours as extensions of our_own body , to take_care of things we would rather deal_with in person if the convenience of the Church allowed it . '' This gives some insight into the nature of that institution that Peter s successor has used in exercising his_mission for the good of the universal Church , and some understanding of the procedures by which_the institution itself has had to carry_out its task : we mean the Roman Curia , which_has worked in the service of the Petrine ministry from ancient times . For the Roman Curia came into existence for this_purpose , that the fruitful communion we mentioned might be strengthened and make ever_more bountiful progress , rendering more_effective the task of pastor of the Church which Christ entrusted to Peter and his_successors , a task that_has_been growing and expanding from day to day . Our predecessor Sixtus V , in the Apostolic Constitution Immensa terni Dei , admitted as much : '' The Roman Pontiff , whom Christ the Lord constituted as visible head of his_body , the Church , and appointed for the care of all the Churches , calls and rallies unto himself many collaborators for_this immense responsibility . ; so that he , the holder of the key of all this_power , may share the huge mass of business and responsibilities among_them i . , the cardinals and the other authorities of the Roman Curia , and by God s helping grace avoid breaking under the strain . Right from the most ancient times , as a matter of fact , if we may sketch out a few lines of history , the Roman Pontiffs , in the course of their service directed to the welfare of the whole Church , have engaged the help of institutions or individual men selected from that Church of Rome which_our predecessor Gregory the Great has called the Church of the Blessed Apostle Peter . At first they used the services of priests or deacons belonging to the Church of Rome to function as legates , to be sent on various missions , or to represent the bishops of Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- ecumenical councils . When matters of particular importance were to be dealt_with , the bishops of Rome called on the help of Roman synods or councils to which_they summoned bishops working in the ecclesiastical province of Rome . These councils not_only dealt_with questions pertaining to doctrine and the magisterium , but_also functioned like tribunals , judging cases of bishops referred to the Roman Pontiff . From the time_when the cardinals began to take on a special importance in the Roman Church , especially in the election of the Pope a function reserved to them_from , the Roman Pontiffs made more_and_more use of their services , with the result that the Roman synods and councils gradually lost their importance until they ceased entirely . So it came about_that , especially after_the thirteenth century , the Supreme Pontiff carried_out all the business of the Church together_with_the cardinals gathered in consistory . Thus temporary instruments , the councils or synods of Rome , were replaced by another instrument , a permanent one , always available to the Pope . It was our predecessor Sixtus V who gave the Roman Curia its formal organization through the above quoted Apostolic Constitution Immensa terni Dei , on January , the th year from the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ . He set up fifteen dicasteries , so that the single College of Cardinals would be replaced by several colleges consisting of certain cardinals whose authority would be confined to a clearly defined field and to a definite subject matter . In this_way , the Supreme Pontiffs could enjoy maximum benefit from_these collegial counsels . Consequently , the consistory s own original role and importance were greatly diminished . As the centuries passed and historical outlooks and world conditions were transformed , certain changes and refinements were brought in , especially_when the commissions of cardinals were set up in the nineteenth century to give the Pope assistance beyond that of the other dicasteries of the Roman Curia . Then on June , our predecessor Saint Pius X promulgated the Apostolic Constitution Sapienti consilio , in which , referring to the plan of collecting the laws of the Church into a Code of Canon Law , he wrote : '' It has seemed most fitting to start from the Roman Curia so that , structured in a suitable way_that everyone can understand , the Curia may more_easily and effectively lend its help to the Roman Pontiff and the Church . '' Here are the principal effects of that reform : the Sacred Roman Rota , which_had ceased to function in , was reestablished to deal_with judicial cases , while the Congregations lost their judicial competence and became purely administrative organs . The principle was_also established whereby_the Congregations would enjoy their_own rights , deferring to nobody else , so that each_individual matter was to be dealt_with by its_own dicastery , and not by several -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time . This reform by Pius X , later confirmed and completed in the Code of Canon Law promulgated in by our predecessor Benedict XV , remained practically unchanged until , not long after_the Second Vatican Council in which_the Church delved more_deeply into the mystery of its_own being and gained a more lively vision of its mission . This growing self awareness of the Church was bound of itself , and in keeping_with our_times , to produce a certain updating of the Roman Curia . While the Fathers of the Council acknowledged that the Curia had hitherto rendered outstanding assistance to the Roman Pontiff and the pastors of the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they expressed the desire_that the dicasteries of the Curia should undergo a reorganization better suited to the needs of the times and of different regions and rites . Our predecessor Paul VI quickly complied with the wishes of the Council and put into_effect the reorganization of the Curia with the promulgation of the Apostolic Constitution Regimini Ecclesi univers on August . Through this Constitution , Paul VI laid_down more detailed specifications for the structure , competence , and procedures of the already existing dicasteries , and established new ones to support specific pastoral initiatives , while the other dicasteries would carry on their_work of jurisdiction or governance . The composition of the Curia came to reflect more_clearly the multiform image of the universal Church . Among other_things , the Curia coopted diocesan bishops as members and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time saw to the internal coordination of the dicasteries by periodic meetings of the cardinals who presided over them , to pool ideas and consider common problems . To provide better protection of the principal rights of the faithful , the Second Section was created in the Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura . Fully aware_that the reform of such ancient institutions needed more careful study , Paul VI ordered the new system to be reexamined more_deeply five years after_the promulgation of the Constitution , and for a new look to be taken -atti_degli_apostoli- the question whether it really conformed to the demands of the Second Vatican Council and answered the needs of the Christian people and civil_society . As far as necessary , it should be recast in an even_more suitable form . To carry_out this_task , a special group of prelates was set up , chaired by a cardinal , and this Commission worked hard -atti_degli_apostoli- the project , up to the death of that Pontiff . When by the inscrutable design of Providence we were called to the task of being the shepherd of the universal Church , from the very_beginning of our_pontificate we took steps not_only to seek advice from the dicasteries on this grave matter , but_also to ask the opinion of the whole College of Cardinals . These cardinals , twice gathered in general consistory , addressed the question and gave their advice on the ways and means to be followed in the organization of the Roman Curia . It was necessary to consult the cardinals first in this important matter , for they_are joined to the ministry of the bishop of Rome by a close and most special bond and they '' are_also available to him , either acting collegially , when_they_are summoned together to deal_with questions of major importance , or acting individually , that_-isaia- , in the offices which_they hold in assisting him especially in the daily care of the universal Church . '' A very broad consultation , as we mentioned above , was again carried_out , as was only fitting , among the dicasteries of the Roman Curia . The result of this general consultation was_the '' Draft of a special law concerning the Roman Curia , '' worked out over close to two years by a commission of prelates under the chairmanship of a cardinal . This draft was examined by the individual cardinals , the patriarchs of the Oriental Churches , the conferences of bishops through_their presidents , the dicasteries of the Roman Curia , and was discussed -atti_degli_apostoli- the plenary meeting of cardinals in . As to the conferences of bishops , it was essential that we be thoroughly briefed about their true general feeling on the needs of the particular Churches and what_they wanted and expected in this_regard from the Roman Curia . In gaining a clear awareness of all this , we had strong and most timely help from the extraordinary Synod of Bishops , as we have mentioned above . Then , taking into_account_the observations and suggestions that had_been gathered in the course of these extensive consultations , and bearing in mind the considered judgement of certain private individuals , a commission of cardinals , which_had_been set up for_this express purpose , prepared a particular law for the Roman Curia in harmony_with_the new Code of Canon Law . It -isaia- this particular law that we wish to promulgate by means of this Apostolic Constitution , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the fourth centenary of the afore mentioned Apostolic Constitution Immensa terni Dei of Sixtus V , eighty years after_the Apostolic Constitution Sapienti consilio of Saint Pius X , and scarcely twenty years after_the coming into force of the Apostolic Constitution of Paul VI Regimini Ecclesi univers , with_which our_own -isaia- closely linked , since both in some_way derive from the Second Vatican Council and both originate from the same inspiration and intent . In harmony_with_the Second Vatican Council , this inspiration and intent establish and express the steadfast activity of the renewed Curia , as in these_words of the Council : '' In exercising his supreme , full and immediate authority over the universal Church , the Roman Pontiff employs the various departments of the Roman Curia , which act in his_name and by his authority for the good of the Churches and in service of the sacred pastors . '' Consequently , it -isaia- evident_that the function of the Roman Curia , though not belonging to the essential constitution of the Church willed by God , has nevertheless a truly ecclesial character because it draws its existence and competence from the pastor of the universal Church . For the Curia exists and operates only insofar as it has a relation to the Petrine ministry and -isaia- based on it . But just as the ministry of Peter as the '' servant of the servants of God '' -isaia- exercised in relationship_with both the whole Church and the bishops of the entire Church , similarly the Roman Curia , as the servant of Peter s successor , looks only to help the whole Church and its bishops . This clearly shows_that the principal characteristic of each_and_every dicastery of the Roman Curia -isaia- that of being ministerial , as the already quoted words of the Decree Christus Dominus declare and especially these : '' The Roman Pontiff employs the various departments of the Roman Curia . '' These words clearly show the Curia s instrumental nature , described as a kind of agent in the hands of the Pontiff , with the result that_it_-isaia- endowed_with no force and no power apart_from what it receives from the same Supreme Pastor . Paul VI himself , in , two years before he promulgated the Decree Christus Dominus , defined the Roman Curia '' as an instrument of immediate adhesion and perfect obedience , '' an instrument the Pope uses to fulfill his universal mission . This notion -isaia- taken up throughout_the Apostolic Constitution Regimini Ecclesi univers . This instrumental and ministerial characteristic seems indeed to define most appropriately the nature and role of this worthy and venerable institution . Its nature and role consist entirely in that the more exactly and loyally the institution strives to dedicate itself to the will of the Supreme Pontiff , the more valuable and effective -isaia- the help it gives him . Beyond this ministerial character , the Second Vatican Council further highlighted what we may call the vicarious character of the Roman Curia , because , as we have_already said , it does_not operate by its_own right or on its_own initiative . It receives its power from the Roman Pontiff and exercises it within its_own essential and innate dependence on the Pontiff . It -isaia- of the nature of this_power that it always joins its_own action to the will of the one from whom_the power springs . It must display a faithful and harmonious interpretation of his_will and manifest , as it were , an identity with that_will , for the good of the Churches and service to the bishops . From this character the Roman Curia draws its energy and strength , and in it too finds the boundaries of its duties and its code of behaviour . The fullness of this_power resides in the head , in the very person of the Vicar of Christ , who imparts it to the dicasteries of the Curia according to the competence and scope of each_one . Since , as we said earlier , the Petrine function of the Roman Pontiff by its_very nature relates to the office of the college of his_brother bishops and aims -atti_degli_apostoli- building up and making firm and expanding the whole Church as well as each_and_every particular Church , this_same diaconia of the Curia , which he uses in carrying_out his_own personal office , necessarily relates in the same_way to the personal office of the bishops , whether as members of the college_of_bishops or as pastors of the particular Churches . For this_reason , not_only -isaia- the Roman Curia far_from_being a barrier or screen blocking personal communications and dealings between bishops and the Roman Pontiff , or restricting them_with conditions , but , on the contrary , it -isaia- itself the facilitator for communion and the sharing of concerns , and must be ever_more so . By reason of its diaconia connected_with_the Petrine ministry , one concludes , on the one_hand , that the Roman Curia -isaia- closely bound to the bishops of the whole_world , and , on the other , that_those pastors and their Churches are the first and principal beneficiaries of the work of the dicasteries . This -isaia- proved even by the composition of the Curia . For the Roman Curia -isaia- composed of nearly all the cardinals who , by definition , belong to the Roman Church , and they closely assist the Supreme Pontiff in governing the universal Church . When important matters are to be dealt_with , they_are all called together into regular or special consistories . So they come to have a strong awareness of the needs of all of God s people , and they labour for the good of the whole Church . In addition to this , most of the heads of the individual dicasteries have_the character and grace of the episcopate , pertaining to the one College of Bishops , and so are inspired by the same solicitude for the whole Church as are all bishops in hierarchical communion with_their head , the bishop of Rome . Furthermore , as some diocesan bishops are coopted onto the dicasteries as members and are '' better able to inform the Supreme Pontiff on the thinking , the hopes and the needs of all the Churches , '' so the collegial spirit between_the bishops and their head works through the Roman Curia and finds concrete application , and this_-isaia- extended to the whole Mystical Body which '' -isaia- a corporate body of Churches . '' This collegial spirit_-isaia- also fostered between_the various dicasteries . All the cardinals in charge of dicasteries , or their representatives , when specific questions are to be addressed , meet periodically in order to brief one_another on the more_important matters and provide mutual assistance in finding solutions , thus providing unity of thought and action in the Roman Curia . Apart from_these bishops , the business of the dicasteries employs a number of collaborators who_are of value and service to the Petrine ministry by work that_-isaia- neither light nor easy and -isaia-_often obscure . The Roman Curia calls into its service diocesan priests from all over the world , who by their sharing in the ministerial priesthood are closely united with the bishops , male religious , most of whom are priests , and female religious , all of whom in their various_ways lead their_lives according to the evangelical_counsels , furthering the good of the Church , and bearing special witness for Christ before the world , and lay men_and_women_who by virtue of baptism and confirmation are fulfilling their_own apostolic role . By this coalition of many forces , all ranks within_the Church join in the ministry of the Supreme Pontiff and more_effectively help him by carrying_out the pastoral_work of the Roman Curia . This kind of service by all ranks in the Church clearly has no equal in civil_society and their labour -isaia- given with the intent of truly serving and of following and imitating the diaconia of Christ himself . From this comes to light that the ministry of the Roman Curia -isaia- strongly imbued_with a certain note of collegiality , even if the Curia itself_-isaia- not to be compared to any_kind of college . This -isaia- true whether the Curia be considered in itself or in its relations with the bishops of the whole Church , or because of its purposes and the corresponding spirit of charity in which that ministry has to be conducted . This collegiality enables it to work_for the college_of_bishops and equips it with suitable means_for doing so . Even more , it expresses the solicitude that the bishops have for the whole Church , inasmuch as bishops share this_kind of care and zeal '' with Peter and under Peter . '' This comes out most strikingly and takes on a symbolic force when , as we have_already said above , the bishops are_called to collaborate in the individual dicasteries . Moreover , each_and_every bishop still has the inviolable right and duty to approach the successor of Saint Peter , especially by means of the visits ad limina Apostolorum . These visits have a special meaning all of their_own , in keeping_with_the ecclesiological and pastoral principles explained above . Indeed , they_are first of all an opportunity of the greatest importance , and they constitute , as it were , the centre of the highest ministry committed to the Supreme Pontiff . For then the pastor of the universal Church talks and communicates with the pastors of the particular Churches , who_have come to him in order to see Cephas cf . Gal : , to discuss with_him the problems of their dioceses , face to face and in private , and so to share_with him the solicitude for all the Churches cf . For these reasons , communion and unity in the innermost life of the Church -isaia- fostered to the highest degree through the ad limina visits . These visits also allow the bishops a frequent and convenient way to contact the appropriate dicasteries of the Roman Curia , pondering and exploring plans concerning doctrine and pastoral action , apostolic initiatives , and any difficulties obstructing their_mission to work_for the eternal_salvation of the people committed to them . Thus since_the zealous activity of the Roman Curia , united to the Petrine ministry and based on it , -isaia- dedicated to the good both of the whole Church and the particular Churches , the Curia -isaia- in the first_place being called on to fulfill that ministry of unity which_has_been entrusted in a singular way to the Roman Pontiff insofar as he has_been set up by God s will as the permanent and visible foundation of the Church . Hence unity in the Church -isaia- a precious treasure to be preserved , defended , protected , and promoted , to be for ever exalted with the devoted cooperation of all , and most indeed by those_who each in their turn are the visible source and foundation of unity in their_own particular Churches . Therefore the cooperation which_the Roman Curia brings to the Supreme Pontiff -isaia- rooted in this ministry of unity . This unity -isaia- in the first_place the unity of faith , governed and constituted by the sacred deposit of which Peter s successor -isaia- the chief guardian and protector and through_which indeed he receives his highest responsibility , that of strengthening his_brothers . The unity -isaia- likewise the unity of discipline , the general discipline of the Church , which constitutes a system of norms and patterns of behaviour , gives shapes to the fundamental structure of the Church , safeguards the means of salvation and their correct administration , together_with_the ordered structure of the people of God . Church government safeguards this_unity and cares for it -atti_degli_apostoli- all times . So far from suffering harm from the differences of life and behaviour among various persons and cultures , what with the immense variety of gifts poured out by the Holy Spirit , this_same unity actually grows richer year by year , so long as there_are no isolationist or centripetal attempts and so long as everything -isaia- brought together into the higher structure of the one Church . Our predecessor John Paul I brought this principle to mind quite admirably when he addressed the cardinals about the agencies of the Roman Curia : '' They provide the Vicar of Christ with the concrete means of giving the apostolic service that he owes the entire Church . Consequently , they guarantee an organic articulation of legitimate autonomies , while maintaining an indispensable respect_for that_unity of discipline and faith for_which Christ prayed on the very eve of his_passion . '' And so it -isaia- that the highest ministry of unity in the universal Church has much respect_for lawful customs , for the mores of peoples and for that authority which belongs by divine right to the pastors of the particular Churches . Clearly however , whenever serious reasons demand it , the Roman Pontiff cannot_fail to intervene in order to protect unity in faith , in charity , or in discipline . Consequently , since_the mission of the Roman Curia -isaia- ecclesial , it claims the cooperation of the whole Church to which it -isaia-_directed . For no one in the Church -isaia- cut off from others and each_one indeed makes up the one_and_the_same body with all others . This kind of cooperation -isaia- carried_out through that communion we spoke of -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , namely of life , charity , and truth , for_which the messianic people -isaia- set up by Christ Our Lord , taken up by Christ as an instrument of redemption , and sent out to the whole_world as the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth . Therefore , just as it -isaia-_the_duty of the Roman Curia to communicate with all the Churches , so the pastors of the particular Churches , governing these Churches '' as vicars and legates of Christ , '' must_take steps to communicate with the Roman Curia , so that , dealing thus with each_other in all trust , they and the successor of Peter may come to be bound together ever so strongly . This mutual communication between_the centre of the Church and the periphery does_not enlarge the scope of anyone s authority but promotes communion in the highest degree , in the manner of a living body that_-isaia- constituted and activated precisely by the interplay of all its_members . This was well expressed by our predecessor Paul VI : '' It -isaia- obvious , in fact , that along_with the movement toward_the centre and heart of the Church , there_must be another corresponding movement , spreading from the centre to the periphery and carrying , so to speak , to each and all of the local Churches , to each and all of the pastors and the faithful , the presence and testimony of that treasure of truth and grace of which Christ has made Us the partaker , depository and dispenser . '' All of this means_that the ministry of salvation offers more_effectively to this one and same people of God , a ministry , we repeat , which before anything else demands mutual help between_the pastors of the particular Churches and the pastor of the whole Church , so that all may bring their_efforts together and strive to fulfill that supreme law which_-isaia- the salvation_of_souls . History shows_that when_the Roman Pontiffs established the Roman Curia and adapted it to new conditions in the Church and in the world , they intended nothing other_than to work all the better for_this salvation_of_souls . With full justification did Paul VI visualise the Roman Curia as another cenacle or upper_room of Jerusalem totally dedicated to the Church . We ourselves have proclaimed to all who work there that the only possible code of action -isaia- to set the norm for the Church and to deliver eager service to the Church . Indeed , in this_new legislation on the Roman Curia it has_been our will to insist that the dicasteries should approach all questions '' by a pastoral route and with a pastoral sense of judgement , aiming -atti_degli_apostoli- justice and the good of the Church and above all -atti_degli_apostoli- the salvation_of_souls . Now as we are about to promulgate this Apostolic Constitution , laying down the new physionomy of the Roman Curia , we wish to bring together the ideas and intentions that_have guided us . First of all we wanted the image and features of this Curia to respond to the demands of our_time , bearing in mind the changes that_have been_made by us or our predecessor Paul VI after_the publication of the Apostolic Constitution Regimini Ecclesi univers . Then it was our_duty to fulfill and complete that renewal of the laws of the Church which_was brought in by the publication of the new Code of Canon Law or which_-isaia- to be brought into_effect by the revision of the Oriental canonical legislation . Then we had in mind_that the traditional dicasteries and organs of the Roman Curia be made more suitable for the purposes they_were meant for , that_-isaia- , their share in governance , jurisdiction , and administration . For this_reason , their areas of competence have_been distributed more aptly among_them and more distinctly delineated . Then with an eye to what experience has taught in recent_years and to the never ending demands of Church society , we reexamined the juridical form and raison d \u00eatre of existence of those organs which_are rightly called '' postconciliar , '' changing on occasion their shape and organization . We did this in order to make_the work of those institutions more_and_more useful and beneficial , that_-isaia- , supporting special pastoral_activity and research in the Church which , -atti_degli_apostoli- an ever accelerating pace , are filling pastors with concern and which with the same urgency demand timely and well thought out answers . Finally , new and more stable measures have_been devised to promote mutual cooperation between dicasteries , so that_their manner of working may intrinsically bear the stamp of unity . In a word , our whole steadfast approach has_been to make sure_that the structure and working methods of the Roman Curia increasingly correspond to the ecclesiology spelled out by the Second Vatican Council , be ever more_clearly suitable for achieving the pastoral purposes of its_own constitution , and more_and_more fit to meet_the needs of Church and civil_society . It -isaia- indeed our conviction_that now , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium after_the birth of Christ , the zeal of the Roman Curia in no small measure contributes to the Church s fidelity to the mystery of her origin , since_the Holy Spirit keeps her ever young by the power of the Gospel . Having given thought to all these_matters with the help of expert advisors , sustained by the wise counsel and collegial spirit of the cardinals and bishops , having diligently studied the nature and mission of the Roman Curia , we have commanded that_this Apostolic Constitution be drawn up , led by the hope_that this venerable institution , so necessary to the government of the Church , may respond to that new pastoral impulse by which all the faithful_are moved , laity , priests and particularly bishops , especially now after_the Second Vatican Council , to listen ever more_deeply and follow what_the Spirit -isaia- saying to the Churches cf . Just as all the pastors of the Church , and among_them in a special_way the bishop of Rome , are keenly aware that_they_are '' Christ s servants , stewards entrusted with the mysteries of God '' Cor : and seek above all to be utterly loyal helpers whom_the Eternal Father may easily use to carry_out the work of salvation in the world , so also the Roman Curia has this strong desire , in each_and_every sphere of its important work , to be filled_with_the same_spirit and the same inspiration ; the Spirit , we say , of the Son of Man , of Christ the only_begotten of the Father , who '' has come to save what_was lost '' Mt : and whose single and all embracing wish -isaia- that all men '' may_have life and have it to the full '' Jn : . Therefore , with the help of God s grace and of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary , the Mother of the Church , we establish and decree the following norms for the Roman Curia . IGENERAL NORMS Notion of Roman Curia Art . The Roman Curia -isaia- the complex of dicasteries and institutes which help the Roman Pontiff in the exercise of his supreme pastoral_office for the good and service of the whole Church and of the particular Churches . It thus strengthens the unity of the faith and the communion of the people of God and promotes the mission proper to the Church in the world . Structure of the Dicasteries Art . By the word '' dicasteries '' are understood the Secretariat of State , Congregations , Tribunals , Councils and Offices , namely the Apostolic Camera , the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See , and the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See . The dicasteries are juridically equal among_themselves . Among the institutes of the Roman Curia are the Prefecture of the Papal Household and the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff . Unless they_have a different structure in virtue of their_specific nature or some special law , the dicasteries are composed of the cardinal prefect or the presiding archbishop , a body of cardinals and of some bishops , assisted by a secretary , consultors , senior administrators , and a suitable number of officials . According to the specific nature of certain dicasteries , clerics and other faithful can be added to the body of cardinals and bishops . Strictly speaking , the members of a congregation are the cardinals and the bishops . The prefect or president acts as moderator of the dicastery , directs it and acts in its name . The secretary , with the help of the undersecretary , assists the prefect or president in managing the business of the dicastery as well as its human resources . The prefect or president , the members of the body mentioned in art . , , the secretary , and the other senior administrators , as well as the consultors , are appointed by the Supreme Pontiff for a five year term . Once they_have completed seventy five years of age , cardinal prefects are asked to submit their resignation to the Roman Pontiff , who , after considering all factors , will_make the decision . Other moderators and secretaries cease from office , having completed seventy five years of age ; members , when they_have completed eighty years of age ; those_who_are attached to any dicastery by reason of their office cease to be members when their office ceases . On the death of the Supreme Pontiff , all moderators and members of the dicasteries cease from their office . The camerlengo of the Roman Church and the major penitentiary are excepted , who expedite ordinary business and refer to the College of Cardinals those things_which would_have been referred to the Supreme Pontiff . The secretaries see to the ordinary operations of the dicasteries , taking care of ordinary business only ; they_need to be confirmed in office by the Supreme Pontiff within three months of his election . The members of the body mentioned in art . , , are taken from among the cardinals living in Rome or outside the city , to whom are added some bishops , especially diocesan ones , insofar as they_have special expertise in the matters being dealt_with ; also , depending on the nature of the dicastery , some clerics and other Christian faithful , with this proviso that matters requiring the exercise of power of governance be reserved to those in holy_orders . Consultors also are appointed from among clerics or other Christian faithful outstanding for their knowledge and prudence , taking_into consideration , as much as possible , the international character of the Church . Officials are taken from among the Christian faithful , clergy or laity , noted for their virtue , prudence , and experience , and for the necessary knowledge attested by suitable academic_degrees , and selected as far_as_possible from the various regions of the world , so that the Curia may express the universal character of the Church . The suitability of the applicants should be evaluated by test or other appropriate means , according to the circumstances . Particular Churches , moderators of institutes_of_consecrated_life and of societies of apostolic_life will not_fail to render assistance to the Apostolic See by allowing their Christian faithful or their members to be available for service -atti_degli_apostoli- the Roman Curia . Each dicastery -isaia- to have its_own archive where incoming documents and copies of documents sent out are kept safe and in good order in a system of '' protocol '' organized according to modern methods . Matters of major importance are reserved to the general meeting , according to the nature of each dicastery . All members must be called in due time to the plenary sessions , held as far_as_possible once a year , to deal_with questions involving general principles , and for other questions which_the prefect or president may_have deemed to require treatment . For ordinary sessions it -isaia- sufficient to convoke members who reside in Rome . The secretary participates in all sessions with the right to vote . Consultors and those_who_are equivalent to them are to make a diligent study of the matter in hand and to present their considered opinion , usually in writing . So far as opportunity allows and depending on the nature of each dicastery , consultors can be called together to examine questions in a collegial fashion and , as the case may be , present a common position . For individual cases , others can be called in for consultation who , although not numbered among the consultors , are qualified by their special expertise in the matter to be treated . Depending on their_own proper field of competence , the dicasteries deal with_those matters which , because_of_their special importance , either by their nature or by law , are reserved to the Apostolic See and those_which exceed the competence of individual bishops and their groupings , as well as those matters committed to them by the Supreme Pontiff . The dicasteries study the major problems of the present age , so that the Church s pastoral action may be more_effectively promoted and suitably coordinated , with due regard to relations with the particular Churches . The dicasteries promote initiatives for the good of the universal Church . Finally , they review matters that the Christian faithful , exercising their_own right , bring to the attention of the Apostolic See . The competence of dicasteries -isaia- defined on the basis of subject matter , unless otherwise expressly provided for . Questions are to be dealt_with according to law , be it universal law or the special law of the Roman Curia , and according to the norms of each dicastery , yet with pastoral means and criteria , attentive both to justice and the good of the Church and , especially , to the salvation_of_souls . Apart from the official Latin language , it -isaia- acceptable to approach the Roman Curia in any of the languages widely known today . For the convenience of the dicasteries , a centre -isaia- being established for translating documents into other languages . General documents prepared by one dicastery will be communicated to other interested dicasteries , so that the text may be improved with any corrections that may be suggested , and , through common consultation , it may even be proceeded in a coordinated manner to their implementation . Decisions of major importance are to be submitted for the approval of the Supreme Pontiff , except decisions for_which special faculties have_been granted to the moderators of the dicasteries as well as the sentences of the Tribunal of the Roman Rota and the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura within_the limits of their_proper competence . The dicasteries cannot issue laws or general decrees having the force of law or derogate from the prescriptions of current universal law , unless in individual cases and with the specific approval of the Supreme Pontiff . It -isaia- of the utmost importance that_nothing grave and extraordinary be transacted unless the Supreme Pontiff be previously informed by the moderators of the dicasteries . Hierarchical recourses are received by whichever dicastery has competence in that subject matter , without prejudice to art . Questions , however , which_are to be dealt_with judicially are sent to the competent tribunals , without prejudice to arts . Conflicts of competence arising between dicasteries are to be submitted to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura , unless it pleases the Supreme Pontiff to deal_with them otherwise . Matters touching the competence of more_than one dicastery are to be examined together by the dicasteries concerned . To enable them to exchange advice , a meeting will be called by the moderator of the dicastery which_has begun to deal_with the matter , either on his_own initiative or -atti_degli_apostoli- the request of another dicastery concerned . However , if the subject matter demands it , it may be referred to a plenary session of the dicasteries concerned . The meeting will be chaired by the moderator of the dicastery who called the meeting or by its secretary , if only the secretaries are meeting . Where needed , permanent interdicasterial commissions will be set up to deal_with matters requiring mutual and frequent consultation . Meetings of Cardinals Art . By mandate of the Supreme Pontiff , the cardinals in charge of dicasteries meet together several times a year to examine more_important questions , coordinate their activities , so that_they_may be able to exchange information and take counsel . More serious business of a general character can be usefully dealt_with , if the Supreme Pontiff so decides , by the cardinals assembled in plenary consistory according to proper law . Council of Cardinalsfor the Study of Organizational and Economic Questions of the Apostolic See Art . The Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational and Economic Questions of the Apostolic See consists of fifteen cardinals who head particular Churches from various parts_of_the_world and are appointed by the Supreme Pontiff for a five year term of office . The Council -isaia- convened by the cardinal secretary of state , usually twice a year , to consider those economic and organizational questions which relate to the administration of the Holy See , with the assistance , as needed , of experts in these affairs . The Council also considers the activities of the special institute which_-isaia- erected and located within_the State of Vatican City in order to safeguard and administer economic goods placed in its care with the purpose of supporting works of religion and charity . This institute -isaia- governed by a special law . Relations with Particular Churches Art . Close relations are to be fostered with particular Churches and groupings of bishops , seeking out_their advice when preparing documents of major importance that_have a general character . As far_as_possible , documents of a general character or having a special bearing on their particular Churches should be communicated to the bishops before they_are made public . Questions brought before the dicasteries are to be diligently examined and , without delay , an answer or , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , a written acknowledgement of receipt , insofar as this_-isaia- necessary , should be sent . Dicasteries should_not omit to consult with papal legates regarding business affecting the particular Churches where_the legates are serving , nor_should they omit to communicate to the legates the results of their deliberations . '' Ad limina '' Visits Art . In keeping_with a venerable tradition and the prescriptions of law , bishops presiding over particular Churches visit the tombs of the Apostles -atti_degli_apostoli- predetermined times and on that occasion present to the Roman Pontiff a report on the state of their diocese . These kinds of visits have a special importance in the life of the Church , marking as they do the summit of the relationship of the pastors of each particular Church with the Roman Pontiff . For he meets his_brother bishops , and discusses with_them matters concerning the good of the Churches and the bishops role as shepherds , and he confirms and supports them in faith and charity . This strengthens the bonds of hierarchical communion and openly manifests the catholicity of the Church and the unity of the episcopal college . The ad limina visits also concern the dicasteries of the Roman Curia . For through these visits a helpful dialogue_between the bishops and the Apostolic See -isaia- increased and deepened , information -isaia- shared , advice and timely suggestions are brought forward for the greater good and progress of the Churches and for the observance of the common discipline of the Church . These visits are to be prepared very carefully and appropriately so that_they proceed well and enjoy a successful outcome in their three principal stages namely , the pilgrimage to the tombs of the Princes of the Apostles and their veneration , the meeting with the Supreme Pontiff , and the meetings -atti_degli_apostoli- the dicasteries of the Roman Curia . For this_purpose , the report on the state of the diocese should be sent to the Holy See six months before the time set for the visit . It -isaia- to be examined with all diligence by the competent dicasteries , and their remarks are to be shared with a special committee convened for this_purpose so that a brief synthesis of these may be drawn up and be readily -atti_degli_apostoli- hand in the meetings . Pastoral Character of the Activity of the Roman Curia Art . The activity of all who work -atti_degli_apostoli- the Roman Curia and the other institutes of the Holy See -isaia- a true ecclesial service , marked with a pastoral character , that all must discharge with a deep sense of duty as well as in a spirit of service , as it -isaia- a sharing in the world wide mission of the bishop of Rome . Each individual dicastery pursues its_own end , yet dicasteries cooperate with one_another . Therefore , all who_are working in the Roman Curia are to do so in such_a_way_that their_work may come together and be forged into one . Accordingly , all must_always be prepared to offer their services wherever needed . Although any work performed within_the institutes of the Holy See -isaia- a sharing in the apostolic action , priests_are to apply themselves as best they_can to the care of souls , without prejudice however to their_own office . Central Labour Office Art . According to its_own terms of reference , the Central Labour Office deals with working conditions within_the Roman Curia and related questions . To this Apostolic Constitution -isaia- added an Ordo servandus or common norms setting forth the ways and means of transacting business in the Curia itself , without prejudice to the norms of this Constitution . Each dicastery -isaia- to have its_own Ordo servandus or special norms setting forth the ways and means of transacting business within it . The Ordo servandus of each dicastery shall be made public in the usual manner of the Apostolic See . II SECRETARIAT OF STATE Art .

JOHN PAUL II APPENDIX I Pastoral Significance of the Visit ad limina Apostolorum cf . That pastoral spirit , prominent in the revision of the Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia , has_also led to attaching greater significance to bishops visits ad limina Apostolorum , bringing a more adequate light to bear on the pastoral importance which_the visits have gained in the present life of the Church . These visits , as we know , take_place when_the bishops , joined as they_are to the Apostolic See with the bond of communion and presiding in charity and service over the particular Churches throughout_the_world , set_out -atti_degli_apostoli- certain appointed times for Rome to visit the tombs of the Apostles . On the one_hand , these visits give the bishops an opportunity to sharpen their awareness of their responsibilities as successors of the Apostles and to feel more intensely their sense of hierarchical communion with the successor of Peter . On the other_hand , the visits in some_way constitute the highest and most central point in that universal ministry that the Holy Father -isaia- carrying_out when he embraces his_brother bishops , the pastors of the particular Churches , and takes up with_them the business of sustaining their_mission in the Church . These ad limina visits bring into full view this movement or life blood between_the particular Churches and the Church as a whole that theologians call perichoresis . The process may be compared to the diastolic systolic movements within_the human body when_the blood -isaia- carried to the outer limbs and from there flows back to the heart . Some trace and example of a first ad limina visit -isaia- found in Paul s letter to the Galatians , in which_the Apostle tells the story of his conversion and the journey he undertook among the pagans . Although he knew that he had been_called and instructed personally by Christ who_had conquered death , he wrote these_words : '' Then did I go up to Jerusalem to meet Cephas . I stayed fifteen days with_him '' Gal : . '' It was_not until fourteen years later that I travelled up to Jerusalem again . I expounded the whole gospel that I preach the gentiles , to make quite sure_that the efforts I was making and had_already made should_not be fruitless '' Gal : . The natural result of this meeting with Peter s successor , first guardian of the deposit of truth passed on by the Apostles , -isaia- to strengthen unity in the same faith , hope and charity , and more_and_more to recognize and treasure that immense heritage of spiritual and moral wealth that_the_whole Church , joined with the bishop of Rome by the bond of communion , has spread throughout_the_world . During the ad limina visit , two men stand face to face together , namely the bishop of a certain particular Church and the bishop of Rome , who -isaia-_also the successor of Peter . Both carry on their shoulders the burden of office , which they_cannot relieve themselves from , but they_are_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all divided one from the other , for both of them in their_own way represent , and must represent , the sum total of the faithful , the whole of the Church , and the sum total of the bishops , which together constitute the only '' we and us '' in the body of Christ . It -isaia- in their communion that_the_faithful under their care communicate with one_another , and likewise the universal Church and particular Churches communicate with each_other . For all these reasons , the ad limina visits express that pastoral solicitude which thrives in the universal Church . Here we see the meeting of the pastors of the Church , joined together in a collegial unity that_-isaia- based on apostolic succession . In this College , each_and_every one of the bishops displays that solicitude of Jesus Christ , the Good Shepherd , which all have_received by way of inheritance . This indeed -isaia- the highest ideal of the apostolate that_has to be carried_out in the Church and which concerns the bishops together_with_the successor of Peter . For each_one of them stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of all the apostolate , in all its forms , that_-isaia- carried_out in each particular Church , joined -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time in the universal dimension of the Church as a whole . All this apostolate , again in all its forms , demands and includes the work and help of all those_who_are building the Body of Christ in the Church , be it universal or particular : the priests , men_and_women_religious consecrated to God , and the laypeople . Now if the ad limina visits are conceived and viewed in this_way , they come to be a specific moment of that communion_which so profoundly determines the nature and essence of the Church , as it was admirably indicated in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , especially in chapters II and III . Given that society nowadays -isaia- moving towards a greater unification , and the Church experiences herself as '' a sign and instrument . of communion with God and of unity among the whole of humankind , '' it seems utterly necessary_that a permanent communication between particular Churches and the Apostolic See should be promoted and built up , especially by sharing pastoral solicitude regarding questions , experiences , problems , projects and ideas about life and action . When pastors converge on Rome and meet together , there comes to pass a remarkable and most beautiful sharing of gifts from among all those riches in the Church , be they universal or local and particular , in accordance_with that principle of catholicity by which '' each part contributes its_own gifts to other parts and to the whole Church , so that_the_whole and each of the parts are strengthened by the common sharing of all things and by the common effort to attain to fullness in unity . '' Furthermore and in the same_way , ad limina visits aim not_only -atti_degli_apostoli- a direct sharing of information but_also and especially to an increase and strengthening of a collegial structure in the body of the Church , bringing_about a remarkable unity in variety . This communication in the Church -isaia- a two way movement . On the one_hand , the bishops converge towards_the centre and the visible foundation of unity . We are referring to that unity_which , when it comes to full bloom , casts its benefits on their_own groupings or conferences , through each pastor s responsibilities and awareness of his functions and of their fulfilment , or through the collegial spirit of all the pastors . On the other_hand , there_-isaia- the commission '' which_the Lord confided to Peter alone , as the first of the apostles '' which serves the ecclesial_community and the spread of her_mission , in such_a_way_that nothing_-isaia- left untried that may lead to the advancement and preservation of the unity of the faith and the common discipline of the whole Church , and all become more_and_more aware_that the responsibility of proclaiming the Gospel everywhere throughout_the_world falls chiefly on the body of the pastors . From all the principles established above to describe this_most important process , one may deduce in what way_that apostolic custom of '' seeing Peter '' -isaia- to be understood and put into_practice . First of all the ad limina visit has a sacred meaning in that the bishops with religious veneration pay a visit to the tombs of Peter and Paul , the Princes of the Apostles , shepherds and pillars of the Church of Rome . Then the ad limina visit has a personal meaning because each_individual bishop meets the successor of Peter and talks to him face to face . Finally , the visit has a curial meaning , that_-isaia- , a hallmark of community , because the bishops enter_into conversation with the moderators of the dicasteries , councils , and offices of the Roman Curia . The Curia , after all , -isaia- a certain '' community '' that_-isaia- closely joined with the Roman Pontiff in that area of the Petrine ministry which involves solicitude for all the Churches cf . In the course of the ad limina visit , the access that the bishops have to the dicasteries -isaia- of a two fold nature : First , it gives them access to each_individual agency of the Roman Curia , especially to questions that the agencies are dealing_with directly according_to_their competence , questions that have_been referred by law to those agencies because_of_their expertise and experience . Second , bishops coming from all over the world , where each of the particular Churches can be found , are introduced to questions of common pastoral solicitude for the universal Church . Bearing in mind this specific point_of_view , the Congregation for Bishops , in consultation with the other interested Congregations , -isaia- preparing a '' Directory '' for publication so that the ad limina visits can receive long and short term preparation and thus proceed smoothly . Each and every bishop by the very nature of that '' ministry '' that_has_been entrusted to him -isaia- called and invited to visit the '' tombs of the Apostles '' -atti_degli_apostoli- certain appointed times . However , since_the bishops living within each territory , nation or region , have_already gathered together and now form conferences of bishops collegial unions with an excellent , broad theoretical basis it -isaia- highly appropriate that the ad limina visits should proceed according to this collegial principle , for that carries much significance within_the Church . The institutes of the Apostolic See , and especially_the nunciatures and apostolic delegations as well as the dicasteries of the Roman Curia , are_most willing to offer assistance in order to ensure_that ad limina visits be made possible , are suitably prepared and proceed well . To sum up : the institution of the ad limina visit -isaia- an instrument of the utmost value , commanding respect because_it_-isaia- an ancient custom and has outstanding pastoral importance . Truly , these visits express the catholicity of the Church and the unity and communion of the College of Bishops , qualities rooted in the successor of Peter and signified by those holy places_where the Princes of the Apostles underwent martyrdom , qualities of a theological , pastoral , social , and religious import known to all . This institution therefore -isaia- to be favored and promoted in every possible way , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment of the history_of_salvation in which_the teachings and magisterium of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council shine out with ever brighter light . APPENDIX II The Collaborators of the Apostolic See as a Work Community cf . The principal feature characterizing the revision of the Apostolic Constitution Regimini Ecclesi univers , so that it might be adapted to the needs that arose after its promulgation , was certainly to emphasize the pastoral nature of the Roman Curia . Viewed in this_way , the true character of the functions fulfilled in the midst , as it were , of the Apostolic See shines bright and clear , so that_they provide the Supreme Pontiff with suitable instruments to carry_out the mission entrusted to him by Christ Our Lord . Through that unique ministry which he offers to the Church , the Supreme Pontiff strengthens his_brothers in the faith Lk : the pastors , namely , and the Christian faithful of the universal Church looking only to nourish and guard that Church communion in which '' there_are also particular Churches that retain their_own traditions , without prejudice to the Chair of Peter which presides over the whole assembly of charity cf . , and protects their legitimate variety and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time keeps watch to ensure_that individual differences , so far_from_being harmful to unity , actually serve its cause . By constant toil , this Petrine ministry reaches out to the whole_world and claims the help of persons and other means throughout_the Church . Help it does receive in a direct and privileged manner from all those_who_are called to perform various functions in the Roman Curia and in the various institutions which compose the structure of the Holy See , be they in holy_orders as bishops and priests , or men_and_women consecrated to God in the religious families and secular institutes , or Christian lay men_and_women . Out of this diversity emerge certain quite remarkable contours and the considerable importance of these duties , which_have absolutely no equivalent -atti_degli_apostoli- any_other level of civil_society , with_which by its_very nature indeed the Roman Curia cannot be compared . On this foundation stands that leading idea of the work community constituted by all those_who , being well nourished with the one_and_the_same faith and charity and '' united , heart and soul '' Acts : , make up those structures of collaboration just mentioned . Therefore those_who under whatever title and in any manner help in the universal mission of the Supreme Pontiff to foster the Church community , have a further call to set up a communion of purpose , of undertakings , and of rules of behaviour , that deserves the name of community more_than does any_other form of grouping . The letter of Pope John Paul II of November on the meaning of work performed for the Apostolic See , took pains to elaborate on the characteristics of this_work community . The letter outlined its_nature , unique and yet endowed_with a variety of functions . All those_who share in the '' single , incessant activity of the Apostolic See , '' become in some_way brothers . From this consideration the letter went on to conclude that_those_who shared in this_work should be aware '' of that specific character of their positions . In any case , such a consciousness has_ever been_the tradition and pride of those_who_have chosen to dedicate themselves to that noble service . '' The letter adds : '' This consideration applies to clerics and religious and to laity as well ; both to those_who occupy posts of high responsibility and to office and manual workers to whom auxiliary functions are assigned . '' The same letter points_out the special nature of the Apostolic See , which , to preserve the exercise of spiritual freedom and its true and visible immunity , constitutes a sovereign State in its_own right and yet '' does_not possess all ordinary characteristics of a political community , '' different from all others . The practical results of this condition are seen in the operation of its affairs , especially as regards its economic organization . In the Apostolic See there_-isaia- a total absence of a taxation system that other states have by right , and it has no economic activity producing goods and income . The '' prime basis of sustenance of the Apostolic See -isaia- the spontaneous offerings '' by reason of a certain universal interdependence emanating from the Catholic family and elsewhere , which to a marvellous degree expresses that communion of charity over which_the Apostolic See presides in the world and by which it lives . From this basic condition flow certain consequences on the practical level and in the behaviour among the staff of the Holy See '' the spirit of thrift , '' '' a readiness always to take account of the real but limited financial possibilities of the Holy See and their source , '' '' a profound trust in Providence . '' And , over and beyond all these qualities , '' those_who work_for the Holy See must_therefore have_the profound conviction_that their_work above all entails an ecclesial responsibility to live in a spirit of authentic faith , and that the juridical administrative aspects of their relationship_with the Apostolic See stand in a particular light . The remuneration owed to the clerical and lay staff -atti_degli_apostoli- the Holy See , according_to_their personal conditions of life , -isaia- regulated by the major principles of the social teachings of the Church , which_have_been made quite clear by the magisterium of the Popes from the time of the publication of Leo XIII s Encyclical Letter Rerum novarum up to John Paul II s Encyclicals Laborem exercens and Sollicitudo rei_socialis . While labouring under a grave lack of economic means , the Holy See makes every_effort to measure up to the heavy obligations to which_it_-isaia- held with_regard to its workers even granting them certain benefit packages but subject to that basic situation which_-isaia- peculiar to the Apostolic See and has_been explained in the Pope s Letter , the fact , namely_,_that the Holy See cannot be compared to any_other form of State , since_it_-isaia- deprived of the ordinary means of generating income , except the income that comes_from universal charity . However the Holy See -isaia- conscious of the fact and the same Apostolic Letter makes this clear_that the active cooperation of everybody , and especially of the lay members of the staff , -isaia- necessary so that regulations and interrelations may be protected , as well as those rights_and_duties that arise out of '' social_justice '' when_it_-isaia- correctly applied to the relations_between worker and employer . On this_subject , the Apostolic Letter has pointed_out the help that workers associations can_give in this respect , like the '' Associazione Dipendenti Laici Vaticani , '' recently founded through productive talks among the various administrative levels to promote the spirit of solicitude and justice . The Apostolic Letter however has cautioned us to beware lest this_kind of group distort the leading ideal that_must govern_the work community of the See of Peter . The letter says : '' However , a lapse of this type of organization into the field of extremist conflict and class struggle does_not correspond to the Church s social_teaching . Nor should such associations have a political character or openly or covertly serve partisan interests or other interests with quite different goals . At the same_time the Supreme Pontiff declared his firm conviction_that associations of this_kind like the one mentioned above '' set forward work problems and develop continuous and constructive dialogue_with_the competent organisms and will not_fail to take account in every case of the particular character of the Apostolic See . '' Now since_the lay staff of Vatican City had very much -atti_degli_apostoli- heart that_there be an ever_more suitable fine tuning of working conditions and of everything touching the labour question , the Supreme Pontiff provided_that '' suitable executive documents '' be prepared '' for forthering a work community according to the principles set_forth by means of suitable norms and structures . '' The outcome of the Pope s concern -isaia-_now '' The Labour Office of the Apostolic See '' L . , which_-isaia- established by an Apostolic Letter given motu_proprio together_with_the document specifying in detail the membership of the Labour Office , its authority , its functions , its regulatory and advisory organs as well as its_proper norms to facilitate a fair , rapid , and efficient process ; furthermore , as it has_been just newly set up , this Office needs a reasonable period of time to operate ad experimentum so that_its regulations and procedures may be confirmed and its true and objective importance reviewed . This motu_proprio and the regulations of the new Labour Office are_being published -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , together_with_the promulgation of the Apostolic Constitution on the renewal of the Roman Curia . The chief purpose of the Labour Office apart_from the practical ends for_which it was brought into existence -isaia- to promote and preserve a work community among the various levels of staff of the Apostolic See , especially_the laypeople . The spirit of this community should be characteristic of all who_have_been called to the privilege and responsibility of serving the Petrine ministry . Again and again it -isaia- to be explained that_these workers are in duty bound to foster and cultivate within themselves a special awareness of the Church , an awareness making them ever_more fitted to fulfill the functions entrusted to them , no matter what these may be . These functions are_not mere give and take arrangements a certain labour given and a certain wage received , as may happen in institutions in civil_society ; they constitute rather a service offered to Christ himself '' who came not to be served but to serve '' Mt : . Therefore all the workers of the Holy See , clergy and laity , out of a sense of honour and sincerely conscious of their_own duty before God and themselves , must resolve that their_lives as priests and lay_faithful shall be lived -atti_degli_apostoli- an exemplary level , as -isaia- proposed by God s commandments , by the laws of the Church and by the pronouncements of the Second Vatican Council , especially in Lumen gentium , Presbyterorum ordinis , and Apostolicam actuositatem . However , this_-isaia- a free decision , by which with full awareness certain responsibilities are taken on , the force of which_-isaia- felt not_only on the individuals but_also on their_families and even on the actual work community composed of all the collaborators of the Holy See . Well may we be asked '' of whose spirit we are '' cf . : thus_the Pope writes -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Apostolic Letter . So each and all , in searching their_own sincerity as human_beings and as Christians , are_bound to be faithful to those promises , and to keep those bonds that_they freely accepted when they_were chosen to labour -atti_degli_apostoli- the Holy See . To keep in view the principles and norms indicated by the Pope in the afore mentioned Apostolic Letter to the cardinal secretary of state , the full text -isaia- printed below . In fact , this document must be considered as the foundation and sign of the whole pattern of interdependence in order to maintain full cooperation and understanding within_the work community -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Apostolic See . Apostolic Letter Apostolica Sedes by John Paul IIon the meaning of work performed for the Apostolic See . The Apostolic See , in exercising its mission , has recourse to the valid and precious work of the particular community made up of those men_and_women , priests , religious and laity who devote their_efforts in their dicasteries and offices to the service of the universal Church . Charges and duties are assigned to the members of this community ; each of those charges and duties has its_own purpose and dignity , in consideration both of the objective content and value of the work done and of the person_who accomplishes it . This concept of community , applied to those_who aid the bishop of Rome in his_ministry as pastor of the universal Church , permits us first of all to define the unitary character of functions which_are nonetheless diverse among_themselves . All persons called to perform them really participate in the single , incessant activity of the Apostolic See ; that_-isaia- , in that '' concern_for all the Churches '' cf . : which enlivened the apostles service from the earliest times and -isaia- the prerogative today in outstanding measure of the successors of St . Peter in the Roman See . It -isaia-_very important_that those_who_are associated in any_way with the Apostolic See s activity should_have a consciousness of that specific character of their positions . In any case , such a consciousness has_ever been_the tradition and pride of those_who_have chosen to dedicate themselves to that noble service . This consideration applies to clerics and religious and to laity as well , both to those_who hold posts of high responsibility , and to office and manual workers to whom auxiliary functions are assigned . It applies to persons attached to the service of the same Apostolic See more directly , inasmuch as they work in those organisms which_are altogether known in fact under the name of '' Holy See ; '' and it applies to those_who_are in the service of the Vatican City State , which_-isaia- so closely linked_with the Apostolic See . In the recent Encyclical Laborem exercens , I recalled the principal truths of the '' gospel of labour '' and Catholic doctrine on human_work , a doctrine always alive in the Church s tradition . There -isaia- need_for the life of that singular community which operates sub umbra Petri in Peter s shadow , in such immediate contact_with_the Apostolic See , to conform itself to these truths . In order to apply these_principles to reality , their objective significance must be borne in mind , together_with_the specific nature of the Apostolic See . This latter does_not have_the general form of true states even_though , as I noted above , the entity described as the Vatican City State -isaia- closely linked_with it ; for true states are subjects of the political sovereignty of particular societies . On the other_hand , the Vatican City State -isaia- sovereign , yet does_not possess all ordinary characteristics of a political community . It -isaia- an atypical state . It exists as a fitting means of guaranteeing the exercise of the spiritual liberty of the Apostolic See ; that_-isaia- , as the means of assuring real and visible independence of the same in its activity of government for the sake of the universal Church , as well as of its pastoral_work directed toward_the whole_human_race . It does_not possess a proper society for the service of which it was established nor_does it base itself upon forms of social action which usually determine the structure and organization of every_other state . Furthermore , the persons_who aid the Apostolic See or even cooperate in government of the Vatican City State are with few exceptions not citizens of this state . Nor , consequently , do they_have the rights_and_duties those to do with taxation in particular which ordinarily arise from belonging to a state . The Apostolic See does_not develop nor_can it develop economic activity proper to a state , since it transcends the narrow confines of the Vatican City State in a much more_important respect and extends its mission to the whole of the earth . Production of economic goods and enrichment by way of revenues are foreign to its institutional purposes . Besides the revenues of the Vatican City State and the limited income afforded by what remains of the funds obtained on the occasion of the Lateran Pacts as indemnity for the Papal States . and ecclesiastical goods passed to the Italian State , the prime basis of sustenance of the Apostolic See -isaia- the spontaneous offerings provided by Catholics throughout_the_world and by other men_of_good will . This corresponds to a tradition having its origin in the Gospel and the teachings of the apostles . This tradition has_taken on various_forms over the centuries in relation to the economic structures prevailing in various eras . In conformity_with that tradition it must be affirmed that the Apostolic See may and ought to make_use of the spontaneous contributions of the faithful and other people_of_good_will , without having recourse to other means which might appear to be less respectful of the character proper to the Apostolic See . The above mentioned material contributions are the expression of a constant and moving solidarity with the Apostolic See and the activity carried_out by it . My profound gratitude goes out to such_great solidarity . It ought to be with a sense_of_responsibility commensurate with the nature of the contributions on the part of the Apostolic See itself , its individual organs and the persons working in them . That -isaia- to say that the contributions are to be used solely and always according to the dispositions and will of those offering them : for the general intention which_-isaia- maintenance of the Apostolic See and the generality of its activities or for particular purposes missionary , charitable , etc . , when these have_been expressly mentioned . Responsibility and loyalty toward those_who show their solidarity with the Apostolic See through_their aid and share its pastoral concern in some_way are expressed in scrupulous fidelity to all tasks and duties assigned , as well as in the zeal , hard work and professional spirit_which ought to distinguish whoever participates in the same Apostolic See s activities . Right intention must likewise be always cultivated , so as to exert watchful administration in terms of their purposes over both material goods which_are offered and over what_-isaia- acquired or conserved by means of such goods . This includes safeguarding and enhancing the See of Peter s precious inheritance in the religious cultural and artistic fields . In making use of means allocated for these ends , the Apostolic See and those directly collaborating with it must be distinguished not_only by a spirit of thrift , but_also by readiness always to take account of the real but limited financial possibilities of the Holy See and their source . Obviously such interior dispositions of mind ought to be well assimilated , becoming ingrained in the minds of religious and clerics through_their training . But neither should they be lacking from the minds of laity who through_their free choice accept working for and with the Apostolic See . Moreover , all those_who_have particular responsibilities in running organisms , offices and services of the Apostolic See , as well as those employed in various functions , will know_how to join this_spirit of thrift with constant application to making the various activities ever more_effective . This can be done through organization of work based , on the one_hand , on full respect_for persons and the valid contribution made by each according_to_his proper abilities and functions and , on the other_hand , upon use of appropriate structures and technical means , so that the activity engaged in corresponds more_and_more to the demands of service to the universal Church . Recourse shall be had to everything_that experience , science and technology teach ; efforts will be made in this_way to use human and financial resources with_greater effectiveness by avoiding waste , self interest and pursuit of unjustified privileges , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time by promoting good human relations in every sector and the true and rightful interests of the Apostolic See . Along with_such commitment should go a profound trust in Providence , which , through the offerings of good people , will not_allow a lack of the means to pursue the Apostolic See s proper ends . Should a lack of means impede accomplishment of some fundamental objective , a special appeal may be made to the generosity of the people of God , informing them of needs which_are not sufficiently well_known . In the normal way , however , it -isaia- fitting to be content with what bishops_,_priests , religious institutes and faithful offer spontaneously , since they_themselves can_see or discern rightful needs . Many of those working with the Apostolic See are clerics . Since they live in celibacy , they_have no families to their charge . They deserve remuneration proportional to the tasks performed and capable of assuring them a decent manner of living and means to carry_out the duties of their state , including responsibilities which_they may_have in certain cases toward parents or other family members dependent on them . Nor should the demands of orderly social relationships be neglected , particularly and above all their obligation to assist the needy . This obligation -isaia- more impelling for clerics and religious than for the laity , by reason of their evangelical vocation . Remuneration of the lay employees of the Apostolic See should_also correspond to the tasks performed , taking_into consideration -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time their responsibility to support their_families . Study should therefore be devoted , in a spirit of lively concern and justice , to ascertaining their objective material needs and those of their_families , including needs regarding education of their_children and suitable provision for old age , so as to meet those needs properly . The fundamental guidelines in this sector are to be found in Catholic teaching on remuneration for work . Immediate indications for the evaluation of circumstances can be obtained from examining experiences and programs of the society in particular , the Italian society to which almost all lay employees of the Apostolic See belong and in which_they -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate live . A valid collaborative function may be performed by workers associations such as the Association of Vatican Lay Employees , which recently came into existence , in promoting that spirit of concern and justice , through representing those working within_the Apostolic See . Such associations take on a specific character within_the Apostolic See . They are an initiative in conformity_with_the Church s social_teaching , for the Church sees them as one instrument for better assuring social_justice in relations_between worker and employer . However , a lapse of this type of organization into the field of extremist conflict and class struggle does_not correspond to the Church s social_teaching . Nor should such associations have a political or openly or covertly serve partisan interests or other interests with quite different goals . I express confidence that associations such as that now existing and just mentioned will perform a useful function in the work community , operating in solid harmony_with_the Apostolic See , by taking inspiration from the principles of the Church s social_teaching . I -amos- likewise certain_that as they set forward work problems and develop continuous and constructive dialogue_with_the competent organisms they_will not_fail to take account in every case of the particular character of the Apostolic See , as pointed_out in the initial part of this_letter . In relation to what_has_been expounded , Your Eminence will wish to prepare suitable executive documents for furthering a work community according to the principles set_forth by means of suitable norms and structures . I emphasized in the Encyclical Laborem exercens that the worker s personal_dignity requires expression in a particular relationship_with the work entrusted to him . This relationship -isaia- objectively realizable in various_ways according to the kind of work undertaken . It -isaia- realized subjectively when_the worker lives it as '' his_own , '' even_though he -isaia- working '' for wages . '' Since the work in question here -isaia- performed within_the Apostolic See and -isaia- therefore marked by the characteristics already mentioned , such a relationship calls for heartfelt sharing in that '' concern_for all the Churches '' which_-isaia- proper to the Chair of Peter . Those who work_for the Holy See must_therefore have_the profound conviction_that their_work above all entails an ecclesial responsibility to live in a spirit of authentic faith , and that the juridical administrative aspects of their relationship_with the Apostolic See stand in a particular light . The Second Vatican Council provided us with copious teaching on the way_in_which all Christians , clerics , religious and laity can and ought to make such ecclesial concern their_own . So it seems necessary_for all , especially_those working with the Apostolic See , to deepen personal consciousness above all of the universal apostolic commitment of Christians and that arising from each_one s specific vocation : that of the bishop , of the priest , of religious , of the laity . The answers to the present difficulties in the field of human labor are to be sought in the sphere of social_justice . But they must_also be sought in the area of an interior relationship_with the work that_each -isaia- called_upon to perform . It seems evident_that work of whatever kind carried_out in the employment of the Apostolic See requires this in a quite special measure . Besides the deepened interior relationship , this_work calls for reciprocal respect , if it -isaia- to be advantageous and serene , based on human and Christian brotherhood by all and for all concerned . Only when_it_-isaia- allied with_such brotherhood that_-isaia- , with love of man in truth , can justice manifest itself as true justice . We must try to find '' of what spirit we are '' cf . These latter questions have hardly been touched on here . They cannot be adequately formulated in administrative juridical terms . This does_not exempt us , however , from the search and effort necessary_for making operative precisely within_the circle of the Apostolic See that spirit of human_work which_comes_from our Lord Jesus Christ . As I entrust these thoughts , Most Reverend Cardinal , to your attentive consideration , I call down an abundance of the gifts of divine assistance upon the future commitment which putting them into_practice requires . At the same_time I impart my benediction to you from my heart and willingly extend it to all those_who offer their meritorious service to the Apostolic See .

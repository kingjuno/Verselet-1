The family in the modern_world , as much as and perhaps more_than any_other institution , has_been beset by the many profound and rapid changes that_have affected society and culture . Many families are living this situation in fidelity to those values that constitute the foundation of the institution of the family . Others have_become uncertain and bewildered over their role or even doubtful and almost unaware of the ultimate meaning and truth of conjugal and family_life . Finally , there_are others_who are hindered by various situations of injustice in the realization of their fundamental rights . Knowing that marriage and the family constitute one_of_the_most precious of human values , the Church wishes to speak and offer her help to those_who_are already aware of the value of marriage and the family and seek to live it faithfully , to those_who_are uncertain and anxious and searching for the truth , and to those_who_are unjustly impeded from living freely their family lives . Supporting the first , illuminating the second and assisting the others , the Church offers her services to every_person who wonders about the destiny of marriage and the family . In a particular_way the Church addresses the young , who_are beginning their journey towards marriage and family_life , for the purpose of presenting them_with new horizons , helping them to discover the beauty and grandeur of the vocation to love and the service of life . The Synod of in Continuity with Preceding Synods . A sign of this profound interest of the Church in the family was_the last Synod of Bishops , held in Rome from September to October , . This was a natural continuation of the two preceding Synods : the Christian family , in fact , -isaia-_the_first community called to announce the Gospel to the human_person during growth and to bring him or her , through a progressive education and catechesis , to full human and Christian maturity . Furthermore , the recent Synod -isaia- logically connected in some_way as well with_that on the ministerilal priesthood and on justice in the modern_world . In fact , as an educating community , the family must help man to discern his_own vocation and to accept responsibility in the search_for greater justice , educating him from the beginning in interpersonal relationships , rich in justice and in love . At the close of their assembly , the Synod Fathers presented me with a long list of proposals in which_they had gathered the fruits of their reflections , which_had matured over intense days of work , and they asked me unanimously to be a spokesman before humanity of the Church s lively care_for the family and to give suitable indications for renewed pastoral effort in this fundamental sector of the life of man and of the Church . As I fulfill that mission with this Exhortation , thus actuating in a particular matter the apostolic ministry with_which I -amos- entrusted , I wish to thank all the members of the Synod for the very valuable contribution of teaching and experience that_they made especially through the Propositiones , the text of which I -amos- entrusting to the Pontifical Council for the Family with instructions to study it so as to bring out every aspect of its rich content . The Precious Value of Marriage and of the Family . Illuminated by the faith_that gives her an understanding of all the truth concerning the great value of marriage and the family and their deepest meaning , the Church once_again feels the pressing need to proclaim_the Gospel , that_-isaia- the '' good_news , '' to all people without exception , in particular to all those_who_are called to marriage and are preparing for it , to all married_couples and parents in the world . The Church -isaia- deeply convinced_that only by the acceptance of the Gospel are the hopes that_man legitimately places in marriage and in the family capable of being fulfilled . Willed by God in the very act of creation , marriage and the family are interiorly ordained to fulfillment in Christ and have need of His graces in order to be healed from the wounds of sin and restored to their '' beginning , '' that_-isaia- , to full understanding and the full realization of God s plan . At a moment of history in which_the family_-isaia- the object of numerous forces that seek to destroy it or in some_way to deform it , and aware_that the well_being of society and her_own good are intimately tied to the good of the family , the Church perceives in a more urgent and compelling way her_mission of proclaiming to all people the plan of God for marriage and the family , ensuring their full vitality and human and Christian development , and thus contributing to the renewal of society and of the People of God . PART ONE BRIGHT SPOTS AND SHADOWS FOR THE FAMILY TODAY The Need To Understand the Situation . Since God s plan_for marriage and the family touches men_and_women in the concreteness of their_daily existence in specific social_and_cultural situations , the Church ought to apply herself to understanding the situations within which marriage and the family are lived today , in order to fulfill her task of serving . This understanding -isaia- , therefore , an inescapable requirement of the work_of_evangelization . It -isaia- , in fact , to the families of our_times that the Church must bring_the unchangeable and ever_new Gospel of Jesus Christ , just as it -isaia- the families involved in the present conditions of the world_that are_called to accept and to live the plan of God that pertains to them . Moreover , the call and demands of the Spirit resound in the very events of history , and so the Church can_also be guided to a more profound understanding of the inexhaustible mystery of marriage and the family by the circumstances , the questions and the anxieties and hopes of the young_people , married_couples and parents of today . To this ought to be added a further reflection of particular importance -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . Not infrequently ideas and solutions which_are very appealing but_which obscure in varying degrees the truth and the dignity_of_the_human_person , are offered to the men_and_women of today , in their sincere and deep search_for a response to the important daily problems that affect their married and family_life . These views are_often supported by the powerful and pervasive organization of the means of social communication , which subtly endanger freedom and the capacity_for objective judgment . Many are_already aware of this danger to the human_person and are working for the truth . The Church , with_her evangelical discernment , joins with_them , offering her_own service to the truth , to freedom and to the dignity of every man and every woman . The discernment effected by the Church becomes_the offering of an orientation in order_that the entire truth and the full dignity of marriage and the family may be preserved and realized . This discernment -isaia- accomplished through the sense of faith_,_which -isaia-_a_gift that the Spirit gives to all the faithful , and -isaia- therefore the work of the whole Church according to the diversity of the various gifts and charisms that , together_with and according to the responsibility proper to each_one , work together for a more profound understanding and activation of the word of God The Church , therefore , does_not accomplish this discernment only through the Pastors , who teach in the name and with the power of Christ but_also through the laity : Christ '' made them His witnesses and gave them understanding of the faith and the grace of speech cf . : , so that the power of the Gospel might shine_forth in their_daily social and family_life . '' The laity , moreover , by reason of their particular vocation have_the specific role of interpreting the history of the world in the light of Christ , in as much as they_are_called to illuminate and organize temporal realities according to the plan of God , Creator and Redeemer . The '' supernatural sense of faith '' however does_not consist solely or necessarily in the consensus of the faithful . Following Christ , the Church seeks the truth , which_-isaia-_not always the same as the majority opinion . She listens to conscience and not to power , and in this_way she defends the poor and the downtrodden . The Church values sociological and statistical research , when it proves helpful in understanding the historical context in which pastoral action has to be developed and when it leads to a better understanding of the truth . Such research alone , however , -isaia- not to be considered in itself an expression of the sense of faith . Because it -isaia- the task of the apostolic ministry to ensure_that the Church remains in the truth of Christ and to lead her ever more_deeply into that_truth , the Pastors must promote the sense of the faith in all the faithful , examine and authoritatively judge the genuineness of its expressions , and educate the faithful in an ever_more mature evangelical discernment . Christian spouses and parents can and should offer their unique and irreplaceable contribution to the elaboration of an authentic evangelical discernment in the various situations and cultures in which men_and_women live their marriage and their family_life . They are qualified for_this role by their charism or specific gift , the gift of the sacrament of matrimony . The Situation of the Family in the World Today . The situation in which_the family finds itself presents positive and negative aspects : the first are a sign of the salvation of Christ operating in the world ; the second , a sign of the refusal that_man gives to the love of God . On the one_hand , in fact , there_-isaia- a more lively awareness of personal freedom and greater attention to the quality of interpersonal relationships in marriage , to promoting the dignity of women , to responsible procreation , to the education of children . There -isaia-_also an awareness of the need_for the development of interfamily relationships , for reciprocal spiritual and material assistance , the rediscovery of the ecclesial mission proper to the family and its responsibility_for the building of a more just society . On the other_hand , however , signs are_not lacking of a disturbing degradation of some fundamental values : a mistaken theoretical and practical concept of the independence of the spouses in relation to each_other ; serious misconceptions regarding the relationship of authority between parents and children ; the concrete difficulties that the family itself experiences in the transmission of values ; the growing number of divorces ; the scourge of abortion ; the ever_more frequent recourse to sterilization ; the appearance of a truly contraceptive mentality . At the root of these negative phenomena there frequently lies a corruption of the idea and the experience of freedom , conceived not as a capacity_for realizing the truth of God s plan_for marriage and the family , but as an autonomous power of self affirmation , often against others , for one_s_own selfish well_being . Worthy of our attention also -isaia- the fact_that , in the countries of the so called Third World , families often lack both the means necessary_for survival , such as food , work , housing and medicine , and the most elementary freedoms . In the richer countries , on the contrary , excessive prosperity and the consumer mentality , paradoxically joined to a certain anguish and uncertainty about the future , deprive married_couples of the generosity and courage needed_for raising up new human_life : thus life -isaia-_often perceived not as a blessing , but as a danger from which to defend oneself . The historical situation in which_the family lives therefore appears as an interplay of light and darkness . This shows_that history -isaia- not_simply a fixed progression towards what_-isaia- better , but_rather an event of freedom , and even a struggle between freedoms that_are in mutual conflict , that_-isaia- , according to the well_known expression of St . Augustine , a conflict between two loves : the love of God to the point of disregarding self , and the love of self to the point of disregarding God . It follows_that only an education for love rooted in faith can lead to the capacity of interpreting '' the signs of the times , '' which_are the historical expression of this twofold love . The Influence of Circumstances on the Consciences of the Faithful . Living in such a world , under the pressures coming above all from the mass_media , the faithful do not_always remain immune from the obscuring of certain fundamental values , nor set themselves up as the critical conscience of family culture and as active agents in the building of an authentic family humanism . Among the more troubling signs of this phenomenon , the Synod Fathers stressed the following , in particular : the spread of divorce and of recourse to a new union , even on the part of the faithful ; the acceptance of purely civil marriage in contradiction to the vocation of the baptized to '' be married in the Lord '' , the celebration of the marriage sacrament without living faith , but_for other motives ; the rejection of the moral norms that guide and promote the human and Christian exercise of sexuality in marriage . Our Age Needs Wisdom . The whole Church -isaia- obliged to a deep reflection and commitment , so that the new culture now emerging may be evangelized in depth , true values acknowledged , the rights of men_and_women defended , and justice promoted in the very structures of society . In this_way the '' new humanism '' will_not distract people from their relationship_with God , but will lead_them to it more_fully . Science and its technical applications offer new and immense possibilities in the construction of such a humanism . Still , as a consequence of political choices that decide the direction of research and its applications , science -isaia-_often used against its original purpose , which_-isaia- the advancement of the human_person . It becomes necessary , therefore , on the part of all , to recover an awareness of the primacy of moral values , which_are the values of the human_person as such . The great task that_has to be faced today for the renewal of society_-isaia- that of recapturing the ultimate meaning of life and its fundamental values . Only an awareness of the primacy of these values enables man to use the immense possibilities given him by science in such_a_way as to bring_about the true advancement of the human_person in his or her whole truth , in his or her freedom and dignity . Science -isaia- called to ally itself with wisdom . The following words of the Second Vatican Council can therefore be applied to the problems of the family : '' Our era needs such wisdom more_than bygone ages if the discoveries made by man are to be further humanized . For the future of the world stands in peril unless wiser people_are forthcoming . The education of the moral conscience , which_makes every_human_being capable of judging and of discerning the proper ways to achieve self realization according_to_his or her original truth , thus becomes a pressing requirement that cannot be renounced . Modern culture must be led to a more profoundly restored covenant with divine Wisdom . Every man_-isaia- given a share of such Wisdom through the creating action of God . And it -isaia- only in faithfulness to this covenant that the families of today will be in a position to influence positively the building of a more just and fraternal world . Gradualness and Conversion . To the injustice originating from sin which_has profoundly penetrated the structures of today_s_world and often hindering the family s full realization of itself and of its fundamental rights , we must all set ourselves in opposition through a conversion of mind_and_heart , following Christ Crucified by denying our_own selfishness : such a conversion cannot_fail to have a beneficial and renewing influence even on the structures of society . What -isaia- needed -isaia- a continuous , permanent conversion which , while requiring an interior detachment from every evil and an adherence to good in its fullness , -isaia- brought_about concretely in steps which lead us ever forward . Thus a dynamic process develops , one_which advances gradually with the progressive integration of the gifts of God and the demands of His definitive and absolute love in the entire personal and social_life of man . Therefore an educational growth process -isaia- necessary , in order_that individual believers , families and peoples , even civilization itself , by beginning from what_they have_already received of the mystery of Christ , may patiently be led forward , arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- a richer understanding and a fuller integration of this_mystery in their_lives . In conformity_with her constant tradition , the Church receives from the various cultures everything_that -isaia- able to express better the unsearchable riches of Christ . Only with the help of all the cultures will it be possible_for these riches to be manifested ever more_clearly , and for the Church to progress towards a daily more complete and profound awareness of the truth , which has_already_been given to her in its entirety by the Lord . Holding fast to the two principles of the compatibility with the Gospel of the various cultures to be taken up , and of communion with the universal Church , there_must be further study , particularly by the Episcopal Conferences and the appropriate departments of the Roman Curia , and greater pastoral diligence so that_this '' inculturation '' of the Christian faith may come about ever_more extensively , in the context of marriage and the family as well as in other fields . It -isaia- by means of '' inculturation '' that_one proceeds towards_the full restoration of the covenant with the Wisdom of God , which_-isaia- Christ Himself . The whole Church will be enriched also by the cultures which , though lacking technology , abound in human wisdom and are enlivened by profound moral values . So that the goal of this journey might be clear and consequently the way plainly indicated , the Synod was right to begin by considering in depth the original design of God for marriage and the family : it '' went back to the beginning , '' in deference to the teaching of Christ . PART TWO THE PLAN OF GOD FOR MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY Man , the Image of the God Who Is Love . God created man in His own image_and_likeness : calling him to existence through love , He called him -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for love . God -isaia- love and in Himself He lives a mystery of personal loving communion . Creating the human_race in His own image and continually keeping it in being , God inscribed in the humanity of man_and_woman the vocation , and thus_the capacity and responsibility , of love and communion . Love -isaia- therefore the fundamental and innate vocation of every_human_being . As an incarnate spirit , that_-isaia- a soul which expresses itself in a body and a body informed by an immortal spirit , man_-isaia- called to love in his unified totality . Love includes the human body , and the body -isaia- made a sharer in spiritual love . Christian revelation recognizes two specific ways of realizing the vocation of the human_person in its entirety , to love : marriage and virginity or celibacy . Either one_-isaia- , in its_own proper form , an actuation of the most profound truth of man , of his being '' created in the image of God . '' Consequently , sexuality , by means of which man_and_woman give themselves to one_another through the acts which_are proper and exclusive to spouses , -isaia- by no means something purely biological , but concerns the innermost being of the human_person as such . It -isaia- realized in a truly human way only if it -isaia- an integral part of the love by which a man and a woman commit themselves totally to one_another until death . The total physical self_giving would be a lie if it were_not the sign and fruit of a total personal self_giving , in which_the whole person , including the temporal dimension , -isaia- present : if the person were to withhold something or reserve the possibility of deciding otherwise in the future , by this_very fact he or she would_not be giving totally . This totality which_-isaia- required by conjugal love also corresponds to the demands of responsible fertility . This fertility -isaia-_directed to the generation of a human_being , and so by its_nature it surpasses the purely biological order and involves a whole series of personal values . For the harmonious growth of these values a persevering and unified contribution by both parents -isaia- necessary . The only '' place '' in which_this self_giving in its whole truth_-isaia- made possible -isaia- marriage , the covenant of conjugal love freely and consciously chosen , whereby man_and_woman accept the intimate community of life and love willed by God Himself which only in this light manifests its true meaning . The institution of marriage -isaia- not an undue interference by society or authority , nor the extrinsic imposition of a form . Rather it -isaia- an interior requirement of the covenant of conjugal love which_-isaia- publicly affirmed as unique and exclusive , in order to live in complete fidelity to the plan of God , the Creator . A person s freedom , far_from_being restricted by this fidelity , -isaia- secured against every_form of subjectivism or relativism and -isaia- made a sharer in creative Wisdom . Marriage and Communion Between God and People . The communion of love between God and people , a fundamental part of the Revelation and faith experience of Israel , finds a meaningful expression in the marriage covenant which_-isaia- established between a man and a woman . For this_reason_the central word of Revelation , '' God loves His people , '' -isaia- likewise proclaimed through the living and concrete word whereby a man and a woman express their conjugal love . Their bond of love becomes_the image and the symbol of the covenant which unites God and His people . And the same sin which_can harm the conjugal covenant becomes an image of the infidelity of the people to their God : idolatry -isaia- prostitution , infidelity -isaia- adultery , disobedience to the law_-isaia- abandonment of the spousal love of the Lord . But the infidelity of Israel does_not destroy the eternal fidelity of the Lord , and therefore the ever faithful love of God -isaia- put forward as the model of the of faithful love which_should exist between spouses . Jesus Christ , Bridegroom of the Church , and the Sacrament of Matrimony . The communion_between God and His people finds_its definitive fulfillment in Jesus Christ , the Bridegroom who loves and gives Himself as the Savior of humanity , uniting it to Himself as His body . He reveals the original truth of marriage , the truth of the '' beginning , '' and , freeing man from his hardness of heart , He makes man capable of realizing this_truth in its entirety . This revelation reaches its definitive fullness in the gift of love_which the Word of God makes to humanity in assuming a human_nature , and in the sacrifice which Jesus Christ makes of Himself on the Cross for His bride , the Church . In this sacrifice there_-isaia- entirely revealed that plan which God has imprinted on the humanity of man_and_woman since their creation ; the marriage of baptized persons thus becomes a real symbol of that new and eternal covenant sanctioned in the blood of Christ . The Spirit which_the Lord pours forth gives a new heart , and renders man_and_woman capable of loving one_another as Christ has loved us . Conjugal love reaches that fullness to which_it_-isaia- interiorly ordained , conjugal charity , which_-isaia- the proper and specific way_in_which the spouses participate in and are_called to live the very charity of Christ who gave Himself on the Cross . In a deservedly famous page , Tertullian has well expressed the greatness of this conjugal life in Christ and its beauty : '' How can I ever express the happiness of the marriage that_-isaia- joined together by the Church strengthened by an offering , sealed by a blessing , announced by angels and ratified by the Father ? . How wonderful the bond_between two believers with a single hope , a single desire , a single observance , a single service ! They are both brethren and both fellow servants ; there_-isaia- no separation between_them in spirit or flesh ; in fact they_are truly two in one flesh and where_the flesh -isaia- one , one_-isaia- the spirit . '' Receiving and meditating faithfully on the word of God , the Church has solemnly taught and continues to teach that the marriage of the baptized -isaia- one of the seven sacraments of the New Covenant . Indeed , by means of baptism , man_and_woman are definitively placed within_the new and eternal covenant , in the spousal covenant of Christ with the Church . And it -isaia- because of this indestructible insertion that the intimate community of conjugal life and love , founded by the Creator , -isaia- elevated and assumed into the spousal charity of Christ , sustained and enriched by His redeeming power . By virtue of the sacramentality of their marriage , spouses are_bound to one_another in the most profoundly indissoluble manner . Their belonging to each_other -isaia- the real representation , by means of the sacramental sign , of the very relationship of Christ with the Church . Spouses are therefore the permanent reminder to the Church of what happened on the Cross ; they_are for one_another and for the children witnesses to the salvation in which_the sacrament makes them sharers . Of this salvation event marriage , like every sacrament , -isaia- a memorial , actuation and prophecy : '' As a memorial , the sacrament gives them the grace and duty of commemorating the great works of God and of bearing_witness to them before their_children . As actuation , it gives them the grace and duty of putting into_practice in the present , towards each_other and their_children , the demands of a love_which forgives and redeems . As prophecy , it gives them the grace and duty of living and bearing_witness to the hope of the future encounter_with Christ . '' Like each of the seven sacraments , so also marriage -isaia- a real symbol of the event of salvation , but in its_own way . '' The spouses participate in it as spouses , together , as a couple , so that the first and immediate effect of marriage res et sacramentum -isaia- not supernatural grace itself , but the Christian conjugal bond , a typically Christian communion of two persons because it represents the mystery of Christ s incarnation and the mystery of His covenant . The content of participation in Christ s life -isaia-_also specific : conjugal love involves a totality , in which all the elements of the person enter appeal of the body and instinct , power of feeling and affectivity , aspiration of the spirit and of will . It aims -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeply personal unity , the unity that , beyond union in one flesh , leads to forming one heart and soul ; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness in definitive mutual giving ; and it -isaia- open to fertility cf Humanae vitae , . In a word it -isaia-_a_question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love , but_with a new significance which not_only purifies and strengthens them , but raises them to the extent of making them the expression of specifically Christian values . '' Children , the Precious Gift of Marriage . According to the plan of God , marriage -isaia- the foundation of the wider community of the family , since_the very institution of marriage and conjugal love are ordained to the procreation and education of children , in whom_they find_their crowning . In its most profound reality , love_-isaia- essentially a gift ; and conjugal love , while leading the spouses to the reciprocal '' knowledge '' which_makes them '' one flesh , '' does_not end with the couple , because it makes them capable of the greatest possible gift , the gift by which_they become cooperators with God for giving life to a new human_person . Thus the couple , while giving themselves to one_another , give not_just themselves but_also the reality of children , who_are a living reflection of their love , a permanent sign of conjugal unity and a living and inseparable synthesis of their being a father and a mother . When they become parents , spouses receive from God the gift of a new responsibility . Their parental love_-isaia- called to become for the children the visible sign of the very love of God , '' from whom every family in heaven and on earth -isaia- named . '' It must_not be forgotten however that , even_when procreation -isaia- not_possible , conjugal life does_not for this_reason lose its value . Physical sterility in fact can be for spouses the occasion for other important services to the life of the human_person , for example , adoption , various_forms of educational work , and assistance to other families and to poor or handicapped children . The Family , a Communion of Persons . In matrimony and in the family a complex of interpersonal relationships -isaia- set up married life , fatherhood and motherhood , filiation and fraternity through_which each human person_-isaia- introduced into the '' human_family '' and into the '' family of God , '' which_-isaia- the Church . Christian marriage and the Christian family build up the Church : for in the family the human_person -isaia-_not_only brought into being and progressively introduced by means of education into the human community , but by means of the rebirth of baptism and education in the faith the child -isaia-_also introduced into God s family , which_-isaia- the Church . The human_family , disunited by sin , -isaia- reconstituted in its unity by the redemptive power of the death and Resurrection of Christ . Christian marriage , by participating in the salvific efficacy of this event , constitutes the natural setting in which_the human person_-isaia- introduced into the great family of the Church . The commandment to grow and multiply , given to man_and_woman in the beginning , in this_way reaches its whole truth and full realization . The Church thus finds in the family , born from the sacrament , the cradle and the setting in which_she can enter_the human generations , and where these in their turn can enter_the Church . Marriage and Virginity or Celibacy . Virginity or celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of God not_only does_not contradict the dignity of marriage but presupposes it and confirms it . Marriage and virginity or celibacy are two ways of expressing and living the one mystery of the covenant of God with His people . When marriage -isaia- not esteemed , neither can consecrated virginity or celibacy exist ; when human sexuality -isaia- not regarded as a great value given by the Creator , the renunciation of it for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven loses its meaning . Rightly indeed does St . John Chrysostom say : '' Whoever denigrates marriage also diminishes the glory of virginity . Whoever praises it makes virginity more admirable and resplendent . What appears good only in comparison with evil would_not be particularly good . It -isaia- something better_than what_-isaia- admitted to be good that -isaia-_the_most excellent good . '' In virginity or celibacy , the human_being -isaia- awaiting , also in a bodily way , the eschatological marriage of Christ with the Church , giving himself or herself completely to the Church in the hope_that Christ may give Himself to the Church in the full truth of eternal_life . The celibate person thus anticipates in his or her flesh the new world of the future resurrection . By virtue of this witness , virginity or celibacy keeps alive in the Church a consciousness of the mystery of marriage and defends it from any reduction and impoverishment . Virginity or celibacy , by liberating the human_heart in a unique way , '' so as to make it burn with_greater love for God and all humanity , '' bears_witness that the Kingdom of God and His justice -isaia- that pearl of great price which_-isaia- preferred to every_other value no matter how_great , and hence must be sought as the only definitive value . It -isaia- for_this reason_that the Church , throughout her history , has_always defended the superiority of this charism to that of marriage , by reason of the wholly singular link which it has with the Kingdom of God . In spite of having renounced physical fecundity , the celibate person becomes spiritually fruitful , the father and mother of many , cooperating in the realization of the family according to God s plan . Christian couples therefore have_the right to expect from celibate persons a good example and a witness of fidelity to their_vocation until death . Just as fidelity -atti_degli_apostoli- times becomes difficult for married people and requires sacrifice , mortification and self denial , the same can happen to celibate persons , and their fidelity , even in the trials that may occur , should strengthen the fidelity of married_couples . These reflections on virginity or celibacy can enlighten and help those_who , for reasons independent of their_own will , have_been unable to marry and have then accepted their situation in a spirit of service . PART THREE THE ROLE OF THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY Family , Become What You Are . The family finds in the plan of God the Creator and Redeemer not_only its identity , what it -isaia- , but_also its mission , what it can and should do . The role that God calls the family to perform in history derives from what_the family_-isaia- ; its role represents the dynamic and existential development of what it -isaia- . Each family finds within itself a summons that cannot be ignored , and that specifies both its dignity and its responsibility : family , become what_you are . Accordingly , the family must go back to the '' beginning '' of God s creative act , if it -isaia- to attain self knowledge and self realization in accordance_with_the inner truth not_only of what it -isaia- but_also of what it does in history . And since in God s plan it has_been established as an '' intimate community of life and love , '' the family has the mission to become more_and_more what it -isaia- , that_-isaia- to say , a community of life and love , in an effort that_will find fulfillment , as will everything created and redeemed , in the Kingdom of God . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- it in such_a_way as to reach its_very roots , we must say that the essence and role of the family are in the final analysis specified by love . Hence the family has the mission to guard , reveal and communicate love , and this_-isaia- a living reflection of and a real sharing in God s love for_humanity and the love of Christ the Lord for the Church His bride . Every particular task of the family_-isaia- an expressive and concrete actuation of that fundamental mission . We must_therefore go deeper into the unique riches of the family s mission and probe its contents , which_are both manifold and unified . Thus , with love as its point of departure and making constant reference to it , the recent Synod emphasized four general tasks for the family : forming a community of persons ; serving life ; participating in the development of society ; sharing in the life_and_mission of the Church . I FORMING A COMMUNITY OF PERSONS Love as the Principle and Power of Communion . The family , which_-isaia- founded and given life by love , -isaia- a community of persons : of husband_and_wife , of parents and children , of relatives . Its first task -isaia- to live with fidelity the reality of communion in a constant effort to develop an authentic community of persons . The inner principle of that task , its permanent power and its final goal -isaia- love : without love the family_-isaia- not a community of persons and , in the same_way , without love the family cannot live , grow and perfect itself as a community of persons . What I wrote in the Encyclical Redemptor hominis applies primarily and especially within_the family as such : '' Man cannot live without love . He remains a being that_-isaia- incomprehensible for_himself , his life_-isaia- senseless , if love_-isaia- not revealed to him , if he does_not encounter love , if he does_not experience it and make it his_own , if he does_not participate intimately in it . '' The love between husband_and_wife and , in a derivatory and broader way , the love between members of the same family between parents and children , brothers_and_sisters and relatives and members of the household -isaia- given life and sustenance by an unceasing inner dynamism leading the family to ever deeper and more intense communion , which_-isaia- the foundation and soul of the community of marriage and the family . The Indivisible Unity of Conjugal Communion . The first communion_-isaia- the one which_-isaia- established and which develops between husband_and_wife : by virtue of the covenant of married life , the man_and_woman '' are no longer two but_one flesh '' and they_are_called to grow continually in their communion through day to day fidelity to their marriage promise of total mutual self_giving . This conjugal communion sinks its roots in the natural complementarity that exists between man_and_woman , and -isaia- nurtured through the personal willingness of the spouses to share their entire life project , what they_have and what_they are : for this_reason such communion_-isaia- the fruit and the sign of a profoundly human need . But in the Lord Christ God takes up this human need , confirms it , purifies it and elevates it , leading it to perfection through the sacrament of matrimony : the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- poured out in the sacramental celebration offers Christian couples the gift of a new communion of love that_-isaia- the living and real image of that unique unity_which makes of the Church the indivisible Mystical Body of the Lord Jesus . The gift of the Spirit -isaia- a commandment of life_for Christian spouses and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a stimulating impulse so that_every day they_may progress towards an ever richer union with each_other on all levels of the body , of the character , of the heart , of the intelligence and will , of the soul revealing in this_way to the Church and to the world_the new communion of love , given by the grace of Christ . Such a communion_-isaia- radically contradicted by polygamy : this , in fact , directly negates the plan of God which_was revealed from the beginning , because_it_-isaia- contrary to the equal personal_dignity of men_and_women_who in matrimony give themselves_with a love that_-isaia- total and therefore unique and exclusive . As the Second Vatican Council writes : '' Firmly established by the Lord , the unity of marriage will radiate from the equal personal_dignity of husband_and_wife , a dignity acknowledged by mutual and total love . Conjugal communion_-isaia- characterized not_only by its unity but_also by its indissolubility : '' As a mutual gift of two persons , this intimate_union , as well as the good of children , imposes total fidelity on the spouses and argues for an unbreakable oneness between_them . '' It -isaia- a fundamental duty of the Church to reaffirm strongly , as the Synod Fathers did , the doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage . To all those_who , in our_times , consider it too difficult , or indeed impossible , to be bound to one person for the whole of life , and to those caught up in a culture that rejects the indissolubility of marriage and openly mocks the commitment of spouses to fidelity , it -isaia- necessary to reconfirm the good_news of the definitive nature of that conjugal love_that has in Christ its foundation and strength . Being rooted in the personal and total self_giving of the couple , and being required by the good of the children , the indissolubility of marriage finds_its ultimate truth in the plan that God has manifested in His revelation : He wills and He communicates the indissolubility of marriage as a fruit , a sign and a requirement of the absolutely faithful love_that God has for_man and that the Lord Jesus has for the Church . Christ renews the first plan that the Creator inscribed in the hearts of man_and_woman , and in the celebration of the sacrament of matrimony offers a '' new heart '' : thus_the couples are not_only able to overcome '' hardness of heart , '' but_also and above all they are_able to share the full and definitive love of Christ , the new and eternal Covenant made_flesh . Just as the Lord Jesus -isaia- the '' faithful witness , '' the '' yes '' of the promises of God and thus_the supreme realization of the unconditional faithfulness with_which God loves His people , so Christian couples are_called to participate truly in the irrevocable indissolubility that binds Christ to the Church His bride , loved by Him to the end . The gift of the sacrament -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a vocation and commandment for the Christian spouses , that_they_may remain faithful to each_other forever , beyond every trial and difficulty , in generous obedience to the holy will of the Lord : '' What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder . '' To bear_witness to the inestimable value of the indissolubility and fidelity of marriage -isaia- one_of_the_most precious and most urgent tasks of Christian couples in our_time . So , with all my Brothers who participated in the Synod of Bishops , I praise and encourage those numerous couples who , though encountering no small difficulty , preserve and develop the value of indissolubility : thus , in a humble and courageous manner , they perform the role committed to them of being in the world a '' sign '' a small and precious sign , sometimes also subjected to temptation , but always renewed of the unfailing fidelity with_which God and Jesus Christ love each and every_human_being . But it -isaia-_also proper to recognize_the value of the witness of those spouses who , even_when abandoned by their partner , with the strength of faith and of Christian hope have_not entered a new union : these spouses too give an authentic witness to fidelity , of which_the world today has a great need . For this_reason they_must be encouraged and helped by the pastors and the faithful of the Church . The Broader Communion of the Family . Conjugal communion constitutes the foundation on which_-isaia- built the broader communion of the family , of parents and children , of brothers_and_sisters with each_other , of relatives and other members of the household . This communion_-isaia- rooted in the natural bonds of flesh and blood , and grows to its specifically human perfection with the establishment and maturing of the still deeper and richer bonds of the spirit : the love_that animates the interpersonal relationships of the different members of the family constitutes the interior strength that shapes and animates the family communion and community . The Christian family_-isaia- also called to experience a new and original communion_which confirms and perfects natural and human communion . In fact the grace of Jesus Christ , '' the first born among many brethren '' -isaia- by its_nature and interior dynamism '' a grace of brotherhood , '' as St . Thomas Aquinas calls it . The Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- poured forth in the celebration of the sacraments , -isaia- the living source and inexhaustible sustenance of the supernatural communion that gathers believers and links them_with Christ and with each_other in the unity of the Church of God . The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and realization of ecclesial_communion , and for this_reason too it can and should be called '' the domestic Church . '' All members of the family , each according_to_his or her_own gift , have_the grace and responsibility of building , day_by_day , the communion of persons , making the family '' a school of deeper humanity '' : this happens where there_-isaia- care and love for the little ones , the sick , the aged ; where there_-isaia- mutual service every_day ; when there_-isaia- a sharing of goods , of joys and of sorrows . A fundamental opportunity_for building such a communion_-isaia- constituted by the educational exchange between parents and children , in which_each gives and receives . By means of love , respect and obedience towards their_parents , children offer their_specific and irreplaceable contribution to the construction of an authentically human and Christian family . They will be aided in this if parents exercise their unrenounceable authority as a true and proper '' ministry , '' that_-isaia- , as a service to the human and Christian well_being of their_children , and in particular as a service aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping them acquire a truly responsible freedom , and if parents maintain a living awareness of the '' gift '' they continually receive from their_children . Family communion can_only be preserved and perfected through a great spirit of sacrifice . It requires , in fact , a ready and generous openness of each and all to understanding , to forbearance , to pardon , to reconciliation . There -isaia- no family that does_not know_how selfishness , discord , tension and conflict violently attack and -atti_degli_apostoli- times mortally wound its_own communion : hence there arise the many and varied forms of division in family_life . But , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , every family_-isaia- called by the God of peace to have_the joyous and renewing experience of '' reconciliation , '' that_-isaia- , communion reestablished , unity restored . In particular , participation in the sacrament of Reconciliation and in the banquet of the one Body of Christ offers to the Christian family the grace and the responsibility of overcoming every division and of moving towards_the fullness of communion willed by God , responding in this_way to the ardent desire of the Lord : '' that_they_may be one . '' The Rights and Role of Women . In that_it_-isaia- , and ought always to become , a communion and community of persons , the family finds in love the source and the constant impetus for welcoming , respecting and promoting each_one of its_members in his or her lofty dignity as a person , that_-isaia- , as a living image of God . As the Synod Fathers rightly stated , the moral criterion for the authenticity of conjugal and family relationships consists in fostering the dignity and vocation of the individual persons , who achieve their fullness by sincere self_giving . In this perspective the Synod devoted special_attention to women , to their_rights and role within_the family and society . In the same perspective are_also to be considered men as husbands and fathers , and likewise children and the elderly . Above all it -isaia- important to underline the equal dignity and responsibility of women with men . This equality -isaia- realized in a unique manner in that reciprocal self_giving by each_one to the other and by both to the children which_-isaia- proper to marriage and the family . What human_reason intuitively perceives and acknowledges -isaia- fully revealed by the word of God : the history_of_salvation , in fact , -isaia- a continuous and luminous testimony of the dignity of women . In creating the human_race '' male and female , '' God gives man_and_woman an equal personal_dignity , endowing them_with_the inalienable rights and responsibilities proper to the human_person . God then manifests the dignity of women in the highest form possible , by assuming human flesh from the Virgin Mary , whom_the Church honors as the Mother of God , calling her the new Eve and presenting her as the model of redeemed woman . The sensitive respect of Jesus towards_the women that He called to His following and His friendship , His appearing on Easter morning to a woman before the other disciples , the mission entrusted to women to carry the good_news of the Resurrection to the apostles these_are all signs that confirm the special esteem of the Lord Jesus for women . The Apostle Paul will say : '' In Christ Jesus you_are all children of God through_faith . There -isaia- neither Jew nor Greek , there_-isaia- neither slave nor free , there_-isaia- neither male nor female ; for you_are all one in Christ Jesus . '' Women and Society . Without intending to deal_with all the various aspects of the vast and complex theme of the relationships between women and society , and limiting these remarks to a few essential points , one cannot_but observe that in the specific area of family_life a widespread social_and_cultural tradition has considered women s role to be exclusively that of wife and mother , without adequate access to public functions which_have generally been reserved for men . There -isaia- no doubt_that the equal dignity and responsibility of men_and_women fully justifies women s access to public functions . On the other_hand the true advancement of women requires that clear recognition be given to the value of their maternal and family role , by comparison with all other public roles and all other professions . Furthermore , these roles and professions should be harmoniously combined , if we wish the evolution of society and culture to be truly and fully human . This will come about more_easily if , in accordance_with_the wishes expressed by the Synod , a renewed '' theology of work '' can shed light upon and study in depth the meaning of work in the Christian life and determine the fundamental bond_between work and the family , and therefore the original and irreplaceable meaning of work in the home and in rearing children . Therefore the Church can and should help modern society by tirelessly insisting that the work of women in the home be recognized and respected by all in its irreplaceable value . This -isaia- of particular importance in education : for possible discrimination between_the different types of work and professions -isaia- eliminated -atti_degli_apostoli- its_very root once it -isaia- clear_that all people , in every area , are working with equal rights and equal responsibilities . The image of God in man and in woman will thus be seen with added luster . While it must be recognized that women have_the same right as men to perform various public functions , society must be structured in such_a_way_that wives and mothers are_not in practice compelled to work outside the home , and that their_families can live and prosper in a dignified way even_when they_themselves devote their full time to their_own family . Furthermore , the mentality which honors women more for their_work outside the home than for their_work within_the family must be overcome . This requires that_men should truly esteem and love women with total respect_for their personal_dignity , and that society should create and develop conditions favoring work in the home . With due respect to the different vocations of men_and_women , the Church must in her own_life promote as far_as_possible their equality of rights and dignity : and this for the good of all , the family , the Church and society . But clearly all of this does_not_mean for women a renunciation of their femininity or an imitation of the male role , but the fullness of true feminine humanity which_should be expressed in their activity , whether in the family or outside of it , without disregarding the differences of customs and cultures in this sphere . Offenses Against Women s Dignity . Unfortunately the Christian message about the dignity of women -isaia- contradicted by that persistent mentality which considers the human_being not as a person but as a thing , as an object of trade , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of selfish interest and mere pleasure : the first victims of this mentality are women . This mentality produces very bitter fruits , such as contempt for men and for women , slavery , oppression of the weak , pornography , prostitution especially in an organized form and all those various_forms of discrimination that exist in the fields of education , employment , wages , etc . Besides , many forms of degrading discrimination still persist today in a great part of our society that affect and seriously harm particular categories of women , as for example childless wives , widows , separated or divorced women , and unmarried mothers . The Synod Fathers deplored these and other_forms of discrimination as strongly as possible . I therefore ask that vigorous and incisive pastoral action be taken by all to overcome them definitively so that the image of God that shines in all human_beings without exception may be fully respected . Men as Husbands and Fathers . Within the conjugal and family communion community , the man_-isaia- called_upon to live his gift and role as husband and father . In his wife he sees the fulfillment of God s intention : '' It -isaia- not good that the man should be alone , I will_make him a helper fit for him , '' and he makes his_own the cry of Adam , the first husband : '' This -atti_degli_apostoli- last -isaia- bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh . '' Authentic conjugal love presupposes and requires that a man have a profound respect_for the equal dignity of his wife : '' You are_not her master , '' writes St . Ambrose , '' but her husband ; she_was not given to you to be your slave , but your wife . Reciprocate her attentiveness to you and be grateful to her for_her love . '' With his wife a man should live '' a very_special form of personal friendship . '' As for the Christian , he -isaia- called_upon to develop a new attitude of love , manifesting towards his wife a charity that_-isaia- both gentle and strong like that_which Christ has for the Church . '' Love for his wife as mother of their_children and love for the children themselves are for the man the natural way of understanding and fulfilling his_own fatherhood . Above all where social_and_cultural conditions so easily encourage a father to be less concerned_with his family or -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate less involved in the work of education , efforts must be made to restore socially the conviction_that the place and task of the father in and for the family_-isaia- of unique and irreplaceable importance . As experience teaches , the absence of a father causes psychological and moral imbalance and notable difficulties in family relationships , as does , in contrary circumstances , the oppressive presence of a father , especially where_there still prevails the phenomenon of '' machismo , '' or a wrong superiority of male prerogatives which humiliates women and inhibits the development of healthy family relationships . In revealing and in reliving on earth the very fatherhood of God , a man_-isaia- called_upon to ensure the harmonious and united development of all the members of the family : he will perform this_task by exercising generous responsibility_for the life conceived under the heart of the mother , by a more solicitous commitment to education , a task he shares with_his wife , by work which_-isaia- never a cause of division in the family but promotes its unity and stability , and by means of the witness he gives of an adult Christian life_which effectively introduces the children into the living experience of Christ and the Church . The Rights of Children . In the family , which_-isaia- a community of persons , special_attention must be devoted to the children by developing a profound esteem_for their personal_dignity , and a great respect and generous concern_for their_rights . This -isaia- true for_every child , but it becomes all the more urgent the smaller the child -isaia- and the more it -isaia- in need of everything , when_it_-isaia- sick , suffering or handicapped . By fostering and exercising a tender and strong concern_for every child that comes into this_world , the Church fulfills a fundamental mission : for she_-isaia- called_upon to reveal and put forward anew in history the example and the commandment of Christ the Lord , who placed the child -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Kingdom of God : '' Let the children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for to such belongs the kingdom_of_heaven . '' I repeat once_again what I said to the General Assembly of the United Nations on October , : '' I wish to express the joy that we all find in children , the springtime of life , the anticipation of the future history of each of our present earthly homelands . No country on earth , no political system can think of its_own future otherwise than through the image of these new generations that_will receive from their_parents the manifold heritage of values , duties and aspirations of the nation to which_they belong and of the whole human_family . Concern for the child , even before birth , from the first moment of conception and then throughout_the years of infancy and youth , -isaia- the primary and fundamental test of the relationship of one human_being to another . And so , what better wish can I express for_every nation and for the whole of mankind , and for all the children of the world than a better future in which respect_for human_rights will_become a complete reality throughout_the third_millennium , which_-isaia- drawing near ? '' Acceptance , love , esteem , many sided and united material , emotional , educational and spiritual concern_for every child that comes into this_world should_always constitute a distinctive , essential characteristic of all Christians , in particular of the Christian family : thus children , while they are_able to grow '' in wisdom and in stature , and in favor with God and man , '' offer their_own precious contribution to building up the family community and even to the sanctification of their_parents . The Elderly in the Family . There are cultures which manifest a unique veneration and great love for the elderly : far_from_being outcasts from the family or merely tolerated as a useless burden , they continue to be present and to take an active and responsible part in family_life , though having to respect the autonomy of the new family ; above all they carry_out the important mission of being a witness to the past and a source of wisdom for the young and for the future . Other cultures , however , especially in the wake of disordered industrial and urban development , have both in the past and in the present set the elderly aside in unacceptable ways . This causes acute suffering to them and spiritually impoverishes many families . The pastoral_activity of the Church must help everyone to discover and to make good use of the role of the elderly within_the civil and ecclesial_community , in particular within_the family . In fact , '' the life of the aging helps to clarify a scale of human values ; it shows the continuity of generations and marvelously demonstrates the interdependence of God s people . The elderly often have_the charism to bridge generation gaps before they_are made : how_many children have found understanding and love in the eyes and words and caresses of the aging ! And how_many old people_have willingly subscribed to the inspired word that the crown of the aged -isaia- their_children s children Prv . The Transmission of Life Cooperators in the Love of God the Creator . With the creation of man_and_woman in His own image_and_likeness , God crowns and brings to perfection the work of His hands : He calls them to a special sharing in His love and in His power as Creator and Father , through_their free and responsible cooperation in transmitting the gift of human_life : '' God blessed them , and God said to them , Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth and subdue it . '' Thus the fundamental task of the family_-isaia- to serve life , to actualize in history the original blessing of the Creator that of transmitting by procreation the divine image from person to person . Fecundity -isaia- the fruit and the sign of conjugal love , the living testimony of the full reciprocal selfgiving of the spouses : '' While not making the other purposes of matrimony of less account , the true practice of conjugal love , and the whole meaning of the family_life which results from it , have this aim : that the couple be ready with stout hearts to cooperate with the love of the Creator and the Savior , who through them will enlarge and enrich His own family day_by_day . '' However , the fruitfulness of conjugal love_-isaia- not restricted solely to the procreation of children , even understood in its specifically human dimension : it -isaia- enlarged and enriched by all those fruits of moral , spiritual and supernatural life_which the father and mother are_called to hand on to their_children , and through the children to the Church and to the world . The Church s Teaching and Norm , Always Old Yet Always New . Precisely because the love of husband_and_wife -isaia- a unique participation in the mystery of life and of the love of God Himself , the Church knows that_she has_received the special mission of guarding and protecting the lofty dignity of marriage and the most serious responsibility of the transmission of human_life . Thus , in continuity with the living tradition of the ecclesial_community throughout history , the recent Second Vatican Council and the magisterium of my predecessor Paul VI , expressed above all in the Encyclical Humanae vitae , have handed on to our_times a truly prophetic proclamation , which reaffirms and reproposes with clarity the Church s teaching and norm , always old yet always new , regarding marriage and regarding the transmission of human_life . For this_reason_the Synod Fathers made the following declaration -atti_degli_apostoli- their last assembly : '' This Sacred Synod , gathered together_with_the Successor of Peter in the unity of faith , firmly holds what_has_been set_forth in the Second Vatican Council cf . Gaudium et spes , and afterwards in the Encyclical Humanae vitae , particularly that_love between husband_and_wife must be fully human , exclusive and open to new_life Humanae vitae , ; cf . '' The Church Stands for Life . The teaching of the Church in our_day -isaia- placed in a social_and_cultural context which renders it more difficult to understand and yet more urgent and irreplaceable for promoting the true good of men_and_women . Scientific and technical progress , which contemporary man_-isaia- continually expanding in his dominion over nature , not_only offers the hope of creating a new and better humanity , but_also causes ever_greater anxiety regarding the future . Some ask themselves if it -isaia- a good thing to be alive or if it would be better never to have_been born ; they doubt therefore if it -isaia- right to bring others into life when perhaps they_will curse their existence in a cruel world with unforeseeable terrors . Others consider themselves to be the only ones for_whom the advantages of technology are intended and they exclude others by imposing on them contraceptives or even worse means . Still others , imprisoned in a consumer mentality and whose sole concern -isaia- to bring_about a continual growth of material goods , finish by ceasing to understand , and thus by refusing , the spiritual riches of a new human_life . The ultimate reason_for these mentalities -isaia- the absence in people s hearts of God , whose love alone_-isaia- stronger than all the world s fears and can conquer them . Thus an anti life mentality -isaia- born , as can be seen in many current issues : one thinks , for example , of a certain panic deriving from the studies of ecologists and futurologists on population growth , which sometimes exaggerate the danger of demographic increase to the quality of life . But the Church firmly believes that human_life , even if weak and suffering , -isaia- always a splendid gift of God s goodness . Against the pessimism and selfishness which cast a shadow over the world , the Church stands for life : in each human_life she sees the splendor of that '' Yes , '' that '' Amen , '' who_-isaia- Christ Himself . To the '' No '' which assails and afflicts the world , she replies with this living '' Yes , '' thus defending the human_person and the world from all who plot against and harm life . The Church -isaia- called_upon to manifest anew to everyone , with clear and stronger conviction , her will to promote human_life by every_means and to defend it against all attacks , in whatever condition or state of development it -isaia- found . Thus the Church condemns as a grave offense against human_dignity and justice all those activities of governments or other public_authorities which attempt to limit in any_way the freedom of couples in deciding about children . Consequently , any violence applied by such authorities in favor of contraception or , still worse , of sterilization and procured abortion , must be altogether condemned and forcefully rejected . Likewise to be denounced as gravely unjust are cases where , in international relations , economic help given for the advancement of peoples -isaia- made conditional on programs of contraception , sterilization and procured abortion . That God s Design May Be Ever More Completely Fulfilled . The Church -isaia- certainly aware of the many complex problems which couples in many countries face today in their task of transmitting life in a responsible way . She also recognizes the serious problem of population growth in the form it has_taken in many parts_of_the_world and its moral implications . However , she holds that consideration in depth of all the aspects of these problems offers a new and stronger confirmation of the importance of the authentic teaching on birth regulation reproposed in the Second Vatican Council and in the Encyclical Humanae vitae . For this_reason , together_with_the Synod Fathers I feel it -isaia- my duty to extend a pressing invitation to theologians , asking them to unite their_efforts in order to collaborate with the hierarchical Magisterium and to commit themselves to the task of illustrating ever more_clearly the biblical foundations , the ethical grounds and the personalistic reasons behind this_doctrine . Thus it will be possible , in the context of an organic exposition , to render the teaching of the Church on this fundamental question truly accessible to all people_of_good_will , fostering a daily more enlightened and profound understanding of it : in this_way God s plan will be ever_more completely fulfilled for the salvation of humanity and for the glory of the Creator . A united effort by theologians in this_regard , inspired by a convinced adherence to the Magisterium , which -isaia-_the_one authentic guide for the People of God , -isaia- particularly urgent for reasons that include the close link between Catholic teaching on this_matter and the view of the human_person that the Church proposes : doubt or error in the field of marriage or the family involves obscuring to a serious extent the integral truth_about the human_person , in a cultural situation that -isaia-_already so often confused and contradictory . In fulfillment of their_specific role , theologians are called_upon to provide enlightenment and a deeper_understanding , and their contribution -isaia- of incomparable value and represents a unique and highly meritorious service to the family and humanity . In an Integral Vision of the Human Person and of His or Her Vocation . In the context of a culture which seriously distorts or entirely misinterprets the true meaning of human sexuality , because it separates it from its essential reference to the person , the Church more urgently feels how irreplaceable -isaia- her_mission of presenting sexuality as a value and task of the whole person , created male and female in the image of God . In this perspective the Second Vatican Council clearly affirmed that '' when there -isaia-_a_question of harmonizing conjugal love with the responsible transmission of life , the moral aspect of any procedure does_not depend solely on sincere intentions or on an evaluation of motives . It must be determined by objective standards . These , based on the nature of the human_person and his or her acts , preserve the full sense of mutual self_giving and human procreation in the context of true love . Such a goal cannot be achieved unless the virtue of conjugal chastity -isaia- sincerely practiced . '' It -isaia- precisely by moving from '' an integral vision of man and of his vocation , not_only his natural and earthly , but_also his supernatural and eternal vocation , '' that Paul VI affirmed that the teaching of the Church '' -isaia- founded upon the inseparable connection , willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his_own initiative , between_the two meanings of the conjugal act : the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning . '' And he concluded by re emphasizing that_there must be excluded as intrinsically immoral '' every action which , either in anticipation of the conjugal act , or in its accomplishment , or in the development of its natural consequences , proposes , whether as an end or as a means , to render procreation impossible . '' When couples , by means of recourse to contraception , separate these_two meanings that God the Creator has inscribed in the being of man_and_woman and in the dynamism of their sexual communion , they act as '' arbiters '' of the divine plan and they '' manipulate '' and degrade human sexuality and with it themselves and their married partner by altering its value of '' total '' self_giving . Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self_giving of husband_and_wife -isaia- overlaid , through contraception , by an objectively contradictory language , namely_,_that of not giving oneself totally to the other . This leads not_only to a positive refusal to be open to life but_also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love , which_-isaia- called_upon to give itself in personal totality . When , instead , by means of recourse to periods of infertility , the couple respect the inseparable connection_between the unitive and procreative meanings of human sexuality , they_are acting as '' ministers '' of God s plan and they '' benefit from '' their sexuality according to the original dynamism of '' total '' selfgiving , without manipulation or alteration . In the light of the experience of many couples and of the data provided by the different human sciences , theological reflection -isaia- able to perceive and -isaia- called to study further the difference , both anthropological and moral , between contraception and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle : it -isaia- a difference which_-isaia- much wider and deeper than -isaia- usually thought , one_which involves in the final analysis two irreconcilable concepts of the human_person and of human sexuality . The choice of the natural rhythms involves accepting the cycle of the person , that_-isaia- the woman , and thereby accepting dialogue , reciprocal respect , shared responsibility and self control . To accept the cycle and to enter_into dialogue means to recognize both the spiritual and corporal character of conjugal communion and to live personal love with its requirement of fidelity . In this_context the couple comes to experience how conjugal communion_-isaia- enriched with_those values of tenderness and affection which constitute the inner soul of human sexuality , in its physical dimension also . In this_way sexuality -isaia- respected and promoted in its truly and fully human dimension , and -isaia- never '' used '' as an '' object '' that , by breaking the personal unity of soul and body , strikes -atti_degli_apostoli- God s creation itself -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the deepest interaction of nature and person . The Church as Teacher and Mother for Couples in Difficulty . In the field of conjugal morality the Church -isaia- Teacher and Mother and acts as such . As Teacher , she never tires of proclaiming the moral norm that_must guide the responsible transmission of life . The Church -isaia- in no way the author or the arbiter of this norm . In obedience to the truth which_-isaia- Christ , whose image -isaia- reflected in the nature and dignity_of_the_human_person , the Church interprets the moral norm and proposes it to all people_of_good_will , without concealing its demands of radicalness and perfection . As Mother , the Church -isaia- close to the many married_couples who find_themselves in difficulty over this important point of the moral_life : she knows well their situation , which -isaia-_often very arduous and -atti_degli_apostoli- times truly tormented by difficulties of every_kind , not_only individual difficulties but social ones as well ; she knows that_many couples encounter difficulties not_only in the concrete fulfillment of the moral norm but_even in understanding its inherent values . But it -isaia- one_and_the_same Church that_-isaia- both Teacher and Mother . And so the Church never ceases to exhort and encourage all to resolve whatever conjugal difficulties may arise without ever falsifying or compromising the truth : she_-isaia- convinced_that there_can be no true contradiction between_the divine_law on transmitting life and that on fostering authentic married love . Accordingly , the concrete pedagogy of the Church must_always remain linked_with her doctrine and never be separated_from it . With the same conviction as my predecessor , I therefore repeat : '' To diminish in no way the saving teaching of Christ constitutes an eminent form of charity for souls . '' On the other_hand , authentic ecclesial pedagogy displays its realism and wisdom only by making a tenacious and courageous effort to create and uphold all the human conditions psychological , moral and spiritual indispensable for understanding and living the moral value and norm . There -isaia- no doubt_that these conditions must include persistence and patience , humility and strength of mind , filial trust in God and in His grace , and frequent recourse to prayer and to the sacraments of the Eucharist and of Reconciliation . Thus strengthened , Christian husbands and wives will_be_able to keep alive their awareness of the unique influence that the grace of the sacrament of marriage has on every aspect of married life , including therefore their sexuality : the gift of the Spirit , accepted and responded to by husband_and_wife , helps them to live their human sexuality in accordance_with God s plan and as a sign of the unitive and fruitful love of Christ for His Church . But the necessary conditions alone in the knowledge of the bodily aspect and the body s rhythms of fertility . Accordingly , every_effort must be made to render such knowledge accessible to all married people and also to young adults before marriage , through clear , timely and serious instruction and education given by married_couples , doctors and experts . Knowledge must then lead to education in selfcontrol : hence_the absolute necessity for the virtue of chastity and for permanent education in it . In the Christian view , chastily by no means signifies rejection of human sexuality or lack of esteem_for it : rather it signifies spiritual energy capable of defending love from the perils of selfishness and aggressiveness , and able to advance it towards its_full realization . With deeply wise and loving intuition , Paul VI was only voicing the experience of many married_couples when he wrote in his Encyclical : '' To dominate instinct by means of one s reason and free will undoubtedly requires ascetical practices , so that the affective manifestations of conjugal life may observe the correct order , in particular with_regard to the observance of periodic continence . Yet this discipline which_-isaia- proper to the purity of married_couples , far from harming conjugal love , rather confers on it a higher human value . It demands continual effort , yet , thanks to its beneficent influence , husband_and_wife fully develop their personalities , being enriched with spiritual values . Such discipline bestows upon family_life fruits of serenity and peace , and facilitates the solution of other problems ; it favors attention for one s partner , helps both parties to drive out selfishness , the enemy of true love , and deepens their sense_of_responsibility . By its means , parents acquire the capacity of having a deeper and more efficacious influence in the education of their offspring . The Moral Progress of Married People . It -isaia- always very_important to have a right notion of the moral_order , its values and its norms ; and the importance -isaia- all the greater when_the difficulties in the way of respecting them become more numerous and serious . Since the moral_order reveals and sets forth the plan of God the Creator , for this_very reason it cannot be something_that harms man , something impersonal . On the contrary , by responding to the deepest demands of the human_being created by God , it places itself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of that person s full humanity with the delicate and binding love whereby God Himself inspires , sustains and guides every_creature towards its happiness . But man_,_who has been_called to live God s wise and loving design in a responsible manner , -isaia- an historical being who day_by_day builds himself up through_his many free decisions ; and so he knows , loves and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth . Married people too are called_upon to progress unceasingly in their moral_life , with the support of a sincere and active desire to gain ever better knowledge of the values enshrined in and fostered by the law of God . They must_also be supported by an upright and generous willingness to embody these values in their concrete decisions . They cannot however look on the law as merely an ideal to be achieved in the future : they_must consider it as a command of Christ the Lord to overcome difficulties with constancy . '' And so what_-isaia- known as the law of gradualness or step by step advance cannot be identified with gradualness of the law , as if there_were different degrees or forms of precept in God s law for different individuals and situations . In God s plan , all husbands and wives are_called in marriage to holiness , and this lofty vocation -isaia- fulfilled to the extent_that the human person_-isaia- able to respond to God s command with serene confidence in God s grace and in his or her_own will . '' On the same lines , it -isaia-_part of the Church s pedagogy that husbands and wives should first of all recognize clearly_the teaching of Humanae vitae as indicating the norm for the exercise of their sexuality , and that_they_should endeavor to establish the conditions necessary_for observing that norm . As the Synod noted , this pedagogy embraces the whole of married life . Accordingly , the function of transmitting life must be integrated into the overall mission of Christian life as a whole , which without_the Cross cannot reach the Resurrection . In such a context it -isaia- understandable that sacrifice cannot be removed from family_life , but must in fact be wholeheartedly accepted if the love between husband_and_wife -isaia- to be deepened and become a source of intimate joy . This shared progress demands reflection , instruction and suitable education on the part of the priests , religious and lay_people engaged in family pastoral_work : they_will all be able to assist married people in their human and spiritual progress , a progress that demands awareness of sin , a sincere commitment to observe the moral_law , and the ministry of reconciliation . It must_also be kept in mind_that conjugal intimacy involves the wills of two persons , who_are however called to harmonize their mentality and behavior : this requires much patience , understanding and time . Uniquely important in this_field -isaia- unity of moral and pastoral judgment by priests , a unity that_must be carefully sought and ensured , in order that_the_faithful may not_have to suffer anxiety of conscience . It will be easier for married people to make progress if , with_respect for the Church s teaching and with trust in the grace of Christ , and with the help and support of the pastors of souls and the entire ecclesial_community , they are_able to discover and experience the liberating and inspiring value of the authentic love that_-isaia- offered by the Gospel and set before us by the Lord s commandment . Instilling Conviction and Offering Practical Help . With regard to the question of lawful birth regulation , the ecclesial_community -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time must_take on the task of instilling conviction and offering practical help to those_who wish to live out_their parenthood in a truly responsible way . In this_matter , while the Church notes with satisfaction the results achieved by scientific_research aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- a more precise knowledge of the rhythms of women s fertility , and while it encourages a more decisive and wide ranging extension of that research , it cannot_fail to call with renewed vigor on the responsibility of all doctors , experts , marriage counselors , teachers and married_couples who_can actually help married people to live their love with_respect for the structure and finalities of the conjugal act which expresses that_love . This implies a broader , more decisive and more systematic effort to make_the natural methods of regulating fertility known , respected and applied . A very valuable witness can and should be given by those husbands and wives who through the joint exercise of periodic continence have reached a more mature personal responsibility with_regard to love and life . As Paul VI wrote : '' To them the Lord entrusts the task of making visible to people the holiness and sweetness of the law which unites the mutual love of husband_and_wife with_their cooperation_with the love of God , the author of human_life . Education The Right and Duty of Parents Regarding Education . The task of giving education -isaia- rooted in the primary vocation of married_couples to participate in God s creative activity : by begetting in love and for love a new person_who has within himself or herself the vocation to growth and development , parents by that_very fact take on the task of helping that person effectively to live a fully human_life . As the Second Vatican Council recalled , '' since parents have conferred life on their_children , they_have a most solemn obligation to educate their offspring . Hence , parents must be acknowledged as the first_and_foremost educators of their_children . Their role as educators -isaia- so decisive that scarcely anything can compensate for their failure in it . For it devolves on parents to create a family atmosphere so animated with love and reverence for God and others that a well rounded personal and social development will be fostered among the children . Hence , the family -isaia-_the_first school of those social virtues which_every society needs . The right and duty of parents to give education -isaia- essential , since_it_-isaia- connected_with_the transmission of human_life ; it -isaia- original and primary with_regard to the educational role of others , on account of the uniqueness of the loving relationship_between parents and children ; and it -isaia- irreplaceable and inalienable , and therefore incapable of being entirely delegated to others or usurped by others . In addition to these characteristics , it cannot be forgotten that the most basic element , so basic that it qualifies the educational role of parents , -isaia- parental love_,_which finds fulfillment in the task of education as it completes and perfects its service of life : as well as being a source , the parents love -isaia-_also the animating principle and therefore the norm inspiring and guiding all concrete educational activity , enriching it with the values of kindness , constancy , goodness , service , disinterestedness and self sacrifice that_are the most_precious fruit of love . Educating in the Essential Values of Human Life . Even amid the difficulties of the work of education , difficulties which are_often greater today , parents must trustingly and courageously train their_children in the essential values of human_life . Children must grow up with a correct attitude of freedom with_regard to material goods , by adopting a simple and austere life style and being fully convinced_that '' man_-isaia- more precious for_what he -isaia- than for_what he has . '' In a society shaken and split by tensions and conflicts caused by the violent clash of various kinds of individualism and selfishness , children must be enriched not only_with a sense of true justice , which alone leads to respect_for the personal_dignity of each_individual , but_also and more powerfully by a sense of true love , understood as sincere solicitude and disinterested service with_regard to others , especially_the poorest and those in most need . The family -isaia-_the_first and fundamental school of social living : as a community of love , it finds in self_giving the law that guides it and makes it grow . The self_giving that inspires the love of husband_and_wife for each_other -isaia- the model and norm for the self_giving that_must be practiced in the relationships between brothers_and_sisters and the different generations living together in the family . And the communion and sharing that_are part of everyday life in the home -atti_degli_apostoli- times of joy and -atti_degli_apostoli- times of difficulty are the most concrete and effective pedagogy for the active , responsible and fruitful inclusion of the children in the wider horizon of society . Education in love as self_giving -isaia-_also the indispensable premise for parents called to give their_children a clear and delicate sex education . Faced with a culture that largely reduces human sexuality to the level of something common place , since it interprets and lives it in a reductive and impoverished way by linking it solely with the body and with selfish pleasure , the educational service of parents must aim firmly -atti_degli_apostoli- a training in the area of sex that_-isaia- truly and fully personal : for sexuality -isaia- an enrichment of the whole person body , emotions and soul and it manifests its inmost meaning in leading the person to the gift_of_self in love . Sex education , which_-isaia- a basic right and duty of parents , must_always be carried_out under their attentive guidance , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- home or in educational centers chosen and controlled by them . In this_regard , the Church reaffirms the law of subsidiarity , which_the school -isaia- bound to observe when it cooperates in sex education , by entering into the same_spirit that animates the parents . In this_context education for chastity -isaia- absolutely essential , for it -isaia- a virtue that develops a person s authentic maturity and makes him or her capable of respecting and fostering the '' nuptial meaning '' of the body . Indeed Christian parents , discerning the signs of God s call , will devote special_attention and care to education in virginity or celibacy as the supreme form of that self_giving that constitutes the very meaning of human sexuality . In view of the close links between_the sexual dimension of the person and his or her ethical values , education must bring_the children to a knowledge of and respect_for the moral norms as the necessary and highly valuable guarantee for responsible personal growth in human sexuality . For this_reason_the Church -isaia- firmly opposed to an often widespread form of imparting sex information dissociated from moral principles . That would merely be an introduction to the experience of pleasure and a stimulus leading to the loss of serenity while still in the years of innocence by opening the way to vice . The Mission To Educate and the Sacrament of Marriage . For Christian parents the mission to educate , a mission rooted , as we have_said , in their participation in God s creating activity , has a new specific source in the sacrament of marriage , which consecrates them_for the strictly Christian education of their_children : that_-isaia- to say , it calls upon them to share in the very authority and love of God the Father and Christ the Shepherd , and in the motherly love of the Church , and it enriches them_with wisdom , counsel , fortitude and all the other gifts of the Holy Spirit in order to help the children in their growth as human_beings and as Christians . The sacrament of marriage gives to the educational role the dignity and vocation of being really and truly a '' ministry '' of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the building up of her members . So great and splendid -isaia- the educational ministry of Christian parents that Saint Thomas has no hesitation in comparing it with the ministry of priests : '' Some only propagate and guard spiritual_life by a spiritual ministry : this_-isaia- the role of the sacrament of Orders ; others do this for both corporal and spiritual_life , and this_-isaia- brought_about by the sacrament of marriage , by which a man and a woman join in order to beget offspring and bring them up to worship God . '' A vivid and attentive awareness of the mission that_they_have received with the sacrament of marriage will_help Christian parents to place themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of their_children s education with_great serenity and trustfulness , and also_with a sense_of_responsibility before God , who calls them and gives them the mission of building up the Church in their_children . Thus in the case of baptized people , the family , called together by word and sacrament as the Church of the home , -isaia- both teacher and mother , the same as the worldwide Church . First Experience of the Church . The mission to educate demands_that Christian parents should present to their_children all the topics that_are necessary_for the gradual maturing of their personality from a Christian and ecclesial point_of_view . They will therefore follow_the educational lines mentioned above , taking care to show their_children the depths of significance to which_the faith and love of Jesus Christ can lead . Furthermore , their awareness_that the Lord -isaia- entrusting to them the growth of a child of God , a brother or sister of Christ , a temple of the Holy Spirit , a member of the Church , will support Christian parents in their task of strengthening the gift of divine_grace in their_children s souls . The Second Vatican Council describes the content of Christian education as follows : '' Such an education does_not merely strive to foster maturity . in the human_person . Rather , its principal aims are these : that as baptized persons are gradually introduced into a knowledge of the mystery of salvation , they_may daily grow more conscious of the gift of faith which_they_have received ; that_they_may learn to adore God the Father in spirit and in truth cf . : , especially through liturgical worship ; that_they_may be trained to conduct their_personal life in true righteousness and holiness , according_to_their new nature Eph . : , and thus grow to maturity , to the stature of the fullness of Christ cf . : , and devote_themselves to the upbuilding of the Mystical Body . Moreover , aware of their calling , they_should grow accustomed to giving witness to the hope that_-isaia- in them cf . : , and to promoting the Christian transformation of the world . '' The Synod too , taking up and developing the indications of the Council , presented the educational mission of the Christian family as a true ministry through_which the Gospel -isaia- transmitted and radiated , so that family_life itself becomes an itinerary of faith and in some_way a Christian initiation and a school of following Christ . Within a family that_-isaia- aware of this_gift , as Paul VI wrote , '' all the members evangelize and are evangelized . '' By virtue of their_ministry of educating , parents are , through the witness of their_lives , the first heralds of the Gospel for their_children . Furthermore , by praying with their_children , by reading the word of God with_them and by introducing them deeply through Christian initiation into the Body of Christ both the Eucharistic and the ecclesial Body they become fully parents , in that_they_are begetters not_only of bodily life but_also of the life that_through the Spirit s renewal flows from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ . In order_that Christian parents may worthily carry_out_their ministry of educating , the Synod Fathers expressed the hope_that a suitable catechism for families would be prepared , one that_would be clear , brief and easily assimilated by all . The Episcopal Conferences were warmly invited to contribute to producing this catechism . Relations with Other Educating Agents . The family_-isaia- the primary but_not the only and exclusive educating community . Man s community aspect itself both civil and ecclesial demands and leads to a broader and more articulated activity resulting from well ordered collaboration between_the various agents of education . All these agents are necessary , even_though each can and should play its part in accordance_with_the special competence and contribution proper to itself . The educational role of the Christian family therefore has a very_important place in organic pastoral_work . This involves a new form of cooperation between parents and Christian communities , and between_the various educational groups and pastors . In this_sense , the renewal of the Catholic school must give special_attention both to the parents of the pupils and to the formation of a perfect educating community . The right of parents to choose an education in conformity_with their religious faith must be absolutely guaranteed . The State and the Church have_the obligation to give families all possible aid to enable them to perform their educational role properly . Therefore both the Church and the State must create and foster the institutions and activities that families justly demand , and the aid must be in proportion to the families needs . However , those in society who_are in charge of schools must_never forget_that the parents have_been appointed by God Himself as the first and principal educators of their_children and that_their right -isaia- completely inalienable . But corresponding to their right , parents have a serious duty to commit themselves totally to a cordial and active relationship_with the teachers and the school authorities . If ideologies opposed to the Christian faith are taught in the schools , the family must join with_other families , if possible through family associations , and with all its strength and with wisdom help the young not to depart from the faith . In this case the family needs special assistance from pastors of souls , who must_never forget_that parents have_the inviolable right to entrust their_children to the ecclesial_community . Manifold Service to Life . Fruitful married love expresses itself in serving life in many_ways . Of these ways , begetting and educating children are the most immediate , specific and irreplaceable . In fact , every act of true love towards a human_being bears_witness to and perfects the spiritual fecundity of the family , since_it_-isaia- an act of obedience to the deep inner dynamism of love as self_giving to others . For everyone this perspective -isaia- full of value and commitment , and it can be an inspiration in particular for couples who experience physical sterility . Christian families , recognizing with_faith all human_beings as children of the same heavenly Father , will respond generously to the children of other families , giving them support and love not as outsiders but as members of the one family of God s children . Christian parents will thus be able to spread their love beyond_the bonds of flesh and blood , nourishing the links that_are rooted in the spirit and that develop through concrete service to the children of other families , who are_often without even the barest necessities . Christian families will_be_able to show greater readiness to adopt and foster children who_have lost their_parents or have_been abandoned by them . Rediscovering the warmth of affection of a family , these children will_be_able to experience God s loving and provident fatherhood witnessed to by Christian parents , and they_will thus be able to grow up with serenity and confidence in life . At the same_time the whole family will be enriched with the spiritual values of a wider fraternity . Family fecundity must_have an unceasing '' creativity , '' a marvelous fruit of the Spirit of God , who opens the eyes of the heart to discover the new needs and sufferings of our society and gives courage for accepting them and responding to them . A vast field of activity . lies open to families : today , even_more preoccupying than child abandonment -isaia- the phenomenon of social_and_cultural exclusion , which seriously affects the elderly , the sick , the disabled , drug addicts , ex prisoners , etc . This broadens enormously the horizons of the parenthood of Christian families : these and many_other urgent needs of our_time are a challenge to their spiritually fruitful love . With families and through them , the Lord Jesus continues to '' have compassion '' on the multitudes . III PARTICIPATING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY The Family as the First and Vital Cell of Society . '' Since the Creator of all things has established the conjugal partnership as the beginning and basis of human_society , '' the family_-isaia- '' the first and vital cell of society . '' The family has vital and organic links with society , since_it_-isaia- its foundation and nourishes it continually through its role of service to life : it -isaia- from the family that citizens come to birth and it -isaia- within_the family that_they find the first school of the social virtues that_are the animating principle of the existence and development of society itself . Thus , far_from_being closed in on itself , the family_-isaia- by nature and vocation open to other families and to society , and undertakes its social role . Family Life as an Experience of Communion and Sharing . The very experience of communion and sharing that should characterize the family s daily_life represents its first and fundamental contribution to society . The relationships between_the members of the family community are inspired and guided by the law of '' free giving . '' By respecting and fostering personal_dignity in each_and_every one as the only basis for value , this free giving takes the form of heartfelt acceptance , encounter and dialogue , disinterested availability , generous service and deep solidarity . Thus the fostering of authentic and mature communion_between persons within_the family -isaia-_the_first and irreplaceable school of social_life , and example and stimulus for the broader community relationships marked by respect , justice , dialogue and love . The family_-isaia- thus , as the Synod Fathers recalled , the place of origin and the most effective means_for humanizing and personalizing society : it makes an original contribution in depth to building up the world , by making possible a life that_-isaia- properly speaking human , in particular by guarding and transmitting virtues and '' values . '' As the Second Vatican Council states , in the family '' the various generations come together and help one_another to grow wiser and to harmonize personal rights with the other requirements of social living . '' Consequently , faced_with a society that_-isaia- running the risk of becoming more_and_more depersonalized and standardized and therefore inhuman and dehumanizing , with the negative results of many forms of escapism such as alcoholism , drugs and even terrorism the family possesses and continues still to release formidable energies capable of taking man out of his anonymity , keeping him conscious of his personal_dignity , enriching him_with deep humanity and actively placing him , in his uniqueness and unrepeatability , within_the fabric of society . The Social and Political Role . The social role of the family certainly cannot stop short -atti_degli_apostoli- procreation and education , even if this constitutes its primary and irreplaceable form of expression . Families therefore , either singly or in association , can and should devote_themselves to manifold social service activities , especially in favor of the poor , or -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate for the benefit of all people and situations that cannot be reached by the public_authorities welfare organization . The social contribution of the family has an original character of its_own , one_that should be given greater recognition and more decisive encouragement , especially as the children grow up , and actually involving all its_members as much as possible . In particular , note must_be_taken of the ever_greater importance in our society of hospitality in all its forms , from opening the door of one s home and still_more of one s heart to the pleas of one s brothers_and_sisters , to concrete efforts to ensure_that every family has its_own home , as the natural environment that preserves it and makes it grow . In a special_way the Christian family_-isaia- called_upon to listen to the Apostle s recommendation : '' Practice hospitality , '' and therefore , imitating Christ s example and sharing in His love , to welcome the brother or sister in need : '' Whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he -isaia- a disciple , truly , I say to you , he shall_not lose his reward . '' The social role of families -isaia- called_upon to find expression also in the form of political intervention : families should be the first to take steps to see_that the laws and institutions of the State not_only do not offend but support and positively defend the rights_and_duties of the family . Along these lines , families should grow in awareness of being '' protagonists '' of what_-isaia- known as '' family politics '' and assume responsibility_for transforming society ; otherwise families will be the first victims of the evils that_they_have done no more_than note with indifference . The Second Vatican Council s appeal to go beyond an individualistic ethic therefore also holds good for the family as such . '' Society -atti_degli_apostoli- the Service of the Family . Just as the intimate connection_between the family and society demands_that the family be open to and participate in society and its development , so also it requires that society should never fail in its fundamental task of respecting and fostering the family . The family and society have complementary functions in defending and fostering the good of each and every_human_being . But society more specifically the State must recognize_that '' the family_-isaia- a society in its_own original right '' and so society_-isaia- under a grave obligation in its relations with the family to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity . By virtue of this principle , the State cannot and must_not take away from families the functions that_they_can just as well perform on their_own or in free associations ; instead it must positively favor and encourage as far_as_possible responsible initiative by families . In the conviction_that the good of the family_-isaia- an indispensable and essential value of the civil community , the public_authorities must do everything possible to ensure_that families have all those aids economic , social , educational , political and cultural assistance that_they need in order to face all their responsibilities in a human way . The Charter of Family Rights . The ideal of mutual support and development between_the family and society_-isaia- often very seriously in conflict with the reality of their separation and even opposition . In fact , as was repeatedly denounced by the Synod , the situation experienced by many families in various countries -isaia- highly problematical , if not entirely negative : institutions and laws unjustly ignore the inviolable rights of the family and of the human_person ; and society , far from putting itself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the family , attacks it violently in its values and fundamental requirements . Thus the family , which in God s plan -isaia- the basic cell of society and a subject of rights_and_duties before the State or any_other community , finds itself the victim of society , of the delays and slowness with_which it acts , and even of its blatant injustice . For this_reason , the Church openly and strongly defends the rights of the family against the intolerable usurpations of society and the State . In particular , the Synod Fathers mentioned the following rights of the family : the right to exist and progress as a family , that_-isaia- to say , the right of every_human_being , even if he or she_-isaia- poor , to found a family and to have adequate means to support it ; the right to exercise its responsibility regarding the transmission of life and to educate children ; family_life ; the right to the intimacy of conjugal and family_life ; the right to the stability of the bond and of the institution of marriage ; the right to believe in and profess one s faith and to propagate it ; the right to bring up children in accordance_with_the family s own traditions and religious and cultural values , with the necessary instruments , means and institutions ; the right , especially of the poor and the sick , to obtain physical , social , political and economic security ; the right to housing suitable for living family_life in a proper way ; the right to expression and to representation , either directly or through associations , before the economic , social_and_cultural public_authorities and lower authorities ; the right to form associations with_other families and institutions , in order to fulfill the family s role suitably and expeditiously ; the right to protect minors by adequate institutions and legislation from harmful drugs , pornography , alcoholism , etc . ; the right to wholesome recreation of a kind that also fosters family values ; the right of the elderly to a worthy life and a worthy death ; the right to emigrate as a family in search of a better life . Acceding to the Synod s explicit request , the Holy See will_give prompt attention to studying these suggestions in depth and to the preparation of a Charter of Rights of the Family , to be presented to the quarters and authorities concerned . The Christian Family s Grace and Responsibility . The social role that belongs to every family pertains by a new and original right to the Christian family , which_-isaia- based on the sacrament of marriage . By taking up the human reality of the love between husband_and_wife in all its implications , the sacrament gives to Christian couples and parents a power and a commitment to live their_vocation as lay_people and therefore to '' seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God . '' The social and political role -isaia- included in the kingly mission of service in which Christian couples share by virtue of the sacrament of marriage , and they receive both a command which they_cannot ignore and a grace_which sustains and stimulates them . The Christian family_-isaia- thus called_upon to offer everyone a witness of generous and disinterested dedication to social matters , through a '' preferential option '' for the poor and disadvantaged . Therefore , advancing in its following of the Lord by special love for all the poor , it must_have special concern_for the hungry , the poor , the old , the sick , drug victims and those_who_have no family . For a New International Order . In view of the worldwide dimension of various social questions nowadays , the family has seen its role with_regard to the development of society extended in a completely new_way : it now also involves cooperating for a new international order , since_it_-isaia- only in worldwide solidarity that the enormous and dramatic issues of world justice , the freedom of peoples and the peace of humanity can be dealt_with and solved . The spiritual communion_between Christian families , rooted in a common faith and hope and given life by love , constitutes an inner energy that generates , spreads and develops justice , reconciliation , fraternity and peace among human_beings . Insofar as it -isaia- a '' small scale Church , '' the Christian family_-isaia- called_upon , like the '' large scale Church , '' to be a sign of unity for the world and in this_way to exercise its prophetic role by bearing_witness to the Kingdom and peace of Christ , towards which_the whole world_-isaia- journeying . Christian families can do this through_their educational activity that_-isaia- to say by presenting to their_children a model of life based on the values of truth , freedom , justice and love both through active and responsible involvement in the authentically human growth of society and its institutions , and by supporting in various_ways the associations specifically devoted to international issues . IV SHARING IN THE LIFE AND MISSION OF THE CHURCH The Family , Within the Mystery of the Church . Among the fundamental tasks of the Christian family_-isaia- its ecclesial task : the family_-isaia- placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the building up of the Kingdom of God in history by participating in the life_and_mission of the Church . In order to understand better the foundations , the contents and the characteristics of this participation , we must examine the many profound bonds linking the Church and the Christian family and establishing the family as a '' Church in miniature '' Ecclesia domestica , in such_a_way_that in its_own way the family_-isaia- a living image and historical representation of the mystery of the Church . It -isaia- , above all , the Church as Mother that gives birth to , educates and builds up the Christian family , by putting into_effect in its regard the saving mission which_she has received_from her Lord . By proclaiming the word of God , the Church reveals to the Christian family its true identity , what it -isaia- and should be according to the Lord s plan ; by celebrating the sacraments , the Church enriches and strengthens the Christian family with the grace of Christ for its sanctification to the glory of the Father ; by the continuous proclamation of the new commandment of love , the Church encourages and guides the Christian family to the service of love , so that_it_may imitate and relive the same self_giving and sacrificial love_that the Lord Jesus has for the entire human_race . In turn , the Christian family_-isaia- grafted into the mystery of the Church to such a degree as to become a sharer , in its_own way , in the saving mission proper to the Church : by virtue of the sacrament , Christian married_couples and parents '' in their state and way_of_life have_their own special gift among the People of God . '' For this_reason they not_only receive the love of Christ and become a saved community , but_they are_also called_upon to communicate Christ s love to their brethren , thus becoming a saving community . In this_way , while the Christian family_-isaia- a fruit and sign of the supernatural fecundity of the Church , it stands also as a symbol , witness and participant of the Church s motherhood . A Specific and Original Ecclesial Role . The Christian family_-isaia- called_upon to take_part actively and responsibly in the mission of the Church in a way that_-isaia- original and specific , by placing itself , in what it -isaia- and what it does as an '' intimate community of life and love , '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church and of society . Since the Christian family_-isaia- a community in which_the relationships are renewed by Christ through_faith and the sacraments , the family s sharing in the Church s mission should follow a community pattern : the spouses together as a couple , the parents and children as a family , must live their service to the Church and to the world . They must be '' of one heart and soul '' in faith , through the shared apostolic zeal that animates them , and through_their shared commitment to works of service to the ecclesial and civil communities . The Christian family also builds up the Kingdom of God in history through the everyday realities that concern and distinguish its state of life . It -isaia- thus in the love between husband_and_wife and between_the members of the family a love lived out in all its extraordinary richness of values and demands : totality , oneness , fidelity and fruitfulness that the Christian family s participation in the prophetic , priestly and kingly mission of Jesus Christ and of His Church finds expression and realization . Therefore , love and life constitute the nucleus of the saving mission of the Christian family in the Church and for the Church . The Second Vatican Council recalls this_fact when it writes : '' Families will share their_spiritual riches generously with_other families too . Thus the Christian family , which springs from marriage as a reflection of the loving covenant uniting Christ with the Church , and as a participation in that covenant will manifest to all people the Savior s living presence in the world , and the genuine nature of the Church . This the family will do by the mutual love of the spouses , by their generous fruitfulness , their solidarity and faithfulness , and by the loving way_in_which all the members of the family work together . '' Having laid the foundation of the participation of the Christian family in the Church s mission , it -isaia-_now time to illustrate its substance in reference to Jesus Christ as Prophet , Priest and King three aspects of a single reality by presenting the Christian family as a believing and evangelizing community , a community in dialogue_with God , and a community -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of man . The Christian Family as a Believing and Evangelizing Community Faith as the Discovery and Admiring Awareness of God s Plan for the Family . As a sharer in the life_and_mission of the Church , which listens to the word of God with reverence and proclaims it confidently , the Christian family fulfills its prophetic role by welcoming and announcing the word of God : it thus becomes more_and_more each_day a believing and evangelizing community . Christian spouses and parents are required to offer '' the obedience of faith . '' They are called_upon to welcome the word of the Lord which reveals to them the marvelous news the Good News of their conjugal and family_life sanctified and made a source of sanctity by Christ Himself . Only in faith can they discover and admire with joyful gratitude the dignity to which God has deigned to raise marriage and the family , making them a sign and meeting place of the loving covenant between God and man , between Jesus Christ and His bride , the Church . The very preparation_for Christian marriage -isaia- itself a journey of faith . It -isaia- a special opportunity_for the engaged to rediscover and deepen the faith received in Baptism and nourished by their Christian upbringing . In this_way they come to recognize and freely accept their_vocation to follow Christ and to serve the Kingdom of God in the married state . The celebration of the sacrament of marriage -isaia- the basic moment of the faith of the couple . This sacrament , in essence , -isaia- the proclamation in the Church of the Good News concerning married love . It -isaia- the word of God that '' reveals '' and '' fulfills '' the wise and loving plan of God for the married couple , giving them a mysterious and real share in the very love with_which God Himself loves humanity . Since the sacramental celebration of marriage -isaia- itself a proclamation of the word of God , it must_also be a '' profession_of_faith '' within and with the Church , as a community of believers , on the part of all those_who in different_ways participate in its celebration . This profession_of_faith demands_that it be prolonged in the life of the married couple and of the family . God , who called the couple to marriage , continues to call them in marriage . In and through the events , problems , difficulties and circumstances of everyday life , God comes to them , revealing and presenting the concrete '' demands '' of their sharing in the love of Christ for His Church in the particular family , social and ecclesial situation in which_they find_themselves . The discovery of and obedience to the plan of God on the part of the conjugal and family community must take_place in '' togetherness , '' through the human experience of love between husband_and_wife , between parents and children , lived in the Spirit of Christ . Thus the little domestic Church , like the greater Church , needs to be constantly and intensely evangelized : hence its duty regarding permanent education in the faith . The Christian Family s Ministry of Evangelization . To the extent in which_the Christian family accepts the Gospel and matures in faith , it becomes an evangelizing community . Let us listen again to Paul VI : '' The family , like the Church , ought to be a place_where the Gospel -isaia- transmitted and from which_the Gospel radiates . In a family which_-isaia- conscious of this_mission , all the members evangelize and are evangelized . The parents not_only communicate the Gospel to their_children , but_from their_children they_can themselves receive the same Gospel as deeply lived by them . And such a family becomes_the evangelizer of many_other families , and of the neighborhood of which it forms part . '' As the Synod repeated , taking up the appeal which I launched -atti_degli_apostoli- Puebla , the future of evangelization depends in great part on the Church of the home . This apostolic mission of the family_-isaia- rooted in Baptism and receives from the grace of the sacrament of marriage new strength to transmit the faith , to sanctify and transform our present society according to God s plan . Particularly today , the Christian family has a special vocation to witness to the paschal covenant of Christ by constantly radiating the joy of love and the certainty of the hope for_which it must give an account : '' The Christian family loudly proclaims both the present virtues of the Kingdom of God and the hope of a blessed life to come . '' The absolute need_for family catechesis emerges with particular force in certain situations that the Church unfortunately experiences in some places : '' In places_where anti religious legislation endeavors even to prevent education in the faith , and in places_where widespread unbelief or invasive secularism makes real religious growth practically impossible , the Church of the home remains the one place_where children and young_people can receive an authentic catechesis . The ministry of evangelization carried_out by Christian parents -isaia- original and irreplaceable . It assumes the characteristics typical of family_life itself , which_should be interwoven with love , simplicity , practicality and daily witness . The family must educate the children for life in such_a_way_that each_one may fully perform his or her role according to the vocation received_from God . Indeed , the family that_-isaia- open to transcendent values , that serves its brothers_and_sisters with_joy , that fulfills its duties with generous fidelity , and -isaia- aware of its daily sharing in the mystery of the glorious Cross of Christ , becomes_the primary and most excellent seed bed of vocations to a life of consecration to the Kingdom of God . The parents ministry of evangelization and catechesis ought to play a part in their_children s lives also during adolescence and youth , when_the children , as often happens , challenge or even reject the Christian faith received in earlier years . Just as in the Church the work_of_evangelization can_never be separated_from the sufferings of the apostle , so in the Christian family parents must face with courage and great interior serenity the difficulties that their_ministry of evangelization sometimes encounters in their_own children . It should_not be forgotten that the service rendered by Christian spouses and parents to the Gospel -isaia- essentially an ecclesial service . It has its place within_the context of the whole Church as an evangelized and evangelizing community . In so far as the ministry of evangelization and catechesis of the Church of the home -isaia- rooted in and derives from the one mission of the Church and -isaia- ordained to the upbuilding of the one Body of Christ , it must remain in intimate communion and collaborate responsibly with all the other evangelizing and catechetical activities present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the ecclesial_community -atti_degli_apostoli- the diocesan and parochial levels . To Preach the Gospel to the Whole Creation . Evangelization , urged on within by irrepressible missionary zeal , -isaia- characterized by a universality without boundaries . It -isaia- the response to Christ s explicit and unequivocal command : '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation . '' The Christian family s faith and evangelizing mission also possesses this catholic missionary inspiration . The sacrament of marriage takes up and reproposes the task of defending and spreading the faith , a task that_has its roots in Baptism and Confirmation , and makes Christian married_couples and parents witnesses of Christ '' to the end of the earth , '' missionaries , in the true and proper sense , of love and life . A form of missionary_activity can be exercised even within_the family . This happens when some member of the family does_not have_the faith or does_not practice it with consistency . In such a case the other members must give him or her a living witness of their_own faith in order to encourage and support him or her along the path towards full acceptance of Christ the Savior . Animated in its_own inner life by missionary zeal , the Church of the home -isaia-_also called to be a luminous sign of the presence of Christ and of His love for those_who_are '' far away , '' for families who_do_not yet believe , and for those Christian families who no longer live in accordance_with_the faith_that they once received . The Christian family_-isaia- called to enlighten '' by its example and its witness . those_who seek the truth . '' Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of Christianity Aquila and Priscilla were presented as a missionary couple , so today the Church shows forth her perennial newness and fruitfulness by the presence of Christian couples and families who dedicate -atti_degli_apostoli- least a part of their_lives to working in missionary territories , proclaiming the Gospel and doing service to their fellowman in the love of Jesus Christ . Christian families offer a special contribution to the missionary cause of the Church by fostering missionary vocations among their sons_and_daughters and , more generally , '' by training their_children from childhood to recognize God s love for all people . The Christian Family as a Community in Dialogue with God The Church s Sanctuary in the Home . The proclamation of the Gospel and its acceptance in faith reach their fullness in the celebration of the sacraments . The Church which_-isaia- a believing and evangelizing community -isaia-_also a priestly people invested with the dignity and sharing in the power of Christ the High Priest of the New and Eternal Covenant . The Christian family too -isaia-_part of this priestly people which_-isaia- the Church . By means of the sacrament of marriage , in which_it_-isaia- rooted and from which it draws its nourishment , the Christian family_-isaia- continuously vivified by the Lord Jesus and called and engaged by Him in a dialogue_with God through the sacraments , through the offering of one s life , and through prayer . This -isaia- the priestly role which_the Christian family can and ought to exercise in intimate communion with the whole Church , through the daily realities of married and family_life . In this_way the Christian family_-isaia- called to be sanctified and to sanctify the ecclesial_community and the world . Marriage as a Sacrament of Mutual Sanctification and an Act of Worship . The sacrament of marriage -isaia- the specific source and original means of sanctification for Christian married_couples and families . It takes up again and makes specific the sanctifying grace of Baptism . By virtue of the mystery of the death and Resurrection of Christ , of which_the spouses are made part in a new_way by marriage , conjugal love_-isaia- purified and made holy : '' This love the Lord has judged worthy of special gifts , healing , perfecting and exalting gifts of grace and of charity . '' The gift of Jesus Christ -isaia- not exhausted in the actual celebration of the sacrament of marriage , but_rather accompanies the married couple throughout their_lives . This fact -isaia- explicitly recalled by the Second Vatican Council when it says_that Jesus Christ '' abides with_them so that , just as He loved the Church and handed Himself over on her behalf , the spouses may love each_other with perpetual fidelity through mutual self bestowal . For this_reason , Christian spouses have a special sacrament by which_they_are fortified and receive a kind of consecration in the duties and dignity of their state . By virtue of this_sacrament , as spouses fulfill their conjugal and family obligations , they_are penetrated with the Spirit of Christ , who fills their whole lives with_faith , hope and charity . Thus they increasingly advance towards their_own perfection , as well as towards their mutual sanctification , and hence contribute jointly to the glory of God . '' Christian spouses and parents are included in the universal call to sanctity . For them this call -isaia- specified by the sacrament they_have celebrated and -isaia- carried_out concretely in the realities proper to their conjugal and family_life . This gives_rise to the grace and requirement of an authentic and profound conjugal and family spirituality that draws its inspiration from the themes of creation , covenant , cross , resurrection , and sign , which_were stressed more_than_once by the Synod . Christian marriage , like the other sacraments , '' whose purpose -isaia- to sanctify people , to build up the body of Christ , and finally , to give worship to God , '' -isaia- in itself a liturgical action glorifying God in Jesus Christ and in the Church . By celebrating it , Christian spouses profess their gratitude to God for the sublime gift bestowed on them of being able to live in their married and family lives the very love of God for people and that of the Lord Jesus for the Church , His bride . Just as husbands and wives receive from the sacrament the gift and responsibility of translating into daily living the sanctification bestowed on them , so the same sacrament confers on them the grace and moral obligation of transforming their whole lives into a '' spiritual sacrifice . '' What the Council says of the laity applies also to Christian spouses and parents , especially with_regard to the earthly and temporal realities that characterize their_lives : '' As worshippers leading holy lives in every place , the laity consecrate the world itself to God . '' Marriage and the Eucharist . The Christian family s sanctifying role -isaia- grounded in Baptism and has its highest expression in the Eucharist , to which Christian marriage -isaia- intimately connected . The Second Vatican Council drew attention to the unique relationship_between_the Eucharist and marriage by requesting that '' marriage normally be celebrated within_the Mass . '' To understand better and live more intensely the graces and responsibilities of Christian marriage and family_life , it -isaia- altogether necessary to rediscover and strengthen this relationship . The Eucharist -isaia- the very source of Christian marriage . The Eucharistic Sacrifice , in fact , represents Christ s covenant of love with the Church , sealed with His blood on the Cross . In this sacrifice of the New and Eternal Covenant , Christian spouses encounter the source from which their_own marriage covenant flows , -isaia- interiorly structured and continuously renewed . As a representation of Christ s sacrifice of love for the Church , the Eucharist -isaia- a fountain of charity . In the Eucharistic gift of charity the Christian family finds the foundation and soul of its '' communion '' and its '' mission '' : by partaking in the Eucharistic bread , the different members of the Christian family become one_body , which reveals and shares in the wider unity of the Church . Their sharing in the Body of Christ that_-isaia- '' given up '' and in His Blood that_-isaia- '' shed '' becomes a never ending source of missionary and apostolic dynamism for the Christian family . The Sacrament of Conversion and Reconciliation . An essential and permanent part of the Christian family s sanctifying role consists in accepting the call to conversion that the Gospel addresses to all Christians , who do not_always remain faithful to the '' newness '' of the Baptism that constitutes them '' saints . '' The Christian family too -isaia- sometimes unfaithful to the law of baptismal grace and holiness proclaimed anew in the sacrament of marriage . Repentance and mutual pardon within_the bosom of the Christian family , so much a part of daily_life , receive their_specific sacramental expression in Christian Penance . In the Encyclical Humanae vitae , Paul VI wrote of married_couples : '' And if sin should still keep its hold over them , let_them not be discouraged , but_rather have_recourse with humble perseverance to the mercy of God , which_-isaia- abundantly poured forth in the sacrament of Penance . '' The celebration of this_sacrament acquires special significance for family_life . While they discover in faith_that sin contradicts not_only the covenant with God , but_also the covenant between husband_and_wife and the communion of the family , the married couple and the other members of the family are led to an encounter_with God , who_-isaia- '' rich in mercy , '' who bestows on them His love which_-isaia- more powerful than sin , and who reconstructs and brings to perfection the marriage covenant and the family communion . The Church prays for the Christian family and educates the family to live in generous accord with the priestly gift and role received_from Christ the High Priest . In effect , the baptismal priesthood of the faithful , exercised in the sacrament of marriage , constitutes the basis of a priestly vocation and mission for the spouses and family by which their_daily lives are transformed into '' spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ . '' This transformation -isaia- achieved not_only by celebrating the Eucharist and the other sacraments and through offering themselves to the glory of God , but_also through a life of prayer , through prayerful dialogue_with_the Father , through Jesus Christ , in the Holy Spirit . Family prayer has its_own characteristic qualities . It -isaia- prayer offered in common , husband_and_wife together , parents and children together . Communion in prayer_-isaia- both a consequence of and a requirement for the communion bestowed by the sacraments of Baptism and Matrimony . The words with_which_the Lord Jesus promises His presence can be applied to the members of the Christian family in a special_way : '' Again I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven . For where two or three are gathered in my name , there -amos- I in the midst of them . '' Family prayer has for its_very own object family_life itself , which in all its varying circumstances -isaia- seen as a call from God and lived as a filial response to His call . Joys and sorrows , hopes and disappointments , births and birthday celebrations , wedding anniversaries of the parents , departures , separations and homecomings , important and far reaching decisions , the death of those_who_are dear , etc . all of these mark God s loving intervention in the family s history . They should be seen as suitable moments for thanksgiving , for petition , for trusting abandonment of the family into the hands of their common Father in heaven . The dignity and responsibility of the Christian family as the domestic Church can be achieved only_with God s unceasing aid , which_will surely be granted if it -isaia- humbly and trustingly petitioned in prayer . By reason of their_dignity and mission , Christian parents have_the specific responsibility of educating their_children in prayer , introducing them to gradual discovery of the mystery of God and to personal dialogue_with Him : '' It -isaia- particularly in the Christian family , enriched by the grace and the office of the sacrament of Matrimony , that_from the earliest years children should be taught , according to the faith received in Baptism , to have a knowledge of God , to worship Him and to love their neighbor . '' The concrete example and living witness of parents -isaia- fundamental and irreplaceable in educating their_children to pray . Only by praying together_with their_children can a father and mother exercising their royal priesthood penetrate the innermost depths of their_children s hearts and leave an impression that the future events in their_lives will_not be able to efface . Let us again listen to the appeal made by Paul VI to parents : '' Mothers , do you teach your children the Christian prayers ? Do you prepare them , in conjunction with the priests , for the sacraments that_they receive when_they_are young : Confession , Communion and Confirmation ? Do you encourage them when_they_are sick to think of Christ suffering to invoke the aid of the Blessed Virgin and the saints Do you say the family rosary together ? And you , fathers , do you pray with your children , with the whole domestic community , -atti_degli_apostoli- least sometimes ? Your example of honesty in thought and action , joined to some common prayer , -isaia- a lesson for life , an act of worship of singular value . In this_way you bring peace to your homes : Pax huic domui . Remember , it -isaia- thus that_you build up the Church . '' Liturgical Prayer and Private Prayer . There exists a deep and vital bond_between the prayer of the Church and the prayer of the individual faithful , as has_been clearly reaffirmed by the Second Vatican Council . An important purpose of the prayer of the domestic Church -isaia- to serve as the natural introduction for the children to the liturgical prayer of the whole Church , both in the sense of preparing for it and of extending it into personal , family and social_life . Hence the need_for gradual participation by all the members of the Christian family in the celebration of the Eucharist , especially on Sundays and feast days , and of the other sacraments , particularly the sacraments of Christian initiation of the children . The directives of the Council opened up a new possibility for the Christian family when it listed the family among_those groups to whom it recommends the recitation of the Divine Office in common . Likewise , the Christian family will strive to celebrate -atti_degli_apostoli- home , and in a way suited to the members , the times and feasts of the liturgical year . As preparation_for the worship celebrated in church , and as its prolongation in the home , the Christian family makes use of private prayer , which presents a great variety of forms . While this variety testifies to the extraordinary richness with_which_the Spirit vivifies Christian prayer , it serves also to meet_the various needs and life situations of those_who turn to the Lord in prayer . Apart from morning and evening prayers , certain forms of prayer are to be expressly encouraged , following the indications of the Synod Fathers , such as reading and meditating on the word of God , preparation_for the reception of the sacraments , devotion and consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , the various_forms of veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary , grace before and after meals , and observance of popular devotions . While respecting the freedom of the children of God , the Church has_always proposed certain practices of piety to the faithful with particular solicitude and insistence . Among these should be mentioned the recitation of the rosary : '' We now desire , as a continuation of the thought of our_predecessors , to recommend strongly the recitation of the family rosary . There -isaia- no doubt_that . the rosary should be considered as one of the best and most efficacious prayers in common that the Christian family_-isaia- invited to recite . We like to think , and sincerely hope , that_when the family gathering becomes a time of prayer the rosary -isaia- a frequent and favored manner of praying . '' In this_way authentic devotion to Mary , which finds expression in sincere love and generous imitation of the Blessed Virgin s interior spiritual attitude , constitutes a special instrument for nourishing loving communion in the family and for developing conjugal and family spirituality . For she who_-isaia- the Mother of Christ and of the Church -isaia- in a special_way the Mother of Christian families , of domestic Churches . Prayer and Life . It should never be forgotten that prayer constitutes an essential part of Christian life , understood in its fullness and centrality . Indeed , prayer_-isaia- an important part of our very humanity : it -isaia- '' the first expression of man s inner truth , the first condition_for authentic freedom of spirit . '' Far from being a form of escapism from everyday commitments , prayer constitutes the strongest incentive for the Christian family to assume and comply fully with all its responsibilities as the primary and fundamental cell of human_society . Thus the Christian family s actual participation in the Church s life_and_mission -isaia- in direct proportion to the fidelity and intensity of the prayer with which_it_-isaia- united with the fruitful vine that_-isaia- Christ the Lord . The fruitfulness of the Christian family in its specific service to human advancement , which of itself cannot_but lead to the transformation of the world , derives from its living union with Christ , nourished by Liturgy , by self oblation and by prayer . The Christian Family The New Commandment of Love . The Church , a prophetic , priestly and kingly people , -isaia- endowed_with the mission of bringing all human_beings to accept the word of God in faith , to celebrate and profess it in the sacraments and in prayer , and to give expression to it in the concrete realities of life in accordance_with_the gift and new commandment of love . The law of Christian life_-isaia- to be found not in a written code , but in the personal action of the Holy Spirit who inspires and guides the Christian . It -isaia- the '' law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus '' '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us . '' This -isaia- true also_for the Christian couple and family . Their guide and rule of life_-isaia- the Spirit of Jesus poured into their_hearts in the celebration of the sacrament of Matrimony . In continuity with Baptism in water and the Spirit , marriage sets forth anew the evangelical law of love , and with the gift of the Spirit engraves it more profoundly on the hearts of Christian husbands and wives . Their love , purified and saved , -isaia- a fruit of the Spirit acting in the hearts of believers and constituting , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the fundamental commandment of their moral_life to be lived in responsible freedom . Thus , the Christian family_-isaia- inspired and guide by the new law of the Spirit and , in intimate communion with the Church , the kingly people , it -isaia- called to exercise its '' service '' of love towards God and towards its fellow human_beings . Just as Christ exercises His royal power by serving us , so also the Christian finds the authentic meaning of his participation in the kingship of his Lord in sharing His spirit and practice of service to man . '' Christ has communicated this_power to his_disciples that they_might be established in royal freedom and that by self denial and a holy life they_might conquer the reign of sin in themselves cf . Further , He has shared this_power so that by serving Him in their fellow human_beings they_might through humility and patience lead their brothers_and_sisters to that King whom to serve -isaia- to reign . For the Lord wishes to spread His kingdom by means of the laity also , a kingdom of truth and life , a kingdom of holiness and grace , a kingdom of justice , love and peace . In this kingdom , creation itself will be delivered out of its slavery to corruption and into the freedom of the glory of the children of God cf . '' To Discover the Image of God in Each Brother and Sister . Inspired and sustained by the new commandment of love , the Christian family welcomes , respects and serves every_human_being , considering each_one in his or her dignity as a person and as a child of God . It should be so especially between husband_and_wife and within_the family , through a daily effort to promote a truly personal community , initiated and fostered by an inner communion of love . This way_of_life should then be extended to the wider circle of the ecclesial_community of which_the Christian family_-isaia- a part . Thanks to love within_the family , the Church can and ought to take on a more homelike or family dimension , developing a more_human and fraternal style of relationships . Love , too , goes beyond our_brothers_and_sisters of the same faith since '' everybody -isaia- my brother or sister . '' In each_individual , especially in the poor , the weak , and those who_suffer or are unjustly treated , love knows how to discover the face of Christ , and discover a fellow human_being to be loved and served . In order_that the family may serve man in a truly evangelical way , the instructions of the Second Vatican Council must be carefully put into_practice : '' That the exercise of such charity may rise above any deficiencies in fact and even in appearance , certain fundamentals must be observed . Thus , attention -isaia- to be paid to the image of God in which_our neighbor has_been created , and also to Christ the Lord to whom -isaia- really offered whatever_-isaia- given to a needy person . '' While building up the Church in love , the Christian family places itself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the human_person and the world , really bringing_about the '' human advancement '' whose substance was_given in summary form in the Synod s Message to families : '' Another task for the family_-isaia- to form persons in love and also to practice love in all its relationships , so that it does_not live closed in on itself , but remains open to the community , moved by a sense of justice and concern_for others , as well as by a consciousness of its responsibility towards_the whole of society . '' PART FOUR PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAMILY : STAGES , STRUCTURES , AGENTS AND SITUATIONS I STAGES OF PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAMILY The Church Accompanies the Christian Family on Its Journey Through Life . Like every_other living reality , the family too -isaia- called_upon to develop and grow . After the preparation of engagement and the sacramental celebration of marriage , the couple begin their_daily journey towards_the progressive actuation of the values and duties of marriage itself . In the light_of_faith and by virtue of hope , the Christian family too shares , in communion with the Church , in the experience of the earthly pilgrimage towards_the full revelation and manifestation of the Kingdom of God . Therefore , it must be emphasized once_more that the pastoral intervention of the Church in support of the family -isaia-_a_matter of urgency . Every effort should be made to strengthen and develop pastoral_care for the family , which_should be treated as a real matter of priority , in the certainty_that future evangelization depends largely on the domestic Church . '' The Church s pastoral concern will_not be limited only to the Christian families closest -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; it will extend its horizons in harmony_with_the Heart of Christ , and will show itself to be even_more lively for families in general and for those families in particular which_are in difficult or irregular situations . For all of them the Church will_have a word of truth , goodness , understanding , hope and deep sympathy with_their sometimes tragic difficulties . To all of them she_will offer her disinterested help so that_they_can come closer to that model of a family which_the Creator intended from '' the beginning '' and which Christ has renewed with His redeeming grace . The Church s pastoral action must be progressive , also in the sense_that it must follow_the family , accompanying it step by step in the different stages of its formation and development . Preparation for Marriage . More than_ever necessary in our_times -isaia- preparation of young_people for marriage and family_life . In some_countries it -isaia- still the families themselves that , according to ancient customs , ensure the passing on to young_people of the values concerning married and family_life , and they do this through a gradual process of education or initiation . But the changes that_have taken_place within almost all modern societies demand_that not_only the family but_also society and the Church should be involved in the effort of properly preparing young_people for their future responsibilities . Many negative phenomena which_are today noted with regret in family_life derive from the fact_that , in the new situations , young_people not_only lose sight of the correct hierarchy of values but , since_they no longer have certain criteria of behavior , they_do_not know_how to face and deal_with the new difficulties . But experience teaches_that young_people who_have_been well prepared_for family_life generally succeed better_than others . This -isaia- even_more applicable to Christian marriage , which influences the holiness of large numbers of men_and_women . The Church must_therefore promote better and more intensive programs of marriage preparation , in order to eliminate as far_as_possible the difficulties that_many married_couples find_themselves in , and even_more in order to favor positively the establishing and maturing of successful marriages . Marriage preparation has to be seen and put into_practice as a gradual and continuous process . It includes three main stages : remote , proximate and immediate preparation . Remote preparation begins in early childhood , in that wise family training which_leads children to discover themselves as being endowed_with a rich and complex psychology and with a particular personality with its_own strengths and weaknesses . It -isaia- the period when esteem_for all authentic human values -isaia- instilled , both in interpersonal and in social relationships , with all that_this signifies for the formation of character , for the control and right use of one s inclinations , for the manner of regarding and meeting people of the opposite sex , and so on . Also necessary , especially_for Christians , -isaia- solid spiritual and catechetical formation that_will show that marriage -isaia- a true vocation and mission , without excluding the possibility of the total gift_of_self to God in the vocation to the priestly or religious_life . Upon this basis there_will subsequently and gradually be built up the proximate preparation , which from the suitable age and with adequate catechesis , as in a catechumenal process involves a more specific preparation_for the sacraments , as it were , a rediscovery of them . This renewed catechesis of young_people and others preparing for Christian marriage -isaia- absolutely necessary in order_that the sacrament may be celebrated and lived with the right moral and spiritual dispositions . The religious formation of young_people should be integrated , -atti_degli_apostoli- the right moment and in accordance_with_the various concrete requirements , with a preparation_for life as a couple . This preparation will present marriage as an interpersonal relationship of a man and a woman that_has to be continually developed , and it will encourage those concerned to study the nature of conjugal sexuality and responsible parenthood , with the essential medical and biological knowledge connected_with it . It will_also acquaint those concerned_with correct methods for the education of children , and will assist them in gaining the basic requisites for well ordered family_life , such as stable work , sufficient financial resources , sensible administration , notions of housekeeping . Finally , one must_not overlook preparation_for the family apostolate , for fraternal solidarity and collaboration with_other families , for active membership in groups , associations , movements and undertakings set up for the human and Christian benefit of the family . The immediate preparation_for the celebration of the sacrament of Matrimony should_take place in the months and weeks immediately preceding the wedding , so as to give a new meaning , content and form to the so called premarital enquiry required by Canon Law . This preparation -isaia-_not_only necessary in every case , but -isaia-_also more urgently needed_for engaged couples that still manifest shortcomings or difficulties in Christian doctrine and practice . Among the elements to be instilled in this journey of faith_,_which -isaia- similar to the catechumenate , there_must also be a deeper knowledge of the mystery of Christ and the Church , of the meaning of grace and of the responsibility of Christian marriage , as well as preparation_for taking an active and conscious part in the rites of the marriage liturgy . The Christian family and the whole of the ecclesial_community should feel involved in the different phases of the preparation_for marriage , which_have_been described only in their broad outlines . It -isaia- to be hoped that the Episcopal Conferences , just as they_are concerned_with appropriate initiatives to help engaged couples to be more aware of the seriousness of their choice and also to help pastors of souls to make sure of the couples proper dispositions , so they_will also take steps to see that_there_-isaia- issued a Directory for the Pastoral Care of the Family . In this they_should lay_down , in the first_place , the minimum content , duration and method of the '' Preparation Courses , '' balancing the different aspects doctrinal , pedagogical , legal and medical concerning marriage , and structuring them in such_a_way_that those preparing for marriage will not_only receive an intellectual training but will_also feel a desire to enter actively into the ecclesial_community . Although one must_not underestimate the necessity and obligation of the immediate preparation_for marriage which_would happen if dispensations from it were easily given nevertheless such preparation must_always be set_forth and put into_practice in such_a_way_that omitting it -isaia- not an impediment to the celebration of marriage . Christian marriage normally requires a liturgical celebration expressing in social and community form the essentially ecclesial and sacramental nature of the conjugal covenant between baptized persons . Inasmuch as it -isaia- a sacramental action of sanctification , the celebration of marriage inserted into the liturgy , which_-isaia- the summit of the Church s action and the source of her sanctifying power must be per se valid , worthy and fruitful . This opens a wide field for pastoral solicitude , in order_that the needs deriving from the nature of the conjugal convent , elevated into a sacrament , may be fully met , and also in order_that the Church s discipline regarding free consent , impediments , the canonical form and the actual rite of the celebration may be faithfully observed . The celebration should be simple and dignified , according to the norms of the competent authorities of the Church . It -isaia-_also for them in accordance_with concrete circumstances of time_and_place and in conformity_with_the norms issued by the Apostolic See to include in the liturgical celebration such elements proper to each culture which serve to express more_clearly the profound human and religious significance of the marriage contract , provided_that such elements contain nothing that_-isaia-_not in harmony_with Christian faith and morality . Inasmuch as it -isaia- a sign , the liturgical celebration should be conducted in such_a_way as to constitute , also in its external reality , a proclamation of the word of God and a profession_of_faith on the part of the community of believers . Pastoral commitment will be expressed here through the intelligent and careful preparation of the Liturgy of the Word and through the education to faith of those participating in the celebration and in the first_place the couple being married . Inasmuch as it -isaia- a sacramental action of the Church , the liturgical celebration of marriage should involve the Christian community , with the full , active and responsible participation of all those present , according to the place and task of each_individual : the bride and bridegroom , the priest , the witnesses , the relatives , the friends , the other members of the faithful , all of them members of an assembly that manifests and lives the mystery of Christ and His Church . For the celebration of Christian marriage in the sphere of ancestral cultures or traditions , the principles laid_down above should be followed . Celebration of Marriage and Evangelization of Non believing Baptized Persons . Precisely because in the celebration of the sacrament very special_attention must be devoted to the moral and spiritual dispositions of those being married , in particular to their_faith , we must here deal_with a not infrequent difficulty in which_the pastors of the Church can find_themselves in the context of our secularized society . In fact , the faith of the person asking the Church for marriage can exist in different degrees , and it -isaia- the primary duty of pastors to bring_about a rediscovery of this faith and to nourish it and bring it to maturity . But pastors must_also understand_the reasons that lead the Church also to admit to the celebration of marriage those_who_are imperfectly disposed . The sacrament of Matrimony has this specific element that distinguishes it from all the other sacraments : it -isaia- the sacrament of something_that was part of the very economy of creation ; it -isaia- the very conjugal covenant instituted by the Creator '' in the beginning . '' Therefore the decision of a man and a woman to marry in accordance_with this_divine plan , that_-isaia- to say , the decision to commit by their irrevocable conjugal consent their whole lives in indissoluble love and unconditional fidelity , really involves , even if not in a fully conscious way , an attitude of profound obedience to the will of God , an attitude which_cannot exist without God s grace . They have thus already begun what_-isaia- in a true and proper sense a journey towards salvation , a journey which_the celebration of the sacrament and the immediate preparation_for it can complement and bring to completion , given the uprightness of their intention . On the other_hand it -isaia- true_that in some places engaged couples ask to be married in church_for motives which_are social rather_than genuinely religious . This -isaia- not surprising . Marriage , in fact , -isaia- not an event that concerns only the persons actually getting married . By its_very nature it -isaia-_also a social matter , committing the couple being married in the eyes of society . And its celebration has_always_been an occasion of rejoicing that brings together families and friends . It therefore goes without saying that social as well as personal motives enter_into the request to be married in church . Nevertheless , it must_not be forgotten that_these engaged couples , by virtue of their Baptism , are_already really sharers in Christ s marriage Covenant with the Church , and that , by their right intention , they_have accepted God s plan regarding marriage and therefore -atti_degli_apostoli- least implicitly consent to what_the Church intends to do when_she celebrates marriage . Thus , the fact_that motives of a social nature also enter_into the request -isaia-_not_enough to justify refusal on the part of pastors . Moreover , as the Second Vatican Council teaches , the sacraments by words and ritual elements nourish and strengthen faith '' : that_faith towards which_the married couple are_already journeying by reason of the uprightness of their intention , which Christ s grace certainly does_not fail to favor and support . As for wishing to lay_down further criteria for admission to the ecclesial celebration of marriage , criteria that_would concern the level of faith of those to be married , this_would above all involve grave risks . In the first_place , the risk of making unfounded and discriminatory judgments ; secondly , the risk of causing doubts about the validity of marriages already celebrated , with grave harm to Christian communities , and new and unjustified anxieties to the consciences of married_couples ; one would also fall_into the danger of calling into question the sacramental nature of many marriages of brethren separated_from full_communion with the Catholic Church , thus contradicting ecclesial tradition . However , when in spite of all efforts , engaged couples show that_they reject explicitly and formally what_the Church intends to do when_the marriage of baptized persons -isaia- celebrated , the pastor of souls cannot admit them to the celebration of marriage . In spite of his reluctance to do so , he has the duty to take note of the situation and to make it clear to those concerned that , in these circumstances , it -isaia- not the Church that_-isaia- placing an obstacle in the way of the celebration that_they_are asking for , but themselves . Once more there appears in all its urgency the need_for evangelization and catechesis before and after marriage , effected by the whole Christian community , so that_every man_and_woman that gets married celebrates the sacrament of Matrimony not_only validly but_also fruitfully . Pastoral Care After Marriage . The pastoral_care of the regularly established family signifies , in practice , the commitment of all the members of the local ecclesial_community to helping the couple to discover and live their new vocation and mission . In order_that the family may be ever_more a true community of love , it -isaia- necessary_that all its_members should be helped and trained in their responsibilities as they face the new problems that arise , in mutual service , and in active sharing in family_life . This holds true especially_for young families , which , finding themselves in a context of new values and responsibilities , are_more vulnerable , especially in the first years of marriage , to possible difficulties , such as those created by adaptation to life together or by the birth of children . Young married_couples should learn to accept willingly , and make good use of , the discreet , tactful and generous help offered by other couples that already have more experience of married and family_life . Thus , within_the ecclesial_community the great family made up of Christian families there_will take_place a mutual exchange of presence and help among all the families , each_one putting -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others its_own experience of life , as well as the gifts of faith and grace . Animated by a true apostolic spirit , this assistance from family to family will constitute one of the simplest , most effective and most accessible means_for transmitting from one to another those Christian values_which are both the starting point and goal of all pastoral_care . Thus young families will_not limit themselves merely to receiving , but in their turn , having_been helped in this_way , will_become a source of enrichment for other longer established families , through_their witness of life and practical contribution . In her pastoral_care of young families , the Church must_also pay special_attention to helping them to live married love responsibly in relationship_with its demands of communion and service to life . She must likewise help_them to harmonize the intimacy of home life with the generous shared work of building up the Church and society . When children are born and the married couple becomes a family in the full and specific sense , the Church will still remain close to the parents in order that_they_may accept their_children and love them as a gift received_from_the Lord of life , and joyfully accept the task of serving them in their human and Christian growth . II STRUCTURES OF FAMILY PASTORAL CARE Pastoral activity -isaia- always the dynamic expression of the reality of the Church , committed to her_mission of salvation . Family pastoral_care too which_-isaia- a particular and specific form of pastoral_activity has as its operative principle and responsible agent the Church herself , through_her structures and workers . The Ecclesial Community and in Particular the Parish . The Church , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a saved and a saving community , has to be considered here under two aspects : as universal and particular . The second aspect -isaia- expressed and actuated in the diocesan community , which_-isaia- pastorally divided up into lesser communities , of which_the parish -isaia- of special importance . Communion with the universal Church does_not hinder but_rather guarantees and promotes the substance and originality of the various particular Churches . These latter remain the more immediate and more_effective subjects of operation for putting the pastoral_care of the family into_practice . In this_sense every local Church and , in more particular terms , every parochial community , must become more vividly aware of the grace and responsibility that it receives from the Lord in order that_it_may promote the pastoral_care of the family . No plan_for organized pastoral_work , -atti_degli_apostoli- any level , must ever fail to take_into consideration the pastoral_care of the family . Also to be seen in the light of this responsibility -isaia- the importance of the proper preparation of all those_who will be more specifically engaged in this_kind of apostolate . Priests and men_and_women_religious , from the time of their formation , should be oriented and trained progressively and thoroughly for the various tasks . Among the various initiatives I -amos- pleased to emphasize the recent establishment in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Pontifical Lateran University , of a Higher Institute for the study of the problems of the family . Institutes of this_kind have_also been set up in some dioceses . Bishops should see_to_it_that as many priests as possible attend specialized courses there before taking on parish responsibilities . Elsewhere , formation courses are periodically held -atti_degli_apostoli- Higher Institutes of theological and pastoral studies . Such initiatives should be encouraged , sustained , increased in number , and of course are_also open to lay_people who intend to use their professional skills medical , legal , psychological , social or educational to help the family . But it -isaia-_especially necessary to recognize_the unique place that , in this_field , belongs to the mission of married_couples and Christian families , by virtue of the grace received in the sacrament . This mission must be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the building up of the Church , the establishing of the Kingdom of God in history . This -isaia- demanded as an act of docile obedience to Christ the Lord . For it -isaia- He who , by virtue of the fact_that marriage of baptized persons has_been raised to a sacrament , confers upon Christian married_couples a special mission as apostles , sending them as workers into His vineyard , and , in a very_special way , into this_field of the family . In this activity , married_couples act in communion and collaboration with the other members of the Church , who also work_for the family , contributing their_own gifts and ministries . This apostolate will be exercised in the first_place within_the families of those concerned , through the witness of a life lived in conformity_with_the divine_law in all its aspects , through the Christian formation of the children , through helping them to mature in faith , through education to chastity , through preparation_for life , through vigilance in protecting them_from the ideological and moral dangers with which_they_are often threatened , through_their gradual and responsible inclusion in the ecclesial_community and the civil community , through help and advice in choosing a vocation , through mutual help among family members for_human and Christian growth together , and so on . The apostolate of the family will_also become wider through works of spiritual and material charity towards other families , especially_those most in need of help and support , towards_the poor , the sick , the old , the handicapped , orphans , widows , spouses that have_been abandoned , unmarried mothers and mothers to be in difficult situations who_are tempted to have_recourse to abortion , and so on . Associations of Families for Families . Still within_the Church , which_-isaia- the subject responsible_for the pastoral_care of the family , mention should be made of the various groupings of members of the faithful in which_the mystery of Christ s Church -isaia- in some measure manifested and lived . One should therefore recognize and make good use of each_one in relationship to its_own characteristics , purposes effectiveness and methods the different ecclesial_communities , the various groups and the numerous movements engaged in various_ways , for different reasons and -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels , in the pastoral_care of the family . For this_reason_the Synod expressly recognized the useful contribution made by such associations of spirituality , formation and apostolate . It will be their task to foster among the faithful a lively sense of solidarity , to favor a manner of living inspired by the Gospel and by the faith of the Church , to form consciences according to Christian values and not according to the standards of public opinion ; to stimulate people to perform works of charity for one_another and for others with a spirit of openness which_will make Christian families into a true source of light and a wholesome leaven for other families . It -isaia- similarly desirable that , with a lively sense of the common_good , Christian families should become actively engaged , -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , in other non ecclesial associations as well . Some of these associations work_for the preservation , transmission and protection of the wholesome ethical and cultural values of each people , the development of the human_person , the medical , juridical and social protection of mothers and young children , the just advancement of women and the struggle against all that_-isaia- detrimental to their_dignity , the increase of mutual solidarity , knowledge of the problems connected_with_the responsible regulation of fertility in accordance_with natural methods that_are in conformity_with human_dignity and the teaching of the Church . Other associations work_for the building of a more just and human world ; for the promotion of just laws favoring the right social_order with full respect_for the dignity and every legitimate freedom of the individual and the family , on both the national and international level ; for collaboration with the school and with the other institutions that complete the education of children , and so forth . III AGENTS OF THE PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAMILY As well as the family , which_-isaia- the object but_above all the subject of pastoral_care of the family , one must_also mention the other main agents in this particular sector . Bishops and Priests . The person principally responsible in the diocese for the pastoral_care of the family_-isaia- the Bishop . As father and pastor , he must exercise particular solicitude in this clearly priority sector of pastoral_care . He must devote to it personal interest , care , time , personnel and resources , but_above all personal support for the families and for all those_who , in the various diocesan structures , assist him in the pastoral_care of the family . It will be his particular care to make_the diocese ever_more truly a '' diocesan family , '' a model and source of hope_for the many families that belong to it . The setting up of the Pontifical Council for the Family -isaia- to be seen in this light : to be a sign of the importance that I attribute to pastoral_care for the family in the world , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to be an effective instrument for aiding and promoting it -atti_degli_apostoli- every level . The Bishops avail themselves especially of the priests , whose task as the Synod expressly emphasized constitutes an essential part of the Church s ministry regarding marriage and the family . The same -isaia- true of deacons to whose care this sector of pastoral_work may be entrusted . Their responsibility extends not_only to moral and liturgical matters but to personal and social matters as well . They must support the family in its difficulties and sufferings , caring for its_members and helping them to see their_lives in the light of the Gospel . It -isaia- not superfluous to note that_from this_mission , if it -isaia- exercised with due discernment and with a truly apostolic spirit , the minister of the Church draws fresh encouragement and spiritual energy for his_own vocation too and for the exercise of his_ministry . Priests and deacons , when_they have_received timely and serious preparation_for this apostolate , must unceasingly act towards families as fathers , brothers , pastors and teachers , assisting them_with_the means of grace and enlightening them_with_the light of truth . Their teaching and advice must_therefore always be in full harmony_with_the authentic Magisterium of the Church , in such_a_way as to help the People of God to gain a correct sense of the faith , to be subsequently applied to practical life . Such fidelity to the Magisterium will_also enable priests to make every_effort to be united in their judgments , in order to avoid troubling the consciences of the faithful . In the Church , the pastors and the laity share in the prophetic mission of Christ : the laity do so by witnessing to the faith by their words and by their Christian lives ; the pastors do so by distinguishing in that witness what_-isaia- the expression of genuine faith from what_-isaia- less in harmony_with_the light_of_faith ; the family , as a Christian community , does so through its special sharing and witness of faith . Thus there begins a dialogue also between pastors and families . Theologians and experts in family matters can be of great help in this dialogue , by explaining exactly the content of the Church s Magisterium and the content of the experience of family_life . In this_way the teaching of the Magisterium becomes better understood and the way -isaia- opened to its progressive development . But it -isaia- useful to recall that the proximate and obligatory norm in the teaching of the faith also concerning family matters belongs to the hierarchical Magisterium . Clearly defined relationships between theologians , experts in family matters and the Magisterium are of no little assistance for the correct understanding of the faith and for promoting within_the boundaries of the faith legitimate pluralism . Men and Women Religious . The contribution that_can be made to the apostolate of the family by men_and_women_religious and consecrated_persons in general finds_its primary , fundamental and original expression precisely in their consecration to God . By reason of this consecration , '' for all Christ s faithful religious recall that wonderful marriage made by God , which_will be fully manifested in the future age , and in which_the Church has Christ for_her only spouse , '' and they_are witnesses to that universal charity_which , through chastity embraced for the Kingdom of heaven , makes them ever_more available to dedicate themselves generously to the service of God and to the works of the apostolate . Hence the possibility for men_and_women_religious , and members of Secular Institutes and other institutes of perfection , either individually or in groups , to develop their service to families , with particular solicitude for children , especially if they_are abandoned , unwanted , orphaned , poor or handicapped . They can_also visit families and look after_the sick ; they_can foster relationships of respect and charity towards one parent families or families that_are in difficulties or are separated ; they can_offer their_own work of teaching and counseling in the preparation of young_people for marriage , and in helping couples towards truly responsible parenthood ; they_can open their_own houses for simple and cordial hospitality , so that families can_find there the sense of God s presence and gain a taste for prayer and recollection , and see the practical examples of lives lived in charity and fraternal joy as members of the larger family of God . I would_like to add a most pressing exhortation to the heads of institutes_of_consecrated_life to consider always with substantial respect_for the proper and original charism of each_one the apostolate of the family as one of the priority tasks , rendered even_more urgent by the present state of the world . Considerable help can be given to families by lay specialists doctors , lawyers , psychologists , social workers , consultants , etc . who either as individuals or as members of various associations and undertakings offer their contribution of enlightenment , advice , orientation and support . To these_people one_can well apply the exhortations that I had the occasion to address to the Confederation of Family Advisory Bureaus of Christian Inspiration : '' Yours -isaia- a commitment that well deserves the title of mission , so noble are the aims that it pursues , and so determining , for the good of society and the Christian community itself , are the results that derive from it . All that_you succeed in doing to support the family_-isaia- destined to have an effectiveness that goes beyond its_own sphere and reaches other people too and has an effect on society The future of the world and of the Church passes through the family . '' Recipients and Agents of Social Communications . This very_important category in modern life deserves a word of its_own . It -isaia- well_known that the means of social communication '' affect , and often profoundly , the minds of those_who use them , under the affective and intellectual aspect and also under the moral and religious aspect , '' especially in the case of young_people . They can thus exercise a beneficial influence on the life and habits of the family and on the education of children , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time they_also conceal '' snares and dangers that cannot be ignored . '' They could also become a vehicle sometimes cleverly and systematically manipulated , as unfortunately happens in various countries of the world for divisive ideologies and distorted ways of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- life , the family , religion and morality , attitudes that lack respect_for man s true dignity and destiny . This danger -isaia- all the more real inasmuch as '' the modern life style especially in the more industrialized nations all too_often causes families to abandon their responsibility to educate their_children . Evasion of this_duty -isaia- made easy for them by the presence of television and certain publications in the home , and in this_way they keep their_children s time and energies occupied . '' Hence '' the duty . to protect the young from the forms of aggression they_are subjected to by the mass_media , '' and to ensure_that the use of the media in the family_-isaia- carefully regulated . Families should_also take_care to seek for their_children other_forms of entertainment that are_more wholesome , useful and physically , morally and spiritually formative , '' to develop and use to advantage the free time of the young and direct their energies . '' Furthermore , because the means of social communication , like the school and the environment , often have a notable influence on the formation of children , parents as recipients must actively ensure the moderate , critical , watchful and prudent use of the media , by discovering what effect they_have on their_children and by controlling the use of the media in such_a_way as to '' train the conscience of their_children to express calm and objective judgments , which_will then guide them in the choice or rejection of programs available . With equal commitment parents will endeavor to influence the selection and the preparation of the programs themselves , by keeping in contact through suitable initiatives with_those in charge of the various phases of production and transmission . In this_way they_will ensure_that the fundamental human values that form part of the true good of society are_not ignored or deliberately attacked . Rather they_will ensure the broadcasting of programs that present in the right light family problems and their_proper solution . In this_regard my venerated predecessor Paul VI wrote : '' Producers must know and respect the needs of the family , and this sometimes presupposes in them true courage , and always a high sense_of_responsibility . In fact they_are expected to avoid anything that could harm the family in its existence , its stability , its balance and its happiness . Every attack on the fundamental value of the family meaning eroticism or violence , the defense of divorce or of antisocial attitudes among young_people -isaia- an attack on the true good of man . '' I myself , on a similar occasion , pointed_out that families '' to a considerable extent need to be able to count on the good_will , integrity and sense_of_responsibility of the media professionals publishers writers , producers , directors , playwrights , newsmen , commentators and actors . '' It -isaia- therefore also the duty of the Church to continue to devote every care to these categories , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time encouraging and supporting Catholics who feel the call and have_the necessary talents , to take up this sensitive type of work . IV PASTORAL CARE OF THE FAMILY IN DIFFICULT CASES Particular Circumstances . An even_more generous , intelligent and prudent pastoral commitment , modelled on the Good Shepherd , -isaia- called_for in the case of families which , often independently of their_own wishes and through pressures of various other kinds , find_themselves faced by situations which_are objectively difficult . In this_regard it -isaia- necessary to call special_attention to certain particular groups which_are more in need not_only of assistance but_also of more incisive action upon public opinion and especially upon cultural , economic and juridical structures , in order_that the profound causes of their needs may be eliminated as far_as_possible . Such for example are the families of migrant workers ; the families of those obliged to be away for long periods , such as members of the armed forces , sailors and all kinds of itinerant people ; the families of those in prison , of refugees and exiles ; the families in big cities living practically speaking as outcasts ; families with no home ; incomplete or single parent families ; families with children that_are handicapped or addicted to drugs ; the families of alcoholics ; families that have_been uprooted from their cultural and social environment or are in danger of losing it ; families discriminated against for political or other reasons ; families that_are ideologically divided ; families that_are unable to make ready contact_with_the parish ; families experiencing violence or unjust treatment because_of_their faith ; teenage married_couples ; the elderly , who are_often obliged to live alone with inadequate means of subsistence . The families of migrants , especially in the case of manual workers and farm workers , should be able to find a homeland everywhere in the Church . This -isaia- a task stemming from the nature of the Church , as being the sign of unity in diversity . As far_as_possible these_people should be looked after by priests of their_own rite , culture and language . It -isaia-_also the Church s task to appeal to the public conscience and to all those in authority in social , economic and political_life , in order_that workers may find employment in their_own regions and homelands , that_they_may receive just wages , that their_families may be reunited as soon as possible , be respected in their cultural identity and treated on an equal footing with_others , and that their_children may be given the chance to learn a trade and exercise it , as also the chance to own the land needed_for working and living . A difficult problem -isaia- that of the family which_-isaia- ideologically divided . In these cases particular pastoral_care -isaia- needed . In the first_place it -isaia- necessary to maintain tactful personal contact_with such families . The believing members must be strengthened in their_faith and supported in their Christian lives . Although the party faithful to Catholicism cannot give way , dialogue_with_the other party must_always be kept alive . Love and respect must be freely shown , in the firm hope that_unity will be maintained . Much also depends on the relationship_between parents and children . Moreover , ideologies which_are alien to the faith can stimulate the believing members of the family to grow in faith and in the witness of love . Other difficult circumstances in which_the family needs the help of the ecclesial_community and its pastors are : the children s adolescence , which_can be disturbed , rebellious and sometimes stormy ; the children s marriage , which_takes them away from their family ; lack of understanding or lack of love on the part of those held most dear ; abandonment by one of the spouses , or his or her death , which brings the painful experience of widowhood , or the death of a family member , which breaks up and deeply transforms the original family nucleus . Similarly , the Church cannot ignore the time of old age , with all its positive and negative aspects . In old age married love , which_has_been increasingly purified and ennobled by long and unbroken fidelity , can be deepened . There -isaia- the opportunity of offering to others , in a new form , the kindness and the wisdom gathered over the years , and what energies remain . But there_-isaia-_also the burden of loneliness , more often psychological and emotional rather_than physical , which results from abandonment or neglect on the part of children and relations . There -isaia-_also suffering caused by ill health , by the gradual loss of strength , by the humiliation of having to depend on others , by the sorrow of feeling that one_-isaia- perhaps a burden to one s loved ones , and by the approach of the end of life . These are the circumstances in which , as the Synod Fathers suggested , it -isaia- easier to help people understand and live the lofty aspects of the spirituality of marriage and the family , aspects which take their inspiration from the value of Christ s Cross and Resurrection , the source of sanctification and profound happiness in daily_life , in the light of the great eschatological realities of eternal_life . In all these different situations let prayer , the source of light and strength and the nourishment of Christian hope , never be neglected . The growing number of mixed marriages between Catholics and other baptized persons also calls for special pastoral attention in the light of the directives and norms contained in the most recent documents of the Holy See and in those drawn up by the Episcopal Conferences , in order to permit their practical application to the various situations . Couples living in a mixed marriage have special needs , which_can be put under three main headings . In the first_place , attention must be paid to the obligations that_faith imposes on the Catholic party with_regard to the free exercise of the faith and the consequent obligation to ensure , as far as -isaia- possible , the Baptism and upbringing of the children in the Catholic faith . There must be borne in mind the particular difficulties inherent in the relationships between husband_and_wife with_regard to respect_for religious_freedom : this freedom could be violated either by undue pressure to make_the partner change his or her beliefs , or by placing obstacles in the way of the free manifestation of these beliefs by religious practice . With regard to the liturgical and canonical form of marriage , Ordinaries can_make wide use of their faculties to meet various necessities . In dealing_with these special needs , the following points should be kept in mind : In the appropriate preparation_for this type of marriage , every reasonable effort must be made to ensure a proper understanding of Catholic teaching on the qualities and obligations of marriage , and also to ensure_that the pressures and obstacles mentioned above will_not occur . It -isaia- of the greatest importance that , through the support of the community , the Catholic party should be strengthened in faith and positively helped to mature in understanding and practicing that_faith , so as to become a credible witness within_the family through_his or her own_life and through the quality of love shown to the other spouse and the children . Marriages between Catholics and other baptized persons have_their own particular nature , but_they contain numerous elements that could well be made good use of and developed , both_for their intrinsic value and for the contribution that_they_can make to the ecumenical movement . This -isaia- particularly true when both parties are faithful to their religious duties . Their common Baptism and the dynamism of grace provide the spouses in these marriages with the basis and motivation for expressing their unity in the sphere of moral and spiritual values . For this_purpose , and also in order to highlight the ecumenical importance of mixed marriages which_are fully lived in the faith of the two Christian spouses , an effort should be made to establish cordial cooperation between_the Catholic and the non Catholic ministers from the time that preparations begin for the marriage and the wedding ceremony , even_though this_does_not always prove easy . With regard to the sharing of the non Catholic party in Eucharistic Communion , the norms issued by the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity should be followed . Today in many parts_of_the_world marriages between Catholics and non baptized persons are growing in numbers . In many such marriages the non baptized partner professes another religion , and his beliefs are to be treated with_respect , in accordance_with_the principles set_out in the Second Vatican Council s Declaration Nostra aetate on relations with non Christian religions . But in many_other such marriages , particularly in secularized societies , the non baptized person professes no religion -atti_degli_apostoli- all . In these marriages there_-isaia-_a_need for Episcopal Conferences and for individual Bishops to ensure_that there_are proper pastoral safeguards for the faith of the Catholic partner and for the free exercise of his faith , above all in regard to his duty to do all in his_power to ensure the Catholic baptism and education of the children of the marriage . Likewise the Catholic must be assisted in every possible way to offer within his family a genuine witness to the Catholic faith and to Catholic life . Pastoral Action in Certain Irregular Situations . In its solicitude to protect the family in all its dimensions , not_only the religious one , the Synod of Bishops did not_fail to take_into careful consideration certain situations which_are irregular in a religious sense and often in the civil sense too . Such situations , as a result of today s rapid cultural changes , are unfortunately becoming widespread also among Catholics with no little damage to the very institution of the family and to society , of which_the family constitutes the basic cell . A first example of an irregular situation -isaia- provided by what are_called '' trial marriages , '' which many_people today would_like to justify by attributing a certain value to them . But human_reason leads one to see that_they_are unacceptable , by showing the unconvincing nature of carrying_out an '' experiment '' with human_beings , whose dignity demands that_they_should be always and solely the term of a self_giving love without limitations of time or of any_other circumstance . The Church , for_her part , cannot admit such a kind of union , for further and original reasons which derive from faith . For , in the first_place , the gift of the body in the sexual relationship -isaia- a real symbol of the giving of the whole person : such a giving , moreover , in the present state of things cannot take_place with full truth without_the concourse of the love of charity , given by Christ . In the second place , marriage between two baptized persons -isaia- a real symbol of the union of Christ and the Church , which_-isaia-_not a temporary or '' trial '' union but_one which_-isaia- eternally faithful . Therefore between two baptized persons there_can exist only an indissoluble marriage . Such a situation cannot usually be overcome unless the human_person , from childhood , with the help of Christ s grace and without fear , has_been trained to dominate concupiscence from the beginning and to establish relationships of genuine love with_other people . This cannot be secured without a true education in genuine love and in the right use of sexuality , such as to introduce the human_person in every aspect , and therefore the bodily aspect too , into the fullness of the mystery of Christ . It will be very useful to investigate the causes of this phenomenon , including its psychological and sociological aspect , in order to find the proper remedy . b De Facto Free Unions . This means unions without_any publicly recognized institutional bond , either civil or religious . This phenomenon , which_-isaia- becoming ever_more frequent , cannot_fail to concern pastors of souls , also_because it may be based on widely varying factors , the consequences of which_may perhaps be containable by suitable action . Some people consider themselves almost forced into a free union by difficult economic , cultural or religious situations , on the grounds that , if they contracted a regular marriage , they_would be exposed to some form of harm , would lose economic advantages , would be discriminated against , etc . In other cases , however , one encounters people_who scorn , rebel against or reject society , the institution of the family and the social and political order , or who_are solely seeking pleasure . Then there are_those_who are driven to such situations by extreme ignorance or poverty , sometimes by a conditioning due to situations of real injustice , or by a certain psychological immaturity that makes them uncertain or afraid to enter_into a stable and definitive union . In some_countries , traditional customs presume that the true and proper marriage will take_place only after a period of cohabitation and the birth of the first child . Each of these elements presents the Church with arduous pastoral problems , by reason of the serious consequences deriving from them , both religious and moral the loss of the religious sense of marriage seen in the light of the Covenant of God with His people ; deprivation of the grace of the sacrament ; grave scandal , and also social consequences the destruction of the concept of the family ; the weakening of the sense of fidelity , also towards society ; possible psychological damage to the children ; the strengthening of selfishness . The pastors and the ecclesial_community should_take care to become acquainted with_such situations and their actual causes , case by case . They should make tactful and respectful contact_with_the couples concerned , and enlighten them patiently , correct them charitably and show them the witness of Christian family_life , in such_a_way as to smooth the path for them to regularize their situation . But above all there_must be a campaign of prevention , by fostering the sense of fidelity in the whole moral and religious training of the young , instructing them concerning the conditions and structures that favor such fidelity , without_which there_-isaia- no true freedom ; they_must be helped to reach spiritual maturity and enabled to understand_the rich human and supernatural reality of marriage as a sacrament . The People of God should_also make approaches to the public_authorities , in order_that the latter may resist these tendencies which divide society and are harmful to the dignity , security and welfare of the citizens as individuals , and they_must try to ensure_that public opinion -isaia- not led to undervalue the institutional importance of marriage and the family . And since in many regions young_people are unable to get married properly because of extreme poverty deriving from unjust or inadequate social_and_economic structures , society and the public_authorities should favor legitimate marriage by means of a series of social and political actions which_will guarantee a family wage , by issuing directives ensuring housing fitting for family_life and by creating opportunities_for work and life . c Catholics in Civil Marriages . There are increasing cases of Catholics who for ideological or practical reasons , prefer to contract a merely civil marriage , and who reject or -atti_degli_apostoli- least defer religious marriage . Their situation cannot of course be likened to that of people simply living together without_any bond -atti_degli_apostoli- all , because in the present case there_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- least a certain commitment to a properly defined and probably stable state of life , even_though the possibility of a future divorce -isaia-_often present in the minds of those entering a civil marriage . By seeking public recognition of their bond on the part of the State , such couples show that_they_are ready to accept not_only its advantages but_also its obligations . Nevertheless , not_even this situation -isaia- acceptable to the Church . The aim of pastoral action will be to make these_people understand_the need_for consistency between their choice of life and the faith_that they profess , and to try to do everything possible to induce them to regularize their situation in the light of Christian principle . While treating them with_great charity and bringing them_into the life of the respective communities , the pastors of the Church will regrettably not be able to admit them to the sacraments . d Separated or Divorced Persons Who Have Not Remarried . Various reasons can unfortunately lead to the often irreparable breakdown of valid marriages . These include mutual lack of understanding and the inability to enter_into interpersonal relationships . Obviously , separation must be considered as a last resort , after all other reasonable attempts -atti_degli_apostoli- reconciliation have proved vain . Loneliness and other difficulties are_often the lot of separated spouses , especially_when they_are the innocent parties . The ecclesial_community must support such people more_than_ever . It must give_them much respect , solidarity , understanding and practical help , so that_they_can preserve their fidelity even in their difficult situation ; and it must help_them to cultivate the need to forgive which_-isaia- inherent in Christian love , and to be ready perhaps to return to their former married life . The situation -isaia- similar for people_who have undergone divorce , but , being well aware_that the valid marriage bond -isaia- indissoluble , refrain from becoming involved in a new union and devote_themselves solely to carrying_out their family duties and the responsibilities of Christian life . In such cases their example of fidelity and Christian consistency takes on particular value as a witness before the world and the Church . Here it -isaia- even_more necessary_for the Church to offer continual love and assistance , without there being any obstacle to admission to the sacraments . e Divorced Persons Who Have Remarried . Daily experience unfortunately shows_that people_who have obtained a divorce usually intend to enter_into a new union , obviously not_with a Catholic religious ceremony . Since this_-isaia- an evil that , like the others , -isaia- affecting more_and_more Catholics as well , the problem must be faced_with resolution and without delay . The Synod Fathers studied it expressly . The Church , which_was set up to lead to salvation all people and especially_the baptized , cannot abandon to their_own devices those_who_have been previously bound by sacramental marriage and who_have attempted a second marriage . The Church will therefore make untiring efforts to put -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal her means of salvation . Pastors must know_that , for the sake of truth , they_are obliged to exercise careful discernment of situations . There -isaia-_in_fact a difference between those_who_have sincerely tried to save their first marriage and have_been unjustly abandoned , and those_who through_their own grave fault have destroyed a canonically valid marriage . Finally , there_are those_who_have entered into a second union for the sake of the children s upbringing , and who_are sometimes subjectively certain in conscience that_their previous and irreparably destroyed marriage had never been valid . Together with the Synod , I earnestly call_upon pastors and the whole community of the faithful to help the divorced , and with solicitous care to make sure_that they_do_not consider themselves as separated_from the Church , for as baptized persons they_can , and indeed must , share in her_life . They should be encouraged to listen to the word of God , to attend the Sacrifice of the Mass , to persevere in prayer , to contribute to works of charity and to community efforts in favor of justice , to bring up their_children in the Christian faith , to cultivate the spirit and practice of penance and thus implore , day_by_day , God s grace . Let the Church pray_for them , encourage them and show herself a merciful mother , and thus sustain them in faith and hope . However , the Church reaffirms her practice , which_-isaia- based upon Sacred Scripture , of not admitting to Eucharistic Communion divorced persons_who have remarried . They are unable to be admitted thereto from the fact that_their state and condition of life objectively contradict that union of love between Christ and the Church which_-isaia- signified and effected by the Eucharist . Besides this , there_-isaia- another special pastoral reason : if these_people were admitted to the Eucharist , the faithful would be led into error and confusion regarding the Church s teaching about the indissolubility of marriage . Reconciliation in the sacrament of Penance which_would open the way to the Eucharist , can_only be granted to those_who , repenting of having broken the sign of the Covenant and of fidelity to Christ , are sincerely ready to undertake a way_of_life that -isaia-_no_longer in contradiction to the indissolubility of marriage . This means , in practice , that_when , for serious reasons , such as for example the children s upbringing , a man and a woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate , they '' take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence , that_-isaia- , by abstinence from the acts proper to married_couples . '' Similarly , the respect due to the sacrament of Matrimony , to the couples themselves and their_families , and also to the community of the faithful , forbids any pastor , for whatever reason or pretext even of a pastoral nature , to perform ceremonies of any_kind for divorced people_who remarry . Such ceremonies would give the impression of the celebration of a new sacramentally valid marriage , and would thus lead people into error concerning the indissolubility of a validly contracted marriage . By acting in this_way , the Church professes her_own fidelity to Christ and to His truth . At the same_time she shows motherly concern_for these children of hers , especially_those who , through no fault of their_own , have_been abandoned by their legitimate partner . With firm confidence she believes that_those_who have rejected the Lord s command and are_still living in this state will_be_able to obtain from God the grace of conversion and salvation , provided that_they_have persevered in prayer , penance and charity . Those Without a Family . I wish to add a further word for a category of people whom , as a result of the actual circumstances in which_they_are living , and this often not through_their own deliberate wish , I consider particularly close to the Heart of Christ and deserving of the affection and active solicitude of the Church and of pastors . There exist in the world countless people_who unfortunately cannot in any sense claim membership of what could be called in the proper sense a family . Large sections of humanity live in conditions of extreme poverty , in which promiscuity , lack of housing , the irregular nature and instability of relationships and the extreme lack of education make it impossible in practice to speak of a true family . There are others_who , for various reasons , have_been left alone in the world . And yet for all of these_people there exists a '' good_news of the family . '' On behalf of those living in extreme poverty , I have_already spoken of the urgent_need to work courageously in order to find solutions , also -atti_degli_apostoli- the political level , which_will make it possible to help_them and to overcome this inhuman condition of degradation . It -isaia- a task that faces the whole of society but in a special_way the authorities , by reason of their position and the responsibilities flowing therefrom , and also families , which_must show great understanding and willingness to help . For those_who_have no natural family the doors of the great family which_-isaia- the Church the Church which finds concrete expression in the diocesan and the parish family , in ecclesial basic communities and in movements of the apostolate must be opened even wider . No one_-isaia- without a family in this_world : the Church -isaia- a home and family for everyone , especially_those who '' labor and are heavy laden . At the end of this Apostolic Exhortation my thoughts turn with earnest solicitude : to you , married_couples , to you , fathers and mothers of families ; to you , young men_and_women , the future and the hope of the Church and the world , destined to be the dynamic central nucleus of the family in the approaching third_millennium ; to you_,_venerable and dear Brothers in the Episcopate and in the priesthood , beloved sons_and_daughters in the religious_life , souls consecrated to the Lord , who bear_witness before married_couples to the ultimate reality of the love of God ; to you , upright men_and_women , who for_any reason whatever give thought to the fate of the family . The future of humanity passes by way of the family . It -isaia- therefore indispensable and urgent that every_person of good_will should endeavor to save and foster the values and requirements of the family . I feel_that I must ask for a particular effort in this_field from the sons_and_daughters of the Church . Faith gives them full knowledge of God s wonderful plan : they therefore have an extra reason_for caring for the reality that_-isaia- the family in this_time of trial and of grace . They must show the family special love . This -isaia- an injunction that calls for concrete action . Loving the family means being able to appreciate its values and capabilities , fostering them always . Loving the family means identifying the dangers and the evils that menace it , in order to overcome them . Loving the family means endeavoring to create for it an environment favorable for its development . The modern Christian family_-isaia- often tempted to be discouraged and -isaia- distressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the growth of its difficulties ; it -isaia- an eminent form of love to give it back its reasons for confidence in itself , in the riches that it possesses by nature and grace , and in the mission that God has_entrusted to it . '' Yes indeed , the families of today must be called back to their original position . They must follow Christ . '' Christians also have_the mission of proclaiming with_joy and conviction the Good News about the family , for the family absolutely needs to hear ever anew and to understand ever more_deeply the authentic words that reveal its identity , its inner resources and the importance of its mission in the City of God and in that of man . The Church knows the path by which_the family can reach the heart of the deepest truth_about itself . The Church has learned this path -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Christ and the school of history interpreted in the light of the Spirit . She does_not impose it but she feels an urgent_need to propose it to everyone without fear and indeed with_great confidence and hope , although she knows that the Good News includes the subject of the Cross . But it -isaia- through the Cross that the family can attain the fullness of its being and the perfection of its love . Finally , I wish to call on all Christians to collaborate cordially and courageously with all people_of_good_will who_are serving the family in accordance_with their responsibilities . The individuals and groups , movements and associations in the Church which devote_themselves to the family s welfare , acting in the Church s name and under her inspiration , often find_themselves side by side with_other individuals and institutions working for the same ideal . With faithfulness to the values of the Gospel and of the human_person and with_respect for lawful pluralism in initiatives this collaboration can favor a more rapid and integral advancement of the family . And now , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of my pastoral message , which_-isaia- intended to draw everyone s attention to the demanding yet fascinating roles of the Christian family , I wish to invoke the protection of the Holy Family of Nazareth . Through God s mysterious design , it was in that family that the Son of God spent long years of a hidden life . It -isaia- therefore the prototype and example for all Christian families . It was unique in the world . Its life was passed in anonymity and silence in a little town in Palestine . It underwent trials of poverty , persecution and exile . It glorified God in an incomparably exalted and pure way . And it will not_fail to help Christian families indeed , all the families in the world to be faithful to their day to day duties , to bear the cares and tribulations of life , to be open and generous to the needs of others , and to fulfill with_joy the plan of God in their regard . Joseph was '' a just man , '' a tireless worker , the upright guardian of those entrusted to his care . May he always guard , protect and enlighten families . May the Virgin Mary , who_-isaia- the Mother of the Church , also be the Mother of '' the Church of the home . '' Thanks to her motherly aid , may each Christian family really become a '' little Church '' in which_the mystery of the Church of Christ -isaia- mirrored and given new_life . May she , the Handmaid of the Lord , be an example of humble and generous acceptance of the will of God . May she , the Sorrowful Mother -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , comfort the sufferings and dry the tears of those in distress because of the difficulties of their_families . May Christ the Lord , the Universal King , the King of Families , be present in every Christian home as He was -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana , bestowing light , joy , serenity and strength . On the solemn day dedicated to His Kingship I beg of Him that_every family may generously make its_own contribution to the coming of His Kingdom in the world '' a kingdom of truth and life , a kingdom of holiness and grace , a kingdom of justice , love , and peace , '' towards which history -isaia- journeying . I entrust each family to Him , to Mary , and to Joseph . To their hands and their_hearts I offer this Exhortation : may it be they_who present it to you_,_venerable Brothers and beloved sons_and_daughters , and may it be they_who open your hearts to the light that the Gospel sheds on every family . I assure you all of my constant prayers and I cordially impart the apostolic_blessing to each_and_every one of you , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the twenty second day of November , the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ , Universal King , in the year , the fourth of the Pontificate .

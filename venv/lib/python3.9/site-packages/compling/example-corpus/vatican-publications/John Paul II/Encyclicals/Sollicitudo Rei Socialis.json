{"title": "Sollicitudo Rei Socialis", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Encyclicals", "pub_date": "30/12/1987", "text": "II SOLLICITUDO REI SOCIALIS To the Bishops , PriestsReligious Families , sons_and_daughters of the Church and all people_of_good willfor the twentieth anniversary of Populorum Progressio Blessing Venerable Brothers and dear Sons and Daughters , Health and the Apostolic Blessing ! I . The social concern of the Church , directed towards an authentic development of man and society_which would respect and promote all the dimensions of the human_person , has_always expressed itself in the most varied ways . In recent_years , one of the special means of intervention has been_the Magisterium of the Roman Pontiffs which , beginning with the Encyclical Rerum Novarum of Leo XIII as a point of reference , has frequently dealt_with the question and has sometimes made the dates of publication of the various social documents coincide with the anniversaries of that first document . The Popes have_not failed to throw fresh light by means of those messages upon new aspects of the social_doctrine of the Church . As a result , this_doctrine , beginning with the outstanding contribution of Leo XIII and enriched by the successive contributions of the Magisterium , has now become an updated doctrinal '' corpus . '' It builds up gradually , as the Church , in the fullness of the word revealed by Christ Jesus and with the assistance of the Holy Spirit cf . Jn : , ; : , reads events as they unfold in the course of history . She thus seeks to lead people to respond , with the support also of rational reflection and of the human sciences , to their_vocation as responsible builders of earthly society . Part of this large body of social teaching_-isaia- the distinguished Encyclical Populorum Progressio , which my esteemed predecessor Paul VI published on March , . The enduring relevance of this Encyclical -isaia- easily recognized if we note the series of commemorations which took_place during in various_forms and in many_parts of the ecclesiastical and civil world . For this_same purpose , the Pontifical Commission Iustitia et Pax sent a circular letter to the Synods of the Oriental Catholic Churches and to the Episcopal Conferences , asking for ideas and suggestions on the best way to celebrate the Encyclical s anniversary , to enrich its teachings and , if need be , to update them . At the time of the twentieth anniversary , the same Commission organized a solemn commemoration in which I myself took part and gave the concluding address . And now , also taking into_account_the replies to the above mentioned circular letter , I consider it appropriate , -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the year , to devote an Encyclical to the theme of Populorum Progressio . In this_way I wish principally to achieve two objectives of no little importance : on the one_hand , to pay homage to this historic document of Paul VI and to its teaching ; on the other_hand , following in the footsteps of my esteemed predecessors in the See of Peter , to reaffirm the continuity of the social_doctrine as well as its constant renewal . In effect , continuity and renewal are a proof of the perennial value of the teaching of the Church . This twofold dimension -isaia- typical of her teaching in the social sphere . On the one_hand it -isaia- constant , for it remains identical in its fundamental inspiration , in its '' principles of reflection , '' in its '' criteria of judgment , '' in its basic '' directives for action , '' and above all in its vital link with the Gospel of the Lord . On the other_hand , it -isaia- ever_new , because_it_-isaia- subject to the necessary and opportune adaptations suggested by the changes in historical conditions and by the unceasing flow of the events which_are the setting of the life of people and society . I -amos- convinced_that the teachings of the Encyclical Populorum Progressio , addressed to the people and the society of the s , retain all their force as an appeal to conscience today in the last part of the s , in an effort to trace the major lines of the present world always within_the context of the aim and inspiration of the '' development of peoples , '' which are_still very far_from_being exhausted . I therefore propose to extend the impact of that message by bringing it to bear , with its possible applications , upon the present historical moment , which_-isaia- no less dramatic than_that of twenty years_ago . As we well know , time maintains a constant and unchanging rhythm . Today however we have_the impression that_it_-isaia- passing ever_more quickly , especially by reason of the multiplication and complexity of the phenomena in the midst of which we live . Consequently , the configuration of the world in the course of the last twenty years , while preserving certain fundamental constants , has undergone notable changes and presents some totally new aspects . The present period of time , on the eve of the third Christian millennium , -isaia- characterized by a widespread expectancy , rather like a new '' Advent , '' which to some extent touches everyone . It offers an opportunity to study the teachings of the Encyclical in greater detail and to see their possible future developments . The aim of the present reflection -isaia- to emphasize , through a theological investigation of the present world , the need_for a fuller and more nuanced concept of development , according to the suggestions contained in the Encyclical . Its aim -isaia-_also to indicate some ways of putting it into_effect . ORIGINALITY OF THE ENCYCLICAL POPULORUM PROGRESSIO . As soon as it appeared , the document of Pope Paul VI captured the attention of public opinion by reason of its originality . In a concrete manner and with_great clarity , it was possible to identify the above mentioned characteristics of continuity and renewal within_the Church s social_doctrine . The intention of rediscovering numerous aspects of this_teaching , through a careful rereading of the Encyclical , will therefore ; constitute the main thread of the present reflections . But first I wish to say a few words about the date of publication ; the year . The very fact_that Pope Paul VI chose to publish a social Encyclical in that year invites us to consider_the document in relationship to the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , which_had ended on December , . We should see something more in this than simple chronological proximity . The Encyclical Populorum Progressio presents itself , in a certain way , as a document which applies the teachings of the Council . It not_only makes continual reference to the texts of the Council , but it also flows from the same concern of the Church which inspired the whole effort of the Council and in a particular_way the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes to coordinate and develop a number of themes of her social_teaching . We can therefore affirm that the Encyclical Populorum Progressio -isaia- a kind of response to the Council s appeal with_which_the Constitution Gaudium et Spes begins : '' The joys and the hopes . the griefs and the anxieties of the people of this age , especially_those who_are poor or in any_way afflicted , these too are the joys and hopes , the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ . Indeed , nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their_hearts . '' These words express the fundamental motive inspiring the great document of the Council , which begins by noting the situation of poverty and of underdevelopment in which millions of human_beings live . This poverty and underdevelopment are , under another name , the '' griefs and the anxieties '' of today , of '' especially_those who_are poor . '' Before this vast panorama of pain and suffering , the Council wished to suggest horizons of joy and hope . The Encyclical of Paul VI has the same purpose , in full fidelity to the inspiration of the Council . There -isaia-_also the theme of the Encyclical which , in keeping_with_the great tradition of the Church s social_teaching , takes up again in a direct manner the new exposition and rich synthesis which_the Council produced , notably in the Constitution Gaudium et Spes . With regard to the content and themes once_again set_forth by the Encyclical , the following should be emphasized : the awareness of the duty of the Church , as '' an expert in humanity , '' '' to scrutinize the signs of the times and to interpret them in the light of the Gospel '' ; the awareness , equally profound , of her_mission of '' service , '' a mission distinct from the function of the State , even_when she_-isaia- concerned_with people s concrete situation '' ; the reference to the notorious inequalities in the situations of those same people ; the confirmation of the Council s teaching , a faithful echo of the centuries old tradition of the Church regarding the '' universal purpose of goods '' ; the appreciation of the culture and the technological civilization which contribute to human liberation , without failing to recognize their limits s ; finally , on the specific theme of development , which_-isaia- precisely_the theme of the Encyclical , the insistence on the '' most serious duty '' incumbent on the more developed nations '' to help the developing countries . '' The same idea of development proposed by the Encyclical flows directly from the approach which_the Pastoral Constitution takes to this problem . These and other explicit references to the Pastoral Constitution lead one to conclude that the Encyclical presents itself as an application of the Council s teaching in social matters to the specific problem of the development and the underdevelopment of peoples . This brief analysis helps us to appreciate better the originality of the Encyclical , which_can be stated in three points . The first -isaia- constituted by the very_fact of a document , issued by the highest authority of the Catholic Church and addressed both to the Church herself and '' to all people_of_good_will , '' on a matter which -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight -isaia- solely economic_and_social : the development of peoples . The term '' development '' -isaia- taken from the vocabulary of the social_and_economic sciences . From this point_of_view , the Encyclical Populorum Progressio follows directly in the line of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , which deals with the '' condition of the workers . '' Considered superficially , both themes could seem extraneous to the legitimate concern of the Church seen as a religious institution and '' development '' even_more so than the '' condition of the workers . '' In continuity with the Encyclical of Leo XIII , it must be recognized that the document of Paul VI possesses the merit of having emphasized the ethical and cultural character of the problems connected_with development , and likewise the legitimacy and necessity of the Church s intervention in this_field . In addition , the social_doctrine of the Church has once_more demonstrated its character as an application of the word of God to people s lives and the life of society , as well as to the earthly realities connected_with them , offering '' principles for reflection , '' '' criteria of judgment '' and '' directives for action . '' Here , in the document of Paul VI , one finds these three elements with a prevalently practical orientation , that_-isaia- , directed towards moral conduct . In consequence , when_the Church concerns herself with the '' development of peoples , '' she cannot be accused of going outside her_own specific field of competence and , still less , outside the mandate received_from_the Lord . The second point of originality of Populorum Progressio -isaia- shown by the breadth of outlook open to what_-isaia- commonly called the '' social_question . '' In fact , the Encyclical Mater et Magistra of Pope John XXIII had_already entered into this wider outlook , and the Council had echoed the same in the Constitution Gaudium et Spes . However , the social_teaching of the Church had not_yet reached the point of affirming with_such clarity that the social_question has acquired a worldwide dimension , nor had this affirmation and the accompanying analysis yet been_made into a '' directive for action , '' as Paul VI did in his Encyclical . Such an explicit taking up of a position offers a great wealth of content , which_it_-isaia- appropriate to point_out . In the first_place a possible misunderstanding has to be eliminated . Recognition that the '' social_question '' has assumed a worldwide dimension does_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all mean_that it has lost its incisiveness or its national and local importance . On the contrary , it means_that the problems in industrial enterprises or in the workers and union movements of a particular country or region are_not to be considered as isolated cases with no connection . On the contrary they depend more_and_more on the influence of factors beyond regional boundaries and national frontiers . Unfortunately , from the economic point_of_view , the developing countries are much_more numerous than the developed ones ; the multitudes of human_beings who lack the goods and services offered by development are much_more numerous than those_who possess them . We are therefore faced_with a serious problem of unequal distribution of the means of subsistence originally meant for everybody , and thus also an unequal distribution of the benefits deriving from them . And this happens not through the fault of the needy people , and even less through a sort of inevitability dependent on natural conditions or circumstances as a whole . The Encyclical of Paul VI , in declaring that the social_question has acquired worldwide dimensions , first of all points_out a moral fact , one_which has its foundation in an objective analysis of reality . In the words of the Encyclical itself , '' each_one must be conscious '' of this_fact , precisely_because it directly concerns the conscience , which -isaia-_the_source of moral decisions . In this framework , the originality of the Encyclical consists not_so_much in the affirmation , historical in character , of the universality of the social_question , but_rather in the moral evaluation of this reality . Therefore political leaders , and citizens of rich countries considered as individuals , especially if they_are Christians , have_the moral obligation , according to the degree of each_one s responsibility , to take_into consideration , in personal decisions and decisions of government , this relationship of universality , this interdependence which exists between their conduct and the poverty and underdevelopment of so many millions of people . Pope Paul s Encyclical translates more succinctly the moral obligation as the '' duty of solidarity '' ; and this affirmation , even_though many situations have changed in the world , has the same force and validity today as when it was written . On the other_hand , without departing from the lines of this moral vision , the originality of the Encyclical also consists in the basic insight that the very concept of development , if considered in the perspective of universal interdependence , changes notably . True development cannot consist in the simple accumulation of wealth and in the greater availability of goods and services , if this_-isaia- gained -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the development of the masses , and without due consideration for the social , cultural and spiritual dimensions of the human_being . As a third point , the Encyclical provides a very original contribution to the social_doctrine of the Church in its totality and to the very concept of development . This originality -isaia- recognizable in a phrase of the document s concluding paragraph , which_can be considered as its summary , as well as its historic label : '' Development -isaia- the new name for peace . '' In fact , if the social_question has acquired a worldwide dimension , this_-isaia- because the demand for_justice can_only be satisfied on that level . To ignore this demand could encourage the temptation among the victims of injustice to respond with violence , as happens -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of many wars . Peoples excluded from the fair distribution of the goods originally destined for all could ask themselves : why not respond with violence to those_who first treat us with violence ? And if the situation -isaia- examined in the light of the division of the world into ideological blocs a division already existing in and in the light of the subsequent economic and political repercussions and dependencies , the danger -isaia- seen to be much greater . The first consideration of the striking content of the Encyclical s historic phrase may be supplemented by a second consideration to which_the document itself alludes : how_can one justify the fact_that huge sums of money , which_could and should be used for increasing the development of peoples , are instead utilized for the enrichment of individuals or groups , or assigned to the increase of stockpiles of weapons , both in developed countries and in the developing ones , thereby upsetting the real priorities ? This -isaia- even more_serious given the difficulties which often hinder the direct transfer of capital set_aside for helping needy countries . If '' development -isaia- the new name for peace , '' war and military preparations are the major enemy of the integral development of peoples . In the light of this expression of Pope Paul VI , we are thus invited to re examine the concept of development . This of course -isaia- not limited to merely satisfying material necessities through an increase of goods , while ignoring the sufferings of the many and making the selfishness of individuals and nations the principal motivation . James pointedly reminds us : '' What causes wars , and what causes fighting among_you ? Is it not your passions that are_-atti_degli_apostoli- war in your members ? You desire and do not_have '' Js : . On the contrary , in a different world , ruled by concern_for the common_good of all humanity , or by concern_for the '' spiritual and human_development of all '' instead of by the quest for individual profit , peace would be possible as the result of a '' more_perfect justice among people . '' Also this_new element of the Encyclical has a permanent and contemporary value , in view of the modern attitude which_-isaia- so sensitive to the close link between respect for_justice and the establishment of real peace . SURVEY OF THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD . In its own_time the fundamental teaching of the Encyclical Populorum Progressio received great acclaim for its novel character . The social context in which we live today cannot be said to be completely identical to that of twenty years_ago . For this_reason , I now wish to conduct a brief review of some of the characteristics of today_s_world , in order to develop the teaching of Paul VI s Encyclical , once_again from the point_of_view of the '' development of peoples . The first fact to note -isaia- that the hopes for development , -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time so lively , today appear very far_from_being realized . In this_regard , the Encyclical had no illusions . Its language , grave and -atti_degli_apostoli- times dramatic , limited itself to stressing the seriousness of the situation and to bringing before the conscience of all the urgent obligation of contributing to its solution . In those years there_was a certain widespread optimism about the possibility of overcoming , without excessive efforts , the economic backwardness of the poorer peoples , of providing them_with infrastructures and assisting them in the process of industrialization . In that historical context , over and above the efforts of each country , the United Nations Organization promoted consecutively two decades of development . In fact , some measures , bilateral and multilateral , were taken with the aim of helping many nations , some of which_had already_been independent for some time , and others the majority being States just born from the process of decolonization . For her part , the Church felt the duty to deepen her understanding of the problems posed by the new situation , in the hope of supporting these efforts with_her religious and human inspiration in order to give_them a '' soul '' and an effective impulse . It cannot be said that_these various religious , human , economic and technical initiatives have_been in vain , for they_have succeeded in achieving certain results . But in general , taking into_account_the various factors , one_cannot deny that the present situation of the world , from the point_of_view of development , offers a rather negative impression . For this_reason , I wish to call attention to a number of general indicators , without excluding other specific ones . Without going into an analysis of figures and statistics , it -isaia- sufficient to face squarely the reality of an innumerable multitude of people children , adults and the elderly in other_words , real and unique human persons , who_are suffering under the intolerable burden of poverty . There are_many millions who_are deprived of hope due to the fact_that , in many parts_of_the_world , their situation has noticeably worsened . Before these tragedies of total indigence and need , in which so many of our_brothers_and_sisters are living , it -isaia- the Lord Jesus himself who comes to question us cf . The first negative observation to make -isaia- the persistence and often the widening of the gap between_the areas of the so called developed North and the developing South . This geographical terminology -isaia- only indicative , since one_cannot ignore the fact_that the frontiers of wealth and poverty intersect within_the societies themselves , whether developed or developing . In fact , Just as social inequalities down to the level of poverty exist in rich countries , so , in parallel fashion , in the less developed countries one often sees manifestations of selfishness and a flaunting of wealth which_-isaia- as disconcerting , as it -isaia- scandalous . The abundance of goods and services available in some parts_of_the_world , particularly in the developed North , -isaia- matched in the South by an unacceptable delay , and it -isaia- precisely in this geopolitical area that the major part of the human_race lives . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- all the various sectors the production and distribution of foodstuffs , hygiene , health and housing , availability of drinking water , working conditions especially_for women , life expectancy and other economic_and_social indicators the general picture -isaia- a disappointing one , both considered in itself and in relation to the corresponding data of the more developed countries . The word '' gap '' returns spontaneously to mind . Perhaps this_-isaia-_not the appropriate word for indicating the true reality , since it could give the impression of a stationary phenomenon . This -isaia- not the case . The pace of progress in the developed and developing countries in recent_years has differed , and this serves to widen the distances . Thus the developing countries , especially_the poorest of them , find_themselves in a situation of very serious delay . We must_also add the differences of culture and value systems between_the various population groups , differences which do not_always match the degree of economic development , but_which help to create distances . These are elements and aspects which render the social_question much_more complex , precisely_because this_question has assumed a universal dimension . As we observe the various parts_of_the_world separated by this widening gap , and note that_each of these parts seems to follow its_own path with its_own achievements , we can understand_the current usage which speaks of different worlds within our one world : the First World , the Second World , the Third World and -atti_degli_apostoli- times the Fourth World . Such expressions , which obviously do not claim to classify exhaustively all countries , are significant : they_are a sign of a widespread sense_that the unity of the world , that_-isaia- , the unity of the human_race , -isaia- seriously compromised . Such phraseology , beyond its more_or_less objective value , undoubtedly conceals a moral content , before which_the Church , which_-isaia- a '' sacrament or sign and instrument . of the unity of the whole_human_race cannot remain indifference . However , the picture just given would be incomplete if one failed to add to the '' economic_and_social indices '' of underdevelopment other indices which_are equally negative and indeed even_more disturbing , beginning with the cultural level . These are illiteracy , the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining higher education , the inability to share in the building of one_s_own nation , the various_forms of exploitation and of economic , social , political and even religious oppression of the individual and his or her rights , discrimination of every type , especially_the exceptionally odious form based on difference of race . If some of these scourges are noted with regret in areas of the more developed North , they_are undoubtedly more frequent , more lasting and more difficult to root out in the developing and less advanced countries . It should be noted_that in today_s_world , among_other rights , the right of economic initiative -isaia-_often suppressed . Yet it -isaia- a right which_-isaia- important not_only_for the individual but_also_for the common_good . Experience shows us that the denial of this right , or its limitation in the name of an alleged '' equality '' of everyone in society , diminishes , or in practice absolutely destroys the spirit of initiative , that_-isaia- to say the creative subjectivity of the citizen . As a consequence , there arises , not_so_much a true equality as a '' leveling down . '' In the place of creative initiative there appears passivity , dependence and submission to the bureaucratic apparatus which , as the only '' ordering '' and '' decision making '' body if not also the '' owner '' of the entire totality of goods and the means_of_production , puts everyone in a position of almost absolute dependence , which_-isaia- similar to the traditional dependence of the worker proletarian in capitalism . This provokes a sense of frustration or desperation and predisposes people to opt out of national life , impelling many to emigrate and also favoring a form of '' psychological '' emigration . Such a situation has its consequences also from the point_of_view of the '' rights of the individual nations . '' In fact , it often happens_that a nation -isaia- deprived of its subjectivity , that_-isaia- to say the '' sovereignty '' which_-isaia- its right , in its economic , political social and in a certain way cultural significance , since in a national community all these dimensions of life are_bound together . It must_also be restated that no social group , for example a political party , has the right to usurp the role of sole leader , since_this brings about the destruction of the true subjectivity of society and of the individual citizens , as happens in every_form of totalitarianism . In this situation the individual and the people become '' objects , '' in spite of all declarations to the contrary and verbal assurances . We should add here that in today_s_world there_are_many other_forms of poverty . For are there not certain privations or deprivations which deserve this name ? The denial or the limitation of human_rights as for example the right to religious_freedom , the right to share in the building of society , the freedom to organize and to form unions , or to take initiatives in economic matters do these not impoverish the human_person as much as , if not more_than , the deprivation of material goods ? And -isaia- development which_does_not take into_account_the full affirmation of these rights really development on the human level ? In brief , modern underdevelopment -isaia-_not_only economic but_also cultural , political and simply human , as was indicated twenty years_ago by the Encyclical Populorum Progressio . Hence -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point we have to ask ourselves if the sad reality of today might not be , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , the result of a too narrow idea of development , that_-isaia- , a mainly economic one . It should be noted_that in spite of the praiseworthy efforts made in the last two decades by the more developed or developing nations and the international organizations to find a way out of the situation , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to remedy some of its symptoms , the conditions have_become notably worse . Responsibility for_this deterioration -isaia- due to various causes . Notable among_them are undoubtedly grave instances of omissions on the part of the developing nations themselves , and especially on the part of those holding economic and political power . Nor can we pretend not to see the responsibility of the developed nations , which_have not_always , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in due measure , felt the duty to help countries separated_from the affluent world to which they_themselves belong . Moreover , one_must denounce the existence of economic , financial and social mechanisms which , although they_are manipulated by people , often function almost automatically , thus accentuating the situation of wealth for some and poverty for the rest . These mechanisms , which_are maneuvered directly or indirectly by the more developed countries , by their_very functioning favor the interests of the people manipulating them -atti_degli_apostoli- in the end they suffocate or condition the economies of the less developed countries . Later on these mechanisms will_have to be subjected to a careful analysis under the ethical moral aspect . Populorum Progressio already foresaw the possibility that under such systems the wealth of the rich would increase and the poverty of the poor would remain . A proof of this forecast has been_the appearance of the so called Fourth World . However much society worldwide shows signs of fragmentation , expressed in the conventional names First , Second , Third and even Fourth World , their interdependence remains close . When this interdependence -isaia- separated_from its ethical requirements , it has disastrous consequences for the weakest . Indeed , as a result of a sort of internal dynamic and under the impulse of mechanisms which_can only be called perverse , this interdependence triggers negative effects even in the rich countries . It -isaia- precisely within these countries that_one encounters , though on a lesser scale , the more specific manifestations of under development . Thus it should be obvious that development either becomes shared in common by every part_of_the_world or it undergoes a process of regression even in zones marked by constant progress . This tells us a great deal about the nature of authentic development : either all the nations of the world participate , or it will_not be true development . Among the specific signs of underdevelopment which increasingly affect the developed countries also , there_are two in particular that reveal a tragic situation . The first -isaia- the housing crisis . During this International Year of the Home less proclaimed by the United Nations . attention -isaia- focused on the millions of human_beings lacking adequate housing or with no housing -atti_degli_apostoli- all , in order to awaken everyone s conscience and to find a solution to this serious problem with its negative consequences for the individual , the family and society . The lack of housing -isaia- being experienced universally and -isaia- due in large measure to the growing phenomenon of urbanization . Even the most highly developed peoples present_the sad spectacle of individuals and families literally struggling to survive , without a roof over their heads or with a roof so inadequate as to constitute no roof -atti_degli_apostoli- all . The lack of housing , an extremely serious problem in itself , should be seen as a sign and summing up of a whole series of shortcomings : economic , social , cultural or simply human in nature . Given the extent of the problem , we should need little convincing of how far we are from an authentic development of peoples . Another indicator common to the vast majority of nations -isaia- the phenomenon of unemployment and underemployment . Everyone recognizes the reality and growing seriousness of this problem in the industrialized countries . While it -isaia- alarming in the developing countries , with_their high rate of population growth and their large numbers of young_people , in the countries of high economic development the sources of work seem to be shrinking , and thus_the opportunities_for employment are decreasing rather_than increasing . This phenomenon too , with its series of negative consequences for individuals and for society , ranging from humiliation to the loss of that self respect which_every man_and_woman should_have , prompts us to question seriously the type of development which_has_been followed over the past twenty years . Here the words of the Encyclical Laborem Exercens are extremely appropriate : '' It must be stressed that the constitutive element in this progress and also the most adequate way to verify it in a spirit of justice_and_peace , which_the Church proclaims and for_which she_does not_cease to pray . -isaia- the continual reappraisal of man s work , both in the aspect of its objective finality and in the aspect of the dignity of the subject of all work , that_-isaia- to say , man . '' On the other_hand , '' we cannot_fail to be struck by a disconcerting fact of immense proportions : the fact_that . there_are huge numbers of people_who_are unemployed . a fact_that without_any doubt demonstrates that both within_the individual political communities and in their relationships on the continental and world level there_-isaia- something wrong with the organization of work and employment , precisely -atti_degli_apostoli- the most critical and socially most important points . '' This second phenomenon , like the previous one , because_it_-isaia- universal in character and tends to proliferate , -isaia- a very telling negative sign of the state and the quality of the development of peoples which we see today . A third phenomenon , likewise characteristic of the most recent period , even_though it -isaia- not met with everywhere , -isaia- without_doubt equally indicative of the interdependence between developed and less developed countries . It -isaia- the question of the international debt , concerning which_the Pontifical Commission Iustitia et Pax has issued a document . At this_point one_cannot ignore the close connection_between a problem of this_kind the growing seriousness of which_was already foreseen in Populorum Progressio and the question of the development of peoples . The reason which prompted the developing peoples to accept the offer of abundantly available capital was_the hope of being able to invest it in development projects . Thus the availability of capital and the fact of accepting it as a loan can be considered a contribution to development , something desirable and legitimate in itself , even_though perhaps imprudent and occasionally hasty . Circumstances have changed , both within_the debtor nations and in the international financial market ; the instrument chosen to make a contribution to development has turned into a counterproductive mechanism . This -isaia- because the debtor nations , in order to service their debt , find_themselves obliged to export the capital needed_for improving or -atti_degli_apostoli- least maintaining their standard of living . It -isaia-_also because , for the same reason , they_are unable to obtain new and equally essential financing . Through this mechanism , the means intended for the development of peoples has turned into a brake upon development instead , and indeed in some cases has even aggravated underdevelopment . As the recent document of the Pontifical Commission Iustitia et Pax states , these observations should make us reflect on the ethical character of the interdependence of peoples . And along similar lines , they_should make us reflect on the requirements and conditions , equally inspired by ethical principles , for cooperation in development . If -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point we examine the reasons for_this serious delay in the process of development , a delay which_has occurred contrary to the indications of the Encyclical Populorum Progressio , which_had raised such_great hopes , our attention -isaia-_especially drawn to the political causes of today s situation . Faced with a combination of factors which_are undoubtedly complex , we cannot hope to achieve a comprehensive analysis here . However , we cannot ignore a striking fact about the political picture since_the Second World War , a fact which_has considerable impact on the forward movement of the development of peoples . I -amos- referring to the existence of two opposing blocs , commonly known as the East and the West . The reason_for this description -isaia- not purely political but -isaia-_also , as the expression goes , geopolitical . Each of the two blocs tends to assimilate or gather around it other countries or groups of countries , to different degrees of adherence or participation . The opposition -isaia- first of all political , inasmuch as each bloc identifies itself with a system of organizing society and exercising power which presents itself as an alternative to the other . The political opposition , in turn , takes its origin from a deeper Opposition which_-isaia- ideological in nature . In the West there exists a system which_-isaia- historically inspired by the principles of the liberal capitalism which developed with industrialization during the last century . In the East there exists a system inspired by the Marxist collectivism which sprang from an interpretation of the condition of the proletarian classes made in the light of a particular reading of history . Each of the two ideologies , on the basis of two very different visions of man and of his freedom and social role , has proposed and still promotes , on the economic level , antithetical forms of the organization of labor and of the structures of ownership , especially with_regard to the so called means_of_production . It was inevitable that by developing antagonistic systems and centers of power , each with its_own forms of propaganda and indoctrination , the ideological opposition should evolve into a growing military opposition and give rise to two blocs of armed forces , each suspicious and fearful of the other s domination . International relations , in turn , could_not fail to feel the effects of this '' logic of blocs '' and of the respective '' spheres of influence . '' The tension between_the two blocs which began -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Second World War has dominated the whole of the subsequent forty years . Sometimes it has_taken the form of '' cold war , '' sometimes of '' wars by proxy , '' through the manipulation of local conflicts , and sometimes it has kept people s minds in suspense and anguish by the threat of an open and total war . Although -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time this danger seems to have receded , yet without completely disappearing , and even_though an initial agreement has_been reached on the destruction of one type of nuclear weapon , the existence and opposition of the blocs continue to be a real and worrying fact which still colors the world picture . This happens with particularly negative effects in the international relations which concern the developing countries . For as we know_the tension between East and West -isaia- not in itself an opposition between two different levels of development but_rather between two concepts of the development of individuals and peoples both concepts being imperfect and in need of radical correction . This opposition -isaia- transferred to the developing countries themselves , and thus helps to widen the gap already existing on the economic level between North and South and which results from the distance between_the two worlds : the more developed one and the less developed one . This -isaia- one of the reasons why_the Church s social_doctrine adopts a critical attitude towards both liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism . For from the point_of_view of development the question naturally arises : in what way and to what extent are these_two systems capable of changes and updatings such as to favor or promote a true and integral development of individuals and peoples in modern society ? In fact , these changes and updatings are urgent and essential for the cause of a development common to all . Countries which_have recently achieved independence , and which_are trying to establish a cultural and political identity of their_own , and need effective and impartial aid from all the richer and more developed countries , find_themselves involved in , and sometimes overwhelmed by , ideological conflicts , which inevitably create internal divisions , to the extent in some cases of provoking full civil war . This -isaia-_also because investments and aid for development are_often diverted from their_proper purpose and used to sustain conflicts , apart_from and in opposition to the interests of the countries which ought to benefit from them . Many of these countries are becoming more_and_more aware of the danger of falling victim to a form of neocolonialism and are trying to escape from it . It -isaia- this awareness which in spite of difficulties , uncertainties and -atti_degli_apostoli- times contradictions gave rise to the International Movement of Non Aligned Nations , which , in its positive aspect , would_like to affirm in an effective way the right of every people to its_own identity , independence and security , as well as the right to share , on a basis of equality and solidarity , in the goods intended for all . In the light of these considerations , we easily arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a clearer picture of the last twenty years and a better understanding of the conflicts in the northern hemisphere , namely between East and West , as an important cause of the retardation or stagnation of the South . The developing countries , instead of becoming autonomous nations concerned_with their_own progress towards a just sharing in the goods and services meant for all , become parts of a machine , cogs on a gigantic wheel . This -isaia-_often true also in the field of social_communications , which , being run by centers mostly in the northern hemisphere , do not_always give due consideration to the priorities and problems of such countries or respect their cultural make up . They frequently impose a distorted vision of life and of man and thus fail to respond to the demands of true development . Each of the two blocs harbors in its_own way a tendency towards imperialism , as it -isaia- usually called , or towards forms of new colonialism : an easy temptation to which_they frequently succumb , as history , including recent history , teaches . It -isaia- this abnormal situation , the result of a war and of an unacceptably exaggerated concern_for security , which deadens the impulse towards united cooperation by all for the common_good of the human_race , to the detriment especially of peaceful peoples who_are impeded from their rightful access to the goods meant for all . Seen in this_way , the present division of the world_-isaia- a direct obstacle to the real transformation of the conditions of underdevelopment in the developing and less advanced countries . However , peoples do not_always resign themselves to their fate . Furthermore , the very needs of an economy stifled by military expenditure and by bureaucracy and intrinsic inefficiency now seem to favor processes which might mitigate the existing opposition and make it easier to begin a fruitful dialogue and genuine collaboration for peace . The statement in the Encyclical Populorum Progressio that the resources and investments devoted to arms production ought to be used to alleviate the misery of impoverished peoples makes more urgent the appeal to overcome the opposition between_the two blocs . Today , the reality -isaia- that_these resources are used to enable each of the two blocs to overtake the other and thus guarantee its_own security . Nations which historically , economically and politically have_the possibility of playing a leadership role are prevented by this fundamentally flawed distortion from adequately fulfilling their_duty of solidarity for the benefit of peoples which aspire to full development . It -isaia- timely to mention and it -isaia- no exaggeration the a leadership role among nations can_only be justified by the possibility and willingness to contribute widely and generously to the common_good . If a nation were to succumb more_or_less deliberately to the temptation to close in upon itself and failed to meet_the responsibilities following from its superior position in the community of nations , it would fall seriously short of its clear ethical duty . This -isaia- readily apparent in the circumstances of history , where believers discern the dispositions of Divine Providence , ready to make_use of the nations for the realization of its plans , so as to render '' vain the designs of the peoples '' cf . When the West gives the impression of abandoning itself to forms of growing and selfish isolation , and the East in its turn seems to ignore for questionable reasons its duty to cooperate in the task of alleviating human misery , then we are up against not_only a betrayal of humanity s legitimate expectations a betrayal that_-isaia- a harbinger of unforeseeable consequences but_also a real desertion of a moral obligation . If arms production -isaia- a serious disorder in the present world with_regard to true human needs and the employment of the means capable of satisfying those needs , the arms trade -isaia- equally to blame . Indeed , with reference to the latter it must be added that the moral judgment -isaia- even_more severe . As we all know , this_-isaia- a trade without frontiers capable of crossing even the barriers of the blocs . It knows how to overcome the division between East and West , and above all the one between North and South , to the point and this_-isaia- more_serious of pushing its way into the different sections which_make up the southern hemisphere . We are thus confronted with a strange phenomenon : while economic aid and development plans meet with the obstacle of insuperable ideological barriers , and with tariff and trade barriers , arms of whatever origin circulate with almost total freedom all over the world And as the recent document of the Pontifical Commission Iustitia et Pax on the international debt points_out , everyone knows that in certain cases the capital lent by the developed world has_been used in the underdeveloped world to buy weapons . If to all this we add the tremendous and universally acknowledged danger represented by atomic weapons stockpiled on an incredible scale , the logical conclusion seems to be this : in today_s_world , including the world of economics , the prevailing picture -isaia- one destined to lead us more quickly towards death rather_than one of concern_for true development which_would lead all towards a '' more_human '' life , as envisaged by the Encyclical Populorum Progressio . The consequences of this state of affairs are to be seen in the festering of a wound which typifies and reveals the imbalances and conflicts of the modern_world : the millions of refugees whom war , natural calamities , persecution and discrimination of every_kind have deprived of home , employment , family and homeland . The tragedy of these multitudes -isaia- reflected in the hopeless faces of men , women and children who_can no longer find a home in a divided and inhospitable world . Nor may we close our_eyes to another painful wound in today_s_world : the phenomenon of terrorism , understood as the intention to kill people and destroy property indiscriminately , and to create a climate of terror and insecurity , often including the taking of hostages . Even when some ideology or the desire to create a better society_-isaia- adduced as the motivation for_this inhuman behavior , acts of terrorism are never justifiable . Even less so when , as happens today , such decisions and such actions , which -atti_degli_apostoli- times lead to real massacres , and to the abduction of innocent people_who have nothing to do with the conflicts , claim to have a propaganda purpose for furthering a cause . It -isaia- still worse when_they_are an end in themselves , so that murder -isaia- committed merely for the sake of killing . In the face of such horror and suffering , the words I spoke some years_ago are_still true , and I wish to repeat them again : '' What Christianity forbids -isaia- to seek solutions . by the ways of hatred , by the murdering of defenseless people , by the methods of terrorism . At this_point something must be said about the demographic problem and the way it -isaia- spoken of today , following what Paul VI said in his Encyclicals and what I myself stated -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio . One cannot deny the existence , especially in the southern hemisphere , of a demographic problem which creates difficulties for development . One must immediately add that in the northern hemisphere the nature of this problem -isaia- reversed : here , the cause for concern -isaia- the drop in the birthrate , with repercussions on the aging of the population , unable even to renew itself biologically . In itself , this_-isaia- a phenomenon capable of hindering development . Just as it -isaia- incorrect to say that_such difficulties stem solely from demo graphic growth , neither -isaia- it proved that all demo graphic growth -isaia- incompatible with orderly development . On the other_hand , it -isaia-_very alarming to see governments in many countries launching systematic campaigns against birth , contrary not_only to the cultural and religious identity of the countries themselves but_also contrary to the nature of true development . It often happens_that these campaigns are the result of pressure and financing coming from abroad , and in some cases they_are made a condition_for the granting of financial and economic aid and assistance . In any event , there_-isaia- an absolute lack of respect_for the freedom of choice of the parties involved , men_and_women often subjected to intolerable pressures , including economic ones , in order to force them to submit to this_new form of oppression . It -isaia- the poorest populations which suffer such mistreatment , and this sometimes leads to a tendency towards a form of racism , or the promotion of certain equally racist forms of eugenics . This fact too , which deserves the most forceful condemnation , -isaia- a sign of an erroneous and perverse idea of true human_development . This mainly negative overview of the actual situation of development in the contemporary world would be incomplete without a mention of the coexistence of positive aspects . The first positive note -isaia- the full awareness among large numbers of men_and_women of their_own dignity and of that of every_human_being . This awareness -isaia- expressed , for example , in the more lively concern that human_rights should be respected , and in the more vigorous rejection of their violation . One sign of this_-isaia- the number of recently established private associations , some worldwide in membership , almost all of them devoted to monitoring with_great care and commendable objectivity what_-isaia- happening internationally in this sensitive field . At this level one_must acknowledge_the influence exercised by the Declaration of Human Rights , promulgated some forty years_ago by the United Nations Organization . Its very existence and gradual acceptance by the international community are signs of a growing awareness . The same -isaia- to be said , still in the field of human_rights , of other juridical instruments issued by the United Nations Organization or other international organizations . The awareness under discussion applies not_only to individuals but_also to nations and peoples , which , as entities having a specific cultural identity , are particularly sensitive to the preservation , free exercise and promotion of their precious heritage . At the same_time , in a world divided and beset by every type of conflict , the conviction -isaia- growing of a radical interdependence and consequently of the need_for a solidarity which_will take up interdependence and transfer it to the moral plane . Today perhaps more_than in the past , people_are realizing that_they_are linked together by a common destiny , which_-isaia- to be constructed together , if catastrophe for all -isaia- to be avoided . From the depth of anguish , fear and escapist phenomena like drugs , typical of the contemporary world , the idea -isaia- slowly emerging that the good to which_we_are all called and the happiness to which we aspire cannot be obtained without an effort and commitment on the part of all , nobody excluded , and the consequent renouncing of personal selfishness . Also to be mentioned here , as a sign of respect_for life despite all the temptations to destroy it by abortion and euthanasia -isaia- a concomitant concern_for peace , together_with an awareness_that peace_-isaia- indivisible . It -isaia- either for all or for none . It demands an ever_greater degree of rigorous respect for_justice and consequently a fair distribution of the results of true development . Among today s positive signs we must_also mention a greater realization of the limits of avail able resources , and of the need to respect the integrity and the cycles of nature and to take them into_account when planning for development , rather_than sacrificing them to certain demagogic ideas about the latter . Today this_-isaia- called ecological concern . It -isaia-_also right to acknowledge_the generous commitment of statesmen , politicians , economists , trade unionists , people of science and international officials many of them inspired by religious faith who -atti_degli_apostoli- no small personal sacrifice try to resolve the world s ills and who give of themselves in every way so as to ensure_that an ever_increasing number of people may enjoy_the benefits of peace and a quality of life worthy of the name . The great international organizations , and a number of the regional organizations , contribute to this in no small measure . Their united efforts make possible more_effective action . It -isaia-_also through these contributions that_some Third World countries , despite the burden of many negative factors , have succeeded in reaching a certain self sufficiency in food , or a degree of industrialization which_makes it possible to survive with dignity and to guarantee sources of employment for the active population . Thus , all -isaia- not negative in the contemporary world , nor could it be , for the Heavenly Father s providence lovingly watches over even our daily cares cf . Indeed , the positive values which_we_have mentioned testify to a new moral concern , particularly with_respect to the great human problems such as development and peace . This fact prompts me to turn my thoughts to the true nature of the development of peoples , along the lines of the Encyclical which_we_are commemorating , and as a mark of respect_for its teaching . AUTHENTIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT . The examination which_the Encyclical invites us to make of the contemporary world leads us to note in the first_place that development -isaia- not a straightforward process , as it were automatic and in itself limitless , as though , given certain conditions , the human_race were able to progress rapidly towards an undefined perfection of some kind . Such an idea linked to a notion of '' progress '' with philosophical connotations deriving from the Enlightenment , rather_than to the notion of '' development '' which_-isaia- used in a specifically economic_and_social sense now seems to be seriously called into doubt , particularly since_the tragic experience of the two world wars , the planned and partly achieved destruction of whole peoples , and the looming atomic peril . A naive mechanistic optimism has_been replaced by a well founded anxiety for the fate of humanity . At the same_time , however , the '' economic '' concept itself , linked to the word development , has entered into crisis . In fact there_-isaia- a better understanding today that the mere accumulation of goods and services , even_for the benefit of the majority , -isaia-_not_enough for the realization of human happiness . Nor , in consequence , does the availability of the many real benefits provided in recent_times by science and technology , including the computer sciences , bring freedom from every_form of slavery . On the contrary , the experience of recent_years shows_that unless all the considerable body of resources and potential -atti_degli_apostoli- man s disposal -isaia- guided by a moral understanding and by an orientation towards_the true good of the human_race , it easily turns against man to oppress him . A disconcerting conclusion about the most recent period should serve to enlighten us : side by side with the miseries of underdevelopment , themselves unacceptable , we find ourselves up against a form of superdevelopment , equally inadmissible . because like the former it -isaia- contrary to what_-isaia-_good and to true happiness . This super development , which consists in an excessive availability of every_kind of material goods for the benefit of certain social groups , easily makes people slaves of '' possession '' and of immediate gratification , with no other horizon than the multiplication or continual replacement of the things already owned with_others still better . This -isaia- the so called civilization of '' consumption '' or '' consumerism , '' which involves so much '' throwing away '' and '' waste . '' An object already owned but now superseded by something better -isaia- discarded , with no thought of its possible lasting value in itself , nor of some other human_being who_-isaia- poorer . All of us experience firsthand the sad effects of this blind submission to pure consumerism : in the first_place a crass materialism , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a radical dissatisfaction , because one quickly learns unless one_-isaia- shielded from the flood of publicity and the ceaseless and tempting offers of products that the more one possesses the more one wants , while deeper aspirations remain unsatisfied and perhaps even stifled . The Encyclical of Pope Paul VI pointed_out the difference , so often emphasized today , between '' having '' and '' being , '' which_had_been expressed earlier in precise words by the Second Vatican Council . To '' have '' objects and goods does_not in itself perfect the human subject , unless it contributes to the maturing and enrichment of that subject s '' being , '' that_-isaia- to say unless it contributes to the realization of the human vocation as such . Of course , the difference between '' being '' and '' having , '' the danger inherent in a mere multiplication or replacement of things possessed compared to the value of '' being , '' need not turn into a contradiction . One of the greatest injustices in the contemporary world consists precisely in this : that the ones who possess much are relatively few and those_who possess almost nothing are_many . It -isaia- the injustice of the poor distribution of the goods and services originally intended for all . This then -isaia- the picture : there_are_some people the few who possess much who_do_not really succeed in '' being '' because , through a reversal of the hierarchy of values , they_are hindered by the cult of '' having '' ; and there_are others the many who_have little or nothing who_do_not succeed in realizing their basic human vocation because_they_are deprived of essential goods . The evil does_not consist in '' having '' as such , but in possessing without regard_for the quality and the ordered hierarchy of the goods one_has . Quality and hierarchy arise from the subordination of goods and their availability to man s '' being '' and his true vocation . This shows_that although development has a necessary economic dimension , since it must supply the greatest possible number of the world s inhabitants with an availability of goods essential for them '' to be , '' it -isaia- not limited to that dimension . If it -isaia- limited to this , then it turns against those_whom it -isaia- meant to benefit . The characteristics of full development , one which_-isaia- '' more_human '' and able to sustain itself -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the true vocation of men_and_women without denying economic requirements , were described by Paul VI . Development which_-isaia-_not only economic must be measured and oriented according to the reality and vocation of man seen in his totality , namely , according_to_his interior dimension . There -isaia- no doubt_that he needs created goods and the products of industry , which_-isaia- constantly being enriched by scientific and technological progress . And the ever_greater availability of material goods not_only meets needs but_also opens new horizons . The danger of the misuse of material goods and the appearance of artificial needs should in no way hinder the regard we have for the new goods and resources placed -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal and the use we make of them . On the contrary , we must see them as a gift from God and as a response to the human vocation , which_-isaia- fully realized in Christ . However , in trying to achieve true development we must_never lose sight of that dimension which_-isaia- in the specific nature of man_,_who has_been created by God in his image_and_likeness cf . It -isaia- a bodily and a spiritual nature , symbolized in the second creation account by the two elements : the earth , from which God forms man s body , and the breath of life_which he breathes into man s nostrils cf . Thus man comes to have a certain affinity with_other creatures : he -isaia- called to use them , and to be involved with_them . As the Genesis account says cf . Gen : , he -isaia- placed in the garden with the duty of cultivating and watching over it , being superior to the other creatures placed by God under his dominion cf . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time man must remain subject to the will of God , who imposes limits upon his use and dominion over things cf . Gen : , just as he promises his mortality cf . Thus man , being the image of God , has a true affinity with_him too . On the basis of this_teaching , development cannot consist only in the use , dominion over and indiscriminate possession of created things and the products of human industry , but_rather in subordinating the possession , dominion and use to man s divine likeness and to his vocation to immortality . This -isaia- the transcendent reality of the human_being , a reality which_-isaia- seen to be shared from the beginning by a couple , a man and a woman cf . Gen : , and -isaia- therefore fundamentally social . According to Sacred Scripture therefore , the notion of development -isaia-_not_only '' lay '' or '' profane , '' but_it_-isaia- also seen to be , while having a socio economic dimension of its_own , the modern expression of an essential dimension of man s vocation . The fact -isaia- that_man was_not created , so to speak , immobile and static . The first portrayal of him , as given in the Bible , certainly presents him as a creature and image , defined in his deepest reality by the origin and affinity that constitute him . But all this plants within_the human_being man_and_woman the seed and the requirement of a special task to be accomplished by each individually and by them as a couple . The task -isaia- '' to have dominion '' over the other created beings , '' to cultivate the garden . '' This -isaia- to be accomplished within_the framework of obedience to the divine_law and therefore with_respect for the image received , the image which_-isaia- the clear foundation of the power of dominion recognized as belonging to man as the means to his perfection cf . When man disobeys God and refuses to submit to his rule , nature rebels against him and no longer recognizes him as its '' master , '' for he has tarnished the divine image in himself . The claim to ownership and use of created things remains still valid , but after sin its exercise becomes difficult and full of suffering cf . In fact , the following chapter of Genesis shows us that the descendants of Cain build '' a city , '' engage in sheep farming , practice the arts music and technical skills metallurgy ; while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time people began to '' call_upon the name of the Lord '' cf . The story of the human_race described by Sacred Scripture -isaia- , even after_the fall_into sin , a story of constant achievements , which , although always called into question and threatened by sin , are nonetheless repeated , increased and extended in response to the divine vocation given from the beginning to man and to woman cf . Gen : and inscribed in the image which_they received . It -isaia- logical to conclude , -atti_degli_apostoli- least on the part of those who_believe in the word of God , that today s '' development '' -isaia- to be seen as a moment in the story which began -atti_degli_apostoli- creation , a story which_-isaia- constantly endangered by reason of infidelity to the Creator s will , and especially by the temptation to idolatry . But this '' development '' fundamentally corresponds to the first premises . Anyone wishing to renounce the difficult yet noble task of improving the lot of man in his totality , and of all people , with the excuse that the struggle -isaia- difficult and that constant effort -isaia- required , or simply because of the experience of defeat and the need to begin again , that person would be betraying the will of God the Creator . In this_regard , in the Encyclical Laborem Exercens I referred to man s vocation to work , in order to emphasize the idea that_it_-isaia- always man who_-isaia- the protagonist of development . Indeed , the Lord Jesus himself , in the parable of the talents , emphasizes the severe treatment given to the man_who dared to hide the gift received : '' You wicked slothful servant ! You knew that I reap where I have_not sowed and gather where I have_not winnowed ? . So take the talent from him , and give it to him_who has the ten talents '' Mt : . It falls to us , who receive the gifts of God in order to make_them fruitful , to '' sow '' and '' reap . '' If we do not , even what_we_have will be taken away from us . A deeper study of these harsh words will_make us commit ourselves more resolutely to the duty , which_-isaia- urgent for everyone today , to work together for the full development of others : '' development of the whole human_being and of all people . Faith in Christ the Redeemer , while it illuminates from within_the nature of development , also guides us in the task of collaboration . Paul to the Colossians , we read that Christ -isaia- '' the first born of all creation , '' and that '' all things were created through_him '' and for him : . In fact , '' all things hold together in him , '' since '' in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell , and through_him to reconcile to himself all things '' v . A part of this_divine plan , which begins from eternity in Christ , the perfect '' image '' of the Father , and which culminates in him , '' the firstborn from the dead '' v . , -isaia-_our own history , marked by our personal and collective effort to raise up the human condition and to overcome the obstacles which_are continually arising along our way . It thus prepares us to share in the fullness which '' dwells in the Lord '' and which he communicates '' to his_body , which_-isaia- the Church '' v . At the same_time sin , which_-isaia- always attempting to trap us and which jeopardizes our human achievements , -isaia- conquered and redeemed by the '' reconciliation '' accomplished by Christ cf . Here the perspectives widen . The dream of '' unlimited progress '' reappears , radically transformed by the new outlook created by Christian faith , assuring us that progress -isaia- possible only_because God the Father has decided from the beginning to make man a sharer of his glory in Jesus Christ risen from the dead , in whom '' we have redemption through_his blood . the forgiveness of our trespasses '' Eph : . In him God wished to conquer sin and make it serve our greater good , which infinitely surpasses what progress could achieve . We can say therefore as we struggle amidst the obscurities and deficiencies of underdevelopment and superdevelopment that_one day this corruptible body will put on incorruptibility , this mortal body immortality cf . Cor : , when_the Lord '' delivers the Kingdom to God the Father '' v . and all the works and actions that_are worthy of man will be redeemed . Furthermore , the concept of faith makes quite clear the reasons which impel the Church to concern herself with the problems of development , to consider them a duty of her pastoral_ministry , and to urge all to think about the nature and characteristics of authentic human_development . Through her commitment she desires , on the one_hand , to place herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the divine plan which_-isaia- meant to order all things to the fullness which dwells in Christ cf . Col : and which he communicated to his_body ; and on the other_hand she desires to respond to her fundamental vocation of being a '' sacrament , '' that_-isaia- to say '' a sign and instrument of intimate_union with God and of the unity of the whole_human_race . '' Some Fathers of the Church were inspired by this idea to develop in original ways a concept of the meaning of history and of human_work , directed towards a goal which surpasses this meaning and which_-isaia- always defined by its relationship to the work of Christ . In other_words , one can_find in the teaching of the Fathers an optimistic vision of history and work , that_-isaia- to say of the perennial value of authentic human achievements , inasmuch as they_are redeemed by Christ and destined for the promised Kingdom . Thus , part of the teaching and most ancient practice of the Church -isaia- her conviction_that she_-isaia- obliged by her vocation she herself , her ministers and each of her members to relieve the misery of the suffering , both far and near , not_only out of her '' abundance '' but_also out of her '' necessities . '' Faced by cases of need , one_cannot ignore them in favor of superfluous church ornaments and costly furnishings for divine_worship ; on the contrary it could be obligatory to sell these goods in order to provide food , drink , clothing and shelter for those_who lack these_things . As has_been already noted , here we are shown a '' hierarchy of values '' in the framework of the right to property between '' having '' and '' being , '' especially_when the '' having '' of a few can be to the detriment of the '' being '' of many_others . In his Encyclical Pope Paul VI stands in the line of this_teaching , taking his inspiration from the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes . For my own part , I wish to insist once_more on the seriousness and urgency of that teaching , and I ask the Lord to give all Christians the strength to put it faithfully into_practice . The obligation to commit oneself to the development of peoples -isaia- not_just an individual duty , and still less an individualistic one , as if it were possible to achieve this development through the isolated efforts of each_individual . It -isaia- an imperative which obliges each_and_every man_and_woman , as well as societies and nations . In particular , it obliges the Catholic Church and the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , with which_we_are completely willing to collaborate in this_field . In this_sense , just as we Catholics invite our Christian brethren to share in our initiatives , so too we declare that_we_are ready to collaborate in theirs , and we welcome the invitations presented to us . In this pursuit of integral human_development we can_also do much with the members of other_religions , as in fact -isaia- being done in various places . Collaboration in the development of the whole person and of every_human_being -isaia-_in_fact a duty of all towards all , and must be shared by the four parts_of_the_world : East and West , North and South ; or , as we say today , by the different '' worlds . '' If , on the contrary , people try to achieve it in only_one part , or in only_one world , they do so -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the others ; and , precisely_because the others are ignored , their_own development becomes exaggerated and misdirected . Peoples or nations too have a right to their_own full development , which while including as already said the economic_and_social aspects , should_also include individual cultural identity and openness to the transcendent . Not even the need_for development can be used as an excuse for imposing on others one_s_own way_of_life or own religious belief . Nor would a type of development which did_not respect and promote human_rights personal and social , economic and political , including the rights of nations and of peoples be really worthy of man . Today , perhaps more_than in the past , the intrinsic contradiction of a development limited only to its economic element -isaia- seen more_clearly . Such development easily subjects the human_person and his deepest needs to the demands of economic planning and selfish profit . The intrinsic connection_between authentic development and respect_for human_rights once_again reveals the moral character of development : the true elevation of man , in conformity_with_the natural and historical vocation of each_individual , -isaia- not attained only by exploiting the abundance of goods and services , or by having available perfect infrastructures . When individuals and communities do not see a rigorous respect_for the moral , cultural and spiritual requirements , based on the dignity of the person and on the proper identity of each community , beginning with the family and religious societies , then all the rest availability of goods , abundance of technical resources applied to daily_life , a certain level of material well_being will prove unsatisfying and in the end contemptible . The Lord clearly says this in the Gospel , when he calls the attention of all to the true hierarchy of values : '' For what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole_world and forfeits his_life ? '' Mt : True development , in keeping_with_the specific needs of the human_being man or woman , child , adult or old person implies , especially_for those_who actively share in this_process and are responsible_for it , a lively awareness of the value of the rights of all and of each_person . It likewise implies a lively awareness of the need to respect the right of every_individual to the full use of the benefits offered by science and technology . On the internal level of every nation , respect_for all rights takes on great_importance , especially : the right to life -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of its existence ; the rights of the family , as the basic social community , or '' cell of society '' ; justice in employment relationships ; the rights inherent in the life of the political community as such ; the rights based on the transcendent vocation of the human_being , beginning with the right of freedom to profess and practice one_s_own religious belief . On the international level , that_-isaia- , the level of relations_between States or , in present_day usage , between_the different '' worlds , '' there_must be complete respect_for the identity of each people , with its_own historical and cultural characteristics . It -isaia- likewise essential , as the Encyclical Populorum Progressio already asked , to recognize each people s equal right '' to be seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the common banquet , '' instead of lying outside the door like Lazarus , while '' the dogs come and lick his sores '' cf . Both peoples and individual must enjoy_the fundamental equality which_-isaia- the basis , for example , of the Charter of the United Nations Organization : the equality which_-isaia- the basis of the right of all to share in the process of full development . In order to be genuine , development must be achieved within_the framework of solidarity and freedom , without ever sacrificing either of them under whatever pretext . The moral character of development and its necessary promotion are emphasized when_the most rigorous respect -isaia- given to all the demands deriving from the order of truth and good proper to the human_person . Furthermore the Christian who_-isaia- taught to see_that man_-isaia- the image of God , called to share in the truth and the good which_-isaia- God himself , does_not understand a commitment to development and its application which excludes regard and respect_for the unique dignity of this '' image . '' In other_words , true development must be based on the love of God and neighbor , and must help to promote the relationships between individuals and society . This -isaia- the '' civilization of love '' of which Paul VI often spoke . Nor can the moral character of development exclude respect_for the beings which constitute the natural world , which_the ancient Greeks alluding precisely to the order which distinguishes it called the '' cosmos . '' Such realities also demand respect , by virtue of a threefold consideration which_it_-isaia- useful to reflect upon carefully . The first consideration -isaia- the appropriateness of acquiring a growing awareness of the fact_that one_cannot use with impunity the different categories of beings , whether living or inanimate animals , plants , the natural elements simply as one wishes , according to one_s_own economic needs . On the contrary , one must_take into_account_the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system , which_-isaia- precisely_the cosmos . '' The second consideration -isaia- based on the realization which_-isaia- perhaps more urgent that natural resources are limited ; some are_not , as it -isaia- said , renewable . Using them as if they_were inexhaustible , with absolute dominion , seriously endangers their availability not_only_for the present generation but_above all for generations to come . The third consideration refers directly to the consequences of a certain type of development on the quality of life in the industrialized zones . We all know_that the direct or indirect result of industrialization -isaia- , ever_more frequently , the pollution of the environment , with serious consequences for the health of the population . Once again it -isaia- evident_that development , the planning which governs it , and the way_in_which resources are used must include respect_for moral demands . One of the latter undoubtedly imposes limits on the use of the natural world . The dominion granted to man by the Creator -isaia- not an absolute power , nor_can one speak of a freedom to '' use and misuse , '' or to dispose of things as one pleases . The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator himself and expressed symbolically by the prohibition not to '' eat of the fruit of the tree '' cf . Gen : shows clearly enough that , when it comes to the natural world , we are subject not_only to biological laws but_also to moral ones , which_cannot be violated with impunity . A true concept of development cannot ignore the use of the elements of nature , the renewability of resources and the consequences of haphazard industrialization three considerations which alert our consciences to the moral dimension of development . A THEOLOGICAL READING OF MODERN PROBLEMS . Precisely because of the essentially moral character of development , it -isaia- clear_that the obstacles to development likewise have a moral character . If in the years since_the publication of Pope Paul s Encyclical there_has been no development or very little , irregular , or even contradictory development the reasons are not_only economic . As has_already_been said , political motives also enter in . For the decisions which either accelerate or slow down the development of peoples are really political in character . In order to overcome the misguided mechanisms mentioned earlier and to replace them_with new ones which_will be more just and in conformity_with_the common_good of humanity , an effective political will -isaia- needed . Unfortunately , after analyzing the situation we have to conclude that_this political will has_been insufficient . In a document of a pastoral nature such as this , an analysis limited exclusively to the economic and political causes of underdevelopment and , mutatis mutandis , of so called superdevelopment would be incomplete . It -isaia- therefore necessary to single out the moral causes which , with_respect to the behavior of individuals considered as responsible persons , interfere in such_a_way as to slow down the course of development and hinder its_full achievement . Similarly , when_the scientific and technical resources are available which , with the necessary concrete political decisions , ought to help lead peoples to true development , the main obstacles to development will be overcome only by means of essentially moral decisions . For believers , and especially_for Christians , these decisions will_take their inspiration from the principles of faith , with the help of divine_grace . It -isaia- important to note therefore that a world which_-isaia- divided into blocs , sustained by rigid ideologies , and in which instead of interdependence and solidarity different_forms of imperialism hold sway , can_only be a world subject to structures of sin . The sum total of the negative factors working against a true awareness of the universal common_good , and the need to further it , gives the impression of creating , in persons and institutions , an obstacle which_-isaia- difficult to overcome . If the present situation can be attributed to difficulties of various kinds , it -isaia- not out of place to speak of '' structures of sin , '' which , as I stated in my Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia , are rooted in personal sin , and thus always linked to the concrete acts of individuals who introduce these structures , consolidate them and make_them difficult to remove . And thus they grow stronger , spread , and become the source of other sins , and so influence people s behavior . '' Sin '' and '' structures of sin '' are categories which_are seldom applied to the situation of the contemporary world . However , one_cannot easily gain a profound understanding of the reality that confronts us unless we give a name to the root of the evils which afflict us . One can certainly speak of '' selfishness '' and of '' shortsightedness , '' of '' mistaken political calculations '' and '' imprudent economic decisions . '' And in each of these evaluations one hears an echo of an ethical and moral nature . Man s condition -isaia- such that a more profound analysis of individuals actions and omissions cannot be achieved without implying , in one way or another , judgments or references of an ethical nature . This evaluation -isaia- in itself positive , especially if it -isaia- completely consistent and if it -isaia- based on faith in God and on his law , which commands what_-isaia-_good and forbids evil . In this consists the difference between sociopolitical analysis and formal reference to '' sin '' and the '' structures of sin . '' According to this latter viewpoint , there enter in the will of the Triune God , his plan for_humanity , his justice and his_mercy . The God who_-isaia- rich in mercy , the Redeemer of man , the Lord and giver of life , requires from people clear cut attitudes which express themselves also in actions or omissions toward one s neighbor . We have here a reference to the '' second tablet '' of the Ten Commandments cf . Not to observe these -isaia- to offend God and hurt one s neighbor , and to introduce into_the_world influences and obstacles which go far beyond_the actions and brief life span of an individual . This also involves interference in the process of the development of peoples , the delay or slowness of which_must be judged also in this light . This general analysis , which_-isaia- religious in nature , can be supplemented by a number of particular considerations to demonstrate that among the actions and attitudes opposed to the will of God , the good of neighbor and the '' structures '' created by them , two are_very typical : on the one_hand , the all consuming desire_for profit , and on the other , the thirst_for power , with the intention of imposing one s will upon others . In order to characterize better each of these attitudes , one_can add the expression : '' -atti_degli_apostoli- any price . '' In other_words , we are faced_with the absolutizing of human attitudes with all its possible consequences . Since these attitudes can exist independently of each_other , they_can be separated ; however in today_s_world both are indissolubly united , with one or the other predominating . Obviously , not_only individuals fall victim to this double attitude of sin ; nations and blocs can do so too . And this favors even_more the introduction of the '' structures of sin '' of which I have spoken . If certain forms of modern '' imperialism '' were considered in the light of these moral criteria , we would see_that hidden behind certain decisions , apparently inspired only by economics or politics , are real forms of idolatry : of money , ideology , class , technology . I have wished to introduce this type of analysis above all in order to point_out the true nature of the evil which faces us with_respect to the development of peoples : it -isaia-_a_question of a moral evil , the fruit of many sins which lead to '' structures of sin . '' To diagnose the evil in this_way -isaia- to identify precisely , on the level of human conduct , the path to be followed in order to overcome it . This path -isaia- long and complex , and what_-isaia- more it -isaia- constantly threatened because of the intrinsic frailty of human resolutions and achievements , and because of the mutability of very unpredictable and external circumstances . Nevertheless , one must_have the courage to set_out on this path , and , where some steps have_been taken or a part of the journey made , the courage to go on to the end . In the context of these reflections , the decision to set_out or to continue the journey involves , above all , a moral value which men_and_women of faith recognize as a demand of God s will , the only true foundation of an absolutely binding ethic . One would hope_that also men_and_women without an explicit faith would be convinced_that the obstacles to integral development are not_only economic but rest on more profound attitudes which human_beings can_make into absolute values . Thus one would hope_that all those_who , to some degree or other , are responsible_for ensuring a '' more human_life '' for their fellow human_beings , whether or not they_are inspired by a religious faith , will_become fully aware of the urgent_need to change the spiritual attitudes which define each_individual s relationship_with self , with neighbor , with even the remotest human communities , and with nature itself ; and all of this in view of higher values such as the common_good or , to quote the felicitous expression of the Encyclical Populorum Progressio , the full development '' of the whole individual and of all people . '' For Christians , as for all who recognize_the precise theological meaning of the word '' sin , '' a change of behavior or mentality or mode of existence -isaia- called '' conversion , '' to use the language of the Rihle cf . This conversion specifically entails a relationship to God , to the sin committed , to its consequences and hence to one s neighbor , either an individual or a community . It -isaia- God , in '' whose hands are the hearts of the powerful '' and the hearts of all , who according his_own promise and by the power of his Spirit can transform '' hearts of stone '' into '' hearts of flesh '' cf . On the path toward_the desired conversion , toward_the overcoming of the moral obstacles to development , it -isaia-_already possible to point to the positive and moral value of the growing awareness of interdependence among individuals and nations . The fact_that men_and_women in various parts_of_the_world feel personally affected by the injustices and violations of human_rights committed in distant countries , countries which perhaps they will_never visit , -isaia- a further sign of a reality transformed into awareness , thus acquiring a moral connotation . It -isaia- above all a question of interdependence , sensed as a system determining relationships in the contemporary world , in its economic , cultural , political and religious elements , and accepted as a moral category . When interdependence becomes recognized in this_way , the correlative response as a moral and social attitude , as a '' virtue , '' -isaia- solidarity . This then -isaia- not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow distress -atti_degli_apostoli- the misfortunes of so many_people , both near and far . On the contrary , it -isaia- a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common_good ; that_-isaia- to say to the good of all and of each_individual , because we are all really responsible_for all . This determination -isaia- based on the solid conviction_that what_-isaia- hindering full development -isaia- that desire_for profit and that thirst_for power already mentioned . These attitudes and '' structures of sin '' are only conquered presupposing the help of divine_grace by a diametrically opposed attitude : a commitment to the good of one s neighbor with the readiness , in the gospel sense , to '' lose oneself '' for the sake of the other instead of exploiting him , and to '' serve him '' instead of oppressing him for one_s_own advantage cf . The exercise of solidarity within each society_-isaia- valid when its_members recognize one_another as persons . Those who are_more influential , because_they have a greater share of goods and common services , should feel responsible_for the weaker and be ready to share_with them all they possess . Those who_are weaker , for their_part , in the same_spirit of solidarity , should_not adopt a purely passive attitude or one that_-isaia- destructive of the social fabric , but , while claiming their legitimate rights , should do what_they can for the good of all . The intermediate groups , in their turn , should_not selfishly insist on their particular interests , but respect the interests of others . Positive signs in the contemporary world are the growing awareness of the solidarity of the poor among_themselves , their_efforts to support one_another , and their public demonstrations on the social scene which , without recourse to violence , present their_own needs and rights in the face of the inefficiency or corruption of the public_authorities . By virtue of her_own evangelical duty the Church feels called to take her stand beside the poor , to discern the justice of their requests , and to help satisfy them , without losing sight of the good of groups in the context of the common_good . The same criterion -isaia- applied by analogy in international relationships . Interdependence must be transformed into solidarity , based upon the principle that the goods of creation are meant for all . That which human industry produces through the processing of raw materials , with the contribution of work , must serve equally for the good of all . Surmounting every type of imperialism and determination to preserve their_own hegemony , the stronger and richer nations must_have a sense of moral responsibility_for the other nations , so that a real international system may be established which_will rest on the foundation of the equality of all peoples and on the necessary respect_for their legitimate differences . The economically weaker countries , or those still -atti_degli_apostoli- subsistence level , must be enabled , with the assistance of other peoples and of the international community , to make a contribution of their_own to the common_good with_their treasures of humanity and culture , which otherwise would be lost for ever . Solidarity helps us to see the '' other '' whether a person , people or nation not_just as some kind of instrument , with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited -atti_degli_apostoli- low cost and then discarded when no longer useful , but as our '' neighbor , '' a '' helper '' cf . Gen : , to be made a sharer , on a par with ourselves , in the banquet of life to which all are equally invited by God . Hence the importance of reawakening the religious awareness of individuals and peoples . Thus the exploitation , oppression and annihilation of others are excluded . These facts , in the present division of the world into opposing blocs , combine to produce the danger of war and an excessive preoccupation with personal security , often to the detriment of the autonomy , freedom of decision , and even the territorial integrity of the weaker nations situated within_the so called '' areas of influence '' or '' safety belts . '' The '' structures of sin '' and the sins which_they produce are likewise radically opposed to peace and development , for development , in the familiar expression Pope Paul s Encyclical , -isaia- '' the new name for peace . '' In this_way , the solidarity which we propose -isaia- the path to peace and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to development . For world peace_-isaia- inconceivable unless the world s leaders come to recognize_that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs , the sacrifice of all forms of economic , military or political imperialism , and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration . This -isaia- precisely_the act proper to solidarity among individuals and nations . The motto of the pontificate of my esteemed predecessor Pius XII was Opus iustitiae pax , peace as the fruit of justice . Today one could say , with the same exactness and the same power of biblical inspiration cf . Is : ; Jas : : Opus solidaritatis pax , peace as the fruit of solidarity . The goal of peace , so desired by everyone , will certainly be achieved through the putting into_effect of social and international justice , but_also through the practice of the virtues which favor togetherness , and which teach us to live in unity , so as to build in unity , by giving and receiving , a new society and a better world . Solidarity -isaia- undoubtedly a Christian virtue . In what_has_been said so far it has_been possible to identify many points of contact between solidarity and charity , which_-isaia- the distinguishing mark of Christ s disciples cf . In the light_of_faith , solidarity seeks to go beyond itself , to take on the specifically Christian dimension of total gratuity , forgiveness and reconciliation . One s neighbor -isaia- then not_only a human_being with_his or her_own rights and a fundamental equality with everyone else , but becomes_the living image of God the Father , redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and placed under the permanent action of the Holy Spirit . One s neighbor must_therefore be loved , even if an enemy , with the same love with_which_the Lord loves him or her ; and for that person s sake one_must be ready for sacrifice , even the ultimate one : to lay_down one s life_for the brethren cf . At that point , awareness of the common fatherhood of God , of the brotherhood of all in Christ '' children in the Son '' and of the presence and life_giving action of the Holy Spirit will_bring to our vision of the world a new criterion for interpreting it . Beyond human and natural bonds , already so close and strong , there_-isaia- discerned in the light_of_faith a new model of the unity of the human_race , which_must ultimately inspire our solidarity . This supreme model of unity , which_-isaia- a reflection of the intimate life of God , one God in three Persons , -isaia- what we Christians mean by the word '' communion . '' This specifically Christian communion , jealously preserved , extended and enriched with the Lord s help , -isaia- the soul of the Church s vocation to be a '' sacrament , '' in the sense already indicated . Solidarity therefore must play its part in the realization of this_divine plan , both on the level of individuals and on the level of national and international society . The '' evil mechanisms '' and '' structures of sin '' of which_we_have spoken can be overcome only through the exercise of the human and Christian solidarity to which_the Church calls us and which_she tirelessly promotes . Only in this_way can such positive energies be fully released for the benefit of development and peace . Many of the Church s canonized saints offer a wonderful witness of such solidarity and can serve as examples in the present difficult circumstances . Among them I wish to recall St . Peter Claver and his service to the slaves -atti_degli_apostoli- Cartagena de Indias , and St . Maximilian Maria Kolbe who offered his_life in place of a prisoner unknown to him in the concentration camp -atti_degli_apostoli- Auschwitz . SOME PARTICULAR GUIDELINES . The Church does_not have technical revolutions to offer for the problem of underdevelopment as such , as Pope Paul VI already affirmed in his Encyclical . For the Church does_not propose economic and political systems or programs , nor_does she show preference for one or the other , provided_that human_dignity -isaia- properly respected and promoted , and provided she herself -isaia- allowed the room she needs to exercise her ministry in the world . But the Church -isaia- an '' expert in humanity , '' and this leads her necessarily to extend her religious mission to the various fields in which men_and_women expend their_efforts in search of the always relative happiness which_-isaia- possible in this_world , in line with their_dignity as persons . Following the example of my predecessors , I must repeat that whatever affects the dignity of individuals and peoples , such as authentic development , cannot be reduced to a '' technical '' problem . If reduced in this_way , development would be emptied of its true content , and this_would be an act of betrayal of the individuals and peoples whom development -isaia- meant to serve . This -isaia- why_the Church has something to say today , just as twenty years_ago , and also in the future , about the nature , conditions , requirements and aims of authentic development , and also about the obstacles which stand in its way . In doing so the Church fulfills her_mission to evangelize , for she offers her first contribution to the solution of the urgent problem of development when_she proclaims_the truth_about Christ , about herself and about man , applying this_truth to a concrete situation . As her instrument for reaching this goal , the Church uses her social_doctrine . In today s difficult situation , a more exact awareness and a wider diffusion of the '' set of principles for reflection , criteria for judgment and directives for action '' proposed by the Church s teaching would be of great help in promoting both the correct definition of the problems being faced and the best solution to them . It will thus be seen -atti_degli_apostoli- once that the questions facing us are above all moral questions ; and that neither the analysis of the problem of development as such nor the means to overcome the present difficulties can ignore this essential dimension . The Church s social_doctrine -isaia- not a '' third way '' between liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism , nor even a possible alternative to other solutions less radically opposed to one_another : rather , it constitutes a category of its_own . Nor -isaia- it an ideology , but_rather the accurate formulation of the results of a careful reflection on the complex realities of human_existence , in society and in the international order , in the light_of_faith and of the Church s tradition . Its main aim -isaia- to interpret these realities , determining their conformity_with or divergence from the lines of the Gospel teaching on man and his vocation , a vocation which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once earthly and transcendent ; its aim -isaia- thus to guide Christian behavior . It therefore belongs to the field , not of ideology , but of theology and particularly of moral theology . The teaching and spreading of her social_doctrine are part of the Church s evangelizing mission . And since_it_-isaia- a doctrine aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- guiding people s behavior , it consequently gives_rise to a '' commitment to justice , '' according to each_individual s role , vocation and circumstances . The condemnation of evils and injustices -isaia-_also part of that ministry of evangelization in the social field which_-isaia- an aspect of the Church s prophetic role . But it should be made clear_that proclamation -isaia- always more_important than condemnation , and the latter cannot ignore the former , which_gives it true solidity and the force of higher motivation . Today more_than in the past , the Church s social_doctrine must be open to an international outlook , in line with the Second Vatican Council , the most recent Encyclicals , and particularly in line with the Encyclical which_we_are commemorating . It will_not be superfluous therefore to reexamine and further clarify in this light the characteristic themes and guidelines dealt_with by the Magisterium in recent_years . Here I would_like to indicate one of them : the option or love of preference for the poor . This -isaia- an option , or a special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity , to which_the whole tradition of the Church bears_witness . It affects the life of each Christian inasmuch as he or she seeks to imitate the life of Christ , but it applies equally to our social responsibilities and hence to our manner of living , and to the logical decisions to be made concerning the ownership and use of goods . Today , furthermore , given the worldwide dimension which_the social_question has assumed , this_love of preference for the poor , and the decisions which it inspires in us , cannot_but embrace the immense multitudes of the hungry , the needy , the homeless , those without medical care and , above all , those without hope of a better future . It -isaia- impossible not to take account of the existence of these realities . To ignore them would mean becoming like the '' rich man '' who pretended not to know_the beggar Lazarus lying -atti_degli_apostoli- his gate cf . Our daily_life as well as our decisions in the political and economic fields must be marked by these realities . Likewise the leaders of nations and the heads of international bodies , while they_are obliged always to keep in mind the true human dimension as a priority in their development plans , should_not forget to give precedence to the phenomenon of growing poverty . Unfortunately , instead of becoming fewer the poor are becoming more numerous , not_only in less developed countries but and this seems no less scandalous in the more developed ones too . It -isaia- necessary to state once_more the characteristic principle of Christian social_doctrine : the goods of this_world are originally meant for all . The right to private_property -isaia- valid and necessary , but it does_not nullify the value of this principle . Private property , in fact , -isaia- under a '' social mortgage , '' which means_that it has an intrinsically social function , based upon and justified precisely by the principle of the universal destination of goods . Likewise , in this concern_for the poor , one must_not overlook that special form of poverty which consists in being deprived of fundamental human_rights , in particular the right to religious_freedom and also the right to freedom of economic initiative . The motivating concern_for the poor who_are , in the very meaningful term , '' the Lord s poor '' must be translated -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels into concrete actions , until it decisively attains a series of necessary reforms . Each local situation will show what reforms are_most urgent and how they_can be achieved . But those demanded by the situation of international imbalance , as already described , must_not be forgotten . In this respect I wish to mention specifically : the reform of the international trade system , which_-isaia- mortgaged to protectionism and increasing bilateralism ; the reform of the world monetary and financial system , today recognized as inadequate ; the question of technological exchanges and their_proper use ; the need_for a review of the structure of the existing international organizations , in the framework of an international juridical order . The international trade system today frequently discriminates against the products of the young industries of the developing countries and discourages the producers of raw materials . There exists , too , a kind of international division of labor , whereby_the low cost products of certain countries which lack effective labor laws or which_are too weak to apply them are sold in other parts_of_the_world -atti_degli_apostoli- considerable profit for the companies engaged in this form of production , which knows no frontiers . The world monetary and financial system -isaia- marked by an excessive fluctuation of exchange rates and interest rates , to the detriment of the balance of payments and the debt situation of the poorer countries . Forms of technology and their transfer constitute today one of the major problems of international exchange and of the grave damage deriving therefrom . There are quite frequent cases of developing countries being denied needed forms of technology or sent useless ones . In the opinion of many , the international organizations seem to be -atti_degli_apostoli- a stage of their existence when their operating methods , operating costs and effectiveness need careful review and possible correction . Obviously , such a delicate process cannot be put into_effect without_the collaboration of all . This presupposes the overcoming of political rivalries and the renouncing of all desire to manipulate these organizations , which exist solely for the common_good . The existing institutions and organizations have worked well for the benefit of peoples . Nevertheless , humanity today -isaia- in a new and more difficult phase of its genuine development . It needs a greater degree of international ordering , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the societies , economies and cultures of the whole_world . Development demands above all a spirit of initiative on the part of the countries which need it . Each of them must act in accordance_with its_own responsibilities , not expecting everything from the more favored countries , and acting in collaboration with_others in the same situation . Each must discover and use to the best advantage its_own area of freedom . Each must make itself capable of initiatives responding to its_own needs as a society . Each must likewise realize its true needs , as well as the rights_and_duties which oblige it to respond to them . The development of peoples begins and -isaia- most appropriately accomplished in the dedication of each people to its_own development , in collaboration with_others . It -isaia- important then that as far_as_possible the developing nations themselves should favor the self affirmation of each citizen , through access to a wider culture and a free flow of information . Whatever promotes literacy and the basic education which completes and deepens it -isaia- a direct contribution to true development , as the Encyclical Populorum Progressio proposed . These goals are_still far_from_being reached in so many parts_of_the_world . In order to take this path , the nations themselves will_have to identify their_own priorities and clearly recognize their_own needs , according to the particular conditions of their_people , their geographical setting and their cultural traditions . Some nations will_have to increase food production , in order to have_always available what_-isaia- needed_for subsistence and daily_life . In the modern_world where starvation claims so many victims , especially among the very young there_are examples of not particularly developed nations which_have nevertheless achieved the goal of food self sufficiency and have even become food exporters . Other nations need to reform certain unjust structures , and in particular their political institutions , in order to replace corrupt , dictatorial and authoritarian forms of government by democratic and participatory ones . This -isaia- a process which we hope will spread and grow stronger . For the '' health '' of a political community as expressed in the free and responsible participation of all citizens in public affairs , in the rule of law and in respect_for the promotion of human_rights -isaia- the necessary condition and sure guarantee of the development of '' the whole individual and of all people . None of what_has_been said can be achieved without_the collaboration of all especially_the international community in the framework of a solidarity which includes everyone , beginning with the most neglected . But the developing nations themselves have_the duty to practice solidarity among_themselves and with the neediest countries of the world . It -isaia- desirable , for example , that nations of the some geographical area should establish forms of cooperation which_will make_them less dependent on more powerful producers ; they_should open their frontiers to the products of the area ; they_should examine how their products might complement one_another ; they_should combine in order to set up those services which_each one separately -isaia- incapable of providing ; they_should extend cooperation to the monetary and financial sector . Interdependence -isaia-_already a reality in many of these countries . To acknowledge it , in such_a_way as to make it more operative , represents an alternative to excessive dependence on richer and more powerful nations , as part of the hoped for development , without opposing anyone , but discovering and making best use of the country s own potential . The developing countries belonging to one geographical area , especially_those included in the term '' South , '' can and ought to set up new regional organizations inspired by criteria of equality , freedom and participation in the comity of nations as -isaia-_already happening with promising results . An essential condition_for global solidarity -isaia- autonomy and free self determination , also within associations such as those indicated . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time solidarity demands a readiness to accept the sacrifices necessary_for the good of the whole_world community . Peoples and individuals aspire to be free : their search_for full development signals their desire to overcome the many obstacles preventing them_from enjoying a '' more human_life . '' Recently , in the period following the publication of the encyclical Populorum Progressio , a new_way of confronting the problems of poverty and underdevelopment has spread in some areas of the world , especially in Latin America . This approach makes liberation the fundamental category and the first principle of action . The positive values , as well as the deviations and risks of deviation , which_are damaging to the faith and are connected_with this form of theological reflection and method , have_been appropriately pointed_out by the Church s Magisterium . It -isaia- fitting to add that the aspiration to freedom from all forms of slavery affecting the individual and society_-isaia- something noble and legitimate . This in fact -isaia- the purpose of development , or rather liberation and development , taking into_account_the intimate connection_between the two . Development which_-isaia- merely economic -isaia- incapable of setting man free , on the contrary , it will end by enslaving him further . Development that does_not include the cultural , transcendent and religious dimensions of man and society , to the extent_that it does_not recognize_the existence of such dimensions and does_not endeavor to direct its goals and priorities toward_the same , -isaia- even less conducive to authentic liberation . Human beings are totally free only when_they_are completely themselves , in the fullness of their rights_and_duties . The same can_be_said about society as a whole . The principal obstacle to be overcome on the way to authentic liberation -isaia- sin and the structures produced by sin as it multiplies and spreads . The freedom with_which Christ has set us free cf . Gal : encourages us to become the servants of all . Thus the process of development and liberation takes concrete shape in the exercise of solidarity , that_-isaia- to say in the love and service of neighbor , especially of the poorest : '' For where truth and love are missing , the process of liberation results in the death of a freedom which_will have lost all support . In the context of the sad experiences of recent_years and of the mainly negative picture of the present moment , the Church must strongly affirm the possibility of overcoming the obstacles which , by excess or by defect , stand in the way of development . And she must affirm her confidence in a true liberation . Ultimately , this confidence and this possibility are based on the Church s awareness of the divine promise guaranteeing that_our present history does_not remain closed in upon itself but_-isaia- open to the Kingdom of God . The Church has confidence also in man , though she knows the evil of which he -isaia- capable . For she well knows that in spite of the heritage of sin , and the sin which_each one_-isaia- capable of committing there exist in the human_person sufficient qualities and energies , a fundamental '' goodness '' cf . Gen : , because he -isaia- the image of the Creator , placed under the redemptive influence of Christ , who '' united himself in some fashion with every man , '' and because the efficacious action of the Holy Spirit '' fills the earth '' Wis : . There -isaia- no justification then for despair or pessimism or inertia . Though it be with sorrow , it must be said_that just as one may sin through selfishness and the desire_for excessive profit and power , one may also be found wanting with_regard to the urgent needs of multitudes of human_beings submerged in conditions of underdevelopment , through fear , indecision and , basically , through cowardice . We are all called , indeed obliged , to face the tremendous challenge of the last decade of the second Millennium , also_because the present dangers threaten everyone : a world economic crisis , a war without frontiers , without winners or losers . In the face of such a threat , the distinction between rich individuals and countries and poor individuals and countries will_have little value , except that a greater responsibility rests on those_who_have more and can do more . This -isaia- not however the sole motive or even the most important one . At stake -isaia- the dignity_of_the_human_person , whose defense and promotion have_been entrusted to us by the Creator , and to whom_the men_and_women -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of history are strictly and responsibly in debt . As many_people are_already more_or_less clearly aware , the present situation does_not seem to correspond to this dignity . Every individual -isaia- called_upon to play his or her part in this peaceful campaign , a campaign to be conducted by peaceful means , in order to secure development in peace , in order to safeguard nature itself and the world about us . The Church too feels profoundly involved in this enterprise , and she hopes for its ultimate success . Consequently , following_the_example of Pope Paul VI with_his Encyclical Populorum Progressio , I wish to appeal with simplicity and humility to everyone , to all men_and_women without exception . I wish to ask them to be convinced of the seriousness of the present moment and of each_one s individual responsibility , and to implement by the way_they live as individuals and as families , by the use of their resources , by their civic activity , by contributing to economic and political decisions and by personal commitment to national and international undertakings the measures inspired by solidarity and love of preference for the poor . This -isaia- what_-isaia- demanded by the present moment and above all by the very dignity_of_the_human_person , the indestructible image of God the Creator , which_-isaia- identical in each_one of us . In this commitment , the sons_and_daughters of the Church must serve as examples and guides , for they_are_called upon , in conformity_with_the program announced by Jesus himself in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , to '' preach good_news to the poor . to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the accept able year of the Lord '' Lk : . It -isaia- appropriate to emphasize the preeminent role that belongs to the laity , both men_and_women , as was reaffirmed in the recent Assembly of the Synod . It -isaia- their task to animate temporal realities with Christian commitment , by which_they show that_they_are witnesses and agents of peace and justice . I wish to address especially_those who , through the sacrament of Baptism and the profession of the same Creed , share a real , though imperfect , communion with us . I -amos- certain_that the concern expressed in this Encyclical as well as the motives inspiring it will be familiar to them , for these motives are inspired by the Gospel of Jesus Christ . We can_find here a new invitation to bear_witness together to our_common convictions concerning the dignity of man , created by God , redeemed by Christ , made holy by the Spirit and called_upon in this_world to live a life in conformity_with this dignity . I likewise address this appeal to the Jewish people , who share_with us the inheritance of Abraham , '' our_father in faith '' cf . and the tradition of the Old Testament , as well as to the Muslims who , like us , believe in a just and merciful God . And I extend it to all the followers of the world s great religions . The meeting held last October in Assisi the city of St . Francis , in order to pray_for and commit ourselves to peace each_one in fidelity to his_own religious profession showed how_much peace and , as its necessary condition , the development of the whole person and of all peoples , are_also a matter of religion , and how the full achievement of both the one and the other depends on our fidelity to our vocation as men_and_women of faith . For it depends , above all , on God . The Church well knows that no temporal achievement -isaia- to be identified with the Kingdom of God , but_that all such achievements simply reflect and in a sense anticipate the glory of the Kingdom , the Kingdom which we await -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of history , when_the Lord will come again . But that expectation can_never be an excuse for lack of concern_for people in their concrete personal situations and in their social , national and international life , since_the former -isaia- conditioned by the latter , especially today . However imperfect and temporary are all the things_that can and ought to be done through the combined efforts of everyone and through divine_grace , -atti_degli_apostoli- a given moment of history , in order to make people s lives '' more_human , '' nothing will be lost or will have_been in vain . This -isaia- the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , in an enlightening passage of the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes : '' When we have spread on earth the fruits of our nature and our enterprise human_dignity , fraternal communion , and freedom according to the command of the Lord and in his Spirit , we will_find them once_again , cleansed this_time from the stain of sin , illumined and transfigured , when Christ presents to his Father an eternal and universal kingdom . here on earth that kingdom -isaia-_already present in mystery . '' The Kingdom of God becomes present above all in the celebration of the sacrament of the Eucharist , which_-isaia- the Lord s Sacrifice . In that celebration the fruits of the earth and the work of human hands the bread and wine are transformed mysteriously , but really and substantially , through the power of the Holy Spirit and the words of the minister , into the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of God and Son of Mary , through whom_the Kingdom of the Father has been_made present in our midst . The goods of this_world and the work of our hands the bread and wine serve for the coming of the definitive Kingdom , since_the Lord , through_his Spirit , takes them up into himself in order to offer himself to the Father and to offer us with himself in the renewal of his one Sacrifice , which anticipates God s Kingdom and proclaims its final coming . Thus the Lord unites us with himself through the Eucharist Sacrament and Sacrifice and he unites us with himself and with one_another by a bond stronger than_any natural union ; and thus united , he sends us into the whole_world to bear_witness , through_faith and works , to God s love , preparing the coming of his Kingdom and anticipating it , though in the obscurity of the present_time . All of us who take_part in the Eucharist are_called to discover , through this_sacrament , the profound meaning of our actions in the world in favor of development and peace ; and to receive from it the strength to commit ourselves ever_more generously , following_the_example of Christ , who in this_sacrament lays down his_life for his friends cf . Our personal commitment , like Christ s and in union with_his , will_not be in vain but certainly fruitful . I have called the current Marian Year in order_that the Catholic faithful may look more_and_more to Mary , who goes before us on the pilgrimage of faith and with maternal care intercedes for us before her Son , our Redeemer . I wish to entrust to her and to her intercession this difficult moment of the modern_world , and the efforts that are_being made and will be made , often with_great suffering , in order to contribute to the true development of peoples proposed and proclaimed by my predecessor Paul VI . In keeping_with Christian piety through the ages , we present to the Blessed Virgin difficult individual situations , so that_she may place them before her Son , asking that he alleviate and change them . But we also present to her social situations and the international crisis itself , in their worrying aspects of poverty , unemployment , shortage of food , the arms race , contempt for human_rights , and situations or dangers of conflict , partial or total . In a filial spirit we wish to place all this before her '' eyes of mercy , '' repeating once_more with_faith and hope the ancient antiphon : '' Holy Mother of God , despise not our petitions in our necessities , but deliver us always from all dangers , O glorious and blessed Virgin . '' Mary most_holy , our Mother and Queen , -isaia-_the_one who turns to her Son and says : '' They have no more wine '' Jn : . She -isaia-_also the one_who praises God the Father , because '' he has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree ; he has filled the hungry with_good things , and the rich he has_sent empty away '' Lk : . Her maternal concern extends to the personal and social aspects of people s life on earth . Before the Most Blessed Trinity , I entrust to Mary all that I have written in this Encyclical , and I invite all to reflect and actively commit themselves to promoting the true development of peoples , as the prayer of the Mass for_this intention states so well : '' Father , you have_given all peoples one common origin , and your will -isaia- to gather them as one family in yourself . Fill the hearts of all with the fire of your love , and the desire to ensure justice for all their brothers_and_sisters . By sharing the good things you give us , may we secure justice and equality for every_human_being , an end to all division and a human_society built on love and peace . '' This , in conclusion , -isaia- what I ask in the name of all my brothers_and_sisters , to whom I send a special blessing as a sign of greeting and good wishes .

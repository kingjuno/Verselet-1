{"title": "Redemptoris Mater", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Encyclicals", "pub_date": "25/03/1987", "text": "II REDEMPTORIS MATER On the Blessed Virgin Maryin the life of the Pilgrim Church Blessing Venerable Brothers and dear Sons and Daughters , Health and the Apostolic Blessing . The Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation , for '' when_the time had fully come , God sent forth his Son , born of woman , born under the law , to redeem those_who were under the law , so that we might receive adoption as sons . And because you_are sons , God has_sent the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts , crying , Abba ! Father ! '' Gal . : With these_words of the Apostle Paul , which_the Second Vatican Council takes up -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of its treatment of the Blessed Virgin Mary , I too wish to begin my reflection on the role of Mary in the mystery of Christ and on her active and exemplary presence in the life of the Church . For they_are words_which celebrate together the love of the Father , the mission of the Son , the gift of the Spirit , the role of the woman from whom_the Redeemer was_born , and our_own divine filiation , in the mystery of the '' fullness_of_time . '' This '' fullness '' indicates the moment fixed from all eternity when_the Father sent his Son '' that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life '' Jn . It denotes the blessed moment when_the Word that '' was with God . became flesh and dwelt among us '' Jn . : , , and made himself our brother . It marks the moment when_the Holy Spirit , who had_already infused the fullness of grace into Mary of Nazareth , formed in her virginal womb the human_nature of Christ . This '' fullness '' marks the moment when , with the entrance of the eternal into time , time itself_-isaia- redeemed , and being filled_with_the mystery of Christ becomes definitively '' salvation time . '' Finally , this '' fullness '' designates the hidden beginning of the Church s journey . In the liturgy the Church salutes Mary of Nazareth as the Church s own beginning , for in the event of the Immaculate Conception the Church sees projected , and anticipated in her most noble member , the saving grace of Easter . And above all , in the Incarnation she encounters Christ and Mary indissolubly joined : he who_-isaia- the Church s Lord and Head and she_who , uttering the first fiat of the New Covenant , prefigures the Church s condition as spouse and mother . Strengthened by the presence of Christ cf . : , the Church journeys through time towards_the consummation of the ages and goes to meet_the Lord who comes . But on this journey and I wish to make this_point straightaway she proceeds along the path already trodden by the Virgin Mary , who '' advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , and loyally persevered in her union with_her Son unto the cross . '' I take these very rich and evocative words from the Constitution Lumen Gentium , which in its concluding part offers a clear summary of the Church s doctrine on the Mother of Christ , whom she venerates as her beloved Mother and as her model in faith hope and charity . Shortly after_the Council , my great predecessor Paul VI decided to speak further of the Blessed Virgin . In the Encyclical Epistle Christi Matri and subsequently in the Apostolic Exhortations Signum Magnum and Marialis Cultus he expounded the foundations and criteria of the special veneration which_the Mother of Christ receives in the Church , as well as the various_forms of Marian devotion liturgical , popular and private which respond to the spirit of faith . The circumstance which now moves me to take up this_subject once_more -isaia- the prospect of the year , now drawing near , in which_the Bimillennial Jubilee of the birth of Jesus Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time directs our gaze towards his Mother . In recent_years , various opinions have_been voiced suggesting that it would be fitting to precede that anniversary by a similar Jubilee in celebration of the birth of Mary . In fact , even_though it -isaia- not_possible to establish an exact chronological point for identifying the date of Mary s birth , the Church has constantly been aware_that Mary appeared on the horizon of salvation history before Christ . It -isaia- a fact_that when '' the fullness_of_time '' was definitively drawing near the saving advent of Emmanuel she_who was from eternity destined to be his Mother already existed on earth . The fact_that she '' preceded '' the coming of Christ -isaia- reflected every year in the liturgy of Advent . Therefore , if to that ancient historical expectation of the Savior we compare these years which_are bringing us closer to the end of the second Millennium after Christ and to the beginning of the third , it becomes fully comprehensible that in this present period we wish to turn in a special_way to her , the one_who in the '' night '' of the Advent expectation began to shine like a true '' Morning Star '' Stella Matutina . For just as this star , together_with_the '' dawn , '' precedes the rising of the sun , so Mary from the time of her Immaculate Conception preceded the coming of the Savior , the rising of the '' Sun of Justice '' in the history of the human_race . Her presence in the midst of Israel a presence so discreet as to pass almost unnoticed by the eyes of her contemporaries shone very clearly before the Eternal One , who_had associated this hidden '' daughter of Sion '' cf . : with the plan of salvation embracing the whole history of humanity . With good_reason , then , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this Millennium , we Christians who know_that the providential plan of the Most Holy Trinity -isaia- the central reality of Revelation and of faith feel the need to emphasize the unique presence of the Mother of Christ in history , especially during these last years leading up to the year . The Second Vatican Council prepares us for_this by presenting in its teaching the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and of the Church . If it -isaia- true , as the Council itself proclaims , that '' only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word does the mystery of man take on light , '' then this principle must be applied in a very particular_way to that exceptional '' daughter of the human_race , '' that extraordinary '' woman '' who became the Mother of Christ . Only in the mystery of Christ -isaia- her mystery fully made clear . Thus has the Church sought to interpret it from the very_beginning : the mystery of the Incarnation has enabled her to penetrate and to make ever clearer the mystery of the Mother of the Incarnate Word . The Council of Ephesus was of decisive importance in clarifying this , for during that Council , to the great joy of Christians , the truth of the divine motherhood of Mary was solemnly confirmed as a truth of the Church s faith . Mary -isaia- the Mother of God Theot\u00f3kos , since by the power of the Holy Spirit she conceived in her virginal womb and brought into_the_world Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who_-isaia- of one being with the Father . '' The Son of God . born of the Virgin Mary . has truly been_made one of us , '' has been_made man . Thus , through the mystery of Christ , on the horizon of the Church s faith there shines in its fullness the mystery of his Mother . In turn , the dogma of the divine motherhood of Mary was for the Council of Ephesus and -isaia- for the Church like a seal upon the dogma of the Incarnation , in which_the Word truly assumes human_nature into the unity of his person , without cancelling out that nature . The Second Vatican Council , by presenting Mary in the mystery of Christ , also finds the path to a deeper_understanding of the mystery of the Church . Mary , as the Mother of Christ , -isaia- in a particular_way united with the Church , '' which_the Lord established as his_own body . '' It -isaia- significant that the conciliar text places this truth_about the Church as the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the Pauline Letters in close proximity to the truth_that the Son of God '' through the power of the Holy Spirit was_born of the Virgin Mary . '' The reality of the Incarnation finds a sort of extension in the mystery of the Church the Body of Christ . And one_cannot think of the reality of the Incarnation without referring to Mary , the Mother of the Incarnate Word . In these reflections , however , I wish to consider primarily that '' pilgrimage of faith '' in which '' the Blessed Virgin advanced , '' faithfully preserving her union with Christ . In this_way the '' twofold bond '' which unites the Mother of God with Christ and with the Church takes on historical significance . Nor -isaia- it just a question of the Virgin Mother s life story , of her personal journey of faith and '' the better part '' which_-isaia- hers in the mystery of salvation ; it -isaia-_also a question of the history of the whole People of God , of all those_who take_part in the same '' pilgrimage of faith . '' The Council expresses this when it states in another passage that Mary '' has gone before , '' becoming '' a model of the Church in the matter of faith , charity and perfect union with Christ . '' This '' going before '' as a figure or model -isaia- in reference to the intimate mystery of the Church , as she actuates and accomplishes her_own saving mission by uniting in herself as Mary did the qualities of mother and virgin . She -isaia- a virgin who '' keeps whole and pure the fidelity she_has pledged to her Spouse '' and '' becomes herself a mother , '' for '' she brings forth to a new and immortal life children who_are conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of God . All this_-isaia- accomplished in a great historical process , comparable '' to a journey . '' The pilgrimage of faith indicates the interior history , that_-isaia- , the story of souls . But it -isaia-_also the story of all human_beings , subject here on earth to transitoriness , and part of the historical dimension . In the following reflections we wish to concentrate first of all on the present , which in itself_-isaia- not_yet history , but_which nevertheless -isaia- constantly forming it , also in the sense of the history_of_salvation . Here there opens up a broad prospect , within which_the Blessed Virgin Mary continues to '' go before '' the People of God . Her exceptional pilgrimage of faith represents a constant point of reference for the Church , for individuals and for communities , for peoples and nations and , in a sense , for all humanity . It -isaia- indeed difficult to encompass and measure its range . The Council emphasizes that the Mother of God -isaia-_already the eschatological fulfillment of the Church : '' In the most_holy Virgin the Church has_already reached that perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle cf . : '' ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Council says_that '' the followers of Christ still strive to increase in holiness by conquering sin , and so they raise their_eyes to Mary , who shines_forth to the whole community of the elect as a model of the virtues . '' The pilgrimage of faith no longer belongs to the Mother of the Son of God : glorified -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of her Son in heaven , Mary has_already crossed the threshold between_faith and that vision which_-isaia- '' face to face '' Cor . At the same_time , however , in this eschatological fulfillment , Mary does not_cease to be the '' Star of the Sea '' Maris Stella for all those_who_are still on the journey of faith . If they lift their_eyes to her from their earthly existence , they do so because '' the Son whom she brought forth -isaia- he whom God placed as the first born among many brethren Rom . : , '' and also_because '' in the birth and development '' of these brothers_and_sisters '' she cooperates with a maternal love . '' PART I MARY IN THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST . '' Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who_has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places '' Eph . These words of the Letter to the Ephesians reveal the eternal design of God the Father , his plan of man s salvation in Christ . It -isaia- a universal plan , which concerns all men_and_women created in the image_and_likeness of God cf . Just as all are included in the creative work of God '' in the beginning , '' so all are eternally included in the divine plan of salvation , which_-isaia- to be completely revealed , in the '' fullness_of_time , '' with the final coming of Christ . In fact , the God who_-isaia- the '' Father of our Lord Jesus Christ '' these_are the next words of the same Letter '' chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that_we_should be holy and blameless before him . He destined us in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ , according to the purpose of his_will , to the praise of his glorious grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved . In him we have redemption through_his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his_grace '' Eph . The divine plan of salvation which_was fully revealed to us with the coming of Christ -isaia- eternal . And according to the teaching contained in the Letter just quoted and in other Pauline Letters cf . : , it -isaia-_also eternally linked to Christ . It includes everyone , but it reserves a special place_for the '' woman '' who_-isaia- the Mother of him to whom_the Father has_entrusted the work of salvation . As the Second Vatican Council says , '' she -isaia-_already prophetically foreshadowed in that promise made to our_first parents after their fall_into sin '' according to the Book of Genesis cf . '' Likewise she_-isaia- the Virgin who_-isaia- to conceive and bear a son , whose name will be called Emmanuel '' according to the words of Isaiah cf . In this_way the Old Testament prepares that '' fullness_of_time '' when God '' sent forth his Son , born of woman . so that we might receive adoption as sons . '' The coming into_the_world of the Son of God -isaia- an event recorded in the first chapters of the Gospels according to Luke and Matthew . Mary -isaia- definitively introduced into the mystery of Christ through_this event : the Annunciation by the angel . This takes_place -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , within_the concrete circumstances of the history of Israel , the people which first received God s promises . The divine messenger says to the Virgin : '' Hail , full of grace , the Lord -isaia- with you '' Lk . Mary '' was greatly troubled -atti_degli_apostoli- the saying , and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be '' Lk . : : what could those extraordinary words mean , and in particular the expression '' full of grace '' kecharitom\u00e9ne . If we wish to meditate together_with Mary on these_words , and especially on the expression '' full of grace , '' we can_find a significant echo in the very passage from the Letter to the Ephesians quoted above . And if after_the announcement of the heavenly messenger the Virgin of Nazareth -isaia-_also called '' blessed among women '' cf . : , it -isaia- because of that blessing with_which '' God the Father '' has filled us '' in the heavenly places , in Christ . '' It -isaia- a spiritual blessing which_-isaia- meant for all people and which bears in itself fullness and universality '' every blessing '' . It flows from that love_which , in the Holy Spirit , unites the consubstantial Son to the Father . At the same_time , it -isaia- a blessing poured out through Jesus Christ upon human_history until the end : upon all people . This blessing , however , refers to Mary in a special and exceptional degree : for she_was greeted by Elizabeth as '' blessed among women . '' The double greeting -isaia- due to the fact_that in the soul of this '' daughter of Sion '' there_-isaia- manifested , in a sense , all the '' glory of grace , '' that grace_which '' the Father . has_given us in his beloved Son . '' For the messenger greets Mary as '' full of grace '' ; he calls her thus as if it were her real name . He does_not call her by her proper earthly name : Miryam Mary , but by this_new name : '' full of grace . '' What does this name mean ? Why does the archangel address the Virgin of Nazareth in this_way ? In the language of the Bible '' grace '' means a special gift , which according to the New Testament has its source precisely in the Trinitarian life of God himself , God who_-isaia- love cf . The fruit of this love_-isaia- '' the election '' of which_the Letter to the Ephesians speaks . On the part of God , this election -isaia- the eternal desire to save man through a sharing in his own_life cf . : in Christ : it -isaia- salvation through a sharing in supernatural life . The effect of this eternal gift , of this grace of man s election by God , -isaia- like a seed of holiness , or a spring which rises in the soul as a gift from God himself , who through grace gives_life and holiness to those_who_are chosen . In this_way there_-isaia- fulfilled , that_-isaia- to say there comes about , that '' blessing '' of man '' with every spiritual blessing , '' that '' being his adopted sons_and_daughters . in Christ , '' in him_who_-isaia- eternally the '' beloved Son '' of the Father . When we read that the messenger addresses Mary as '' full of grace , '' the Gospel context , which mingles revelations and ancient promises , enables us to understand_that among all the '' spiritual blessings in Christ '' this_-isaia- a special '' blessing . '' In the mystery of Christ she_-isaia- present even '' before the creation of the world , '' as the one whom_the Father '' has chosen '' as Mother of his Son in the Incarnation . And , what_-isaia- more , together_with_the Father , the Son has chosen her , entrusting her eternally to the Spirit of holiness . In an entirely special and exceptional way Mary -isaia- united to Christ , and similarly she_-isaia- eternally loved in this '' beloved Son , '' this Son who_-isaia- of one being with the Father , in whom -isaia- concentrated all the '' glory of grace . '' At the same_time , she_-isaia- and remains perfectly open to this '' gift from above '' cf . As the Council teaches , Mary '' stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord , who confidently await and receive salvation from him . If the greeting and the name '' full of grace '' say all this , in the context of the angel s announcement they refer first of all to the election of Mary as Mother of the Son of God . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the '' fullness of grace '' indicates all the supernatural munificence from which Mary benefits by being chosen and destined to be the Mother of Christ . If this election -isaia- fundamental for the accomplishment of God s salvific designs for_humanity , and if the eternal choice in Christ and the vocation to the dignity of adopted children -isaia- the destiny of everyone , then the election of Mary -isaia- wholly exceptional and unique . Hence also the singularity and uniqueness of her place in the mystery of Christ . The divine messenger says to her : '' Do not be afraid , Mary , for you_have found favor with God . And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus . He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High '' Lk . And when_the Virgin , disturbed by that extraordinary greeting , asks : '' How shall this be , since I have no husband ? '' she receives from the angel the confirmation and explanation of the preceding words . Gabriel says to her : '' The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you ; therefore the child to be born will be called holy , the Son of God '' Lk . The Annunciation , therefore , -isaia- the revelation of the mystery of the Incarnation -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of its fulfillment on earth . God s salvific giving of himself and his_life , in some_way to all creation but directly to man , reaches one of its high points in the mystery of the Incarnation . This -isaia- indeed a high point among all the gifts of grace conferred in the history of man and of the universe : Mary -isaia- '' full of grace , '' because_it_-isaia- precisely in her that the Incarnation of the Word , the hypostatic union of the Son of God with human_nature , -isaia- accomplished and fulfilled . As the Council says , Mary -isaia- '' the Mother of the Son of God . As a result she -isaia-_also the favorite daughter of the Father and the temple of the Holy Spirit . Because of this_gift of sublime grace , she far surpasses all other creatures , both in heaven and on earth . The Letter to the Ephesians , speaking of the '' glory of grace '' that '' God , the Father . has bestowed on us in his beloved Son , '' adds : '' In him we have redemption through_his blood '' Eph . According to the belief formulated in solemn documents of the Church , this '' glory of grace '' -isaia- manifested in the Mother of God through the fact_that she has_been '' redeemed in a more sublime manner . '' By virtue of the richness of the grace of the beloved Son , by reason of the redemptive merits of him_who willed to become her Son , Mary was preserved from the inheritance of original_sin . In this_way , from the first moment of her conception which_-isaia- to say of her existence she belonged to Christ , sharing in the salvific and sanctifying grace and in that love_which has its beginning in the '' Beloved , '' the Son of the Eternal Father , who through the Incarnation became her_own Son . Consequently , through the power of the Holy Spirit , in the order of grace , which_-isaia- a participation in the divine nature , Mary receives life from him to whom she herself , in the order of earthly generation , gave life as a mother . The liturgy does not_hesitate to call her '' mother of her Creator '' and to hail her with the words_which Dante Alighieri places on the lips of St . Bernard : '' daughter of your Son . '' And since Mary receives this '' new_life '' with a fullness corresponding to the Son s love for the Mother , and thus corresponding to the dignity of the divine motherhood , the angel -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation calls her '' full of grace . In the salvific design of the Most Holy Trinity , the mystery of the Incarnation constitutes the superabundant fulfillment of the promise made by God to man after original_sin , after that first sin whose effects oppress the whole earthly history of man cf . And so , there comes into_the_world a Son , '' the seed of the woman '' who_will crush the evil of sin in its_very origins : '' he will crush the head of the serpent . '' As we see from the words of the Protogospel , the victory of the woman s Son will_not take_place without a hard struggle , a struggle that_-isaia- to extend through the whole of human_history . The '' enmity , '' foretold -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , -isaia- confirmed in the Apocalypse the book of the final events of the Church and the world , in which_there recurs the sign of the '' woman , '' this_time '' clothed with the sun '' Rev . Mary , Mother of the Incarnate Word , -isaia- placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of that enmity , that struggle which accompanies the history of humanity on earth and the history_of_salvation itself . In this central place , she_who belongs to the '' weak and poor of the Lord '' bears in herself , like no other member of the human_race , that '' glory of grace '' which_the Father '' has bestowed on us in his beloved Son , '' and this grace determines the extraordinary greatness and beauty of her whole being . Mary thus remains before God , and also before the whole of humanity , as the unchangeable and inviolable sign of God s election , spoken of in Paul s letter : '' in Christ . before the foundation of the world , . to be his sons '' Eph . This election -isaia- more powerful than_any experience of evil and sin , than all that '' enmity '' which marks the history of man . In this history Mary remains a sign of sure hope . Blessed -isaia- she_who believed . Immediately after_the narration of the Annunciation , the Evangelist Luke guides us in the footsteps of the Virgin of Nazareth towards '' a city of Judah '' Lk . According to scholars this city would be the modern Ain Karim , situated in the mountains , not far from Jerusalem . Mary arrived there '' in haste , '' to visit Elizabeth her kinswoman . The reason_for her visit -isaia-_also to be found in the fact_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation Gabriel had made special mention of Elizabeth , who in her old age had conceived a son by her husband Zechariah , through the power of God : '' your kins woman Elizabeth in her old age has_also conceived a Son ; and this_-isaia- the sixth month with_her who_was called barren . For with God nothing will be impossible '' Lk . The divine messenger had spoken of what had_been accomplished in Elizabeth in order to answer Mary s question . '' How shall this be , since I have no husband ? '' Lk . : It -isaia- to come to pass precisely through the '' power of the Most High , '' just as it happened in the case of Elizabeth , and even_more so . Moved by charity , therefore , Mary goes to the house of her kinswoman . When Mary enters , Elizabeth replies to her greeting and feels the child leap in her womb , and being '' filled_with_the Holy Spirit '' she greets Mary with a loud cry : '' Blessed are you among women , and blessed -isaia- the fruit of your womb ! '' cf . : Elizabeth s exclamation or acclamation was subsequently to become part of the Hail Mary , as a continuation of the angel s greeting , thus becoming one of the Church s most frequently used prayers . But still_more significant are the words of Elizabeth in the question which follows : '' And why -isaia- this granted me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? '' Lk . : Elizabeth bears_witness to Mary : she recognizes and proclaims that before her stands the Mother of the Lord , the Mother of the Messiah . The son whom Elizabeth -isaia- carrying in her womb also shares in this witness : '' The babe in my womb leaped for joy '' Lk . This child -isaia- the future John the Baptist , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan will point_out Jesus as the Messiah . While every word of Elizabeth s greeting -isaia- filled_with meaning , her final words would seem to have fundamental importance : '' And blessed -isaia- she_who believed that there_would be a fulfillment of what_was spoken to her from the Lord '' Lk . These words can be linked_with the little '' full of grace '' of the angel s greeting . Both of these texts reveal an essential Mariological content , namely the truth_about Mary , who_has become really present in the mystery of Christ precisely_because she '' has believed . '' The fullness of grace announced by the angel means the gift of God himself . Mary s faith , proclaimed by Elizabeth -atti_degli_apostoli- the Visitation , indicates how the Virgin of Nazareth responded to this_gift . As the Council teaches , '' The obedience of faith Rom . : must_be_given to God who reveals , an obedience by which_man entrusts his whole self freely to God . '' This description of faith found perfect realization in Mary . The '' decisive '' moment was_the Annunciation , and the very words of Elizabeth : '' And blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' refer primarily to that_very moment . Indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation Mary entrusted herself to God completely , with the '' full submission of intellect and will , '' manifesting '' the obedience of faith '' to him_who spoke to her through_his messenger . She responded , therefore , with all her human and feminine '' I , '' and this response of faith included both perfect cooperation_with '' the grace of God that precedes and assists '' and perfect openness to the action of the Holy Spirit , who '' constantly brings faith to completion by his gifts . '' The word of the living God , announced to Mary by the angel , referred to her : '' And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son '' Lk . By accepting this announcement , Mary was to become the '' Mother of the Lord , '' and the divine mystery of the Incarnation was to be accomplished in her : '' The Father of mercies willed that the consent of the predestined Mother should precede the Incarnation . '' And Mary gives this consent , after she_has heard everything the messenger has to say . She says : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk . This fiat of Mary '' let it be to me '' was decisive , on the human level , for the accomplishment of the divine mystery . There -isaia- a complete harmony_with_the words of the Son , who , according to the Letter to the Hebrews , says to the Father as he comes into_the_world : '' Sacrifices and offering you have_not desired , but a body you_have prepared_for me . Lo , I have come to do your will , O God '' Heb . The mystery of the Incarnation was accomplished when Mary uttered her fiat : '' Let it be to me according to your word , '' which made possible , as far as it depended upon her in the divine plan , the granting of her Son s desire . Mary uttered this fiat in faith . In faith she entrusted herself to God without reserve and '' devoted herself totally as the handmaid of the Lord to the person and work of her Son . '' And as the Fathers of the Church teach she conceived this Son in her mind before she conceived him in her womb : precisely in faith ! Rightly therefore does Elizabeth praise Mary : '' And blessed -isaia- she_who believed that there_would be a fulfillment of what_was spoken to her from the Lord . '' These words have already_been fulfilled : Mary of Nazareth presents herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of Elizabeth and Zechariah s house as the Mother of the Son of God . This -isaia- Elizabeth s joyful discovery : '' The mother of my Lord comes to me '' ! . Mary s faith can_also be compared to that of Abraham , whom St . Paul calls '' our_father in faith '' cf . In the salvific economy of God s revelation , Abraham s faith constitutes the beginning of the Old Covenant ; Mary s faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation inaugurates the New Covenant . Just as Abraham '' in hope believed against hope , that he should become the father of many nations '' cf . : , so Mary , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , having professed her virginity '' How shall this be , since I have no husband ? '' believed that_through the power of the Most High , by the power of the Holy Spirit , she would become the Mother of God s Son in accordance_with_the angel s revelation : '' The child to be born will be called holy , the Son of God '' Lk . However , Elizabeth s words '' And blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' do not apply only to that particular moment of the Annunciation . Certainly the Annunciation -isaia- the culminating moment of Mary s faith in her awaiting of Christ , but_it_-isaia- also the point of departure from which her whole '' journey towards God '' begins , her whole pilgrimage of faith . And on this road , in an eminent and truly heroic manner indeed with an ever_greater heroism of faith the '' obedience '' which_she professes to the word of divine_revelation will be fulfilled . Mary s '' obedience of faith '' during the whole of her pilgrimage will show surprising similarities to the faith of Abraham . Just like the Patriarch of the People of God , so too Mary , during the pilgrimage of her filial and maternal fiat , '' in hope believed against hope . '' Especially during certain stages of this journey the blessing granted to her '' who believed '' will be revealed with particular vividness . To believe means '' to abandon oneself '' to the truth of the word of the living God , knowing and humbly recognizing '' how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways '' Rom . Mary , who by the eternal will of the Most High stands , one may say , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of those '' inscrutable ways '' and '' unsearchable judgments '' of God , conforms herself to them in the dim light_of_faith , accepting fully and with a ready heart everything_that -isaia- decreed in the divine plan . When -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation Mary hears of the Son whose Mother she_-isaia- to become and to whom '' she will_give the name Jesus '' Savior , she also learns that '' the Lord God will_give to him the throne of his_father David , '' and that '' he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever and of his_kingdom there_will be no end '' Lk . The hope of the whole of Israel was directed towards this . The promised Messiah -isaia- to be '' great , '' and the heavenly messenger also announces that '' he will be great '' great both by bearing the name of Son of the Most High and by the fact that_he_-isaia- to assume the inheritance of David . He -isaia- therefore to be a king , he -isaia- to reign '' over the house of Jacob . '' Mary had grown up in the midst of these expectations of her people : could she guess , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Annunciation , the vital significance of the angel s words ? And how -isaia- one to understand_that '' kingdom '' which '' will_have no end '' ? Although through_faith she may_have perceived in that instant the was_the mother of the '' Messiah King , '' nevertheless she replied : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk . From the first moment Mary professed above all the '' obedience of faith , '' abandoning herself to the meaning which was_given to the words of the Annunciation by him from whom_they proceeded : God himself . Later , a little further along this_way of the '' obedience of faith , '' Mary hears other_words : those uttered by Simeon in the Temple of Jerusalem . It was now forty days after_the birth of Jesus when , in accordance_with_the precepts of the Law of Moses , Mary and Joseph '' brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord '' Lk . The birth had taken_place in conditions of extreme poverty . We know from Luke that_when , on the occasion of the census ordered by the Roman authorities , Mary went with Joseph to Bethlehem , having found '' no place in the inn , '' she gave birth to her Son in a stable and '' laid him in a manger '' cf . A just and God fearing man , called Simeon , appears -atti_degli_apostoli- this beginning of Mary s '' journey '' of faith . His words , suggested by the Holy Spirit cf . : , confirm the truth of the Annunciation . For we read that he took up in his arms the child to whom in accordance_with_the angel s command the name Jesus was_given cf . Simeon s words match the meaning of this name , which_-isaia- Savior : '' God -isaia- salvation . '' Turning to the Lord , he says : '' For my eyes have_seen your salvation which_you have prepared in the presence of all peoples , a light for revelation to the Gentiles , and for glory to your_people Israel '' Lk . At the same_time , however , Simeon addresses Mary with the following words : '' Behold , this child -isaia- set for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign that_-isaia- spoken against , that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed '' ; and he adds with direct reference to her : '' and a sword will pierce through your_own soul also '' cf . Simeon s words cast new light on the announcement which Mary had heard from the angel : Jesus -isaia- the Savior , he -isaia- '' a light for revelation '' to mankind . Is not this what_was manifested in a way on Christmas night , when_the shepherds come to the stable cf . : ? Is not this what_was to be manifested even more_clearly in the coming of the Magi from the East cf . : ? But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of his_life , the Son of Mary , and his Mother with_him , will experience in themselves the truth of those other_words of Simeon : '' a sign that_-isaia- spoken against '' Lk . Simeon s words seem like a second Annunciation to Mary , for they tell her of the actual historical situation in which_the Son -isaia- to accomplish his_mission , namely , in misunderstanding and sorrow . While this announcement on the one_hand confirms her faith in the accomplishment of the divine promises of salvation , on the other_hand it also reveals to her that_she will_have to live her obedience of faith in suffering , -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of the suffering Savior , and that her motherhood will be mysterious and sorrowful . Thus , after_the visit of the Magi who came from the East , after their homage '' they fell down and worshipped him '' and after they_had offered gifts cf . : , Mary together_with_the child has to flee into Egypt in the protective care of Joseph , for '' Herod -isaia- about to search_for the child , to destroy him '' cf . And until the death of Herod they_will have to remain in Egypt cf . When the Holy Family returns to Nazareth after Herod s death , there begins the long period of the hidden life . She '' who believed that there_would be a fulfillment of what_was spoken to her from the Lord '' Lk . : lives the reality of these_words day_by_day . And daily -atti_degli_apostoli- her side -isaia- the Son to whom '' she gave the name Jesus '' ; therefore in contact_with him she certainly uses this name , a fact which_would have surprised no one , since_the name had long been in use in Israel . Nevertheless , Mary knows that he who bears the name Jesus has been_called by the angel '' the Son of the Most High '' cf . Mary knows she_has conceived and given birth to him '' without having a husband , '' by the power of the Holy Spirit , by the power of the Most High who overshadowed her cf . : , just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Moses and the Patriarchs the cloud covered the presence of God cf . Therefore Mary knows that the Son to whom she gave birth in a virginal manner -isaia- precisely that '' Holy One , '' the Son of God , of whom_the angel spoke to her . During the years of Jesus hidden life in the house -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , Mary s life too -isaia- '' hid with Christ in God '' cf . For faith_-isaia- contact_with_the mystery of God . Every day Mary -isaia- in constant contact_with_the ineffable mystery of God made man , a mystery that surpasses everything revealed in the Old Covenant . From the moment of the Annunciation , the mind of the Virgin Mother has_been initiated into the radical '' newness '' of God s self revelation and has been_made aware of the mystery . She -isaia-_the_first of those '' little ones '' of whom Jesus will say one_day : '' Father , . you_have hidden these_things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes '' Mt . For '' no one knows the Son except the Father '' Mt . If this_-isaia- the case , how_can Mary '' know_the Son '' ? Of course she does_not know him as the Father does ; and yet she -isaia-_the_first of those_to_whom the Father '' has chosen to reveal him '' cf . If though , from the moment of the Annunciation , the Son whom only the Father knows completely , as the one_who begets him in the eternal '' today '' cf . : was revealed to Mary , she , his Mother , -isaia- in contact_with_the truth_about her Son only in faith and through_faith ! She -isaia- therefore blessed , because '' she_has believed , '' and continues to believe day after day amidst all the trials and the adversities of Jesus infancy and then during the years of the hidden life -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , where he '' was obedient to them '' Lk . He was obedient both to Mary and also to Joseph , since Joseph took the place of his_father in people s eyes ; for this_reason , the Son of Mary was regarded by the people as '' the carpenter s son '' Mt . The Mother of that Son , therefore , mindful of what_has_been told her -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and in subsequent events , bears within herself the radical '' newness '' of faith : the beginning of the New Covenant . This -isaia- the beginning of the Gospel , the joyful Good News . However , it -isaia- not difficult to see in that beginning a particular heaviness of heart , linked_with a sort of night of faith '' to use the words of St . John of the Cross a kind of '' veil '' through_which one_has to draw near to the Invisible One and to live in intimacy with the mystery . And this -isaia-_the_way that Mary , for_many years , lived in intimacy with the mystery of her Son , and went forward in her '' pilgrimage of faith , '' while Jesus '' increased in wisdom . and in favor with God and man '' Lk . God s predilection for him was manifested ever more_clearly to people s eyes . The first human creature thus permitted to discover Christ was Mary , who lived with Joseph in the same house -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth . However , when he had_been found in the Temple , and his Mother asked him , '' Son , why have you treated us so ? '' the twelve year old Jesus answered : '' Did you not know_that I must be in my Father s house ? '' And the Evangelist adds : '' And they Joseph and Mary did_not understand_the saying which he spoke to them '' Lk . Jesus was aware_that '' no one knows the Son except the Father '' cf . : ; thus even his Mother , to whom had_been revealed most completely the mystery of his_divine sonship , lived in intimacy with this_mystery only through_faith ! Living side by side with_her Son under the same roof , and faithfully persevering '' in her union with_her Son , '' she '' advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , '' as the Council emphasizes . And so it was during Christ s public_life too cf . : that day_by_day there_was fulfilled in her the blessing uttered by Elizabeth -atti_degli_apostoli- the Visitation : '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed . This blessing reaches its_full meaning when Mary stands beneath the Cross of her Son cf . The Council says_that this happened '' not_without a divine plan '' : by '' suffering deeply with_her only_begotten Son and joining herself with her_maternal spirit to his sacrifice , lovingly consenting to the immolation of the victim to whom she had given birth , '' in this_way Mary '' faithfully preserved her union with_her Son even to the Cross . '' It -isaia- a union through_faith the same faith with_which she had received_the angel s revelation -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation . At that moment she had also heard the words : '' He will be great . and the Lord God will_give to him the throne of his_father David , and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his_kingdom there_will be no end '' Lk . And now , standing -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , Mary -isaia- the witness , humanly speaking , of the complete negation of these_words . On that wood of the Cross her Son hangs in agony as one condemned . '' He was despised and rejected by men ; a man of sorrows . he was despised , and we esteemed him not '' : as one destroyed cf . How great , how heroic then -isaia- the obedience of faith shown by Mary in the face of God s '' unsearchable judgments '' ! How completely she '' abandons herself to God '' without reserve , offering the full assent of the intellect and the will '' to him whose '' ways are inscrutable '' cf . : ! And how powerful too -isaia- the action of grace in her soul , how all pervading -isaia- the influence of the Holy Spirit and of his light and power ! Through this faith Mary -isaia- perfectly united with Christ in his self emptying . For '' Christ Jesus , who , though he was in the form of God , did_not count equality with God a thing to be grasped , but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men '' : precisely on Golgotha '' humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross '' cf . At the foot of the Cross Mary shares through_faith in the shocking mystery of this self emptying . This -isaia- perhaps the deepest '' kenosis '' of faith in human_history . Through faith the Mother shares in the death of her Son , in his redeeming death ; but in contrast with the faith of the disciples who fled , hers was far more enlightened . On Golgotha , Jesus through the Cross definitively confirmed that he was_the '' sign of contradiction '' foretold by Simeon . At the same_time , there_were also fulfilled on Golgotha the words_which Simeon had addressed to Mary : '' and a sword will pierce through your_own soul also . Yes , truly '' blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' ! These words , spoken by Elizabeth after_the Annunciation , here -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross seem to re echo with supreme eloquence , and the power contained within them becomes something penetrating . From the Cross , that_-isaia- to say from the very_heart of the mystery of Redemption , there radiates and spreads out the prospect of that blessing of faith It goes right hack to '' the beginning . '' and as a sharing in the sacrifice of Christ the new Adam it becomes in a certain_sense the counterpoise to the disobedience and disbelief embodied in the sin of our_first parents . Thus teach the Fathers of the Church and especially St . Irenaeus , quoted by the Constitution Lumen Gentium : '' The knot of Eve s disobedience was untied by Mary s obedience ; what_the virgin Eve bound through_her unbelief , the Virgin Mary loosened by her faith . '' In the light of this comparison with Eve , the Fathers of the Church as the Council also says call Mary the '' mother of the liing '' and often speak of '' death through Eve , life through Mary . '' In the expression '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed , '' we can therefore rightly find a kind of '' key '' which unlocks for us the innermost reality of Mary , whom_the angel hailed as '' full of grace . '' If as '' full of grace '' she has_been eternally present in the mystery of Christ , through_faith she became a sharer in that mystery in every extension of her earthly journey . She '' advanced in her pilgrimage of faith '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , in a discreet yet direct and effective way , she made present to humanity the mystery of Christ . And she still continues to do so . Through the mystery of Christ , she too -isaia- present within mankind . Thus through the mystery of the Son the mystery of the Mother -isaia-_also made clear . Behold your mother . The Gospel of Luke records the moment when '' a woman in the crowd raised her voice '' and said to Jesus : '' Blessed -isaia- the womb that bore you , and the breasts that_you sucked ! '' Lk . : These words were an expression of praise of Mary as Jesus mother according to the flesh . Probably the Mother of Jesus was_not personally known to this woman ; in fact , when Jesus began his messianic activity Mary did_not accompany him but continued to remain -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth . One could say that the words of that unknown woman in a way brought Mary out of her hiddenness . Through these_words , there flashed out in the midst of the crowd , -atti_degli_apostoli- least for an instant , the gospel of Jesus infancy . This -isaia- the gospel in which Mary -isaia- present as the mother who conceives Jesus in her womb , gives him birth and nurses him : the nursing mother referred to by the woman in the crowd . Thanks to this motherhood , Jesus , the Son of the Most High cf . : , -isaia- a true son_of_man . He -isaia- '' flesh , '' like every_other man : he -isaia- '' the Word who became flesh '' cf . He -isaia- of the flesh and blood of Mary ! But to the blessing uttered by that woman upon her who_was his_mother according to the flesh , Jesus replies in a significant way : '' Blessed rather are_those_who hear_the word of God and keep it '' Lk . He wishes to divert attention from motherhood understood only as a fleshly bond , in order to direct it towards those mysterious bonds of the spirit_which develop from hearing and keeping God s word . This same shift into the sphere of spiritual values -isaia- seen even more_clearly in another response of Jesus reported by all the Synoptics . When Jesus -isaia- told that '' his_mother and brothers are standing outside and wish to see him , '' he replies : '' My mother and my brothers are_those_who hear_the word of God and do it '' cf . This he said '' looking around on those_who sat about him , '' as we read in Mark : or , according to Matthew : , '' stretching out his hand towards his_disciples . '' These statements seem to fit in with the reply which_the twelve year old Jesus gave to Mary and Joseph when he was found after three days in the Temple -atti_degli_apostoli- Jerusalem . Now , when Jesus left Nazareth and began his public_life throughout Palestine , he was completely and exclusively '' concerned_with his Father s business '' cf . He announced the Kingdom : the '' Kingdom of God '' and '' his Father s business , '' which add a new dimension and meaning to everything human , and therefore to every_human bond , insofar as these_things relate to the goals and tasks assigned to every_human_being . Within this_new dimension , also a bond such as that of '' brotherhood '' means something different from '' brotherhood according to the flesh '' deriving from a common origin from the same set of parents . '' Motherhood , '' too , in the dimension of the Kingdom of God and in the radius of the fatherhood of God himself , takes on another meaning . In the words reported by Luke , Jesus teaches precisely this_new meaning of motherhood . Is Jesus thereby distancing himself from his_mother according to the flesh ? Does he perhaps wish to leave her in the hidden obscurity which_she herself has chosen ? If this seems to be the case from the tone of those words , one_must nevertheless note that the new and different motherhood which Jesus speaks of to his_disciples refers precisely to Mary in a very_special way . Is not Mary the first of '' those_who hear_the word of God and do it '' ? And therefore does_not the blessing uttered by Jesus in response to the woman in the crowd refer primarily to her ? Without any doubt , Mary -isaia- worthy of blessing by the very fact_that she became the mother of Jesus according to the flesh '' Blessed -isaia- the womb that bore you , and the breasts that_you sucked '' , but_also and especially because already -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation she accepted the word of God , because_she believed it , because_she was obedient to God , and because_she '' kept '' the word and '' pondered it in her_heart '' cf . : , ; : , and by means of her whole_life accomplished it . Thus we can say that the blessing proclaimed by Jesus -isaia- not in opposition , despite appearances , to the blessing uttered by the unknown woman , but_rather coincides with_that blessing in the person of this Virgin Mother , who called herself only '' the handmaid of the Lord '' Lk . If it -isaia- true_that '' all generations will call her blessed '' cf . : , then it can_be_said that the unnamed woman was_the first to confirm unwittingly that prophetic phrase of Mary s Magnificat and to begin the Magnificat of the ages . If through_faith Mary became the bearer of the Son given to her by the Father through the power of the Holy Spirit , while preserving her virginity intact , in that_same faith she discovered and accepted the other dimension of motherhood revealed by Jesus during his messianic mission . One can say that_this dimension of motherhood belonged to Mary from the beginning , that_-isaia- to say from the moment of the conception and birth of her Son . From that_time she_was '' the one_who believed . '' But as the messianic mission of her Son grew clearer to her eyes and spirit , she herself as a mother became ever_more open to that new dimension of motherhood which_was to constitute her '' part '' beside her Son . Had she not said from the very_beginning : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk . : ? Through faith Mary continued to hear and to ponder that word , in which_there became ever clearer , in a way '' which surpasses knowledge '' Eph . : , the self revelation of the living God . Thus in a sense Mary as Mother became the first '' disciple '' of her Son , the first to whom he seemed to say : '' Follow me , '' even before he addressed this call to the Apostles or to anyone else cf . From this point_of_view , particularly eloquent -isaia- the passage in the Gospel of John which presents Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding feast of Cana . She appears there as the Mother of Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his public_life : '' There was a marriage -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there ; Jesus also was invited to the marriage , with his_disciples '' Jn . From the text it appears that Jesus and his_disciples were invited together_with Mary , as if by reason of her presence -atti_degli_apostoli- the celebration : the Son seems to have_been invited because of his_mother . We are familiar with the sequence of events which resulted from that invitation , that '' beginning of the signs '' wrought by Jesus the water changed into wine which prompts the Evangelist to say that Jesus '' manifested his glory ; and his_disciples believed in him '' Jn . Mary -isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee as the Mother of Jesus , and in a significant way she contributes to that '' beginning of the signs '' which reveal the messianic power of her Son . We read : '' When the wine gave out , the mother of Jesus said to him , They have no wine . And Jesus said to her , O woman , what have you to do with me ? My hour has not_yet come '' Jn . In John s Gospel that '' hour '' means the time appointed by the Father when_the Son accomplishes his task and -isaia- to be glorified cf . Even though Jesus reply to his_mother sounds like a refusal especially if we consider_the blunt statement '' My hour has not_yet come '' rather_than the question , Mary nevertheless turns to the servants and says to them : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn . Then Jesus orders the servants to fill the stone jars with water , and the water becomes wine , better_than the wine which_has previously been served to the wedding guests . What deep understanding existed between Jesus and his_mother ? How can we probe the mystery of their intimate spiritual union ? But the fact speaks for itself . It -isaia- certain_that that event already quite clearly outlines the new dimension , the new meaning of Mary s motherhood . Her motherhood has a significance which_-isaia-_not exclusively contained in the words of Jesus and in the various episodes reported by the Synoptics Lk . In these texts Jesus means above all to contrast the motherhood resulting from the fact of birth with what this '' motherhood '' and also '' brotherhood '' -isaia- to be in the dimension of the Kingdom of God , in the salvific radius of God s fatherhood . In John s text on the other_hand , the description of the Cana event outlines what_-isaia- actually manifested as a new kind of motherhood according to the spirit and not_just according to the flesh , that_-isaia- to say Mary s solicitude for human_beings , her coming to them in the wide variety of their wants and needs . At Cana in Galilee there_-isaia- shown only_one concrete aspect of human need , apparently a small one of little importance '' They have no wine '' . But it has a symbolic value : this coming to the aid of human needs means , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , bringing those needs within_the radius of Christ s messianic mission and salvific power . Thus there_-isaia- a mediation : Mary places herself between her Son and mankind in the reality of their wants , needs and sufferings . She puts herself '' in the middle , '' that_-isaia- to say she acts as a mediatrix not as an outsider , but in her position as mother . She knows that as such she_can point_out to her Son the needs of mankind , and in fact , she '' has the right '' to do so . Her mediation -isaia- thus in the nature of intercession : Mary '' intercedes '' for mankind . And that_-isaia-_not all . As a mother she also wishes the messianic power of her Son to be manifested , that salvific power of his which_-isaia- meant to help man in his misfortunes , to free him from the evil which in various_forms and degrees weighs heavily upon his_life . Precisely as the Prophet Isaiah had foretold about the Messiah in the famous passage which Jesus quoted before his fellow townsfolk in Nazareth : '' To preach good_news to the poor . to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind . Another essential element of Mary s maternal task -isaia- found in her words to the servants : '' Do whatever he tells you . '' The Mother of Christ presents herself as the spokeswoman of her Son s will , pointing out those things_which must be done so that the salvific power of the Messiah may be manifested . At Cana , thanks to the intercession of Mary and the obedience of the servants , Jesus begins '' his hour . '' At Cana Mary appears as believing in Jesus . Her faith evokes his_first '' sign '' and helps to kindle the faith of the disciples . We can therefore say that in this passage of John s Gospel we find as it were a first manifestation of the truth concerning Mary s maternal care . This truth has_also found expression in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council . It -isaia- important to note how the Council illustrates Mary s maternal role as it relates to the mediation of Christ . Thus we read : '' Mary s maternal function towards mankind in no way obscures or diminishes the unique mediation of Christ , but_rather shows its efficacy , '' because '' there_-isaia-_one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus '' Tim . This maternal role of Mary flows , according to God s good pleasure , '' from the superabundance of the merits of Christ ; it -isaia- founded on his mediation , absolutely depends on it , and draws all its efficacy from it . '' It -isaia- precisely in this sense_that the episode -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee offers us a sort of first announcement of Mary s mediation , wholly oriented towards Christ and tending to the revelation of his salvific power . From the text of John it -isaia- evident that_it_-isaia- a mediation which_-isaia- maternal . As the Council proclaims : Mary became '' a mother to us in the order of grace . '' This motherhood in the order of grace flows from her_divine motherhood . Because she_was , by the design of divine Providence , the mother who nourished the divine Redeemer , Mary became '' an associate of unique nobility , and the Lord s humble handmaid , '' who '' cooperated by her obedience , faith , hope and burning charity in the Savior s work of restoring supernatural life to souls . '' And '' this maternity of Mary in the order of grace . will last without interruption until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect . If John s description of the event -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana presents Mary s caring motherhood -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Christ s messianic activity , another passage from the same Gospel confirms this motherhood in the salvific economy of grace -atti_degli_apostoli- its crowning moment , namely when Christ s sacrifice on the Cross , his Paschal Mystery , -isaia- accomplished . John s description -isaia- concise : '' Standing by the cross of Jesus were his_mother , and his_mother s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene . When Jesus saw his_mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing near , he said to his_mother : Woman , behold your son ! Then he said to the disciple , Behold , your mother ! And from that hour the disciple took her to his_own home '' Jn . Undoubtedly , we find here an expression of the Son s particular solicitude for his Mother , whom he -isaia- leaving in such_great sorrow . And yet the '' testament of Christ s Cross '' says more . Jesus highlights a new relationship_between Mother and Son , the whole truth and reality of which he solemnly confirms . One can say that if Mary s motherhood of the human_race had already_been outlined , now it -isaia- clearly stated and established . It emerges from the definitive accomplishment of the Redeemer s Paschal Mystery . The Mother of Christ , who stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of this_mystery a mystery which embraces each_individual and all humanity -isaia- given as mother to every single individual and all mankind . The man -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross -isaia- John , '' the disciple whom he loved . '' But it -isaia- not he alone . Following tradition , the Council does not_hesitate to call Mary '' the Mother of Christ and mother of mankind '' : since she '' belongs to the offspring of Adam she_-isaia- one_with all human_beings . Indeed she_-isaia- clearly_the mother of the members of Christ . since she cooperated out of love so that_there might be born in the Church the faithful . '' And so this '' new motherhood of Mary , '' generated by faith , -isaia- the fruit of the '' new '' love_which came to definitive maturity in her -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , through_her sharing in the redemptive love of her Son . Thus we find ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of the fulfillment of the promise contained in the Proto gospel : the '' seed of the woman . will crush the head of the serpent '' cf . By his redemptive death Jesus Christ conquers the evil of sin and death -atti_degli_apostoli- its_very roots . It -isaia- significant that , as he speaks to his_mother from the Cross , he calls her '' woman '' and says to her : '' Woman , behold your son ! '' Moreover , he had addressed her by the same term -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana too cf . How can one doubt_that especially now , on Golgotha , this expression goes to the very_heart of the mystery of Mary , and indicates the unique place which_she occupies in the whole economy of salvation ? As the Council teaches , in Mary '' the exalted Daughter of Sion , and after a long expectation of the promise , the times were -atti_degli_apostoli- length fulfilled and the new dispensation established . All this occurred when_the Son of God took a human_nature from her , that_he_might in the mysteries of his flesh free man from sin . '' The words uttered by Jesus from the Cross signify that the motherhood of her who bore Christ finds a '' new '' continuation in the Church and through the Church , symbolized and represented by John . In this_way , she_who as the one '' full of grace '' was brought into the mystery of Christ in order to be his Mother and thus_the Holy Mother of God , through the Church remains in that mystery as '' the woman '' spoken of by the Book of Genesis : -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning and by the Apocalypse : -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the history_of_salvation . In accordance_with_the eternal plan of Providence , Mary s divine motherhood -isaia- to be poured out upon the Church , as indicated by statements of Tradition , according to which Mary s '' motherhood '' of the Church -isaia- the reflection and extension of her motherhood of the Son of God . According to the Council the very moment of the Church s birth and full manifestation to the world enables us to glimpse this continuity of Mary s motherhood : '' Since it pleased God not to manifest solemnly the mystery of the salvation of the human_race until he poured forth the Spirit promised by Christ , we see the Apostles before the day of Pentecost continuing with one mind in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with_his brethren Acts : . We see Mary prayerfully imploring the gift of the Spirit , who had_already overshadowed her in the Annunciation . '' And so , in the redemptive economy of grace , brought_about through the action of the Holy Spirit , there_-isaia- a unique correspondence between_the moment of the Incarnation of the Word and the moment of the birth of the Church . The person_who links these_two moments -isaia- Mary : Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and Mary in the Upper Room -atti_degli_apostoli- Jerusalem . In both cases her discreet yet essential presence indicates the path of '' birth from the Holy Spirit . '' Thus she who_-isaia- present in the mystery of Christ as Mother becomes by the will of the Son and the power of the Holy Spirit present in the mystery of the Church . In the Church too she continues to be a maternal presence , as -isaia- shown by the words spoken from the Cross : '' Woman , behold your son ! '' ; '' Behold , your mother . '' PART II THE MOTHER OF GOD AT THE CENTER OF THE PILGRIM CHURCH . The Church , the People of God present in all the nations of the earth . '' The Church like a pilgrim in a foreign land , presses forward amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God , announcing the Cross and Death of the Lord until he comes cf . '' '' Israel according to the flesh , which wandered as an exile in the desert , was already called the Church of God cf . Likewise the new Israel . -isaia-_also called the Church of Christ cf Mt : . For he has bought it for himself_with his_blood Acts : , has filled it with_his Spirit , and provided it with_those means which befit it as a visible and social unity . God has gathered together as one all those_who in faith look upon Jesus as the author of salvation and the source of unity and peace , and has established them as Church , that_for each and all she may be the visible sacrament of this saving unity . '' The Second Vatican Council speaks of the pilgrim Church , establishing an analogy with the Israel of the Old Covenant journeying through the desert . The journey also_has an external character , visible in the time and space in which it historically takes_place . For the Church '' -isaia- destined to extend to all regions of the earth and so to enter_into the history of mankind , '' but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time '' she transcends all limits of time and of space . '' And yet the essential character of her pilgrimage -isaia- interior : it -isaia-_a_question of a pilgrimage through_faith , by '' the power of the Risen Lord , '' a pilgrimage in the Holy Spirit , given to the Church as the invisible Comforter parakletos cf . : ; : ; : : '' Moving forward through trial and tribulation , the Church -isaia- strengthened by the power of God s grace promised to her by the Lord , so that . moved by the Holy Spirit , she may never cease to renew herself , until through the Cross she arrives -atti_degli_apostoli- the light_which knows no setting . '' It -isaia- precisely in this ecclesial journey or pilgrimage through space and time , and even_more through the history of souls , that Mary -isaia- present , as the one_who_-isaia- '' blessed because_she believed , '' as the one_who advanced on the pilgrimage of faith , sharing unlike any_other creature in the mystery of Christ . The Council further says_that '' Mary figured profoundly in the history_of_salvation and in a certain way unites and mirrors within herself the central truths of the faith . '' Among all believers she_-isaia- like a '' mirror '' in which_are reflected in the most profound and limpid way '' the mighty works of God '' Acts : . Built by Christ upon the Apostles , the Church became fully aware of these mighty works of God on the day of Pentecost , when those gathered together in the Upper Room '' were all filled_with_the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance '' Acts : . From that moment there also begins that journey of faith , the Church s pilgrimage through the history of individuals and peoples . We know_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this journey Mary -isaia- present . We see her in the midst of the Apostles in the Upper Room , '' prayerfully imploring the gift of the Spirit . '' In a sense her journey of faith_-isaia- longer . The Holy Spirit had_already come down upon her , and she became his faithful spouse -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , welcoming the Word of the true God , offering '' the full submission of intellect and will . and freely assenting to the truth revealed by him , '' indeed abandoning herself totally to God through '' the obedience of faith , '' whereby she replied to the angel : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word . '' The journey of faith made by Mary , whom we see praying in the Upper Room , -isaia- thus longer than_that of the others gathered there : Mary '' goes before them , '' '' leads the way '' for them . The moment of Pentecost in Jerusalem had_been prepared_for by the moment of the Annunciation in Nazareth , as well as by the Cross . In the Upper Room Mary s journey meets the Church s journey of faith . In what way ? Among those_who devoted themselves to prayer in the Upper Room , preparing to go '' into the whole_world '' after receiving the Spirit , some had been_called by Jesus gradually from the beginning of his_mission in Israel . Eleven of them had been_made Apostles , and to them Jesus had passed on the mission which he himself had received_from_the Father . '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn . : , he had said to the Apostles after_the Resurrection . And forty days later , before returning to the Father , he had added : '' when_the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you shall be my witnesses . to the end of the earth '' cf . This mission of the Apostles began the moment they left the Upper Room in Jerusalem . The Church -isaia- born and then grows through the testimony that Peter and the Apostles bear to the Crucified and Risen Christ cf . Mary did_not directly receive this_apostolic mission . She was_not among_those whom Jesus sent '' to the whole_world to teach all nations '' cf . : when he conferred this_mission on them . But she_was in the Upper Room , where_the Apostles were preparing to take up this_mission with the coming of the Spirit of Truth : she_was present with_them . In their midst Mary was '' devoted to prayer '' as the '' mother of Jesus '' cf . Acts : , of the Crucified and Risen Christ . And that first group of those_who in faith looked '' upon Jesus as the author of salvation , '' knew that Jesus was_the Son of Mary , and that_she was his Mother , and that as such she_was from the moment of his conception and birth a unique witness to the mystery of Jesus , that mystery which before their_eyes had_been disclosed and confirmed in the Cross and Resurrection . Thus , from the very first moment , the Church '' looked -atti_degli_apostoli- '' Mary through Jesus , just as she '' looked -atti_degli_apostoli- '' Jesus through Mary . For the Church of that_time and of every time Mary -isaia- a singular witness to the years of Jesus infancy and hidden life -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , when_she '' kept all these_things , pondering them in her_heart '' Lk . But above all , in the Church of that_time and of every time Mary was and -isaia-_the_one who_-isaia- '' blessed because_she believed '' ; she_was the first to believe . From the moment of the Annunciation and conception , from the moment of his birth in the stable -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem , Mary followed Jesus step by step in her_maternal pilgrimage of faith . She followed him during the years of his hidden life -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth ; she followed him also during the time after he left home , when he began '' to do and to teach '' cf . Acts : in the midst of Israel . Above all she followed him in the tragic experience of Golgotha . Now , while Mary was with the Apostles in the Upper Room in Jerusalem -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of the Church , her faith , born from the words of the Annunciation , found confirmation . The angel had said to her then : '' You will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus . and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his_kingdom there_will be no end . '' The recent events on Calvary had shrouded that promise in darkness , yet not_even beneath the Cross did Mary s faith fail . She had still remained the one_who , like Abraham , '' in hope believed against hope '' Rom . But it -isaia- only after_the Resurrection that hope had shown its true face and the promise had begun to be transformed into reality . For Jesus , before returning to the Father , had said to the Apostles : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations . lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' cf . Thus had spoken the one_who by his Resurrection had revealed himself as the conqueror of death , as the one_who possessed the kingdom of which , as the angel said , '' there_will be no end . Now , -atti_degli_apostoli- the first dawn of the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the long journey through_faith which began -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost in Jerusalem , Mary was with all those_who were_the seed of the '' new Israel . '' She was present among_them as an exceptional witness to the mystery of Christ . And the Church was assiduous in prayer together_with her , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' contemplated her in the light of the Word made man . For when_the Church '' enters more intimately into the supreme mystery of the Incarnation , '' she thinks of the Mother of Christ with profound reverence and devotion . Mary belongs indissolubly to the mystery of Christ , and she belongs also to the mystery of the Church from the beginning , from the day of the Church s birth . At the basis of what_the Church has_been from the beginning , and of what she must continually become from generation to generation , in the midst of all the nations of the earth , we find the one '' who believed that there_would be a fulfillment of what_was spoken to her from the Lord '' Lk . It -isaia- precisely Mary s faith_which marks the beginning of the new and eternal Covenant of God with_man in Jesus Christ ; this heroic faith of hers '' precedes '' the apostolic witness of the Church , and ever remains in the Church s heart hidden like a special heritage of God s revelation . All those_who from generation to generation accept the apostolic witness of the Church share in that mysterious inheritance , and in a sense share in Mary s faith . Elizabeth s words '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' continue to accompany the Virgin also -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost ; they accompany her from age to age , wherever knowledge of Christ s salvific mystery spreads , through the Church s apostolic witness and service . Thus -isaia- fulfilled the prophecy of the Magnificat : '' All generations will call me blessed ; for he who_-isaia- mighty has done great things for me , and holy -isaia-_his name '' Lk . For knowledge of the mystery of Christ leads us to bless his Mother , in the form of special veneration for the Theotokos . But this veneration always includes a blessing of her faith , for the Virgin of Nazareth became blessed above all through_this faith , in accordance_with Elizabeth s words . Those who from generation to generation among the different peoples and nations of the earth accept with_faith the mystery of Christ , the Incarnate Word and Redeemer of the world , not_only turn with veneration to Mary and confidently have_recourse to her as his Mother , but_also seek in her faith support for their_own . And it -isaia- precisely this lively sharing in Mary s faith_that determines her special place in the Church s pilgrimage as the new People of God throughout_the earth . As the Council says , '' Mary figured profoundly in the history_of_salvation . Hence when she_-isaia- being preached and venerated , she summons the faithful to her Son and his sacrifice , and to love for the Father . '' For this_reason , Mary s faith , according to the Church s apostolic witness , in some_way continues to become the faith of the pilgrim People of God : the faith of individuals and communities , of places and gatherings , and of the various groups existing in the Church . It -isaia- a faith that_-isaia- passed on simultaneously through both the mind and the heart . It -isaia- gained or regained continually through prayer . Therefore , '' the Church in her apostolic work also rightly looks to her who brought forth Christ , conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin , so that_through the Church Christ may be born and increase in the hearts of the faithful also . '' Today , as on this pilgrimage of faith we draw near to the end of the second Christian Millennium , the Church , through the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , calls our attention to her vision of herself , as the '' one People of God . among all the nations of the earth . '' And she reminds us of that_truth according to which all the faithful , though '' scattered throughout_the_world , are in communion with each_other in the Holy Spirit . '' We can therefore say that in this union the mystery of Pentecost -isaia- continually being accomplished . At the same_time , the Lord s apostles and disciples , in all the nations of the earth , '' devote_themselves to prayer together_with Mary , the mother of Jesus '' Acts : . As they constitute from generation to generation the '' sign of the Kingdom '' which_-isaia-_not of his world , they are_also aware_that in the midst of this_world they_must gather around that King to whom_the nations have been_given in heritage cf . : , to whom_the Father has_given '' the throne of David his_father , '' so that he '' will reign over the house of Jacob for ever , and of his_kingdom there_will he no end . '' During this_time of vigil , Mary , through the same faith_which made her blessed , especially from the moment of the Annunciation , -isaia- present in the Church s mission , present in the Church s work of introducing into_the_world the Kingdom of her Son . This presence of Mary finds many_different expressions in our_day , just as it did throughout_the Church s history . It also_has a wide field of action . Through the faith and piety of individual believers ; through the traditions of Christian families or '' domestic churches , '' of parish and missionary communities , religious institutes and dioceses ; through the radiance and attraction of the great shrines where not_only individuals or local groups , but sometimes whole nations and societies , even whole continents , seek to meet_the Mother of the Lord , the one_who_-isaia- blessed because_she believed -isaia-_the_first among believers and therefore became the Mother of Emmanuel . This -isaia- the message of the Land of Palestine , the spiritual homeland of all Christians because it was_the homeland of the Savior of the world and of his Mother . This -isaia- the message of the many churches in Rome and throughout_the_world which_have_been raised up in the course of the centuries by the faith of Christians . This -isaia- the message of centers like Guadalupe , Lourdes , Fatima and the others situated in the various countries . Among them how could I fail to mention the one in my own native land , Jasna Gora ? One could perhaps speak of a specific '' geography '' of faith and Marian devotion , which includes all these special places of pilgrimage where_the People of God seek to meet_the Mother of God in order to find , within_the radius of the maternal presence of her '' who believed , '' a strengthening of their_own faith . For in Mary s faith , first -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and then fully -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , an interior space was reopened within humanity which_the eternal Father can fill '' with every spiritual blessing . '' It -isaia- the space '' of the new and eternal Covenant , '' and it continues to exist in the Church , which in Christ -isaia- '' a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind . '' In the faith_which Mary professed -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation as the '' handmaid of the Lord '' and in which_she constantly '' precedes '' the pilgrim People of God throughout_the earth , the Church '' strives energetically and constantly to bring all humanity . back to Christ its Head in the unity of his Spirit . The Church s journey and the unity of all Christians . '' In all of Christ s disciples the Spirit arouses the desire to be peacefully united , in the manner determined by Christ , as one flock under one shepherd . '' The journey of the Church , especially in our own_time , -isaia- marked by the sign of ecumenism : Christians are seeking ways to restore that unity_which Christ implored from the Father for his_disciples on the day before his Passion : '' That they_may all be one ; even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you that_they also may be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn . The unity of Christ s disciples , therefore , -isaia- a great sign given in order to kindle faith in the world while their division constitutes a scandal . The ecumenical movement , on the basis of a clearer and more widespread awareness of the urgent_need to achieve the unity of all Christians , has found on the part of the Catholic Church its culminating expression in the work of the Second Vatican Council : Christians must deepen in themselves and each of their communities that '' obedience of faith '' of which Mary -isaia-_the_first and brightest example . And since she '' shines_forth on earth , . as a sign of sure hope and solace for the pilgrim People of God , '' '' it gives great joy and comfort to this most_holy Synod that among the divided brethren , too , there are_those_who live due honor to the Mother of our Lord and Savior . This -isaia-_especially so among the Easterners . Christians know that_their unity will be truly rediscovered only if it -isaia- based on the unity of their_faith . They must resolve considerable discrepancies of doctrine concerning the mystery and ministry of the Church , and sometimes also concerning the role of Mary in the work of salvation . The dialogues begun by the Catholic Church with the Churches and Ecclesial Communities of the West are steadily converging upon these_two inseparable aspects of the same mystery of salvation . If the mystery of the Word made_flesh enables us to glimpse the mystery of the divine motherhood and -isaia- , in turn , contemplation of the Mother of God brings us to a more profound understanding of the mystery of the Incarnation , then the same must be said for the mystery of the Church and Mary s role in the work of salvation . By a more profound study of both Mary and the Church , clarifying each by the light of the other , Christians who_are eager to do what Jesus tells them as their Mother recommends cf . : will_be_able to go forward together on this '' pilgrimage of faith . '' Mary , who_-isaia- still the model of this pilgrimage , -isaia- to lead_them to the unity which_-isaia- willed by their one Lord and so much desired by those_who_are attentively listening to what '' the Spirit -isaia- saying to the Churches '' today Rev . Meanwhile , it -isaia- a hopeful sign that_these Churches and Ecclesial Communities are finding agreement with the Catholic Church on fundamental points of Christian belief , including matters relating to the Virgin Mary . For they recognize her as the Mother of the Lord and hold that_this forms part of our_faith in Christ , true God and true man . They look to her who -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross accepts as her_son the beloved disciple , the one_who in his turn accepts her as his_mother . Therefore , why should we not all together look to her as our_common Mother , who prays for the unity of God s family and who '' precedes '' us all -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the long line of witnesses of faith in the one Lord , the Son of God , who_was conceived in her virginal womb by the power of the Holy Spirit ? . On the other_hand , I wish to emphasize how profoundly the Catholic Church , the Orthodox Church and the ancient Churches of the East feel united by love and praise of the Theotokos . Not only '' basic dogmas of the Christian faith concerning the Trinity and God s Word made_flesh of the Virgin Mary were defined in Ecumenical Councils held in the East , '' but_also in their liturgical worship '' the Orientals pay high tribute , in very beautiful hymns , to Mary ever Virgin . God s Most Holy Mother . '' The brethren of these Churches have experienced a complex history , but_it_-isaia- one_that has_always_been marked by an intense desire_for Christian commitment and apostolic activity , despite frequent persecution , even to the point of bloodshed . It -isaia- a history of fidelity to the Lord , an authentic '' pilgrimage of faith '' in space and time , during which Eastern Christians have_always looked with boundless trust to the Mother of the Lord , celebrated her with praise and invoked her with unceasing prayer . In the difficult moments of their troubled Christian existence , '' they have_taken refuge under her protection , '' conscious of having in her a powerful aid . The Churches which profess the doctrine of Ephesus proclaim_the Virgin as '' true Mother of God , '' since '' our Lord Jesus Christ , born of the Father before time began according_to_his divinity , in the last days , for our sake and for our_salvation , was himself begotten of Mary , the Virgin Mother of God according_to_his humanity . '' The Greek Fathers and the Byzantine tradition contemplating the Virgin in the light of the Word made_flesh , have sought to penetrate the depth of that bond which unites Mary , as the Mother of God , to Christ and the Church : the Virgin -isaia- a permanent presence in the whole reality of the salvific mystery . The Coptic and Ethiopian traditions were introduced to this contemplation of the mystery of Mary by St . Cyril of Alexandria , and in their turn they_have celebrated it with a profuse poetic blossoming . The poetic genius of St . Ephrem the Syrian , called '' the lyre of the Holy Spirit , '' tirelessly sang of Mary , leaving a still living mark on the whole tradition of the Syriac Church . In his panegyric of the Theot\u00f3kos , St . Gregory of Narek , one of the outstanding glories of Armenia , with powerful poetic inspiration ponders the different aspects of the mystery of the Incarnation , and each of them -isaia- for him an occasion to sing and extol the extraordinary dignity and magnificent beauty of the Virgin Mary , Mother of the Word made_flesh . It does_not surprise us therefore that Mary occupies a privileged place in the worship or the ancient Oriental Churches with an incomparable abundance of feasts and hymns . In the Byzantine liturgy , in all the hours of the Divine Office , praise of the Mother -isaia- linked_with praise of her Son and with the praise which , through the Son , -isaia- offered up to the Father in the Holy Spirit . In the Anaphora or Eucharistic Prayer of St . John Chrysostom , immediately after_the epiclesis the assembled community sings in honor of the Mother of God : '' It -isaia- truly just to proclaim you blessed , O Mother of God , who are_most blessed , all pure and Mother of our God . We magnify you_who are_more honorable than the Cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim . You who , without losing your virginity , gave birth to the Word of God . You who_are truly the Mother of God . '' These praises , which in every celebration of the Eucharistic Liturgy are offered to Mary , have moulded the faith , piety and prayer of the faithful . In the course of the centuries they_have permeated their whole spiritual outlook , fostering in them a profound devotion to the '' All Holy Mother of God . This year there occurs the twelfth centenary of the Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea . Putting an end to the wellknown controversy about the cult of sacred images , this Council defined that , according to the teaching of the holy Fathers and the universal tradition of the Church , there could be exposed for the veneration of the faithful , together_with_the Cross , also images of the Mother of God , of the angels and of the saints , in churches and houses and -atti_degli_apostoli- the roadside . This custom has_been maintained in the whole of the East and also in the West . Images of the Virgin have a place of honor in churches and houses . In them Mary -isaia- represented in a number of ways : as the throne of God carrying the Lord and giving him to humanity Theotokos ; as the way_that leads to Christ and manifests him Hodegetria ; as a praying figure in an attitude of intercession and as a sign of the divine presence on the journey of the faithful until the day of the Lord Deesis ; as the protectress who stretches out her mantle over the peoples Pokrov , or as the merciful Virgin of tenderness Eleousa . She -isaia- usually represented with_her Son , the child Jesus , in her arms : it -isaia- the relationship_with the Son which glorifies the Mother . Sometimes she embraces him_with tenderness Glykophilousa ; -atti_degli_apostoli- other times she_-isaia- a hieratic figure , apparently rapt in contemplation of him_who_-isaia- the Lord of history cf . It -isaia-_also appropriate to mention the icon of Our Lady of Vladimir , which continually accompanied the pilgrimage of faith of the peoples of ancient Rus . The first Millennium of the conversion of those noble lands to Christianity -isaia- approaching : lands of humble folk , of thinkers and of saints . The Icons are_still venerated in the Ukraine , in Byelorussia and in Russia under various titles . They are images which witness to the faith and spirit of prayer of that people , who sense the presence and protection of the Mother of God . In these Icons the Virgin shines as the image of divine beauty , the abode of Eternal Wisdom , the figure of the one_who prays , the prototype of contemplation , the image of glory : she_who even in her earthly life possessed the spiritual knowledge inaccessible to human reasoning and who attained through_faith the most sublime knowledge . I also recall_the Icon of the Virgin of the Cenacle , praying with the Apostles as they awaited the Holy Spirit : could she not become the sign of hope_for all those_who , in fraternal dialogue , wish to deepen their obedience of faith ? . Such a wealth of praise , built up by the different_forms of the Church s great tradition , could help us to hasten the day when_the Church can begin once_more to breathe fully with_her '' two lungs , '' the East and the West . As I have often said , this_-isaia- more_than_ever necessary today . It would be an effective aid in furthering the progress of the dialogue already taking place between_the Catholic Church and the Churches and Ecclesial Communities of the West . It would also be the way_for the pilgrim Church to sing and to live more perfectly her '' Magnificat . The '' Magnificat '' of the pilgrim Church . At the present stage of her journey , therefore , the Church seeks to rediscover the unity of all who profess their_faith in Christ , in order to show obedience to her Lord , who prayed for this_unity before his Passion . '' Like a pilgrim in a foreign land , the Church presses forward amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God , announcing the Cross and Death of the Lord until he comes . '' '' Moving forward through trial and tribulation , the Church -isaia- strengthened by the power of God s grace promised to her by the Lord , so that in the weakness of the flesh she may_not waver from perfect fidelity , but remain a bride worthy of her Lord ; that moved by the Holy Spirit she may never cease to renew herself , until through the Cross she arrives -atti_degli_apostoli- the light_which knows no setting . '' The Virgin Mother -isaia- constantly present on this journey of faith of the People of God towards_the light . This -isaia- shown in a special_way by the canticle of the '' Magnificat , '' which , having welled up from the depths of Mary s faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the Visitation , ceaselessly re echoes in the heart of the Church down_the_centuries . This -isaia- proved by its daily recitation in the liturgy of Vespers and -atti_degli_apostoli- many_other moments of both personal and communal devotion . '' My soul magnifies the Lord , and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior , for he has looked on his servant in her lowliness . For behold , henceforth all generations will call me blessed ; for he who_-isaia- mighty has done great things for me , and holy -isaia-_his name : and his_mercy -isaia- from age to age on those_who fear him . He has shown strength with_his arm , he has scattered the proud hearted , he has cast down the mighty from their thrones , and lifted up the lowly ; he has filled the hungry with_good things , sent the rich away empty . He has helped his servant Israel , remembering his_mercy , as he spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his posterity for ever . When Elizabeth greeted her young kinswoman coming from Nazareth , Mary replied with the Magnificat . In her greeting , Elizabeth first called Mary '' blessed '' because of '' the fruit of her womb , '' and then she called her '' blessed '' because of her faith cf . These two blessings referred directly to the Annunciation . Now , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Visitation , when Elizabeth s greeting bears_witness to that culminating moment , Mary s faith acquires a new consciousness and a new expression . That which remained hidden in the depths of the '' obedience of faith '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation can now be said to spring forth like a clear and life_giving flame of the spirit . The words used by Mary on the threshold of Elizabeth s house are an inspired profession of her faith , in which her response to the revealed word_-isaia- expressed with the religious and poetical exultation of her whole being towards God . In these sublime words , which_are simultaneously very simple and wholly inspired by the sacred texts of the people of Israel , Mary s personal experience , the ecstasy of her_heart , shines_forth . In them shines a ray of the mystery of God , the glory of his ineffable holiness , the eternal love_which , as an irrevocable gift , enters into human_history . Mary -isaia-_the_first to share in this_new revelation of God and , within_the same , in this_new '' self_giving '' of God . Therefore she proclaims : '' For he who_-isaia- mighty has done great things for me , and holy -isaia-_his name . '' Her words reflect a joy of spirit which_-isaia- difficult to express : '' My spirit rejoices in God my Savior . '' Indeed , '' the deepest truth_about God and the salvation of man_-isaia- made clear to us in Christ , who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the mediator and the fullness of all revelation . '' In her exultation Mary confesses that_she finds herself in the very_heart of this fullness of Christ . She -isaia- conscious that the promise made to the fathers , first of all '' to Abraham and to his posterity for ever , '' -isaia- being fulfilled in herself . She -isaia- thus aware_that concentrated within herself as the mother of Christ -isaia- the whole salvific economy , in which '' from age to age '' -isaia- manifested he who as the God of the Covenant , '' remembers his_mercy . The Church , which from the beginning has modelled her earthly journey on that of the Mother of God , constantly repeats after her the words of the Magnificat . From the depths of the Virgin s faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and the Visitation , the Church derives the truth_about the God of the Covenant : the God who_-isaia- Almighty and does '' great things '' for_man : '' holy -isaia-_his name . '' In the Magnificat the Church sees uprooted that sin which_-isaia- found -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset of the earthly history of man_and_woman , the sin of disbelief and of '' little faith '' in God . In contrast with the '' suspicion '' which_the '' father of lies '' sowed in the heart of Eve the first woman , Mary , whom tradition -isaia- wont to call the '' new Eve '' and the true '' Mother of the living , '' boldly proclaims_the undimmed truth_about God : the holy and almighty God , who from the beginning -isaia-_the_source of all gifts , he who '' has done great things '' in her , as well as in the whole universe . In the act of creation God gives existence to all that_-isaia- . In creating man , God gives him the dignity of the image_and_likeness of himself in a special_way as compared with all earthly creatures . Moreover , in his desire to give God gives himself in the Son , notwithstanding man s sin : '' He so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son '' Jn . Mary -isaia-_the_first witness of this marvelous truth , which_will be fully accomplished through '' the works and words '' cf . Acts : of her Son and definitively through_his Cross and Resurrection . The Church , which even '' amid trials and tribulations '' does not_cease repeating with Mary the words of the Magnificat , -isaia- sustained by the power of God s truth , proclaimed on that occasion with_such extraordinary simplicity . At the same_time , by means of this truth_about God , the Church desires to shed light upon the difficult and sometimes tangled paths of man s earthly existence . The Church s journey , therefore , near the end of the second Christian Millennium , involves a renewed commitment to her_mission . Following him_who said of himself : '' God has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor '' cf . : , the Church has sought from generation to generation and still seeks today to accomplish that_same mission . The Church s love of preference for the poor -isaia- wonderfully inscribed in Mary s Magnificat . The God of the Covenant , celebrated in the exultation of her spirit by the Virgin of Nazareth , -isaia-_also he who '' has cast down the mighty from their thrones , and lifted up the lowly , . filled the hungry with_good things , sent the rich away empty , . scattered the proud hearted . and his_mercy -isaia- from age to age on those_who fear him . '' Mary -isaia- deeply imbued_with the spirit of the '' poor of Yahweh , '' who in the prayer of the Psalms awaited from God their salvation , placing all their trust in him cf . Mary truly proclaims_the coming of the '' Messiah of the poor '' cf . Drawing from Mary s heart , from the depth of her faith expressed in the words of the Magnificat , the Church renews ever more_effectively in herself the awareness_that the truth_about God who saves , the truth_about God who -isaia-_the_source of every gift , cannot be separated_from the manifestation of his_love of preference for the poor and humble , that love_which , celebrated in the Magnificat , -isaia- later expressed in the words and works of Jesus . The Church -isaia- thus aware and -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time this awareness -isaia- particularly vivid not_only that_these two elements of the message contained in the Magnificat cannot be separated , but_also that_there_-isaia- a duty to safeguard carefully the importance of '' the poor '' and of '' the option in favor of the poor '' in the word of the living God . These are matters and questions intimately connected_with_the Christian meaning of freedom and liberation . '' Mary -isaia- totally dependent upon God and completely directed towards him , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of her Son , she -isaia-_the_most perfect image of freedom and of the liberation of humanity and of the universe . It -isaia- to her as Mother and Model that the Church must look in order to understand in its completeness the meaning of her_own mission . '' PART III MATERNAL MEDIATION . Mary , the Handmaid of the Lord . The Church knows and teaches with Saint Paul that_there_-isaia- only_one mediator : '' For there_-isaia-_one God , and there_-isaia-_one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself as a ransom for all '' Tim . '' The maternal role of Mary towards people in no way obscures or diminishes the unique mediation of Christ , but_rather shows its power '' : it -isaia- mediation in Christ . The Church knows and teaches_that '' all the saving influences of the Blessed Virgin on mankind originate . from the divine pleasure . They flow forth_from the superabundance of the merits of Christ , rest on his mediation , depend entirely on it , and draw all their_power from it . In no way do they impede the immediate union of the faithful with Christ . Rather , they foster this union . '' This saving influence -isaia- sustained by the Holy Spirit , who , just as he overshadowed the Virgin Mary when he began in her the divine motherhood , in a similar way constantly sustains her solicitude for the brothers_and_sisters of her Son . In effect , Mary s mediation -isaia- intimately linked_with her motherhood . It possesses a specifically maternal character , which distinguishes it from the mediation of the other creatures who in various and always subordinate ways share in the one mediation of Christ , although her_own mediation -isaia-_also a shared mediation . In fact , while it -isaia- true_that '' no creature could ever be classed with the Incarnate Word and Redeemer , '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' the unique mediation of the Redeemer does_not exclude but_rather gives_rise among creatures to a manifold cooperation which_-isaia- but a sharing in this unique source . '' And thus '' the one goodness of God -isaia- in reality communicated diversely to his creatures . '' The teaching of the Second Vatican Council presents the truth of Mary s mediation as '' a sharing in the one unique source that_-isaia- the mediation of Christ himself . '' Thus we read : '' The Church does not_hesitate to profess this subordinate role of Mary . She experiences it continuously and commends it to the hearts of the faithful , so that , encouraged by this maternal help , they_may more_closely adhere to the Mediator and Redeemer . '' This role -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time special and extraordinary . It flows from her_divine motherhood and can be understood and lived in faith only on the basis of the full truth of this motherhood . Since by virtue of divine election Mary -isaia- the earthly Mother of the Father s consubstantial Son and his '' generous companion '' in the work of redemption '' she_-isaia- a mother to us in the order of grace . '' This role constitutes a real dimension of her presence in the saving mystery of Christ and the Church . From this point_of_view we must consider once_more the fundamental event in the economy of salvation , namely the Incarnation of the Word -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Annunciation . It -isaia- significant that Mary , recognizing in the words of the divine messenger the will of the Most High and submitting to his_power , says : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk . The first moment of submission to the one mediation '' between God and men '' the mediation of Jesus Christ -isaia- the Virgin of Nazareth s acceptance of motherhood . Mary consents to God s choice , in order to become through the power of the Holy Spirit the Mother of the Son of God . It can_be_said that a consent to motherhood -isaia- above all a result of her total selfgiving to God in virginity . Mary accepted her election as Mother of the Son of God , guided by spousal love , the love_which totally '' consecrates '' a human_being to God . By virtue of this_love , Mary wished to be always and in all things '' given to God , '' living in virginity . The words '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord '' express the fact_that from the outset she accepted and understood her_own motherhood as a total gift_of_self , a gift of her person to the service of the saving plans of the Most High . And to the very end she lived her entire maternal sharing in the life of Jesus Christ , her Son , in a way_that matched her vocation to virginity . Mary s motherhood , completely pervaded by her spousal attitude as the '' handmaid of the Lord , '' constitutes the first and fundamental dimension of that mediation which_the Church confesses and proclaims in her regard and continually '' commends to the hearts of the faithful , '' since_the Church has great trust in her . For it must be recognized that before anyone else it was God himself , the Eternal Father , who entrusted himself to the Virgin of Nazareth , giving her his_own Son in the mystery of the Incarnation . Her election to the supreme office and dignity of Mother of the Son of God refers , on the ontological level , to the very reality of the union of the two natures in the person of the Word hypostatic union . This basic fact of being the Mother of the Son of God -isaia- from the very_beginning a complete openness to the person of Christ , to his whole work , to his whole mission . The words '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord '' testify to Mary s openness of spirit : she perfectly unites in herself the love proper to virginity and the love characteristic of motherhood , which_are joined and , as it were , fused together . For this_reason Mary became not_only the '' nursing mother '' of the Son of Man but_also the '' associate of unique nobility '' of the Messiah and Redeemer . As I have_already said , she advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , and in this pilgrimage to the foot of the Cross there_was simultaneously accomplished her_maternal cooperation_with the Savior s whole mission through_her actions and sufferings . Along the path of this collaboration with the work of her Son , the Redeemer , Mary s motherhood itself underwent a singular transformation , becoming ever_more imbued_with '' burning charity '' towards all those_to_whom Christ s mission was directed . Through this '' burning charity , '' which sought to achieve , in union with Christ , the restoration of '' supernatural life to souls , '' Mary entered , in a way all her_own , into the one mediation '' between God and men '' which_-isaia- the mediation of the man Christ Jesus . If she_was the first to experience within herself the supernatural consequences of this one mediation in the Annunciation she had_been greeted as '' full of grace '' then we must say that_through this fullness of grace and supernatural life she_was especially predisposed to cooperation_with Christ , the one Mediator of human salvation . And such cooperation -isaia- precisely this mediation subordinated to the mediation of Christ . In Mary s case we have a special and exceptional mediation , based upon her '' fullness of grace , '' which_was expressed in the complete willingness of the '' handmaid of the Lord . '' In response to this interior willingness of his Mother , Jesus Christ prepared her ever_more completely to become for all people their '' mother in the order of grace . '' This -isaia- indicated , -atti_degli_apostoli- least indirectly , by certain details noted by the Synoptics cf . : and still_more so by the Gospel of John cf . : ; : , which I have_already mentioned . Particularly eloquent in this_regard are the words spoken by Jesus on the Cross to Mary and John . After the events of the Resurrection and Ascension Mary entered the Upper Room together_with_the Apostles to await Pentecost , and was present there as the Mother of the glorified Lord . She was not_only the one_who '' advanced in her pilgrimage of faith '' and loyally persevered in her union with_her Son '' unto the Cross , '' but she was_also the '' handmaid of the Lord , '' left by her Son as Mother in the midst of the infant Church : '' Behold your mother . '' Thus there began to develop a special bond_between this Mother and the Church . For the infant Church was_the fruit of the Cross and Resurrection of her Son . Mary , who from the beginning had given herself without reserve to the person and work of her Son , could_not but pour out upon the Church , from the very_beginning , her_maternal self_giving . After her Son s departure , her motherhood remains in the Church as maternal mediation : interceding for all her_children , the Mother cooperates in the saving work of her Son , the Redeemer of the world . In fact the Council teaches_that the '' motherhood of Mary in the order of grace . will last without interruption until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect . '' With the redeeming death of her Son , the maternal mediation of the handmaid of the Lord took on a universal dimension , for the work of redemption embraces the whole of humanity . Thus there_-isaia- manifested in a singular way the efficacy of the one and universal mediation of Christ '' between God and men '' Mary s cooperation shares , in its subordinate character , in the universality of the mediation of the Redeemer , the one Mediator . This -isaia- clearly indicated by the Council in the words quoted above . '' For , '' the text goes on , '' taken up to heaven , she did_not lay aside this saving role , but by her manifold acts of intercession continues to win for us gifts of eternal_salvation . '' With this character of '' intercession , '' first manifested -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee , Mary s mediation continues in the history of the Church and the world . We read that Mary '' by her_maternal charity , cares for the brethren of her Son who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties , until they_are led to their happy homeland . '' In this_way Mary s motherhood continues unceasingly in the Church as the mediation which intercedes , and the Church expresses her faith in this_truth by invoking Mary '' under the titles of Advocate , Auxiliatrix , Adjutrix and Mediatrix . Through her mediation , subordinate to that of the Redeemer , Mary contributes in a special_way to the union of the pilgrim Church on earth with the eschatological and heavenly reality of the Communion of Saints , since she has_already_been '' assumed into_heaven . '' The truth of the Assumption , defined by Pius XII , -isaia- reaffirmed by the Second Vatican Council , which thus expresses the Church s faith : '' Preserved free_from all guilt of original_sin , the Immaculate Virgin was taken up body_and_soul into heavenly glory upon the completion of her earthly sojourn . She was exalted by the Lord as Queen of the Universe , in order_that she might be the more thoroughly conformed to her Son , the Lord of lords cf . : and the conqueror of sin and death . '' In this_teaching Pius XII was in continuity with Tradition , which_has found many_different expressions in the history of the Church , both in the East and in the West . By the mystery of the Assumption into_heaven there_were definitively accomplished in Mary all the effects of the one mediation of Christ the Redeemer of the world and Risen Lord : '' In Christ shall all be made alive . But each in his_own order : Christ the first fruits , then -atti_degli_apostoli- his coming those_who belong to Christ '' Cor . In the mystery of the Assumption -isaia- expressed the faith of the Church , according to which Mary -isaia- '' united by a close and indissoluble bond '' to Christ , for , if as Virgin and Mother she_was singularly united with_him in his_first coming , so through_her continued collaboration with_him she will_also be united with_him in expectation of the second ; '' redeemed in an especially sublime manner by reason of the merits of her Son , '' she also_has that specifically maternal role of mediatrix of mercy -atti_degli_apostoli- his final coming , when all those_who belong to Christ '' shall be made alive , '' when '' the last enemy to be destroyed -isaia- death '' Cor . '' Connected with this exaltation of the noble '' Daughter of Sion '' through_her Assumption into_heaven -isaia- the mystery of her eternal glory . For the Mother of Christ -isaia- glorified as '' Queen of the Universe . '' She who -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation called herself the '' handmaid of the Lord '' remained throughout her earthly life faithful to what this name expresses . In this she confirmed that_she was a true '' disciple '' of Christ , who strongly emphasized that his_mission was one of service : the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mt . In this_way Mary became the first of those_who , '' serving Christ also in others , with humility and patience lead their brothers_and_sisters to that King whom to serve -isaia- to reign , '' and she fully obtained that '' state of royal freedom '' proper to Christ s disciples : to serve means to reign ! '' Christ obeyed even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of death , and was therefore raised up by the Father cf . Thus he entered into the glory of his_kingdom . To him all things_are made subject until he subjects himself and all created things to the Father , that God may be all in all cf . '' Mary , the handmaid of the Lord , has a share in this Kingdom of the Son . The glory of serving does not_cease to be her royal exaltation : assumed into_heaven , she_does not_cease her saving service , which expresses her_maternal mediation '' until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect . '' Thus , she_who here on earth '' loyally preserved in her union with_her Son unto the Cross , '' continues to remain united with_him , while now '' all things_are subjected to him , until he subjects to the Father himself and all things . '' Thus in her Assumption into_heaven , Mary -isaia- as it were clothed by the whole reality of the Communion of Saints , and her very union with the Son in glory -isaia- wholly oriented towards_the definitive fullness of the Kingdom , when '' God will be all in all . '' In this phase too Mary s maternal mediation does not_cease to be subordinate to him_who -isaia-_the_one Mediator , until the final realization of '' the fullness_of_time , '' that_-isaia- to say until '' all things are_united in Christ '' cf . Mary in the life of the Church and of every Christian . Linking itself with Tradition , the Second Vatican Council brought new light to bear on the role of the Mother of Christ in the life of the Church . '' Through the gift . of divine motherhood , Mary -isaia- united with_her Son , the Redeemer , and with_his singular graces and offices . By these , the Blessed Virgin -isaia-_also intimately united with the Church : the Mother of God -isaia- a figure of the Church in the matter of faith , charity and perfect union with Christ . '' We have_already noted how , from the beginning , Mary remains with the Apostles in expectation of Pentecost and how , as '' the blessed one_who believed , '' she_-isaia- present in the midst of the pilgrim Church from generation to generation through_faith and as the model of the hope which_does_not disappoint cf . Mary believed in the fulfillment of what had been_said to her by the Lord . As Virgin , she believed that_she would conceive and bear a son : the '' Holy One , '' who bears the name of '' Son of God , '' the name '' Jesus '' God who saves . As handmaid of the Lord , she remained in perfect fidelity to the person and mission of this Son . As Mother , '' believing and obeying . she brought forth on earth the Father s Son . This she did , knowing not man but overshadowed by the Holy Spirit . '' For these reasons Mary -isaia- honored in the Church '' with_special reverence . Indeed , from most ancient times the Blessed Virgin Mary has_been venerated under the title of God bearer . In all perils and needs , the faithful have fled prayerfully to her protection . '' This cult -isaia- altogether special : it bears in itself and expresses the profound link which exists between_the Mother of Christ and the Church . As Virgin and Mother , Mary remains for the Church a '' permanent model . '' It can therefore be said_that especially under this aspect , namely as a model , or rather as a '' figure , '' Mary , present in the mystery of Christ , remains constantly present also in the mystery of the Church . For the Church too -isaia- '' called mother and virgin , '' and these names have a profound biblical and theological justification . The Church '' becomes herself a mother by accepting God s word with fidelity . '' Like Mary , who first believed by accepting the word of God revealed to her -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and by remaining faithful to that word in all her trials even unto the Cross , so too the Church becomes a mother when , accepting with fidelity the word of God , '' by her preaching and by baptism she brings forth to a new and immortal life children who_are conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of God . '' This '' maternal '' characteristic of the Church was expressed in a particularly vivid way by the Apostle to the Gentiles when he wrote : '' My little children , with whom I -amos- again in travail until Christ be formed in you ! '' Gal . : These words of Saint Paul contain an interesting sign of the early Church s awareness of her_own motherhood , linked to her apostolic service to mankind . This awareness enabled and still enables the Church to see the mystery of her life_and_mission modelled upon the example of the Mother of the Son , who_-isaia- '' the first born among many brethren '' Rom . It can_be_said that_from Mary the Church also learns her_own motherhood : she recognizes the maternal dimension of her vocation , which_-isaia- essentially bound to her sacramental nature , in '' contemplating Mary s mysterious sanctity , imitating her charity and faithfully fulfilling the Father s will . '' If the Church -isaia- the sign and instrument of intimate_union with God , she_-isaia- so by reason of her motherhood , because , receiving life from the Spirit , she '' generates '' sons_and_daughters of the human_race to a new_life in Christ . For , just as Mary -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the mystery of the Incarnation , so the Church -isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the mystery of adoption to sonship through grace . Likewise , following_the_example of Mary , the Church remains the virgin faithful to her spouse : The Church herself -isaia- a virgin who keeps whole and pure the fidelity she_has pledged to her Spouse . '' For the Church -isaia- the spouse of Christ , as -isaia- clear from the Pauline Letters cf . : , and from the title found in John : '' bride of the Lamb '' Rev . If the Church as spouse '' keeps the fidelity she_has pledged to Christ , '' this fidelity , even_though in the Apostle s teaching it has become an image of marriage cf . : , also_has value as a model of total self_giving to God in celibacy '' for the kingdom_of_heaven , '' in virginity consecrated to God cf . Precisely such virginity , after_the example of the Virgin of Nazareth , -isaia-_the_source of a special spiritual fruitfulness : it -isaia-_the_source of motherhood in the Holy Spirit . But the Church also preserves the faith received_from Christ . Following the example of Mary , who kept and pondered in her_heart everything relating to her_divine Son cf . : , , the Church -isaia- committed to preserving the word of God and investigating its riches with discernment and prudence , in order to bear faithful witness to it before all mankind in every_age . Given Mary s relationship to the Church as an exemplar , the Church -isaia- close to her and seeks to become like her : '' Imitating the Mother of her Lord , and by the power of the Holy Spirit , she preserves with virginal purity an integral faith , a firm hope , and a sincere charity . '' Mary -isaia- thus present in the mystery of the Church as a model . But the Church s mystery also consists in generating people to a new and immortal life : this_-isaia- her motherhood in the Holy Spirit . And here Mary -isaia-_not_only the model and figure of the Church ; she_-isaia- much_more . For , '' with maternal love she cooperates in the birth and development '' of the sons_and_daughters of Mother Church . The Church s motherhood -isaia- accomplished not_only according to the model and figure of the Mother of God but also_with her '' cooperation . '' The Church draws abundantly from this cooperation , that_-isaia- to say from the maternal mediation which_-isaia- characteristic of Mary , insofar as already on earth she cooperated in the rebirth and development of the Church s sons_and_daughters , as the Mother of that Son whom_the Father '' placed as the first born among many brethren . '' She cooperated , as the Second Vatican Council teaches , with a maternal love . Here we perceive the real value of the words spoken by Jesus to his Mother -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of the Cross : '' Woman , behold your son '' and to the disciple : '' Behold your mother '' Jn . They are words_which determine Mary s place in the life of Christ s disciples and they express as I have_already said the new motherhood of the Mother of the Redeemer : a spiritual motherhood , born from the heart of the Paschal Mystery of the Redeemer of the world . It -isaia- a motherhood in the order of grace , for it implores the gift of the Spirit , who raises up the new children of God , redeems through the sacrifice of Christ that Spirit whom Mary too , together_with_the Church , received on the day of Pentecost . Her motherhood -isaia- particularly noted and experienced by the Christian people -atti_degli_apostoli- the Sacred Banquet the liturgical celebration of the mystery of the Redemption -atti_degli_apostoli- which Christ , his true body born of the Virgin Mary , becomes present . The piety of the Christian people has_always very rightly sensed a profound link between devotion to the Blessed Virgin and worship of the Eucharist : this_-isaia- a fact_that can be seen in the liturgy of both the West and the East , in the traditions of the Religious Families , in the modern movements of spirituality , including those for youth , and in the pastoral practice of the Marian Shrines . Mary guides the faithful to the Eucharist . Of the essence of motherhood -isaia- the fact_that it concerns the person . Motherhood always establishes a unique and unrepeatable relationship_between two people : between mother and child and between child and mother . Even when_the same woman -isaia- the mother of many children , her personal relationship_with each_one of them -isaia- of the very essence of motherhood . For each child -isaia- generated in a unique and unrepeatable way , and this_-isaia- true both_for the mother and for the child . Each child -isaia- surrounded in the same_way by that maternal love on which_are based the child s development and coming to maturity as a human_being . It can_be_said that motherhood '' in the order of grace '' preserves the analogy with what '' in the order of nature '' characterizes the union between mother and child . In the light of this_fact it becomes easier to understand why in Christ s testament on Golgotha his Mother s new motherhood -isaia- expressed in the singular , in reference to one man : '' Behold your son . '' lt can_also be said that_these same words fully show the reason_for the Marian dimension of the life of Christ s disciples . This -isaia- true not_only of John , who -atti_degli_apostoli- that hour stood -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross together_with his Master s Mother , but_it_-isaia- also true of every disciple of Christ , of every Christian . The Redeemer entrusts his_mother to the disciple , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time he gives her to him as his_mother . Mary s motherhood , which becomes man s inheritance , -isaia-_a_gift : a gift_which Christ himself makes personally to every_individual . The Redeemer entrusts Mary to John because he entrusts John to Mary . At the foot of the Cross there begins that special entrusting of humanity to the Mother of Christ , which in the history of the Church has_been practiced and expressed in different_ways . The same Apostle and Evangelist , after reporting the words addressed by Jesus on the Cross to his Mother and to himself , adds : '' And from that hour the disciple took her to his_own home '' Jn . This statement certainly means_that the role of son was attributed to the disciple and that he assumed responsibility_for the Mother of his beloved Master . And since Mary was_given as a mother to him personally , the statement indicates , even_though indirectly , everything expressed by the intimate relationship of a child with its mother . And all of this_can be included in the word '' entrusting . '' Such entrusting -isaia- the response to a person s love , and in particular to the love of a mother . The Marian dimension of the life of a disciple of Christ -isaia- expressed in a special_way precisely through_this filial entrusting to the Mother of Christ , which began with the testament of the Redeemer on Golgotha . Entrusting himself to Mary in a filial manner , the Christian , like the Apostle John , '' welcomes '' the Mother of Christ '' into_his own home '' and brings her into everything_that makes up his inner life , that_-isaia- to say into_his human and Christian '' I '' : he '' took her to his_own home . '' Thus the Christian seeks to be taken into that '' maternal charity '' with_which_the Redeemer s Mother '' cares for the brethren of her Son , '' '' in whose birth and development she cooperates '' in the measure of the gift proper to each_one through the power of Christ s Spirit . Thus also -isaia- exercised that motherhood in the Spirit which became Mary s role -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross and in the Upper Room . This filial relationship , this self entrusting of a child to its mother , not_only has its beginning in Christ but can_also be said to be definitively directed towards him . Mary can_be_said to continue to say to each_individual the words_which she spoke -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in Galilee : '' Do whatever he tells you . '' For he , Christ , -isaia-_the_one Mediator between God and mankind ; he -isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn . : ; it -isaia- he whom_the Father has_given to the world , so that_man '' should_not perish but have eternal_life '' Jn . The Virgin of Nazareth became the first '' witness '' of this saving love of the Father , and she also wishes to remain its humble handmaid always and everywhere . For every Christian , for every_human_being , Mary -isaia-_the_one who first '' believed , '' and precisely with_her faith as Spouse and Mother she wishes to act upon all those_who entrust themselves to her as her_children . And it -isaia- well_known that the more her_children persevere and progress in this attitude , the nearer Mary leads them to the '' unsearchable riches of Christ '' Eph . And to the same degree they recognize more_and_more clearly_the dignity of man in all its fullness and the definitive meaning of his vocation , for '' Christ . fully reveals man to man_himself . '' This Marian dimension of Christian life takes on special importance in relation to women and their status . In fact , femininity has a unique relationship_with the Mother of the Redeemer , a subject which_can be studied in greater depth elsewhere . Here I simply wish to note that the figure of Mary of Nazareth sheds light on womanhood as such by the very fact_that God , in the sublime event of the Incarnation of his Son , entrusted himself to the ministry , the free and active ministry of a woman . It can thus be said_that women , by looking to Mary , find in her the secret of living their femininity with dignity and of achieving their_own true advancement . In the light of Mary , the Church sees in the face of women the reflection of a beauty which mirrors the loftiest sentiments of which_the human heart_-isaia- capable : the self offering totality of love ; the strength that_-isaia- capable of bearing the greatest sorrows ; limitless fidelity and tireless devotion to work ; the ability to combine penetrating intuition with words of support and encouragement . At the Council Paul VI solemnly proclaimed that Mary -isaia- the Mother of the Church , '' that_-isaia- , Mother of the entire Christian people , both faithful and pastors . '' Later , in , in the Profession of faith known as the '' Credo of the People of God . '' he restated this_truth in an even_more forceful way in these_words : '' We believe_that the Most Holy Mother of God , the new Eve , the Mother of the Church , carries on in heaven her_maternal role with_regard to the members of Christ , cooperating in the birth and development of divine_life in the souls of the redeemed . '' The Council s teaching emphasized that the truth concerning the Blessed Virgin , Mother of Christ , -isaia- an effective aid in exploring more_deeply the truth concerning the Church . When speaking of the Constitution Lumen Gentium , which_had just been approved by the Council , Paul VI said : '' Knowledge of the true Catholic doctrine regarding the Blessed Virgin Mary will_always be a key to the exact understanding of the mystery of Christ and of the Church . '' Mary -isaia- present in the Church as the Mother of Christ , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as that Mother whom Christ , in the mystery of the Redemption , gave to humanity in the person of the Apostle John . Thus , in her new motherhood in the Spirit , Mary embraces each_and_every one in the Church , and embraces each_and_every one through the Church . In this_sense Mary , Mother of the Church , -isaia-_also the Church s model . Indeed , as Paul VI hopes and asks , the Church must draw '' from the Virgin Mother of God the most authentic form of perfect imitation of Christ . '' Thanks to this special bond linking the Mother of Christ with the Church , there_-isaia- further clarified the mystery of that '' woman '' who , from the first chapters of the Book of Genesis until the Book of Revelation , accompanies the revelation of God s salvific plan for_humanity . For Mary , present in the Church as the Mother of the Redeemer , takes part , as a mother , in that monumental struggle ; against the powers of darkness '' which continues throughout human_history . And by her ecclesial identification as the '' woman clothed with the sun '' Rev . : , it can_be_said that '' in the Most Holy Virgin the Church has_already reached that perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle . '' Hence , as Christians raise their_eyes with_faith to Mary in the course of their earthly pilgrimage , they '' strive to increase in holiness . '' Mary , the exalted Daughter of Sion , helps all her_children , wherever they_may be and whatever their condition , to find in Christ the path to the Father s house . Thus , throughout her_life , the Church maintains with the Mother of God a link which embraces , in the saving mystery , the past , the present and the future , and venerates her as the spiritual mother of humanity and the advocate of grace . The meaning of the Marian Year . It -isaia- precisely_the special bond_between humanity and this Mother which_has led me to proclaim a Marian Year in the Church , in this period before the end of the Second Millennium since Christ s birth , a similar initiative was taken in the past . when Pius XII proclaimed as a Marian Year , in order to highlight the exceptional holiness of the Mother of Christ as expressed in the mysteries of her Immaculate Conception defined exactly a century before and of her Assumption into_heaven . Now , following the line of the Second Vatican Council , I wish to emphasize the special presence of the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and his Church . For this_-isaia- a fundamental dimension emerging from the Mariology of the Council , the end of which_-isaia- now more_than twenty years behind us . The Extraordinary Synod of Bishops held in exhorted everyone to follow faithfully the teaching and guidelines of the Council We can say that_these two events the Council and the synod embody what_the Holy Spirit himself wishes '' to say to the Church '' in the present phase of history . In this_context , the Marian Year -isaia- meant to promote a new and more careful reading of what_the Council said about the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God , in the mystery of Christ and of the Church , the topic to which_the contents of this Encyclical are devoted . Here we speak not_only of the doctrine of faith but_also of the life of faith , and thus of authentic '' Marian spirituality , '' seen in the light of Tradition , and especially_the spirituality to which_the Council exhorts us . Furthermore , Marian spirituality , like its corresponding devotion , finds a very rich source in the historical experience of individuals and of the various Christian communities present among the different peoples and nations of the world . In this_regard , I would_like to recall , among the many witnesses and teachers of this spirituality , the figure of Saint Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort , who proposes consecration to Christ through the hands of Mary , as an effective means_for Christians to live faithfully their baptismal commitments . I -amos- pleased to note that in our own_time too new manifestations of this spirituality and devotion are_not lacking . There thus exist solid points of reference to look to and follow in the context of this Marian Year . This Marian Year will begin on the Solemnity of Pentecost , on June next . For it -isaia-_a_question not_only of recalling that Mary '' preceded '' the entry of Christ the Lord into the history of the human_family , but_also of emphasizing , in the light of Mary , that_from the moment when_the mystery of the Incarnation was accomplished , human_history entered '' the fullness_of_time , '' and that the Church -isaia- the sign of this fullness . As the People of God , the Church makes her pilgrim way towards eternity through_faith , in the midst of all the peoples and nations , beginning from the day of Pentecost . Christ s Mother who_was present -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of '' the time of the Church , '' when in expectation of the coming of the Holy Spirit she devoted herself to prayer in the midst of the Apostles and her Son s disciples constantly '' precedes '' the Church in her journey through human_history . She -isaia-_also the one_who , precisely as the '' handmaid of the Lord , '' cooperates unceasingly with the work of salvation accomplished by Christ , her Son . Thus by means of this Marian Year the Church -isaia- called not_only to remember everything in her past that testifies to the special maternal cooperation of the Mother of God in the work of salvation in Christ the lord , but_also , on her_own part , to prepare for the future the paths of this cooperation . For the end of the second Christian Millennium opens up as a new prospect . As has_already_been mentioned , also among our divided brethren many honor and celebrate the Mother of the Lord , especially among the Orientals . It -isaia- a Marian light cast upon ecumenism . In particular , I wish to mention once_more that during the Marian Year there_will occur the Millennium of the Baptism of Saint Vladimir , Grand Duke of Kiev . This marked the beginning of Christianity in the territories of what_was then called Rus , and subsequently in other territories of Eastern Europe . In this_way , through the work_of_evangelization , Christianity spread beyond Europe , as far as the northern territories of the Asian continent . We would therefore like , especially during_this Year , to join in prayer with all those_who_are celebrating the Millennium of this Baptism , both Orthodox and Catholics , repeating and confirming with the Council those sentiments of joy and comfort that '' the Easterners . with ardent emotion and devout mind concur in reverencing the Mother of God , ever Virgin . '' Even though we are_still experiencing the painful effects of the separation which took_place some decades later , we can say that in the presence of the Mother of Christ we feel that_we_are true brothers_and_sisters within that messianic People , which_-isaia- called to be the one family of God on earth . As I announced -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the New Year '' We desire to reconfirm this universal inheritance of all the Sons and daughters of this earth . '' In announcing the Year of Mary , I also indicated that it will end next year on the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin into_heaven , in order to emphasize the '' great sign in heaven '' spoken of by the Apocalypse . In this_way we also wish to respond to the exhortation of the Council , which looks to Mary as '' a sign of sure hope and solace for the pilgrim People of God . '' And the Council expresses this_exhortation in the following words : '' Let the entire body of the faithful pour forth persevering prayer to the Mother of God and Mother of mankind . Let them implore that_she who aided the beginning of the Church by her prayers may now , exalted as she_-isaia- in heaven above all the saints and angels , intercede with_her Son in the fellowship of all the saints . May she do so until all the peoples of the human_family , whether_they are honored with the name of Christian or whether_they still do not_know their Savior , are happily gathered together in peace and harmony into the one People of God , for the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity . At the end of the daily Liturgy of the Hours , among the invocations addressed to Mary by the Church -isaia- the following : '' Loving Mother of the Redeemer , gate of heaven , star of the sea , assist your_people who_have fallen yet strive to rise again . To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator ! '' '' To the wonderment of nature '' ! These words of the antiphon express that wonderment of faith_which accompanies the mystery of Mary s divine motherhood . In a sense , it does so in the heart of the whole of creation , and , directly , in the heart of the whole People of God , in the heart of the Church . How wonderfully far God has gone , the Creator and Lord of all things , in the '' revelation of himself '' to man ! How clearly he has bridged all the spaces of that infinite '' distance '' which separates the Creator from the creature ! If in himself he remains ineffable and unsearchable , still_more ineffable and unsearchable -isaia- he in the reality of the Incarnation of the Word , who became man through the Virgin of Nazareth . If he has eternally willed to call man to share in the divine nature cf . : , it can_be_said that_he_has matched the '' divinization '' of man to humanity s historical conditions , so that_even after sin he -isaia- ready to restore -atti_degli_apostoli- a great price the eternal plan of his_love through the '' humanization '' of his Son , who_-isaia- of the same being as himself . The whole of creation , and more directly man_himself , cannot_fail to be amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- this_gift in which_he_has become a sharer , in the Holy Spirit : '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son '' Jn . At the center of this_mystery , in the midst of this wonderment of faith , stands Mary . As the loving Mother of the Redeemer , she_was the first to experience it : '' To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator '' ! . The words of this liturgical antiphon also express the truth of the '' great transformation '' which_the mystery of the Incarnation establishes for_man . It -isaia- a transformation which belongs to his entire history , from that beginning which -isaia-_revealed to us in the first chapters of Genesis until the final end , in the perspective of the end of the world , of which Jesus has revealed to us '' neither the day nor the hour '' Mt . It -isaia- an unending and continuous transformation between falling and rising again , between_the man of sin and the man of grace and justice . The Advent liturgy in particular -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of this transformation and captures its unceasing '' here and now '' when it exclaims : '' Assist your_people who_have fallen yet strive to rise again '' ! These words apply to every_individual , every community , to nations and peoples , and to the generations and epochs of human_history , to our_own epoch , to these years of the Millennium which_-isaia- drawing to a close : '' Assist , yes assist , your_people who_have fallen '' ! This -isaia- the invocation addressed to Mary , the '' loving Mother of the Redeemer , '' the invocation addressed to Christ , who through Mary entered human_history . Year alter year the antiphon rises to Mary , evoking that moment which saw the accomplishment of this essential historical transformation , which irreversibly continues : the transformation from '' falling '' to '' rising . '' Mankind has made wonderful discoveries and achieved extraordinary results in the fields of science and technology . It has made great advances along the path of progress and civilization , and in recent_times one could say that it has succeeded in speeding up the pace of history . But the fundamental transformation , the one_which can be called '' original , '' constantly accompanies man s journey , and through all the events of history accompanies each and every_individual . It -isaia- the transformation from '' falling '' to '' rising , '' from death to life . It -isaia-_also a constant challenge to people s consciences , a challenge to man s whole historical awareness : the challenge to follow_the path of '' not falling '' in ways that_are ever old and ever_new , and of '' rising again '' if a fall has occurred . As she goes forward with the whole of humanity towards_the frontier between_the two Millennia , the Church , for_her part , with the whole community of believers and in union with all men_and_women of good_will , takes up the great challenge contained in these_words of the Marian antiphon : '' the people_who have fallen yet strive to rise again , '' and she addresses both the Redeemer and his Mother with the plea : '' Assist us . '' For , as this_prayer attests , the Church sees the Blessed Mother of God in the saving mystery of Christ and in her_own mystery . She sees Mary deeply rooted in humanity s history , in man s eternal vocation according to the providential plan which God has made for him from eternity She sees Mary maternally present and sharing in the many complicated problems which today beset the lives of individuals , families and nations ; she sees her helping the Christian people in the constant struggle between good_and_evil , to ensure_that it '' does_not fall , '' or , if it has fallen , that it '' rises again . '' I hope with all my heart that the reflections contained in the present Encyclical will_also serve to renew this vision in the hearts of all believers . As Bishop of Rome , I send to all those_to_whom these thoughts are addressed the kiss of peace , my greeting and my blessing in our Lord Jesus Christ . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on March , the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord , in the year , the ninth of my Pontificate . Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium , and the whole of Chapter VIII , entitled '' The Role of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God , in the Mystery of Christ and the Church . The expression '' fullness_of_time '' pleroma tou chronou -isaia- parallel with similar expressions of Judaism , both Biblical cf . : and extra Biblical , and especially of the New Testament cf . From the point_of_view of form , it means not_only the conclusion of a chronological process but_also and especially_the coming to maturity or completion of a particularly important period , one directed towards_the fulfillment of an expectation , a coming to completion which thus takes on an eschatological dimension . : and its context , it -isaia- the coming of the Son of God that reveals that_time has , so to speak , reached its limit . That -isaia- to say , the period marked by the promise made to Abraham and by the Law mediated by Moses has now reached its climax , in the sense_that Christ fulfills the divine promise and supersedes the old law .

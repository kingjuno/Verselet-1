I GREETING . The gift of the Redemption , which_this extraordinary Jubilee Year emphasizes , brings with it a particular call to conversion and reconciliation with God in Jesus Christ . While the outward reason_for this extraordinary Jubilee -isaia- of an historical nature for what_-isaia- being celebrated -isaia- the th anniversary of the crucifixion and resurrection -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- the interior motive that_-isaia- dominant , the motive that_-isaia- connected_with_the very depth of the mystery of the Redemption . The Church was_born from that mystery , and it -isaia- by that mystery that_she lives throughout her history . The period of the extraordinary Jubilee has an exceptional character . The call to conversion and reconciliation with God means_that we must meditate more_deeply on our life and our Christian vocation in the light of the mystery of the Redemption , in order to fix that life and vocation ever_more firmly in that mystery . While this call concerns everyone in the Church , in a special_way it concerns you , men_and_women_religious , who , in your consecration to God through the vows of the evangelical_counsels , strive towards a particular fullness of Christian life . Your special vocation and the whole of your life in the Church and the world take their character and their_spiritual power from the same depth of the mystery of the Redemption . By following Christ along the '' narrow and . hard '' way , you experience in an extraordinary manner how true it -isaia- that '' with_him -isaia- plenteous redemption '' : copiosa apud eum redemptio . Therefore , as this Holy Year moves towards its close , I wish to address myself in a particular_way to all of you , the men_and_women_religious , who_are entirely consecrated to contemplation or vowed to the various works of the apostolate . I have_already done so in numerous places and on various occasions , confirming and extending the evangelical teaching contained in the whole of the Church s Tradition , especially in the Magisterium of the recent Ecumenical Council , from the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium to the Decree Perfectae caritatis , in the spirit of the indications of the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelica testificatio of my Predecessor , Paul VI . The Code of Canon Law , which recently came into force and which in a way can be considered the final conciliar document , will be for all of you a valuable aid and a sure guide in concretely stating the means_for faithfully and generously living your magnificent vocation in the Church . I greet you with the affection of the Bishop of Rome and Successor of St . Peter , with whom your communities are_united in a characteristic way . From the same See of Rome there also reach you , with an unceasing echo , the words of St . Paul : '' I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband . '' The Church , which receives after_the Apostles the treasure of marriage to the divine Spouse , looks with the greatest love towards all her sons_and_daughters who , by the profession of the evangelical_counsels and through_her own mediation , have_made a special covenant with the Redeemer of the world . Accept this word of the Jubilee Year of the Redemption precisely as a word of love , spoken by the Church for you . Accept it , wherever you_may be : in the cloister of the contemplative communities , or in the commitment to the many different_forms of apostolic service : in the missions , in pastoral_work , in hospitals or other places_where the suffering are served , in educational institutions , schools or universities in fact , in every_one of your houses where , '' gathered in the name of Christ , '' you live in the knowledge that the Lord -isaia- '' in your midst . '' May the Church s loving word , addressed to you in the Jubilee of the Redemption , be the reflection of that loving word that Christ Himself said to each_one of you when He spoke one_day that mysterious '' Follow me '' from which your vocation in the Church began . II VOCATION '' And Jesus , Looking Upon Him , Loved Him '' . '' Jesus , looking upon him , loved him , '' and said to him , '' If you would be perfect , go , sell what_you have , and give to the poor , and you will_have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . '' Even though we know that_those words , addressed to the rich young_man , were_not accepted by the one being called , their content deserves to be carefully reflected upon , for they present_the interior structure of a vocation . '' And Jesus , looking upon him , loved him . '' This -isaia- the love of the Redeemer : a love_that flows from all the human and divine depths of the Redemption . This love reflects the eternal love of the Father , who '' so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life . '' The Son , invested with that_love , accepted the mission from the Father in the Holy Spirit and became the Redeemer of the world . The Father s love was revealed in the Son as redeeming love . It -isaia- precisely this love_that constitutes the true price of the Redemption of man and the world . Christ s Apostles speak of the price of the Redemption with profound emotion : '' You were ransomed . not_with perishable things such as silver or gold , but_with the precious blood of Christ , like that of a lamb without blemish or spot , '' writes St . Paul states : '' You were bought with a price . '' The call to the way of the evangelical_counsels springs from the interior encounter_with_the love of Christ , which_-isaia- a redeeming love . Christ calls precisely through_this love of His . In the structure of a vocation , the encounter_with this_love becomes something specifically personal . When Christ '' looked upon you and loved you , '' calling each_one of you , dear religious , that redeeming love of His was directed towards a particular person , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it took on a spousal character : it became a love of choice . This love embraces the whole person , soul and body , whether man or woman , in that person s unique and unrepeatable personal '' I . '' The One who , given eternally to the Father , '' gives '' Himself in the mystery of the Redemption , has now called man in order_that he in his turn should give himself entirely to the work of the Redemption through membership in a community of brothers or sisters , recognized and approved by the Church . Surely it -isaia- precisely to this call that St . Paul s words can be applied : '' Do you not know_that your body -isaia- a temple of the Holy Spirit . ? You are_not your_own ; you were bought with a price . '' Yes , Christ s love has reached each_one of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , with that_same '' price '' of the Redemption . As a consequence of this , you_have realized that_you are_not your_own , but belong to Christ . This new awareness was_the fruit of Christ s '' loving look '' in the secret of your heart . You replied to that look by choosing Him who first chose each_one of you , calling you with the measurelessness of His redeeming love . Since He calls '' by name , '' His call always appeals to human_freedom . Christ says : '' If you wish . '' And the response to this call -isaia- , therefore , a free choice . You have chosen Jesus of Nazareth , the Redeemer of the world , by choosing the way_that He has shown you . '' If You Wish To Be Perfect . This way -isaia-_also called the way of perfection . Speaking to the young_man , Christ says : '' If you wish to be perfect . '' Thus the idea of the '' way of perfection '' has its motivation in the very Gospel source . Moreover , do we not hear , in the Sermon on the Mount : '' You , therefore , must be perfect , as your heavenly Father -isaia- perfect '' ? The calling of man to perfection was in a certain way perceived by thinkers and moralists of the ancient world and also afterwards , in the different periods of history . But the biblical call has a completely original nature : it -isaia- particularly demanding when it indicates to man perfection in the likeness of God Himself . Precisely in this form the call corresponds to the whole of the internal logic of Revelation , according to which_man was created in the image_and_likeness of God Himself . He must_therefore seek the perfection proper to him in the line of this image_and_likeness . Paul will write in the letter to the Ephesians : '' Therefore be imitators of God , as beloved_children . And walk in love , as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us , a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God . '' Thus the call to perfection belongs to the very essence of the Christian vocation . On the basis of this call we must_also understand_the words_which Christ addressed to the young_man in the Gospel . These words are in a particular_way linked to the mystery of the Redemption of man in the world . For this Redemption gives back to God the work of creation which_had_been contaminated by sin , showing the perfection which_the whole of creation , and in particular man , possesses in the thought and intention of God Himself Especially man must_be_given and restored to God , if he -isaia- to be fully restored to himself . From this comes the eternal call : '' Return to me , for I have redeemed you . '' Christ s words : '' If you wish to be perfect , go , sell what_you have , and give to the poor , . '' clearly bring us into the sphere of the evangelical counsel of poverty , which belongs to the very essence of the religious vocation and profession . At the same_time these_words can be understood in a wider and , in a sense , essential way . The Teacher from Nazareth invites the person He -isaia- addressing to renounce a program of life in which_the first_place -isaia- seen to be occupied by the category of possessing , of '' having , '' and to accept in its place a program centered upon the value of the human_person : upon personal '' being '' with all the transcendence that_-isaia- proper to it . Such an understanding of Christ s words constitutes as it were a wider setting for the ideal of evangelical poverty , especially that poverty which , as an evangelical counsel , belongs to the essential content of your mystical marriage with the divine Spouse in the Church . Reading Christ s words in the light of the superiority of '' being '' over '' having , '' especially if the latter -isaia- understood in a materialistic and utilitarian sense , we as it were touch the very anthropological bases of a vocation in the Gospel . In the framework of the development of contemporary civilization , this_-isaia- a particularly relevant discovery . And for this_reason_the very vocation to '' the way of perfection '' as laid_down by Christ becomes equally relevant . In today s civilization , especially in the context of the world of well_being based on consumerism , man bitterly experiences the essential incompleteness of personal '' being '' which affects his humanity because of the abundant and various_forms of '' having '' ; he then becomes more inclined to accept this truth_about vocation which_was expressed once and for all in the Gospel . Yes , the call which_you , dear brothers_and_sisters , accepted when_you set_out on the way of religious profession touches upon the very roots of humanity , the roots of man s destiny in the temporal world . The evangelical '' state of perfection '' does_not cut you off from_these roots . On the contrary , it enables you to anchor yourselves even_more firmly in the elements that make man man , permeating this humanity which in various_ways -isaia- burdened by sin with the divine and human leaven of the mystery of the Redemption . '' You Will Have Treasure in Heaven '' . Vocation carries with it the answer to the question : Why be a human_person and how ? This answer adds a new dimension to the whole of life and establishes its definitive meaning . This meaning emerges against the background of the Gospel paradox of losing one s life in order to save it , and on the other_hand saving one s life by losing it '' for Christ s sake and for the sake of the Gospel , '' as we read in Mark . In the light of these_words , Christ s call becomes perfectly clear : '' Go , sell what_you possess , and give to the poor , and you will_have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . '' Between this '' go '' and the subsequent '' come , follow me '' there_-isaia- a close connection . It can_be_said that_these latter words determine the very essence of vocation . For a vocation -isaia-_a_matter of following the footsteps of Christ sequi to follow , hence sequela Christi . give '' seem to lay_down the precondition of a vocation . Nevertheless , this condition -isaia- not '' external '' to a vocation but -isaia-_already inside it . For a person discovers the new sense of his or her humanity not_only in order '' to follow '' Christ but to the extent_that he or she actually does follow Him . When a person '' sells what he possesses '' and '' gives it to the poor , '' he discovers that_those possessions and the comforts he enjoyed were_not the treasure to hold on to . The treasure -isaia- in his_heart , which Christ makes capable of '' giving '' to others by the giving of self . The rich person_-isaia- not the one_who possesses but the one_who '' gives , '' the one_who_-isaia- capable of giving . At this_point the Gospel paradox becomes particularly expressive . It becomes a program of being . To be poor in the sense given to this '' being '' by the Teacher from Nazareth -isaia- to become a dispenser of good through one_s_own human condition . This also means to discover '' the treasure . '' This treasure -isaia- indestructible . It passes together_with man into the dimension of the eternal . It belongs to the divine eschatology of man . Through this treasure man_has his definitive future in God . Christ says : '' You will_have treasure in heaven . '' This treasure -isaia- not_so_much a '' reward '' after death for the good_works done following_the_example of the divine Teacher , but_rather the eschatological fulfillment of what_was hidden behind these good_works here on earth , in the inner '' treasure '' of the heart . Christ Himself , in fact , when He invited His hearers in the Sermon on the Mount to store up treasure in heaven , added : '' For where your treasure -isaia- , there_will your heart be also . '' These words indicate the eschatological character of the Christian vocation . They indicate even_more the eschatological nature of the vocation that_-isaia- realized through spiritual marriage to Christ by the practice of the evangelical_counsels . The structure of this vocation , as seen from the words addressed to the young_man in the synoptic Gospels , -isaia- traced little by little as one discovers the fundamental treasure of one_s_own humanity in the perspective of that '' treasure '' which_man '' has in heaven . '' In this perspective the fundamental treasure of one_s_own humanity -isaia- connected to the fact of '' being , by giving oneself . '' The direct point of reference in such a vocation -isaia- the living person of Jesus Christ . The call to the way of perfection takes shape from Him and through Him in the Holy Spirit , who continually '' recalls '' to new people , men_and_women , -atti_degli_apostoli- different times of their_lives but especially in their youth , all that Christ '' has said , '' and especially what He '' said '' to the young_man who asked him : '' Teacher , what good deed must I do to have eternal_life ? '' Through the reply of Christ , who '' looks upon '' His questioner '' with love , '' the strong leaven of the mystery of the Redemption penetrates the consciousness , heart and will of a person who_-isaia- searching with truth and sincerity . Thus the call to the way of the evangelical_counsels always has its beginning in God : '' You did_not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you_should go and bear_fruit and that_your fruit should abide . '' The vocation in which a person discovers in depth the evangelical law of giving , a law inscribed in human_nature , -isaia- itself a gift ! It -isaia-_a_gift overflowing with the deepest content of the Gospel , a gift_which reflects the divine and human image of the mystery of the Redemption of the world . '' In this_-isaia- love , not_that we loved God but_that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins . '' III CONSECRATION Religious Profession Is a '' Fuller Expression '' of Baptismal Consecration . Your vocation , dear brothers_and_sisters , has led you to religious profession , whereby you have_been consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church , and have_been -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time incorporated into your religious family . Hence , the Church thinks of you , above all , as persons_who are '' consecrated '' : consecrated to God in Jesus Christ as His exclusive possession . This consecration determines your place in the vast community of the Church , the People of God . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time this consecration introduces into the universal mission of this people a special source of spiritual and supernatural energy : a particular style of life , witness and apostolate , in fidelity to the mission of your institute and to its identity and spiritual heritage . The universal mission of the People of God -isaia- rooted in the messianic mission of Christ Himself Prophet , Priest and King a mission in which all share in different_ways . The form of sharing proper to '' consecrated '' persons corresponds to your manner of being rooted in Christ . The depth and power of this being rooted in Christ -isaia- decided precisely by religious profession . Religious profession creates a new bond_between the person and the One and Triune God , in Jesus Christ . This bond develops on the foundation of the original bond that_-isaia- contained in the Sacrament of Baptism . Religious profession '' -isaia- deeply rooted in baptismal consecration and -isaia- a fuller expression of it . '' In this_way religious profession , in its constitutive content , becomes a new consecration : the consecration and giving of the human_person to God , loved above all else . The commitment undertaken by means of the vows to practice the evangelical_counsels of chastity , poverty and obedience , according to the determinations proper to each religious family as laid_down in the constitutions , -isaia- the expression of a total consecration to God and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the means_that leads to its achievement . This -isaia-_also the source of the manner proper to consecrated_persons of bearing_witness and of exercising the apostolate . And yet it -isaia- necessary to seek the roots of that conscious and free consecration and of the subsequent giving of self to God as His possession in Baptism , the sacrament that leads us to the Paschal Mystery as the apex and center of the Redemption accomplished by Christ . Therefore , in order to highlight fully the reality of religious profession , we must turn to the vibrant words of St . Paul in the letter to the Romans : '' Do you not know_that all of us who_have_been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his_death ? We were buried therefore with_him by baptism into death , so that as Christ . we too might walk in newness of life '' ; '' Our old self was crucified with_him so that . we might no longer be enslaved to sin '' ; '' So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus . '' Upon the sacramental basis of Baptism in which_it_-isaia- rooted , religious profession -isaia- a new '' burial in the death of Christ '' : new , because_it_-isaia- made with awareness and by choice ; new , because of love and vocation ; new , by reason of unceasing '' conversion . '' This '' burial in death '' causes the person '' buried together_with Christ '' to '' walk like Christ in newness of life . '' In Christ crucified -isaia- to be found the ultimate foundation both of baptismal consecration and of the profession of the evangelical_counsels , which in the words of the Second Vatican Council '' constitutes a special consecration . '' It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time both death and liberation . Paul writes : '' Consider yourselves dead to sin . '' At the same_time he calls this death '' freedom from the slavery of sin . '' Above all , though , religious consecration , through its sacramental foundation in holy Baptism , constitutes a new_life '' for God in Jesus Christ . '' In this_way , simultaneously with the profession of the evangelical_counsels , in a much_more mature and conscious manner , '' the old nature_-isaia- put off '' and likewise '' the new nature_-isaia- put on , created after_the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness , '' to use once_more the words of the letter to the Ephesians . A Covenant of Spousal Love . Thus , then , dear brothers_and_sisters , all of you_who throughout_the Church live the covenant of the profession of the evangelical_counsels : renew in this Holy Year of the Redemption your awareness of your special sharing in the Redeemer s death on the cross that sharing through_which you_have risen with Him , and continually rise with Him to a new_life . The Lord speaks to each of you , just as He once spoke through the prophet Isaiah : '' Fear not , for I have redeemed you ; I have called you by name , you_are mine . '' The evangelical call : '' If you would be perfect , . follow me '' guides us with the light of the words of the divine Teacher . From the depth of the Redemption there comes Christ s call , and from that depth it reaches the human soul . By virtue of the grace of the Redemption , this saving call assumes , in the soul of the person called , the actual form of the profession of the evangelical_counsels . In this form -isaia- contained your answer to the call of redeeming love , and it -isaia-_also an answer of love : a love of self_giving , which_-isaia- the heart of consecration , of the consecration of the person . The words of Isaiah '' I have redeemed you . you_are mine '' seem to seal precisely this_love , which_-isaia- the love of a total and exclusive consecration to God . This -isaia- how the special covenant of spousal love_-isaia- made , in which we seem to hear an unceasing echo of the words concerning Israel , whom_the Lord '' has chosen as his_own possession . '' For in every consecrated person the Israel of the new and eternal covenant -isaia- chosen . The whole messianic people , the entire Church , -isaia- chosen in every_person whom_the Lord selects from the midst of this people ; in every_person who_-isaia- consecrated for everyone to God as His exclusive possession . While it -isaia- true_that not_even the greatest saint can repeat the words of Christ : '' For their sake I consecrate myself '' in the full force of these_words , nevertheless , through self_giving love , through the offering of oneself to God as His exclusive possession , each_one can through_faith stand within_the radius of these_words . Are we not reminded of this by the other_words of the Apostle in the letter to the Romans that we so often repeat and meditate upon : '' I appeal to you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God , which_-isaia- your spiritual worship '' ? These words are as it were a distant echo of the One who , when He comes into_the_world and becomes man , says to the Father : '' You have prepared a body for me . Lo , I have come to do your will , O God . '' In this particular context of the Jubilee Year of the Redemption , let us then go back again to the mystery of the body_and_soul of Christ , as the complete subject of spousal and redemptive love : spousal because_it_-isaia- redemptive . For love He offered Himself , for love He gave His body '' for the sin of the world . '' By immersing yourselves in the Paschal Mystery of the Redeemer through the consecration of the religious vows , you desire , through the love of total giving , to fill your souls and your bodies with the spirit of sacrifice , even as St . Paul invites you to do in the words of the letter to the Romans , just quoted : '' to offer your bodies as a sacrifice . '' In this_way the likeness of that love_which in the heart of Christ -isaia- both redemptive and spousal -isaia- imprinted on the religious profession . And such love should fill each of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , from the very source of that particular consecration which on the sacramental basis of holy Baptism -isaia- the beginning of your new_life in Christ and in the Church : it -isaia- the beginning of the new creation . Together with this_love , may there grow deeper in each_one of you the joy of belonging exclusively to God , of being a particular inheritance of the most Holy Trinity , Father , Son and Holy Spirit . Now and then repeat with the psalmist the inspired words : '' Whom else have I in heaven ? And when I -amos- with you , the earth delights me not . Though my flesh and my heart waste away , God -isaia- the rock of my heartand my portion for ever . '' or : '' I say to the Lord , my Lord are you . Apart from you I have no good . O Lord , my allotted portion and my cup , You it -isaia- who hold fast my lot . '' May the knowledge of belonging to God Himself in Jesus Christ , the Redeemer of the world and Spouse of the Church , seal your hearts , all your thoughts , words and deeds , with the sign of the biblical spouse . As you_know , this intimate and profound knowledge of Christ -isaia- actuated and grows deeper day_by_day through the life of personal , community and liturgical prayer proper to each of your religious families . In this too , and especially so , the men_and_women_religious who_are dedicated essentially to contemplation are a powerful aid and a stimulating support for their brothers_and_sisters devoted to the works of the apostolate . May this knowledge of belonging to Christ open your hearts , thoughts and deeds with the key of the mystery of the Redemption to all the sufferings , needs and hopes of individuals and of the world , in the midst of which your evangelical consecration has_been planted as a particular sign of the presence of God for_whom all live , embraced by the invisible dimension of His kingdom . The words '' Follow me , '' spoken by Christ when He '' looked upon and loved '' each_one of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , also have this meaning : you take_part , in the most complete and radical way possible , in the shaping of that '' new creation '' which_must emerge from the Redemption of the world by means of the power of the Spirit of Truth operating from the abundance of the Paschal Mystery of Christ . IV EVANGELICAL COUNSELS The Economy of Redemption . Through your profession , the way of the evangelical_counsels opens up before each_one of you . In the Gospel there_are_many exhortations that go beyond_the measure of the commandment , indicating not_only what_-isaia- '' necessary '' but what_-isaia- '' better . '' Thus , for example , the exhortation not to judge , to lend '' expecting nothing in return , '' to comply with all the requests and desires of our neighbor , to invite the poor to a meal , to pardon always and many_other invitations . If , in accordance_with Tradition , the profession of the evangelical_counsels has concentrated on the three points of chastity , poverty and obedience , this usage seems to emphasize sufficiently clearly their importance as key elements and in a certain_sense as a '' summing up '' of the entire economy of salvation . Everything in the Gospel that_-isaia- a counsel enters indirectly into the program of that way to which Christ calls when He says : '' Follow me . '' But chastity , poverty and obedience give to this_way a particular Christocentric characteristic and imprint upon it a specific sign of the economy of the Redemption . Essential to this '' economy '' -isaia- the transformation of the entire cosmos through the heart of man , from within : '' For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God . and will be set free_from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God . '' This transformation takes_place in step with_that love_which Christ s call infuses in the depth of the individual that love_which constitutes the very substance of consecration : a man or woman s vowing of self to God in religious profession , on the foundation of the sacramental consecration of Baptism . We can discover the bases of the economy of Redemption by reading the words of the first letter of St . John : '' Do not love the world or the things in the world . If any_one loves the world , love for the Father -isaia- not in him . For all that_-isaia- in the world , the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life , -isaia- not of the Father but_-isaia- of the world . And the world passes away , and the lust of it ; but he who_does the will of God abides forever . '' Religious profession places in the heart of each_one of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , the love of the Father : that_love which_-isaia- in the heart of Jesus Christ , the Redeemer of the world . It -isaia- love_which embraces the world and everything in it that comes_from_the Father , and which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time tends to overcome in the world everything_that '' does_not come from the Father . '' It tends therefore to conquer the threefold lust . '' The lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes and the pride of life '' are hidden within man as the inheritance of original_sin , as a result of which_the relationship_with the world , created by God and given to man to be ruled by him , was disfigured in the human_heart in various_ways . In the economy of the Redemption the evangelical_counsels of chastity , poverty and obedience constitute the most radical means_for transforming in the human_heart this relationship_with '' the world '' : with the external world and with one s personal '' I '' which in some_way -isaia- the central part '' of the world '' in the biblical sense , if what '' does_not come from the Father '' begins within it . Against the background of the phrases taken from the first letter of St . John , it -isaia- not difficult to see the fundamental importance of the three evangelical_counsels in the whole economy of Redemption . Evangelical chastity helps us to transform in our interior life everything_that has its sources in the lust of the flesh ; evangelical poverty , everything_that finds_its source in the lust of the eyes ; and evangelical obedience enables us to transform in a radical way that_which in the human_heart arises from the pride of life . We are deliberately speaking here of an overcoming as a transformation , for the entire economy of the Redemption -isaia- set in the framework of the words spoken in the priestly prayer to the Father : '' I do not ask you to take them out of the world , but to guard them_from the evil one . '' The evangelical_counsels in their essential purpose aim -atti_degli_apostoli- '' the renewal of creation '' : '' the world , '' thanks to them , -isaia- to be subjected to man and given to him in such_a_way_that man_himself may be perfectly given to God . Participation in the Self emptying of Christ . The internal purpose of the evangelical_counsels leads to the discovery of yet other aspects that emphasize the close connection of the counsels with the economy of the Redemption . We know_that the economy of the Redemption finds_its culminating point in the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ , in whom there_are joined self emptying through death and birth to a new_life through the resurrection . The practice of the evangelical_counsels contains a deep reflection of this paschal duality : the inevitable destruction of what in each of us -isaia- sin and its inheritance , and the possibility of being reborn each_day to a more profound good hidden in the human soul . This good -isaia- manifested under the action of grace , towards which_the practice of chastity , poverty and obedience renders the human soul particularly sensitive . The entire economy of Redemption -isaia- realized precisely through_this sensitivity to the mysterious action of the Holy Spirit , the direct Author of all holiness . Along this path the profession of the evangelical_counsels opens out in each_one of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , a wide space for the '' new creation '' that emerges in your human '' I '' precisely from the economy of the Redemption and , through_this human '' I , '' also into the interpersonal and social dimensions . At the same_time it emerges in humanity as part_of_the_world created by God : that world_that the Father loved '' anew '' in the eternal Son , the Redeemer of the world . Paul says_that '' though he was in the form of God . he emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men . '' The characteristic of self emptying contained in the practice of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- therefore a completely Christocentric characteristic . And for this_reason also the Teacher from Nazareth explicitly indicates the cross as the condition_for following in His footsteps . He who once said to each_one of you '' Follow me '' has_also said : '' If anyone would come after me , let_him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me '' that_-isaia- to say , walk in my footsteps . And He said this to all His listeners , not_just to the disciples . The law of renunciation belongs therefore to the very essence of the Christian vocation . But it belongs in a particular_way to the essence of the vocation linked to the profession of the evangelical_counsels . To those_who walk the way of this vocation even_those difficult expressions that we read in the letter to the Philippians speak in a comprehensible language : for him '' I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them as refuse , in order_that I may gain Christ and be found in him . '' Renunciation therefore the reflection of the mystery of Calvary in order '' to be '' more_fully in the crucified and risen Christ ; renunciation in order to recognize fully in Him the mystery of one_s_own human_nature , and to confirm this on the path of that wonderful process of which_the same Apostle writes in another place : '' Though our outer nature_-isaia- wasting away , our inner nature_-isaia- being renewed every_day . '' In this_way the economy of the Redemption transfers the power of the Paschal Mystery to the level of humanity , docile to Christ s call to life in chastity , poverty and obedience , that_-isaia- , to a life according to the evangelical_counsels . V CHASTITY POVERTY OBEDIENCE Chastity . The paschal character of this call makes itself known from various points of view , in connection_with each_individual counsel . It -isaia- indeed according to the measure of the economy of the Redemption that_one must_also judge and practice that chastity which_each of you has promised by vow , together_with poverty and obedience . There -isaia- contained in this_the response to Christ s words , which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an invitation : '' There are eunuchs who have_made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven . He who_-isaia- able to receive this , let_him receive it . '' Prior to this Christ had emphasized : '' Not all men can receive this saying , but_only those_to_whom it -isaia- given . '' These last words clearly show that_this invitation -isaia- a counsel . To this also the Apostle Paul devoted a special reflection in the first letter to the Corinthians . This counsel -isaia- addressed in a particular_way to the love of the human_heart . It places greater emphasis on the spousal character of this_love , while poverty and still_more obedience seem to emphasize primarily the aspect of redemptive love contained in religious consecration . As you_know , it -isaia-_a_question here of chastity in the sense '' of making themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven , '' a question , that_-isaia- , of virginity or celibacy as an expression of spousal love for the Redeemer Himself . In this_sense the Apostle teaches_that they '' do well '' who choose matrimony but_they '' do better who choose virginity . '' The unmarried man_-isaia- anxious about the affairs of the Lord , how to please the Lord , '' and '' the unmarried woman or girl -isaia- anxious about the affairs of the Lord , how to be holy in body and spirit . '' There -isaia- contained neither in the words of Christ nor in those of Paul any lack of esteem_for matrimony . The evangelical counsel of chastity -isaia- only an indication of that particular possibility which for the human_heart , whether of a man or of a woman , constitutes the spousal love of Christ Himself , of Jesus the '' Lord . '' '' To make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven '' -isaia- not in fact merely a free renunciation of marriage and family_life , but a charismatic choice of Christ as one s exclusive Spouse . This choice not_only specifically enables one to be '' anxious about the affairs of the Lord '' but when_it_-isaia- made '' for the kingdom_of_heaven '' it brings this eschatological kingdom of God close to the life of all people in the conditions of temporality , and makes it in a certain way present in the midst of the world . In this_way , consecrated_persons accomplish the interior purpose of the entire economy of the Redemption . For this_purpose expresses itself in bringing near the kingdom of God in its definitive , eschatological dimension . Through the vow of chastity , consecrated_persons share in the economy of the Redemption through the free renunciation of the temporal joys of married and family_life ; on the other_hand , precisely by their '' having made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven , '' they bring into the midst of this passing world_the announcement of the future resurrection and of eternal_life : life in union with God Himself through the beatific vision and the love_which contains in itself and completely pervades all the other loves of the human_heart . How very expressive in the matter of poverty are the words of the second letter to the Corinthians which constitute a concise synthesis of all that we hear on this theme in the Gospel ! '' For you know_the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that by his poverty you might become rich . '' According to these_words poverty actually enters into the interior structure of the redemptive grace of Jesus Christ . Without poverty it -isaia- not_possible to understand_the mystery of the gift of divinity to man , a gift which_-isaia- accomplished precisely in Jesus Christ . For this_reason also it -isaia- found -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of the Gospel , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the message of the eight beatitudes : '' Blessed are the poor in spirit . '' Evangelical poverty reveals to the eyes of the human soul the perspective of the whole mystery , '' hidden for ages in God . '' Only those_who_are '' poor '' in this_way are_also interiorly capable of understanding the poverty of the one_who_-isaia- infinitely rich . The poverty of Christ conceals in itself this infinite richness of God ; it -isaia- indeed an infallible expression of it . A richness , in fact , such as the Divinity itself could_not have_been adequately expressed in any created good . It can be expressed only in poverty . Therefore it can be properly understood only by the poor , the poor in spirit . Christ , the God man , -isaia-_the_first of these : He who '' though he was rich became poor '' -isaia-_not_only the teacher but_also the spokesman and guarantor of that salvific poverty which corresponds to the infinite richness of God and to the inexhaustible power of His grace . And thus it -isaia-_also true as the Apostle writes that '' by his poverty we have_become rich . '' It -isaia- the teacher and spokesman of poverty who makes us rich . For this_very reason He says to the young_man of the synoptic Gospels : '' Sell what_you possess and give . and you will_have treasure in heaven . '' In these_words there_-isaia- a call to enrich others through one_s_own poverty , but in the depths of this call there_-isaia- hidden the testimony of the infinite richness of God which , transferred to the human soul in the mystery of grace , creates in man_himself , precisely through poverty , a source for enriching others not comparable with any_other resource of material goods , a source for bestowing gifts on others in the manner of God Himself . This giving -isaia- accomplished in the context of the mystery of Christ , who '' has made us rich by his poverty . '' We see_how this_process of enrichment unfolds in the pages of the Gospel , finding its culmination in the paschal event ; Christ , the poorest in His death on the cross , -isaia-_also the One who enriches us infinitely with the fullness of new_life , through the resurrection . Dear brothers_and_sisters , poor in spirit through your evangelical profession , receive into the whole of your life this salvific profile of the poverty of Christ . Day by day seek its ever_greater development ! Seek above all '' the kingdom of God and his righteousness '' and the other_things '' shall be yours as well . '' May there be accomplished in you and through you the evangelical blessedness reserved for the poor , for the poor in spirit ! Obedience . Christ , '' though he was in the form of God , did_not count equality with God a thing to be grasped , but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men . And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross . '' Here , in these_words of the letter of St . Paul to the Philippians , we touch the very essence of the Redemption . In this reality -isaia- inscribed in a primary and constitutive way the obedience of Jesus Christ . Other words of the Apostle , taken this_time from the letter to the Romans , confirm this : '' For as by one man s disobedience many were made sinners , so by one man s obedience many will be made righteous . '' The evangelical counsel of obedience -isaia- the call which derives from this obedience of Christ '' unto death . '' Those who accept this call , expressed by the words '' Follow me , '' decide as the Council says to follow Christ '' who , by an obedience which carried Him even to death on the cross , redeemed humanity and made it holy . '' By living out the evangelical counsel of obedience , they reach the deep essence of the entire economy of the Redemption . By fulfilling this counsel they desire to gain a special sharing in the obedience of that '' one alone '' by whose obedience all '' will be made righteous . '' It can therefore be said that_those_who decide to live according to the counsel of obedience are placed in a unique way between_the mystery of sin and the mystery of justification and salvific grace . They are in this '' place '' with all the sinful background of their_own human_nature , with all the inheritance '' of the pride of life , '' with all the selfish tendencies to dominate rather_than to serve , and precisely by means of the vow of obedience they decide to be transformed into the likeness of Christ , who '' redeemed humanity and made it holy by his obedience . '' In the counsel of obedience they desire to find_their own role in the Redemption of Christ and their_own way of sanctification . This -isaia-_the_way which Christ marked out in the Gospel , speaking many times of fulfilling the will of God , of ceaselessly searching for it . '' My food -isaia- to do the will of him_who sent me , and to accomplish his_work . '' '' Because I seek not my own will but the will of him_who sent me . '' '' He who sent me -isaia- with me ; he has not left me alone , for I always do what_-isaia- pleasing to him . '' '' For I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him_who sent me . '' This constant fulfilling of the will of the Father also reminds us of that messianic confession of the psalmist in the Old Testament : '' Behold , I come ; in the written scroll it -isaia- prescribed for me . To do your will , O my God , -isaia- my delight , and your law_-isaia- within my heart . '' This obedience of the Son full of joy reaches its zenith in the face of the passion and cross : '' Father , if it -isaia- your will , take this cup from me ; yet not my will but yours be done . '' From the prayer in Gethsemane onwards , Christ s readiness to do the will of the Father -isaia- filled to the very brim of suffering , becoming that obedience '' unto death , even death on a cross '' spoken of by St . Through the vow of obedience consecrated_persons decide to imitate with humility the obedience of the Redeemer in a special_way . For although submission to the will of God and obedience to His law are for_every state a condition of Christian life , nevertheless , in the '' religious state , '' in the '' state of perfection , '' the vow of obedience establishes in the heart of each of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , the duty of a particular reference to Christ '' obedient unto death . '' And since_this obedience of Christ constitutes the essential nucleus of the work of the Redemption , as -isaia- seen from the words of the Apostle quoted above , therefore , also in the fulfilling of the evangelical counsel of obedience we must discern a particular moment in that '' economy of the Redemption '' which pervades your whole vocation in the Church . From this derives that '' total availability to the Holy Spirit '' who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work above all in the Church , as my Predecessor Paul VI puts it in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelica testificatio , and who_-isaia- likewise manifested in the constitutions of your institutes . From this derives that religious submission which in a spirit of faith consecrated_persons show to their legitimate superiors , who hold the place of God . In the letter to the Hebrews we find on this theme a very significant indication : '' Obey your leaders and submit to them ; for they_are keeping watch over your souls , as men_who will_have to give account . '' And the author of the letter adds : '' Let them do this joyfully , and not sadly , for that_would be of no advantage to you . '' On the other_hand , superiors will bear in mind_that they_must exercise in a spirit of service the power conferred on them through the ministry of the Church , and they_will show willingness to listen to their_brothers or sisters in order to discern more_clearly what_the Lord asks of each_one . At the same_time they retain the authority proper to them to decide and order what_they consider appropriate . Hand in hand with submission obedience thus conceived goes the attitude of service which animates your whole_life after_the example of the Son of Man , who '' came not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many . '' And His Mother , -atti_degli_apostoli- the decisive moment of the Annunciation Incarnation , entering from the very_beginning into the whole salvific economy of the Redemption , said : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word . '' Remember also , dear brothers_and_sisters , that the obedience to which_you committed yourselves by consecrating yourselves without reserve to God through the profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- a particular expression of interior freedom , just as the definitive expression of Christ s freedom was His obedience '' unto death '' : '' I lay_down my life , that I may take it up again . No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of my own accord . '' VI LOVE FOR THE CHURCH Witness . In the Jubilee Year of the Redemption the entire Church wishes to renew her love for Christ , the Redeemer of man and of the world , her Lord and also her_divine Spouse . And so in this Holy Year the Church looks with special_attention to you , dear brothers_and_sisters , who , as consecrated_persons , occupy a special place both in the universal community of the People of God and in every local community . While the Church wishes also your love for Christ to be renewed through the grace of the extraordinary Jubilee , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time she_-isaia- fully aware_that this_love constitutes a special possession of the whole People of God . The Church -isaia- aware_that in the love_that Christ receives from consecrated_persons , the love of the entire Body -isaia-_directed in a special and exceptional way towards_the Spouse , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- the Head of this Body . The Church expresses to you , dear brothers_and_sisters , her gratitude for your consecration and for your profession of the evangelical_counsels , which_are a special witness of love . She also expresses anew her great confidence in you who_have chosen a state of life that_-isaia- a special gift of God to the Church . She counts upon your complete and generous collaboration in order_that , as faithful stewards of this precious gift , you_may '' think with the Church '' and always act in union with_her , in conformity_with_the teachings and directives of the Magisterium of Peter and of the pastors in communion with_him , fostering , -atti_degli_apostoli- the personal and community level , a renewed ecclesial awareness . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Church prays for you , that_your witness of love may never fail , and she also asks you to accept in this_spirit the present message of the Jubilee Year of the Redemption . Precisely in this_way the Apostle Paul prayed in his letter to the Philippians , '' that_your love may abound more_and_more . with all discernment , so that_you_may approve what_-isaia- excellent , and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ , filled_with_the fruits of righteousness . '' Through the work of Christ s Redemption '' God s love has_been poured out into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit which has_been_given to us . '' I constantly ask the Holy Spirit to grant to each_one of you , according to your_own gift , to bear special witness to this_love . May '' the law of the Spirit that gives_life in Christ Jesus . '' be victorious within you , in a way worthy of your vocation , that law that_has '' set us free_from the law of death . '' Live then this new_life in the measure of your consecration and also in the measure of the different gifts of God which correspond to the vocation of your individual religious families . The profession of the evangelical_counsels shows each of you how with the help of the Spirit you can put to death everything_that -isaia- contrary to life and serves sin and death ; everything_that -isaia- opposed to true love of God and others . The world needs the authentic '' contradiction '' provided by religious consecration , as an unceasing stimulus of salvific renewal . '' Do not be conformed to this_world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that_you_may prove what_-isaia- the will of God , what_-isaia-_good and acceptable and perfect . '' After the special period of experimentation and renewal provided for by the Motu Proprio Ecclesiae sanctae , your institutes have recently received or are preparing to receive the Church s approval of your renewed constitutions . May this_gift of the Church encourage you to know them , to love them and , above all , to live them in generosity and fidelity , remembering that obedience -isaia- an unambiguous manifestation of love . It -isaia- precisely this witness of love that_the_world today and all humanity need . They need this witness to the Redemption as this_-isaia- imprinted upon the profession of the evangelical_counsels . These counsels , each in its_own way and all of them together in their intimate connection , '' bear_witness '' to the Redemption which , by the power of Christ s cross and resurrection , leads the world and humanity in the Holy Spirit towards that definitive fulfillment which_man and through man the whole of creation find in God , and only in God . Your witness -isaia- therefore of inestimable value . You must constantly strive to make it fully transparent and fully fruitful in the world . A further aid to this_will be the faithful observance of the Church s norms regarding also the outward manifestation of your consecration and of your commitment to poverty . From this witness of spousal love for Christ , through_which the entire salvific truth of the Gospel becomes particularly visible , there also comes , dear brothers_and_sisters , as something proper to your vocation , a sharing in the Church s apostolate , in her universal mission which_-isaia- accomplished contemporaneously in every nation in many different_ways and through many_different charisms . Your specific mission_-isaia- in harmony_with_the mission of the Apostles , whom_the Lord sent '' to the whole_world '' to '' teach all nations , '' and it -isaia-_also linked to the mission of the hierarchical order . In the apostolate which consecrated_persons exercise , their spousal love for Christ becomes , in an organic way as it were , love for the Church as the Body of Christ , for the Church as the People of God , for the Church which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time Spouse and Mother . It -isaia- difficult to describe , or even to list , the many different_ways in which consecrated_persons fulfill their love for the Church through the apostolate . This apostolate -isaia- always born from that particular gift of your founders , which , received_from God and approved by the Church , has become a charism for the whole community . That gift corresponds to the different needs of the Church and the world -atti_degli_apostoli- particular moments of history , and in its turn it -isaia- extended and strengthened in the life of the religious communities as one of the enduring elements of the Church s life and apostolate . In each of these elements , in each field both of contemplation , so fruitful for the apostolate , and of direct apostolic action the Church s constant blessing accompanies you , as does -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time her pastoral and maternal solicitude , with_regard to the spiritual identity of your life and the correctness of your activity in the midst of the great universal community of the vocations and charisms of the whole People of God . Through each of the institutes separately and through_their organic integration in the whole of the Church s mission , special emphasis -isaia- given to that economy of the Redemption , the profound sign of which_each one of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , bears within himself or herself through the consecration and profession of the evangelical_counsels . And thus , even_though the many_different apostolic works that_you perform are extremely important , nevertheless the truly fundamental work of the apostolate remains always what and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time who you_are in the Church . Of each_one of you can be repeated , with_special appropriateness , these_words of St . Paul : '' For you_have died , and your life_-isaia- hidden with Christ in God . '' And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time this '' being hidden with Christ in God '' makes it possible to apply to you the words of the Master Himself : '' Let your light so shine before men , that_they_may see your good_works and give glory to your Father who_-isaia- in heaven . '' For the sake of this light with_which you_must '' shine before men , '' of great_importance among_you -isaia- the witness of mutual love , linked to the fraternal spirit of each community , for the Lord has said : '' By this all men will know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another . '' The fundamentally community nature of your religious_life , nourished by the teaching of the Gospel , by the sacred_liturgy and above all by the Eucharist , -isaia- a special_way of accomplishing this interpersonal and social dimension : by caring for one_another , by bearing one_another s burdens , you show by your unity that Christ -isaia- living in your midst . Important for your apostolate in the Church -isaia- every_kind of sensitivity to the needs and sufferings of the individual , which_are seen so clearly and so movingly in today_s_world . For the Apostle Paul teaches : '' Bear one_another s burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ , '' and he adds that '' love_-isaia- the fulfilling of the law . '' Your mission must be seen ! Deep , very deep must be the bond which links it to the Church ! Through everything_that you do , and especially through everything_that you_are , may the truth be proclaimed and reconfirmed that '' Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for_her '' : the truth that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of the whole economy of the Redemption . From Christ , the Redeemer of the world , may the inexhaustible source of your love for the Church pour forth ! VII CONCLUSION The Eyes Enlightening the Heart . This exhortation which I address to you on the Solemnity of the Annunciation in the Jubilee Year of the Redemption -isaia- meant to be an expression of that love_which the Church has for men_and_women_religious . You , dear brothers_and_sisters , are truly a special treasure of the Church . And this treasure becomes more understandable through meditation on the reality of the Redemption , for_which the present Holy Year offers a continuous opportunity and a welcome encouragement . Recognize , therefore , in this light , your identity and your dignity . May the Holy Spirit through Christ s cross and resurrection '' having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , '' enable you '' to know what_-isaia- the hope to which_he_has called you , what_are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints . '' These '' eyes enlightening the heart '' the Church unceasingly asks for each_one of you_who have_already taken the road of the profession of the evangelical_counsels . The Church , together_with you , asks for the same '' enlightened eyes '' for_many Christians , especially_for young men_and_women , that_they_may discover this_way and not be afraid to enter upon it , that_even in the midst of the adverse circumstances of life today they_may hear Christ s '' Follow me . '' You too must strive for_this through your prayer and also through the witness of that_love whereby '' God abides in us and his love_-isaia- perfected in us . '' May this witness become present everywhere and universally clear . May the people of our_times , in their_spiritual weariness , find in it both support and hope . Therefore , serve your brethren with the joy that wells up from a heart in which Christ has His dwelling . '' And may the world of our_time . be enabled to receive the Good News not from evangelizers who_are dejected and discouraged . but_from ministers of the Gospel whose lives glow with fervor , who_have first received_the joy of Christ . '' The Church , in her love for you , does not_cease '' kneeling before the Father , '' that He may effect in you '' . the strengthening of the inner nature , '' and as in you , so also in many_others of your baptized brothers_and_sisters , especially young_people , so that_they_may find the same_way to holiness which in the course of history so many generations have traveled together_with Christ , the Redeemer of the world and Spouse of souls , often leaving behind them the bright radiance of God s light against the dark and gray background of human_existence . To all of you_who travel this road in the present phase of the history of the Church and the world there_-isaia- addressed this fervent hope of the Jubilee Year of the Redemption , that '' you , being rooted and grounded in love , may have_the power to comprehend with all the saints what_-isaia- the breadth and length and height and depth , and to know_the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge , that_you_may be filled_with all the fullness of God . '' Message of the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord . On the feast of the Annunciation in this Holy Year of the Redemption , I place the present exhortation in the heart of the immaculate Virgin . Among all persons consecrated unreservedly to God , she -isaia-_the_first . She the Virgin of Nazareth -isaia-_also the one most fully consecrated to God , consecrated in the most perfect way . Her spousal love reached its height in the divine Motherhood through the power of the Holy Spirit . She , who as Mother carries Christ in her arms , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time fulfills in the most perfect way His call : '' Follow me . '' And she follows Him she , the Mother as her Teacher of chastity , poverty and obedience . How poor she_was on Bethlehem night and how poor on Calvary ! How obedient she_was -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Annunciation , and then -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross obedient even to the point of assenting to the death of her Son , who became obedient '' unto death '' ! How dedicated she_was in all her earthly life to the cause of the kingdom_of_heaven through most chaste love . If the entire Church finds in Mary her first model , all the more reason do you find her so you as consecrated individuals and communities within_the Church ! On the day that calls to mind the inauguration of the Jubilee of the Redemption , which took_place last year , I address myself to you with this present message , to invite you to renew your religious consecration according to the model of the consecration of the very Mother of God . Beloved brothers_and_sisters ! '' God -isaia- faithful , by whom_you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . '' Persevering in fidelity to Him who_-isaia- faithful , strive to find a very_special support in Mary ! For she_was called by God to the most perfect communion with His Son . May she , the faithful Virgin , also be the Mother of your evangelical way : may she help you to experience and to show to the world how infinitely faithful -isaia- God Himself ! With these hopes I bless you with all my heart . From the Vatican , on March , in the Jubilee Year of the Redemption , , the sixth of my Pontificate . JOHN PAUL II NOTES .

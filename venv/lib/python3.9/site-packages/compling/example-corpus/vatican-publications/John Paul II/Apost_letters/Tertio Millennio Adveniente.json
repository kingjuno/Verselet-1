As the third_millennium of the new era draws near , our_thoughts turn spontaneously to the words of the Apostle Paul : '' When the fullness_of_time had come , God sent forth his Son , born of woman '' Gal : . The fullness_of_time coincides with the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word , of the Son who_-isaia- of one being with the Father , and with the mystery of the Redemption of the world . In this passage , Saint Paul emphasizes that the Son of God was_born of woman , born under the Law , and came into_the_world in order to redeem all who_were under the Law , so that they_might receive adoption as sons_and_daughters . And he adds : '' Because you_are sons , God has_sent the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts , crying Abba ! Father ! '' His conclusion -isaia- truly comforting : '' So through God you_are no longer a slave but a son , and if a son then an heir '' Gal : . Paul s presentation of the mystery of the Incarnation contains the revelation of the mystery of the Trinity and the continuation of the Son s mission in the mission of the Holy Spirit . The Incarnation of the Son of God , his conception and birth , -isaia- the prerequisite for the sending of the Holy Spirit . This text of Saint Paul thus allows the fullness of the mystery of the Redemptive Incarnation to shine_forth . I '' JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY '' Heb : . In his Gospel Luke has handed_down to us a concise narrative of the circumstances of Jesus birth : '' In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled . And all went to be enrolled , each to his_own city . And Joseph also went up from Galilee , from the city of Nazareth , to Judea , to the city of David , which_-isaia- called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and lineage of David , to be enrolled with Mary , his betrothed , who_was with child . And while they_were there , the time came for_her to be delivered . And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths , and laid him in a manger , because there_was no place_for them in the inn '' : , . Thus was fulfilled what_the Angel Gabriel foretold -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , when he spoke to the Virgin of Nazareth in these_words : '' Hail , full of grace , the Lord -isaia- with you '' : . Mary was troubled by these_words , and so the divine messenger quickly added : '' Do not be afraid , Mary , for you_have found favour with God . And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus . He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you ; therefore the child to be born will be called holy , the Son of God '' : , . Mary s reply to the angel was unhesitating : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' : . Never in human_history did so much depend , as it did then , upon the consent of one human creature . John , in the Prologue of his Gospel , captures in one phrase all the depth of the mystery of the Incarnation . He writes : '' And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us , full of grace and truth ; we have beheld his glory , glory as of the only Son from the Father '' : . For John , the Incarnation of the Eternal Word , of one being with the Father , took_place in the conception and birth of Jesus . The Evangelist speaks of the Word who in the beginning was with God , and through whom everything which exists was_made ; the Word in whom was life , the life_which was_the light of men cf . Of the Only Begotten Son , God from God , the Apostle Paul writes that_he_-isaia- '' the first born of all creation '' Col : . God created the world through the Word . The Word -isaia- Eternal Wisdom ; the Thought and Substantial Image of God ; '' He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature '' Heb : . Eternally begotten and eternally loved by the Father , as God from God and Light from Light , he -isaia- the principle and archetype of everything created by God in time . The fact_that in the fullness_of_time the Eternal Word took on the condition of a creature gives a unique cosmic value to the event which took_place in Bethlehem two thousand years_ago . Thanks to the Word , the world of creatures appears as a '' cosmos '' , an ordered universe . And it -isaia-_the_same Word who , by taking flesh , renews the cosmic order of creation . The Letter to the Ephesians speaks of the purpose which God had set_forth in Christ , '' as a plan_for the fullness_of_time , to unite all things in him , things in heaven and things on earth '' : . Christ , the Redeemer of the world , -isaia-_the_one Mediator between God and men , and there_-isaia- no other name under heaven by which we can be saved cf . As we read in the Letter to the Ephesians : '' in him , we have redemption through_his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the richness of his_grace , which_he_has lavished upon us . For he has made_known to us in all wisdom and insight . his purpose which he set_forth in Christ as a plan_for the fullness_of_time , to unite all things in him , things in heaven and things on earth '' : . Christ , the Son who_-isaia- of one being with the Father , -isaia- therefore the one_who reveals God s plan_for all creation , and for_man in particular . In the memorable phrase of the Second Vatican Council , Christ '' fully reveals man to man_himself and makes his supreme calling clear '' . He shows us this calling by revealing the mystery of the Father and his_love . As the image of the invisible God , Christ -isaia- the perfect man_who has restored to the children of Adam the divine likeness which_had_been deformed by sin . In his human_nature , free_from all sin and assumed into the divine Person of the Word , the nature shared by all human_beings -isaia- raised to a sublime dignity : '' By his incarnation the Son of God united himself in some sense with every man . He laboured with human hands , thought with a human mind , acted with a human will , and loved with a human_heart . Born of Mary the Virgin he truly became one of us and , sin apart , was like us in every way '' . This '' becoming one of us '' on the part of the Son of God took_place in the greatest humility , so it -isaia- no wonder that secular historians , caught up by more stirring events and by famous personages , first made only passing , albeit significant , references to him . Such references to Christ are_found for example in The Antiquities of the Jews , a work compiled in Rome between_the years and by the historian Flavius Josephus , and especially in the Annals of Tacitus , written between_the years and , where , reporting the burning of Rome in the year , falsely attributed by Nero to the Christians , the historian makes an explicit reference to Christ '' executed by order of the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius '' . Suetonius too , in his biography of the Emperor Claudius , written around , informs us that the Jews were expelled from Rome because '' under the instigation of a certain Chrestus they stirred up frequent riots '' . This passage -isaia- generally interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ , who_had become a source of contention within Jewish circles in Rome . Also of importance as proof of the rapid spread of Christianity -isaia- the testimony of Pliny the Younger , the Governor of Bithynia , who reported to the Emperor Trajan , between_the years and , that a large number of people was accustomed to gather '' on a designated day , before dawn , to sing in alternating choirs a hymn to Christ as to a God '' . But the great event which non Christian historians merely mention in passing takes on its_full significance in the writings of the New Testament . These writings , although documents of faith , are no less reliable as historical testimonies , if we consider their references as a whole . Christ , true God and true man , the Lord of the cosmos , -isaia-_also the Lord of history , of which he -isaia- '' the Alpha and the Omega '' Rev : ; : , '' the beginning and the end '' Rev : . In him the Father has spoken the definitive word about mankind and its history . This -isaia- expressed in a concise and powerful way by the Letter to the Hebrews : '' In many and various_ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son '' : . Jesus was_born of the Chosen People , in fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham and constantly recalled by the Prophets . The latter spoke in God s name and in his place . The economy of the Old Testament , in fact , was essentially ordered to preparing and proclaiming the coming of Christ , the Redeemer of the universe , and of his Messianic Kingdom . The books of the Old Covenant are thus a permanent witness to a careful divine pedagogy . In Christ this pedagogy achieves its purpose : Jesus does_not in fact merely speak '' in the name of God '' like the Prophets , but he -isaia- God himself speaking in his Eternal Word made_flesh . Here we touch upon the essential point by which Christianity differs from all the other_religions , by which_man s search_for God has_been expressed from earliest times . Christianity has its starting point in the Incarnation of the Word . Here , it -isaia- not_simply a case of man seeking God , but of God who comes in Person to speak to man of himself and to show him the path by which he may be reached . This -isaia- what_-isaia- proclaimed in the Prologue of John s Gospel : '' No one has_ever seen God ; the only Son , who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father , he has made him known '' : . The Incarnate Word -isaia- thus_the fulfilment of the yearning present in all the religions of mankind : this fulfilment -isaia- brought_about by God himself and transcends all human expectations . It -isaia- the mystery of grace . In Christ , religion -isaia-_no_longer a '' blind search_for God '' cf . Acts : but the response of faith to God who reveals himself . It -isaia- a response in which_man speaks to God as his Creator and Father , a response made possible by that_one Man who -isaia-_also the consubstantial Word in whom God speaks to each_individual person and by whom each_individual person_-isaia- enabled to respond to God . What -isaia- more , in this Man all creation responds to God . Jesus Christ -isaia- the new beginning of everything . In him all things come into_their own ; they_are taken up and given back to the Creator from whom_they first came . Christ -isaia- thus_the fulfilment of the yearning of all the world s religions and , as such , he -isaia- their sole and definitive completion . Just as God in Christ speaks to humanity of himself , so in Christ all humanity and the whole of creation speaks of itself to God indeed , it gives itself to God . Everything thus returns to its origin . Jesus Christ -isaia- the recapitulation of everything cf . Eph : and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the fulfilment of all things in God : a fulfilment which_-isaia- the glory of God . The religion founded upon Jesus Christ -isaia- a religion of glory ; it -isaia- a newness of life_for the praise of the glory of God cf . All creation -isaia- in reality a manifestation of his glory . In particular , man vivens homo -isaia- the epiphany of God s glory , man who_-isaia- called to live by the fullness of life in God . In Jesus Christ God not_only speaks to man but_also seeks him out . The Incarnation of the Son of God attests that God goes in search of man . Jesus speaks of this search as the finding of a lost sheep cf . It -isaia- a search which begins in the heart of God and culminates in the Incarnation of the Word . If God goes in search of man , created in his_own image_and_likeness , he does so because he loves him eternally in the Word , and wishes to raise him in Christ to the dignity of an adoptive son . God therefore goes in search of man_who -isaia-_his special possession in a way unlike any_other creature . Man -isaia- God s possession by virtue of a choice made in love : God seeks man out , moved by his fatherly heart . Why does God seek man out ? Because man_has turned away from him , hiding himself as Adam did among the trees of the Garden of Eden cf . Man allowed himself to be led astray by the enemy of God cf . Satan deceived man , persuading him_that he too was a god , that he , like God , was capable of knowing good_and_evil , ruling the world according_to_his own will without having to take into_account_the divine will cf . Going in search of man through_his Son , God wishes to persuade man to abandon the paths of evil which lead him farther and farther afield . '' Making him abandon '' those paths means making man understand that_he_-isaia- taking the wrong path ; it means overcoming the evil which_-isaia- everywhere found in human_history . Overcoming evil : this_-isaia- the meaning of the Redemption . This -isaia- brought_about in the sacrifice of Christ , by which_man redeems the debt of sin and -isaia- reconciled to God . The Son of God became man , taking a body_and_soul in the womb of the Virgin , precisely for this_reason : to become the perfect redeeming sacrifice . The religion of the Incarnation -isaia- the religion of the world s Redemption through the sacrifice of Christ , wherein lies victory over evil , over sin and over death itself . Accepting death on the Cross , Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time reveals and gives_life , because he rises again and death no longer has power over him . The religion which originates in the mystery of the Redemptive Incarnation , -isaia- the religion of '' dwelling in the heart of God '' , of sharing in God s very life . Saint Paul speaks of this in the passage already quoted : '' God has_sent the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts , crying , Abba ! Father ! '' Gal : . Man cries out like Christ himself , who turned to God '' with loud cries and tears '' Heb : , especially in Gethsemane and on the Cross : man cries out to God just as Christ cried out to him , and thus he bears_witness that he shares in Christ s sonship through the power of the Holy Spirit . The Holy Spirit , whom_the Father has_sent in the name of the Son , enables man to share in the inmost life of God . He also enables man to be a son , in the likeness of Christ , and an heir of all that belongs to the Son cf . In this consists the religion of '' dwelling in the inmost life of God '' , which begins with the Incarnation of the Son of God . The Holy Spirit , who searches the depths of God cf . Cor : , leads us , all mankind , into these depths by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ . II THE JUBILEE OF THE YEAR . Speaking of the birth of the Son of God , Saint Paul places this event in the '' fullness_of_time '' cf . Time -isaia- indeed fulfilled by the very fact_that God , in the Incarnation , came down into human_history . Eternity entered into time : what '' fulfilment '' could be greater_than this ? What other '' fulfilment '' would be possible ? Some have thought in terms of certain mysterious cosmic cycles in which_the history of the universe , and of mankind in particular , would constantly repeat itself . True , man rises from the earth and returns to it cf . Gen : : this_-isaia- an immediately evident fact . Yet in man there_-isaia- an irrepressible longing to live forever . How are we to imagine a life beyond death ? Some have considered various_forms of reincarnation : depending on one s previous life , one would receive a new_life in either a higher or lower form , until full purification -isaia- attained . This belief , deeply rooted in some Eastern religions , itself indicates that_man rebels against the finality of death . He -isaia- convinced_that his nature_-isaia- essentially spiritual and immortal . Christian revelation excludes reincarnation , and speaks of a fulfilment which man_-isaia- called to achieve in the course of a single earthly existence . Man achieves this fulfilment of his destiny through the sincere gift_of_self , a gift which_-isaia- made possible only through_his encounter_with God . It -isaia- in God that_man finds full self realization : this_-isaia- the truth revealed by Christ . Man fulfils himself in God , who comes to meet him through_his Eternal Son . Thanks to God s coming on earth , human time , which began -atti_degli_apostoli- Creation , has reached its fullness . '' The fullness_of_time '' -isaia-_in_fact eternity , indeed , it -isaia- the One who_-isaia- eternal , God himself . Thus , to enter_into '' the fullness_of_time '' means to reach the end of time and to transcend its limits , in order to find time s fulfilment in the eternity of God . In Christianity time has a fundamental importance . Within the dimension of time the world was created ; within it the history_of_salvation unfolds , finding its culmination in the '' fullness_of_time '' of the Incarnation , and its goal in the glorious return of the Son of God -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time . In Jesus Christ , the Word made_flesh , time becomes a dimension of God , who_-isaia- himself eternal . With the coming of Christ there begin '' the last days '' cf . Heb : , the '' last hour '' cf . Jn : , and the time of the Church , which_will last until the Parousia . From this relationship of God with time there arises the duty to sanctify time . This -isaia- done , for example , when individual times , days or weeks , are dedicated to God , as once happened in the religion of the Old Covenant , and as happens still , though in a new_way , in Christianity . In the liturgy of the Easter Vigil the celebrant , as he blesses the candle which symbolizes the Risen Christ , proclaims : '' Christ yesterday and today , the beginning and the end , Alpha and Omega , all time belongs to him , and all the ages , to him be glory and power through every_age for ever '' . He says these_words as he inscribes on the candle the numerals of the current year . The meaning of this rite -isaia- clear : it emphasizes the fact_that Christ -isaia- the Lord of time ; he -isaia- its beginning and its end ; every year , every_day and every moment are embraced by his Incarnation and Resurrection , and thus become part of the '' fullness_of_time '' . For this_reason , the Church too lives and celebrates the liturgy in the span of a year . The solar year -isaia- thus permeated by the liturgical year , which in a certain way reproduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption , beginning from the First Sunday of Advent and ending on the Solemnity of Christ the King , Lord of the Universe and Lord of History . Every Sunday commemorates the day of the Lord s Resurrection . Against this background , we can understand_the custom of Jubilees , which began in the Old Testament and continues in the history of the Church . Jesus of Nazareth , going back one_day to the synagogue of his home town , stood up to read cf . Taking the book of the Prophet Isaiah , he read this passage : '' The Spirit of the Lord God -isaia- upon me , because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted ; he has_sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to those_who_are bound ; to proclaim_the year of the Lord s favour '' : . The Prophet was speaking of the Messiah . '' Today '' , Jesus added , '' this scripture has_been fulfilled in your hearing '' Lk : , thus indicating that he himself was_the Messiah foretold by the Prophet , and that the long expected '' time '' was beginning in him . The day of salvation had come , the '' fullness_of_time '' . All Jubilees point to this '' time '' and refer to the Messianic mission of Christ , who came as the one '' anointed '' by the Holy Spirit , the one '' sent by the Father '' . It -isaia- he who proclaims_the good_news to the poor . It -isaia- he who brings liberty to those deprived of it , who frees the oppressed and gives back sight to the blind cf . In this_way he ushers in '' a year of the Lord s favour '' , which he proclaims not only_with his_words but_above all by his actions . The Jubilee , '' a year of the Lord s favour '' , characterizes all the activity of Jesus ; it -isaia- not merely the recurrence of an anniversary in time . The words and deeds of Jesus thus represent the fulfilment of the whole tradition of Jubilees in the Old Testament . We know_that the Jubilee was a time dedicated in a special_way to God . It fell every seventh year , according to the Law of Moses : this_was the '' sabbatical year '' , during which_the earth was left fallow and slaves were set free . The duty to free slaves was regulated by detailed prescriptions contained in the Books of Exodus : , Leviticus : and Deuteronomy : . In other_words , these prescriptions are_found in practically the whole of biblical legislation , which_-isaia- thus marked by this_very specific characteristic . In the sabbatical year , in addition to the freeing of slaves the Law also provided for the cancellation of all debts in accordance_with precise regulations . And all this_was to be done in honour of God . What was true for the sabbatical year was_also true for the jubilee_year , which fell every fifty years . In the jubilee_year , however , the customs of the sabbatical year were broadened and celebrated with even greater solemnity . As we read in Leviticus : '' You shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout_the land to all its inhabitants ; it shall be a jubilee for you , when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his family '' : . One of the most significant consequences of the jubilee_year was_the general '' emancipation '' of all the dwellers on the land in need of being freed . On this occasion every Israelite regained possession of his ancestral land , if he happened to have sold it or lost it by falling into slavery . He could never be completely deprived of the land , because it belonged to God ; nor could the Israelites remain for ever in a state of slavery , since God had '' redeemed '' them for_himself as his exclusive possession by freeing them_from slavery in Egypt . The prescriptions for the jubilee_year largely remained ideals more a hope than an actual fact . They thus became a prophetia futuri insofar as they foretold the freedom which_would be won by the coming Messiah . Even so , on the basis of the juridical norms contained in these prescriptions a kind of social_doctrine began to emerge , which_would then more_clearly develop beginning with the New Testament . The jubilee_year was meant to restore equality among all the children of Israel , offering new possibilities to families which_had lost their property and even their_personal freedom . On the other_hand , the jubilee_year was a reminder to the rich that a time would come when their Israelite slaves would once_again become their equals and would be able to reclaim their_rights . At the times prescribed by Law , a jubilee_year had to be proclaimed , to assist those in need . This was required by just government . Justice , according to the Law of Israel , consisted above all in the protection of the weak , and a king was supposed to be outstanding in this_regard , as the Psalmist says : '' He delivers the needy when he calls , the poor and him_who has no helper . He has pity on the weak and the needy , and saves the lives of the needy '' Ps : . The foundations of this tradition were strictly theological , linked first of all with the theology of Creation and with_that of Divine Providence . It was a common conviction , in fact , that to God alone , as Creator , belonged the '' dominium altum '' lordship over all Creation and over the earth in particular cf . If in his Providence God had given the earth to humanity , that meant that he had given it to everyone . Therefore the riches of Creation were to be considered as a common_good of the whole of humanity . Those who possessed these goods as personal property were really only stewards , ministers charged with working in the name of God , who remains the sole owner in the full sense , since_it_-isaia- God s will that created goods should serve everyone in a just way . The jubilee_year was meant to restore this social_justice . The social_doctrine of the Church , which has_always_been a part of Church teaching and which_has developed greatly in the last century , particularly after_the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , -isaia- rooted in the tradition of the jubilee_year . What needs to be emphasized , however , -isaia- what Isaiah expresses in the words '' to proclaim_the year of the Lord s favour '' . For the Church , the Jubilee -isaia- precisely this '' year of the Lord s favour '' , a year of the remission of sins and of the punishments due to them , a year of reconciliation between disputing parties , a year of manifold conversions and of sacramental and extra sacramental penance . The tradition of jubilee years involves the granting of indulgences on a larger scale than -atti_degli_apostoli- other times . Together with Jubilees recalling the mystery of the Incarnation , -atti_degli_apostoli- intervals of a hundred , fifty and twenty five years , there_are also Jubilees which commemorate the event of the Redemption : the Cross of Christ , his_death on Golgotha and the Resurrection . On these occasions , the Church proclaims '' a year of the Lord s favour '' , and she tries to ensure_that all the faithful can benefit from this grace . That -isaia- why Jubilees are celebrated not_only '' in Urbe '' but_also '' extra Urbem '' : traditionally the latter took_place the year after_the celebration '' in Urbe '' . In the lives of individuals , Jubilees are usually connected_with_the date of birth ; but other anniversaries are_also celebrated , such as those of Baptism , Confirmation , First Communion , Priestly or Episcopal Ordination , and the Sacrament of Marriage . Some of these anniversaries have parallels in the secular world , but Christians always give_them a religious character . In fact , in the Christian view , every Jubilee the twenty fifth of Marriage or Priesthood , known as '' silver '' , the fiftieth , known as '' golden '' , or the sixtieth , known as '' diamond '' -isaia- a particular year of favour for the individual who has_received one or other of the Sacraments . What we have_said about individuals with_regard to jubilees can_also be applied to communities or institutions . Thus we celebrate the centenary or the millennium of the foundation of a town or city . In the Church , we celebrate the jubilees of parishes and dioceses . All these personal and community Jubilees have an important and significant role in the lives of individuals and communities . In view of this , the two thousand years which_have passed since_the Birth of Christ prescinding from the question of its precise chronology represent an extraordinarily great Jubilee , not_only_for Christians but indirectly for the whole of humanity , given the prominent role played by Christianity during these_two millennia . It -isaia- significant that the calculation of the passing years begins almost everywhere with the year of Christ s coming into_the_world , which_-isaia- thus_the centre of the calendar most widely used today . Is this not another sign of the unparalleled effect of the Birth of Jesus of Nazareth on the history of mankind ? . The term '' Jubilee '' speaks of joy ; not_just an inner joy but a jubilation which_-isaia- manifested outwardly , for the coming of God -isaia-_also an outward , visible , audible and tangible event , as Saint John makes clear cf . It -isaia- thus appropriate that_every sign of joy -atti_degli_apostoli- this coming should_have its_own outward expression . This will demonstrate that the Church rejoices in salvation . She invites everyone to rejoice , and she tries to create conditions to ensure_that the power of salvation may be shared by all . Hence the Year will be celebrated as the Great Jubilee . With regard to its content , this Great Jubilee will be , in a certain_sense , like any_other . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it will be different , greater_than any_other . For the Church respects the measurements of time : hours , days , years , centuries . She thus goes forward with every_individual , helping everyone to realize how each of these measurements of time -isaia- imbued_with the presence of God and with_his saving activity . In this_spirit the Church rejoices , gives thanks and asks forgiveness , presenting her petitions to the Lord of history and of human consciences . Among the most fervent petitions which_the Church makes to the Lord during_this important time , as the eve of the new millennium approaches , -isaia- that_unity among all Christians of the various confessions will increase until they reach full_communion . I pray that the Jubilee will be a promising opportunity_for fruitful cooperation in the many areas which unite us ; these_are unquestionably more numerous than those_which divide us . It would thus be quite helpful if , with due respect_for the programmes of the individual Churches and Communities , ecumenical agreements could be reached with_regard to the preparation and celebration of the Jubilee . In this_way the Jubilee will bear_witness even_more forcefully before the world_that the disciples of Christ are fully resolved to reach full unity as soon as possible in the certainty_that '' nothing_-isaia- impossible with God '' . III PREPARATION FOR THE GREAT JUBILEE . In the Church s history every jubilee -isaia- prepared_for by Divine Providence . This -isaia- true also of the Great Jubilee of the Year . With this conviction , we look today with a sense of gratitude and yet with a sense_of_responsibility -atti_degli_apostoli- all that_has happened in human_history since_the Birth of Christ , particularly the events which_have occurred between_the years and . But in a very particular_way , we look with the eyes of faith to our_own century , searching out whatever bears_witness not_only to man s history but_also to God s intervention in human affairs . From this point_of_view we can affirm that the Second Vatican Council was a providential event , whereby_the Church began the more immediate preparation_for the Jubilee of the Second Millennium . It was a Council similar to earlier ones , yet very different ; it was a Council focused on the mystery of Christ and his Church and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time open to the world . This openness was an evangelical response to recent changes in the world , including the profoundly disturbing experiences of the Twentieth Century , a century scarred by the First and Second World Wars , by the experience of concentration camps and by horrendous massacres . All these events demonstrate most vividly that_the_world needs purification ; it needs to be converted . The Second Vatican Council -isaia-_often considered as the beginning of a new era in the life of the Church . This -isaia- true , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time it -isaia- difficult to overlook the fact_that the Council drew much from the experiences and reflections of the immediate past , especially from the intellectual legacy left by Pius XII . In the history of the Church , the '' old '' and the '' new '' are always closely interwoven . The '' new '' grows out of the '' old '' , and the '' old '' finds a fuller expression in the '' new '' . Thus it was for the Second Vatican Council and for the activity of the Popes connected_with_the Council , starting with John XXIII , continuing with Paul VI and John Paul I , up to the present Pope . What these Popes have accomplished during and since_the Council , in their Magisterium no less_than in their pastoral_activity , has certainly made a significant contribution to the preparation of that new springtime of Christian life_which will be revealed by the Great Jubilee , if Christians are docile to the action of the Holy Spirit . The Council , while not imitating the sternness of John the Baptist who called_for repentance and conversion on the banks of the Jordan cf . Lk : , did show something of the Prophet of old , pointing out with fresh vigour to the men_and_women of today that Jesus Christ -isaia- the '' Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world '' Jn : , the Redeemer of humanity and the Lord of history . During the Council , precisely out of a desire to be fully faithful to her Master , the Church questioned herself about her_own identity , and discovered anew the depth of her mystery as the Body and the Bride of Christ . Humbly heeding the word of God , she reaffirmed the universal call to holiness ; she made provision for the reform of the liturgy , the '' origin and summit '' of her_life ; she gave impetus to the renewal of many aspects of her_life -atti_degli_apostoli- the universal level and in the local Churches ; she strove to promote the various Christian vocations , from those of the laity to those of Religious , from the ministry of deacons to that of priests and Bishops ; and in a particular_way she rediscovered episcopal collegiality , that privileged expression of the pastoral service carried_out by the Bishops in communion with the Successor of Peter . On the basis of this profound renewal , the Council opened itself to Christians of other denominations , to the followers of other_religions and to all the people of our_time . No Council had ever spoken so clearly about Christian unity , about dialogue_with non Christian religions , about the specific meaning of the Old Covenant and of Israel , about the dignity of each_person s conscience , about the principle of religious liberty , about the different cultural traditions within which_the Church carries out her missionary mandate , and about the means of social communication . The Council s enormously rich body of teaching and the striking new tone in the way it presented this content constitute as it were a proclamation of new times . The Council Fathers spoke in the language of the Gospel , the language of the Sermon on the Mount and the Beatitudes . In the Council s message God -isaia- presented in his absolute lordship over all things , but_also as the One who ensures the authentic autonomy of earthly realities . The best preparation_for the new millennium , therefore , can_only be expressed in a renewed commitment to apply , as faithfully as possible , the teachings of Vatican II to the life of every_individual and of the whole Church . It was with the Second Vatican Council that , in the broadest sense of the term , the immediate preparations for the Great Jubilee of the Year were really begun . If we look for an analogy in the liturgy , it could be said_that the yearly Advent liturgy -isaia- the season nearest to the spirit of the Council . For Advent prepares us to meet_the One who_was , who_-isaia- and who_-isaia- to come cf . Part of the preparation_for the approach of the Year -isaia- the series of Synods begun after_the Second Vatican Council : general Synods together_with continental , regional , national and diocesan Synods . The theme underlying them all -isaia- evangelization , or rather the new_evangelization , the foundations of which_were laid_down in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi of Pope Paul VI , issued in following the Third General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . These Synods themselves are part of the new_evangelization : they_were born of the Second Vatican Council s vision of the Church . They open up broad areas for the participation of the laity , whose specific responsibilities in the Church they define . They are an expression of the strength which Christ has_given to the entire People of God , making it a sharer in his_own Messianic mission as Prophet , Priest and King . Very eloquent in this_regard are the statements of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium . The preparation_for the Jubilee Year -isaia- thus taking place throughout_the whole Church , on the universal and local levels , giving her a new awareness of the salvific mission she_has received_from Christ . This awareness -isaia- particularly evident in the Post Synodal Exhortations devoted to the mission of the laity , the formation of priests , catechesis , the family , the value of penance and reconciliation in the life of the Church and of humanity in general , as well as in the forth coming one to be devoted to the consecrated_life . Special tasks and responsibilities with_regard to the Great Jubilee of the Year belong to the ministry of the Bishop of Rome . In a certain_sense , all the Popes of the past century have prepared_for this Jubilee . With his programme to renew all things in Christ , Saint Pius X tried to forestall the tragic developments which arose from the international situation -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this century . The Church was aware of her duty to act decisively to promote and defend the basic values of peace and justice in the face of contrary tendencies in our_time . The Popes of the period before the Council acted with firm commitment , each in his_own way : Benedict XV found himself faced_with the tragedy of the First World War ; Pius XI had to contend with the threats of totalitarian systems or systems which did_not respect human_freedom in Germany , in Russia , in Italy , in Spain , and even earlier still in Mexico . Pius XII took steps to counter the very grave injustice brought_about by a total contempt for human_dignity -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Second World War . He also provided enlightened guidelines for the birth of a new world order after_the fall of the previous political systems . Furthermore , in the course of this century the Popes , following in the footsteps of Leo XIII , systematically developed the themes of Catholic social_doctrine , expounding the characteristics of a just system in the area of relations_between labour and capital . We may recall_the Encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of Pius XI , the numerous interventions of Pius XII , the Encyclicals Mater et Magistra and Pacem in Terris of John XXIII , the Encyclical Populorum Progressio and the Apostolic Letter Octogesima Adveniens of Paul VI . I too have frequently dealt_with this_subject : I specifically devoted the Encyclical Laborem Exercens to the importance of human labour , while in Centesimus Annus I wished to reaffirm the relevance , one hundred years later , of the doctrine presented in Rerum Novarum . In my Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis I had earlier offered a systematic reformulation of the Church s entire social_doctrine against the background of the East West confrontation and the danger of nuclear war . The two elements of the Church s social_doctrine the safeguarding of human_dignity and rights in the sphere of a just relation between labour and capital and the promotion of peace were closely joined in this text . The Papal Messages of January each year , begun in in the pontificate of Paul VI , are_also meant to serve the cause of peace . Since the publication of the very first document of my Pontificate , I have spoken explicitly of the Great Jubilee , suggesting that the time leading up to it be lived as '' a new Advent '' . This theme has since reappeared many times , and was dwelt upon -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the Encyclical Dominum et Vivificantem . In fact , preparing for the Year has become as it were a hermeneutical key of my Pontificate . It -isaia- certainly not a matter of indulging in a new millenarianism , as occurred in some quarters -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the first millennium ; rather , it -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- an increased sensitivity to all that the Spirit -isaia- saying to the Church and to the Churches cf . , as well as to individuals through charisms meant to serve the whole community . The purpose -isaia- to emphasize what_the Spirit -isaia- suggesting to the different communities , from the smallest ones , such as the family , to the largest ones , such as nations and international organizations , taking into_account cultures , societies and sound traditions . Despite appearances , humanity continues to await the revelation of the children of God , and lives by this hope , like a mother in labour , to use the image employed so powerfully by Saint Paul in his Letter to the Romans cf . Papal Journeys have_become an important element in the work of implementing the Second Vatican Council . Begun by John XXIII on the eve of the Council with a memorable pilgrimage to Loreto and Assisi , they notably increased under Paul VI who , after first visiting the Holy Land , undertook nine other great apostolic journeys which brought him into direct contact_with_the peoples of the different continents . The current Pontificate has widened this programme of travels even further , starting with Mexico , on the occasion of the Third General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate held in Puebla in . In that_same year , there_was also the trip to Poland for the Jubilee of the nine hundredth anniversary of the death of Saint Stanislaus , Bishop and Martyr . The successive stages of these travels are well_known . Papal journeys have_become a regular occurrence , taking in the particular Churches in every continent and showing concern_for the development of ecumenical relationships with Christians of various denominations . Particularly important in this_regard were_the visits to Turkey , Germany , England , Scotland and Wales , Switzerland , the Scandinavian countries , and most recently the Baltic countries . At present , it -isaia- my fervent wish to visit Sarajevo in Bosnia Hercegovina and the Middle East : Lebanon , Jerusalem and the Holy Land . It would be very significant if in the Year it were possible to visit the places on the road taken by the People of God of the Old Covenant , starting from the places associated_with Abraham and Moses , through Egypt and Mount Sinai , as far as Damascus , the city which witnessed the conversion of Saint Paul . In preparing for the Year , the individual Churches have_their own role to play , as they celebrate with_their own Jubilees significant stages in the salvation history of the various peoples . Among these regional or local Jubilees , events of great_importance have included the millennium of the Baptism of Rus in as also the five hundredth anniversary of the beginning of evangelization in America . Besides events of such wide ranging impact , we may recall others which , although not of universal importance , are no less significant : for example , the millennium of the Baptism of Poland in and of the Baptism of Hungary in , together_with_the six hundredth anniversary of the Baptism of Lithuania in . There will soon also be celebrated the th anniversary of the Baptism of Clovis , king of the Franks , and the th anniversary of the arrival of Saint Augustine in Canterbury , marking the beginning of the evangelization of the Anglo Saxon world . As far as Asia -isaia- concerned , the Jubilee will remind us of the Apostle Thomas , who , according to tradition , brought the proclamation of the Gospel -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of the Christian era to India , where missionaries from Portugal would_not arrive until about the year . The current year also marks the seventh centenary of the evangelization of China , and we are preparing to commemorate the spread of missionary work in the Philippines with the erection of the Metropolitan See of Manila . We likewise look forward to the fourth centenary of the first martyrs in Japan . In Africa , where_the first proclamation of the Gospel also dates back to Apostolic times , together_with_the th anniversary of the episcopal consecration of the first Bishop of the Ethiopians , Saint Frumentius c . , and the five hundredth anniversary of the beginning of the evangelization of Angola in the ancient Kingdom of the Congo , nations such as Cameroon , C\u00f4te d Ivoire , the Central African Republic , Burundi and Burkina Faso are celebrating the centenaries of the arrival of the first missionaries in their_respective territories . Other African nations have recently celebrated such centenaries . And how_can we fail to mention the Eastern Churches , whose ancient Patriarchates are so closely linked to the apostolic heritage and whose venerable theological , liturgical and spiritual traditions constitute a tremendous wealth which_-isaia- the common patrimony of the whole of Christianity ? The many jubilee celebrations in these Churches , and in the Communities which acknowledge them as the origin of their_own apostolicity , recall_the journey of Christ down_the_centuries , leading to the Great Jubilee -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium . Seen in this light , the whole of Christian history appears to us as a single river , into which many tributaries pour their waters . The Year invites us to gather with renewed fidelity and ever deeper communion along the banks of this_great river : the river of Revelation , of Christianity and of the Church , a river which flows through human_history starting from the event which took_place -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and then -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem two thousand years_ago . This -isaia- truly the '' river '' which with its '' streams '' , in the expression of the Psalm , '' make glad the city of God '' : . The Holy Years celebrated in the latter part of this century have_also prepared_for the Year . The Holy Year proclaimed by Paul VI in -isaia- still fresh in our memory . The celebration of as the Year of Redemption followed along the same lines . The Marian Year perhaps struck a more resounding chord ; it was eagerly awaited and profoundly experienced in the individual local Churches , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the Marian Shrines around_the world . The Encyclical Redemptoris Mater , issued on that occasion , drew attention to the Council s teaching on the presence of the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and the Church : two thousand years_ago the Son of God was_made man by the power of the Holy Spirit and was_born of the Immaculate Virgin Mary . The Marian Year was as it were an anticipation of the Jubilee , and contained much of what will_find fuller expression in the Year . It would be difficult not to recall that the Marian Year took_place only shortly before the events of . Those events remain surprising for their vastness and especially_for the speed with which_they occurred . The Eighties were years marked by a growing danger from the '' Cold War '' . ushered in a peaceful resolution which took the form , as it were , of an '' organic '' development . In the light of this_fact , we are led to recognize a truly prophetic significance in the Encyclical Rerum Novarum : everything_that Pope Leo XIII wrote there about Communism was borne out by these events , as I emphasized in the Encyclical Centesimus Annus . In the unfolding of those events one could already discern the invisible hand of Providence -atti_degli_apostoli- work with maternal care : '' Can a woman forget her infant . After however there arose new dangers and threats . In the countries of the former Eastern bloc , after_the fall of Communism , there appeared the serious threat of exaggerated nationalism , as -isaia- evident from events in the Balkans and other neighbouring areas . This obliges the European nations to make a serious examination of conscience , and to acknowledge faults and errors , both economic and political , resulting from imperialist policies carried_out in the previous and present centuries vis \u00e0 vis nations whose rights have_been systematically violated . In the wake of the Marian Year , we are_now observing the Year of the Family , a celebration which_-isaia- closely connected_with_the mystery of the Incarnation and with the very history of humanity . Thus there_-isaia- good cause to hope_that the Year of the Family , inaugurated -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , will_become , like the Marian Year , another significant stage in preparation_for the Great Jubilee . With this in view , I wrote a Letter to Families , the purpose of which_was to restate the substance of the Church s teaching on the family , and to bring this_teaching , so to speak , into every home . At the Second Vatican Council , the Church recognized her duty to promote the dignity of marriage and the family . The Year of the Family -isaia- meant to help make_the Council s teaching in this_regard a reality . Each family , in some_way , should be involved in the preparation_for the Great Jubilee . Was it not through a family , the family of Nazareth , that the Son of God chose to enter_into human_history ? IV IMMEDIATE PREPARATION . Against the background of this sweeping panorama a question arises : can we draw up a specific programme of initiatives for the immediate preparation of the Great Jubilee ? In fact , what_has_been said above already includes some elements of such a programme . A more detailed plan of specific events will call_for widespread consultation , in order for it not to be artificial and difficult to implement in the particular Churches , which live in such different conditions . For this_reason , I wished to consult the Presidents of the Episcopal Conferences and especially_the Cardinals . I -amos- grateful to the members of the College of Cardinals who met in Extraordinary Consistory on June , considered numerous proposals and suggested helpful guidelines . I also thank my Brothers in the Episcopate who in various_ways communicated valuable ideas , which I have kept carefully in mind while writing this Apostolic Letter . The first recommendation which clearly emerged from the consultation regards the period of preparation . Only a few years now separate us from the Year : it seemed fitting to divide this period into two phases , reserving the strictly preparatory phase for the last three years . It was thought that the accumulation of many activities over the course of a longer period of preparation would detract from its spiritual intensity . It was therefore considered appropriate to approach the historic date with a first phase , which_would make_the faithful aware of general themes , and then to concentrate the direct and immediate preparation into a second phase consisting of a three year period wholly directed to the celebration of the mystery of Christ the Saviour . The first phase will therefore be of an ante preparatory character ; it -isaia- meant to revive in the Christian people an awareness of the value and meaning of the Jubilee of the Year in human_history . As a commemoration of the Birth of Christ , the Jubilee -isaia- deeply charged with Christological significance . In keeping_with_the unfolding of the Christian faith in word and Sacrament , it seems important , even in this special anniversary , to link the structure of memorial with_that of celebration , not limiting commemoration of the event only to ideas but_also making its saving significance present through the celebration of the Sacraments . The Jubilee celebration should confirm the Christians of today in their_faith in God who_has revealed himself in Christ , sustain their hope which reaches out in expectation of eternal_life , and rekindle their charity in active service to their brothers_and_sisters . During the first stage to the Holy See , through a special Committee established for this_purpose , will suggest courses of reflection and action -atti_degli_apostoli- the universal level . A similar commitment to promoting awareness will be carried_out in a more detailed way by corresponding Commissions in the local Churches . In a way , it -isaia-_a_question of continuing what_was done in the period of remote preparation and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time of coming to a deeper appreciation of the most significant aspects of the Jubilee celebration . A Jubilee -isaia- always an occasion of special grace , '' a day blessed by the Lord '' . As has_already_been noted , it -isaia- thus a time of joy . The Jubilee of the Year -isaia- meant to be a great prayer of praise and thanksgiving , especially_for the gift of the Incarnation of the Son of God and of the Redemption which he accomplished . In the Jubilee Year Christians will stand with the renewed wonder of faith before the love of the Father , who gave_his Son , '' that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life '' Jn : . With a profound sense of commitment , they_will likewise express their gratitude for the gift of the Church , established by Christ as '' a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind '' . Their thanksgiving will embrace the fruits of holiness which_have matured in the life of all those many men_and_women_who in every generation and every period of history have fully welcomed the gift of Redemption . Nevertheless , the joy of every Jubilee -isaia- above all a joy based upon the forgiveness of sins , the joy of conversion . It therefore seems appropriate to emphasize once_more the theme of the Synod of Bishops in : penance and reconciliation . That Synod was an event of extraordinary significance in the life of the post conciliar Church . It took up the ever topical question of conversion '' metanoia '' , which_-isaia- the pre condition_for reconciliation with God on the part of both individuals and communities . Hence it -isaia- appropriate that , as the Second Millennium of Christianity draws to a close , the Church should become more_fully conscious of the sinfulness of her_children , recalling all those times in history when_they departed from the spirit of Christ and his Gospel and , instead of offering to the world_the witness of a life inspired by the values of faith , indulged in ways of thinking and acting which_were truly forms of counter witness and scandal . Although she_-isaia- holy because of her incorporation into Christ , the Church does_not tire of doing penance : before God and man she always acknowledges as her_own her sinful sons_and_daughters . As Lumen Gentium affirms : '' The Church , embracing sinners to her bosom , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time holy and always in need of being purified , and incessantly pursues the path of penance and renewal '' . The Holy Door of the Jubilee of the Year should be symbolically wider than those of previous Jubilees , because humanity , upon reaching this goal , will leave behind not_just a century but a millennium . It -isaia- fitting_that the Church should make_this passage with a clear awareness of what_has happened to her during the last ten centuries . She cannot cross the threshold of the new millennium without encouraging her_children to purify themselves , through repentance , of past errors and instances of infidelity , inconsistency , and slowness to act . Acknowledging the weaknesses of the past -isaia- an act of honesty and courage which helps us to strengthen our faith_,_which alerts us to face today s temptations and challenges and prepares us to meet them . Among the sins which require a greater commitment to repentance and conversion should certainly be counted those which_have_been detrimental to the unity willed by God for his People . In the course of the thousand years now drawing to a close , even_more than in the first millennium , ecclesial_communion has_been painfully wounded , a fact '' for_which , -atti_degli_apostoli- times , men of both sides were to blame '' . Such wounds openly contradict the will of Christ and are a cause of scandal to the world . These sins of the past unfortunately still burden us and remain ever present temptations . It -isaia- necessary to make amends for them , and earnestly to beseech Christ s forgiveness . In these last years of the millennium , the Church should invoke the Holy Spirit with ever_greater insistence , imploring from him the grace of Christian unity . This -isaia- a crucial matter for our testimony to the Gospel before the world . Especially since_the Second Vatican Council many ecumenical initiatives have_been undertaken with generosity and commitment : it can_be_said that_the_whole activity of the local Churches and of the Apostolic See has_taken on an ecumenical dimension in recent_years . The Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity has become an important catalyst in the movement towards full unity . We are all however aware_that the attainment of this goal cannot be the fruit of human efforts alone , vital though_they are . Unity , after all , -isaia-_a_gift of the Holy Spirit . We are asked to respond to this_gift responsibly , without compromise in our witness to the truth , generously implementing the guidelines laid_down by the Council and in subsequent documents of the Holy See , which_are also highly regarded by many Christians not in full_communion with the Catholic Church . This then -isaia- one of the tasks of Christians as we make our way to the Year . The approaching end of the second millennium demands of everyone an examination of conscience and the promotion of fitting ecumenical initiatives , so that_we_can celebrate the Great Jubilee , if not completely united , -atti_degli_apostoli- least much closer to overcoming the divisions of the second millennium . As everyone recognizes , an enormous effort -isaia- needed in this_regard . It -isaia- essential not_only to continue along the path of dialogue on doctrinal matters , but_above all to be more committed to prayer_for Christian unity . Such prayer has become much_more intense after_the Council , but it must increase still_more , involving an ever_greater number of Christians , in unison with the great petition of Christ before his Passion : '' Father . that_they also may all be one in us '' Jn : . Another painful chapter of history to which_the sons_and_daughters of the Church must return with a spirit of repentance -isaia- that of the acquiescence given , especially in certain centuries , to intolerance and even the use of violence in the service of truth . It -isaia- true_that an accurate historical judgment cannot prescind from careful study of the cultural conditioning of the times , as a result of which many_people may_have held in good faith_that an authentic witness to the truth could include suppressing the opinions of others or -atti_degli_apostoli- least paying no attention to them . Many factors frequently converged to create assumptions which justified intolerance and fostered an emotional climate from which only great spirits , truly free and filled_with God , were in some_way able to break free . Yet the consideration of mitigating factors does_not exonerate the Church from the obligation to express profound regret for the weaknesses of so many of her sons_and_daughters who sullied her face , preventing her from fully mirroring the image of her crucified Lord , the supreme witness of patient love and of humble meekness . From these painful moments of the past a lesson can be drawn for the future , leading all Christians to adhere fully to the sublime principle stated by the Council : '' The truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its_own truth , as it wins over the mind with both gentleness and power '' . Many Cardinals and Bishops expressed the desire_for a serious examination of conscience above all on the part of the Church of today . On the threshold of the new Millennium Christians need to place themselves humbly before the Lord and examine themselves on the responsibility which_they too have for the evils of our_day . The present age in fact , together_with much light , also presents not_a_few shadows . How can we remain silent , for example , about the religious indifference which causes many_people today to live as if God did not_exist , or to be content with a vague religiosity , incapable of coming to grips with the question of truth and the requirement of consistency ? To this must_also be added the widespread loss of the transcendent sense of human_life , and confusion in the ethical sphere , even about the fundamental values of respect_for life and the family . The sons_and_daughters of the Church too need to examine themselves in this_regard . To what extent have they been shaped by the climate of secularism and ethical relativism ? And what responsibility do they bear , in view of the increasing lack of religion , for not having shown the true face of God , by having '' failed in their religious , moral , or social_life '' ? It cannot be denied that , for_many Christians , the spiritual_life -isaia- passing through a time of uncertainty which affects not_only their moral_life but_also their_life of prayer and the theological correctness of their_faith . Faith , already put to the test by the challenges of our_times , -isaia- sometimes disoriented by erroneous theological views , the spread of which_-isaia- abetted by the crisis of obedience vis \u00e0 vis the Church s Magisterium . And with_respect to the Church of our_time , how_can we not lament the lack of discernment , which -atti_degli_apostoli- times became even acquiescence , shown by many Christians concerning the violation of fundamental human_rights by totalitarian regimes ? And should we not also regret , among the shadows of our_own day , the responsibility shared by so many Christians for grave forms of injustice and exclusion ? It must be asked how_many Christians really know and put into_practice the principles of the Church s social_doctrine . An examination of conscience must_also consider_the reception given to the Council , this_great gift of the Spirit to the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium . To what extent has the word of God become more_fully the soul of theology and the inspiration of the whole of Christian living , as Dei Verbum sought ? Is the liturgy lived as the '' origin and summit '' of ecclesial life , in accordance_with_the teaching of Sacrosanctum Concilium ? In the universal Church and in the particular Churches , -isaia- the ecclesiology of communion described in Lumen Gentium being strengthened ? Does it leave room_for charisms , ministries , and different_forms of participation by the People of God , without adopting notions borrowed from democracy and sociology which do not reflect the Catholic vision of the Church and the authentic spirit of Vatican II ? Another serious question -isaia- raised by the nature of relations_between the Church and the world . The Council s guidelines set_forth in Gaudium et Spes and other documents of open , respectful and cordial dialogue , yet accompanied by careful discernment and courageous witness to the truth , remain valid and call us to a greater commitment . The Church of the first millennium was_born of the blood of the martyrs : '' Sanguis martyrum semen christianorum '' . The historical events linked to the figure of Constantine the Great could never have ensured the development of the Church as it occurred during the first millennium if it had not_been for the seeds sown by the martyrs and the heritage of sanctity which marked the first Christian generations . At the end of the second millennium , the Church has once_again become a Church of martyrs . The persecutions of believers priests , Religious and laity has caused a great sowing of martyrdom in different parts_of_the_world . The witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a common inheritance of Catholics , Orthodox , Anglicans and Protestants , as Pope Paul VI pointed_out in his Homily for the Canonization of the Ugandan Martyrs . This witness must_not be forgotten . The Church of the first centuries , although facing considerable organizational difficulties , took care to write down in special martyrologies the witness of the martyrs . These martyrologies have_been constantly updated through the centuries , and the register of the saints and the blessed bears the names not_only of those_who_have shed their blood for Christ but_also of teachers of the faith , missionaries , confessors , bishops_,_priests , virgins , married_couples , widows and children . In our_own century the martyrs have returned , many of them nameless , '' unknown soldiers '' as it were of God s great cause . As far_as_possible , their witness should_not be lost to the Church . As was recommended in the Consistory , the local Churches should do everything possible to ensure_that the memory of those_who_have suffered martyrdom should be safeguarded , gathering the necessary documentation . This gesture cannot_fail to have an ecumenical character and expression . Perhaps the most convincing form of ecumenism -isaia- the ecumenism of the saints and of the martyrs . The communio sanctorum speaks louder than the things_which divide us . The martyrologium of the first centuries was_the basis of the veneration of the Saints . By proclaiming and venerating the holiness of her sons_and_daughters , the Church gave supreme honour to God himself ; in the martyrs she venerated Christ , who_was -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of their martyrdom and of their holiness . In later times there developed the practice of canonization , a practice which still continues in the Catholic Church and in the Orthodox Churches . In recent_years the number of canonizations and beatifications has increased . These show the vitality of the local Churches , which_are much_more numerous today than in the first centuries and in the first millennium . The greatest homage which all the Churches can_give to Christ on the threshold of the third_millennium will be to manifest the Redeemer s all powerful presence through the fruits of faith , hope and charity present in men_and_women of many_different tongues and races who_have followed Christ in the various_forms of the Christian vocation . It will be the task of the Apostolic See , in preparation_for the Year , to update the martyrologies for the universal Church , paying careful attention to the holiness of those_who in our own_time lived fully by the truth of Christ . In particular , there_-isaia-_a_need to foster the recognition of the heroic virtues of men_and_women_who have lived their Christian vocation in marriage . Precisely because we are convinced of the abundant fruits of holiness in the married state , we need to find the most appropriate means_for discerning them and proposing them to the whole Church as a model and encouragement for other Christian spouses . A further need emphasized by the Cardinals and Bishops -isaia- that of Continental Synods , following_the_example of those already held for Europe and Africa . The last General Conference of the Latin American Episcopate accepted , in agreement with the Bishops of North America , the proposal for a Synod for the Americas on the problems of the new_evangelization in both parts of the same continent , so different in origin and history , and on issues of justice and of international economic relations , in view of the enormous gap between North and South . Another plan_for a continent wide Synod will concern Asia , where_the issue of the encounter of Christianity with ancient local cultures and religions -isaia- a pressing one . This -isaia- a great challenge for evangelization , since religious systems such as Buddhism or Hinduism have a clearly soteriological character . There -isaia-_also an urgent_need for a Synod on the occasion of the Great Jubilee in order to illustrate and explain more_fully the truth_that Christ -isaia-_the_one Mediator between God and man and the sole Redeemer of the world , to be clearly distinguished from the founders of other great religions . With sincere esteem , the Church regards the elements of truth found in those religions as a reflection of the Truth which enlightens all men_and_women . '' Ecce natus -ester- nobis Salvator mundi '' : in the Year the proclamation of this_truth should resound with renewed power . Also for Oceania a Regional Synod could be useful . In this region there arises the question , among others , of the Aboriginal People , who in a unique way evoke aspects of human prehistory . In this Synod a matter not to be overlooked , together_with other problems of the region , would be the encounter of Christianity with the most ancient forms of religion , profoundly marked by a monotheistic orientation . On the basis of this vast programme aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- creating awareness , it will then be possible to begin the second phase , the strictly preparatory phase . This will take_place over the span of three years , from to . The thematic structure of this three year period , centred on Christ , the Son of God made man , must necessarily be theological , and therefore Trinitarian . Year One : Jesus Christ . The first year , , will thus be devoted to reflection on Christ , the Word of God , made man by the power of the Holy Spirit . The distinctly Christological character of the Jubilee needs to be emphasized , for it will celebrate the Incarnation and coming into_the_world of the Son of God , the mystery of salvation for all mankind . The general theme proposed by many Cardinals and Bishops for this_year -isaia- : '' Jesus Christ , the one Saviour of the world , yesterday , today and for ever '' cf . Among the Christological themes suggested in the Consistory the following stand out : a renewed appreciation of Christ , Saviour and Proclaimer of the Gospel , with_special reference to the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Luke , where_the theme of Christ s mission of preaching the Good News and the theme of the Jubilee are interwoven ; a deeper_understanding of the mystery of the Incarnation and of Jesus birth from the Virgin Mary ; the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation . In order to recognize who Christ truly -isaia- , Christians , especially in the course of this_year , should turn with renewed interest to the Bible , '' whether it be through the liturgy , rich in the divine_word , or through devotional reading , or through instructions suitable for the purpose and other aids '' . In the revealed text it -isaia- the Heavenly Father himself who comes to us in love and who dwells with us , disclosing to us the nature of his only_begotten Son and his plan of salvation for_humanity . The commitment , mentioned earlier , to make_the mystery of salvation sacramentally present can lead , in the course of the year , to a renewed appreciation of Baptism as the basis of Christian living , according to the words of the Apostle : '' As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ '' Gal : . The Catechism of the Catholic Church , for its part , recalls that Baptism constitutes '' the foundation of communion among all Christians , including those_who_are not_yet in full_communion with the Catholic Church '' . From an ecumenical point_of_view , this_will certainly be a very_important year for Christians to look together to Christ the one Lord , deepening our commitment to become one in him , in accordance_with his prayer to the Father . This emphasis on the centrality of Christ , of the word of God and of faith ought to inspire interest among Christians of other denominations and meet with a favourable response from them . Everything ought to focus on the primary objective of the Jubilee : the strengthening of faith and of the witness of Christians . It -isaia- therefore necessary to inspire in all the faithful a true longing for holiness , a deep desire_for conversion and personal renewal in a context of ever_more intense prayer and of solidarity with one s neighbour , especially_the most needy . The first year therefore will be the opportune moment for a renewed appreciation of catechesis in its original meaning as '' the Apostles teaching '' Acts : about the person of Jesus Christ and his mystery of salvation . In this_regard , a detailed study of the Catechism of the Catholic Church will prove of great benefit , for the Catechism presents '' faithfully and systematically . the teaching of Sacred Scripture , the living Tradition of the Church and the authentic Magisterium , as well as the spiritual heritage of the Fathers , Doctors and Saints of the Church , to allow for a better knowledge of the Christian mystery and for enlivening the faith of the People of God '' . To be realistic , we need to enlighten the consciences of the faithful concerning errors regarding the person of Christ , clarifying objections against him and against the Church . The Blessed Virgin who_will be as it were '' indirectly '' present in the whole preparatory phase , will be contemplated in this first year especially in the mystery of her Divine Motherhood . It was in her womb that the Word became flesh ! The affirmation of the central place of Christ cannot therefore be separated_from the recognition of the role played by his Most Holy Mother . Veneration of her , when properly understood , can in no way take away from '' the dignity and efficacy of Christ the one Mediator '' . Mary in fact constantly points to her Divine Son and she_-isaia- proposed to all believers as the model of faith which_-isaia- put into_practice . '' Devotedly meditating on her and contemplating her in the light of the Word made man , the Church with reverence enters more intimately into the supreme mystery of the Incarnation and becomes ever increasingly like her Spouse '' . Year Two : the Holy Spirit . , the second year of the preparatory phase , will be dedicated in a particular_way to the Holy Spirit and to his sanctifying presence within_the Community of Christ s disciples . '' The great Jubilee -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the second Millennium . '' , I wrote in the Encyclical Dominum et Vivificantem , '' has a pneumatological aspect , since_the mystery of the Incarnation was accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit . It was ? brought_about by that Spirit consubstantial with the Father and the Son who , in the absolute mystery of the Triune God , -isaia- the Person love , the uncreated gift , who_-isaia- the eternal source of every gift that comes_from God in the order of creation , the direct principle and , in a certain_sense , the subject of God s self communication in the order of grace . The mystery of the Incarnation constitutes the climax of this giving , this_divine self communication '' . The Church cannot prepare for the new millennium '' in any_other way than in the Holy Spirit . What was accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit in the fullness_of_time can_only through the Spirit s power now emerge from the memory of the Church '' . The Spirit , in fact , makes present in the Church of every time_and_place the unique Revelation brought by Christ to humanity , making it alive and active in the soul of each_individual : '' The Counsellor , the Holy Spirit , whom_the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I have_said to you '' Jn : . The primary tasks of the preparation_for the Jubilee thus include a renewed appreciation of the presence and activity of the Spirit , who acts within_the Church both in the Sacraments , especially in Confirmation , and in the variety of charisms , roles and ministries which he inspires for the good of the Church : '' There -isaia- only_one Spirit who , according_to_his own richness and the needs of the ministries , distributes his different gift for the welfare of the Church cf . Among these gifts stands out the grace given to the Apostles . To their authority , the Spirit himself subjected even_those who_were endowed_with charisms cf . Giving the body unity through himself and through_his power and through the internal cohesion of its_members , this_same Spirit produces and urges love among the believers '' . In our_own day too , the Spirit -isaia- the principal agent of the new_evangelization . Hence it will be important to gain a renewed appreciation of the Spirit as the One who builds the Kingdom of God within_the course of history and prepares its_full manifestation in Jesus Christ , stirring people s hearts and quickening in our_world the seeds of the full salvation which_will come -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time . In this eschatological perspective , believers should be called to a renewed appreciation of the theological virtue of hope , which_they_have already heard proclaimed '' in the word of the truth , the Gospel '' Col : . The basic attitude of hope , on the one_hand encourages the Christian not to lose sight of the final goal which_gives meaning and value to life , and on the other , offers solid and profound reasons for a daily commitment to transform reality in order to make it correspond to God s plan . As the Apostle Paul reminds us : '' We know that_the_whole creation has_been groaning in travail together until now ; and not_only the creation , but we ourselves , who have_the first fruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons , the redemption of our bodies . For in this hope we were saved '' Rom : . Christians are_called to prepare for the Great Jubilee of the beginning of the Third Millennium by renewing their hope in the definitive coming of the Kingdom of God , preparing for it daily in their_hearts , in the Christian community to which_they belong , in their particular social context , and in world history itself . There -isaia-_also need_for a better appreciation and understanding of the signs of hope present in the last part of this century , even_though they often remain hidden from our_eyes . In society in general , such signs of hope include : scientific , technological and especially medical progress in the service of human_life , a greater awareness of our responsibility_for the environment , efforts to restore peace and justice wherever they_have_been violated , a desire_for reconciliation and solidarity among different peoples , particularly in the complex relationship_between_the North and the South of the world . In the Church , they include a greater attention to the voice of the Spirit through the acceptance of charisms and the promotion of the laity , a deeper commitment to the cause of Christian unity and the increased interest in dialogue_with other_religions and with contemporary culture . The reflection of the faithful in the second year of preparation ought to focus particularly on the value of unity within_the Church , to which_the various gifts and charisms bestowed upon her by the Spirit are directed . In this_regard , it will be opportune to promote a deeper_understanding of the ecclesiological doctrine of the Second Vatican Council as contained primarily in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium . This important document has expressly emphasized that the unity of the Body of Christ -isaia- founded on the activity of the Spirit , guaranteed by the Apostolic Ministry and sustained by mutual love cf . This catechetical enrichment of the faith cannot_fail to bring_the members of the People of God to a more mature awareness of their_own responsibilities , as well as to a more lively sense of the importance of ecclesial obedience . Mary , who conceived the Incarnate Word by the power of the Holy Spirit and then in the whole of her_life allowed herself to be guided by his interior activity , will be contemplated and imitated during_this year above all as the woman who_was docile to the voice of the Spirit , a woman of silence and attentiveness , a woman of hope who , like Abraham , accepted God s will '' hoping against hope '' cf . Mary gave full expression to the longing of the poor of Yahweh and -isaia- a radiant model for those_who entrust themselves_with all their_hearts to the promises of God . Year Three : God the Father . , the third and final year of preparation , will be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- broadening the horizons of believers , so that_they_will see things in the perspective of Christ : in the perspective of the '' Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' cf . Mt : , from whom_the Lord was sent and to whom he has returned cf . '' This -isaia- eternal_life , that_they know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom_you have sent '' Jn : . The whole of the Christian life_-isaia- like a great pilgrimage to the house of the Father , whose unconditional love for every_human creature , and in particular for the '' prodigal son '' cf . Lk : , we discover anew each_day . This pilgrimage takes_place in the heart of each_person , extends to the believing community and then reaches to the whole of humanity . The Jubilee , centred on the person of Christ , thus becomes a great act of praise to the Father : '' Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who_has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places , even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that_we_should be holy and blameless before him '' Eph : . In this third year the sense of being on a '' journey to the Father '' should encourage everyone to undertake , by holding fast to Christ the Redeemer of man , a journey of authentic conversion . This includes both a '' negative '' aspect , that of liberation from sin , and a '' positive '' aspect , that of choosing good , accepting the ethical values expressed in the natural_law , which_-isaia- confirmed and deepened by the Gospel . This -isaia- the proper context for a renewed appreciation and more intense celebration of the Sacrament of Penance in its most profound meaning . The call to conversion as the indispensable condition of Christian love_-isaia- particularly important in contemporary society , where_the very foundations of an ethically correct vision of human_existence often seem to have_been lost . It will therefore be necessary , especially during_this year , to emphasize the theological virtue of charity , recalling the significant and lapidary words of the First Letter of John : '' God -isaia- love '' : , . Charity , in its twofold reality as love of God and neighbour -isaia- the summing up of the moral_life of the believer . It has in God its source and its goal . From this point_of_view , if we recall that Jesus came to '' preach the good_news to the poor '' Mt : ; Lk : , how_can we fail to lay greater emphasis on the Church s preferential option for the poor and the outcast ? Indeed , it has to be said_that a commitment to justice_and_peace in a world like ours , marked by so many conflicts and intolerable social_and_economic inequalities , -isaia- a necessary condition_for the preparation and celebration of the Jubilee . Thus , in the spirit of the Book of Leviticus : , Christians will_have to raise their voice on behalf of all the poor of the world , proposing the Jubilee as an appropriate time to give thought , among other_things , to reducing substantially , if not cancelling outright , the international debt which seriously threatens the future of many nations . The Jubilee can_also offer an opportunity_for reflecting on other challenges of our_time , such as the difficulties of dialogue_between different_cultures and the problems connected_with respect_for women s rights and the promotion of the family and marriage . Recalling that '' Christ . by the revelation of the mystery of the Father and his_love , fully reveals man to man_himself and makes his supreme calling clear '' , two commitments should characterize in a special_way the third preparatory year : meeting the challenge of secularism and dialogue_with_the great religions . With regard to the former , it will be fitting to broach the vast subject of the crisis of civilization , which_has become apparent especially in the West , which_-isaia- highly developed from the standpoint of technology but_-isaia- interiorly impoverished by its tendency to forget God or to keep him -atti_degli_apostoli- a distance . This crisis of civilization must be countered by the civilization of love , founded on the universal values of peace , solidarity , justice and liberty , which find_their full attainment in Christ . On the other_hand , as far as the field of religious awareness -isaia- concerned , the eve of the Year will provide a great opportunity , especially in view of the events of recent decades , for interreligious dialogue , in accordance_with_the specific guidelines set down by the Second Vatican Council in its Declaration Nostra Aetate on the relationship of the Church to non Christian religions . In this dialogue the Jews and the Muslims ought to have a pre eminent place . God grant that as a confirmation of these intentions it may also be possible to hold joint meetings in places of significance for the great monotheistic religions . In this_regard , attention -isaia- being given to finding ways of arranging historic meetings in places of exceptional symbolic importance like Bethlehem , Jerusalem and Mount Sinai as a means of furthering dialogue_with Jews and the followers of Islam , and to arranging similar meetings elsewhere with the leaders of the great world religions . However , care will_always have be taken not to cause harmful misunderstandings , avoiding the risk of syncretism and of a facile and deceptive irenicism . In this broad perspective of commitments , Mary Most Holy , the highly favoured daughter of the Father , will appear before the eyes of believers as the perfect model of love towards both God and neighbour . As she herself says in the Canticle of the Magnificat , great things were done for_her by the Almighty , whose name -isaia- holy cf . The Father chose her for a unique mission in the history_of_salvation : that of being the Mother of the long awaited Saviour . The Virgin Mary responded to God s call with complete openness : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord '' Lk : . Her motherhood , which began in Nazareth and was lived most intensely in Jerusalem -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , will be felt during_this year as a loving and urgent invitation addressed to all the children of God , so that_they_will return to the house of the Father when_they hear her_maternal voice : '' Do whatever Christ tells you '' cf . c Approaching the Celebration . A separate chapter will be the actual celebration of the Great Jubilee , which_will take_place simultaneously in the Holy Land , in Rome and in the local Churches throughout_the_world . Especially in this phase , the phase of celebration , the aim will be to give glory to the Trinity , from whom everything in the world and in history comes and to whom everything returns . This mystery -isaia- the focus of the three years of immediate preparation : from Christ and through Christ , in the Holy Spirit , to the Father . In this_sense the Jubilee celebration makes present in an anticipatory way the goal and fulfilment of the life of each Christian and of the whole Church in the Triune God . But since Christ -isaia-_the_only way to the Father , in order to highlight his living and saving presence in the Church and the world , the International Eucharistic Congress will take_place in Rome , on the occasion of the Great Jubilee . The Year will be intensely Eucharistic : in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the Saviour , who took flesh in Mary s womb twenty centuries ago , continues to offer himself to humanity as the source of divine_life . The ecumenical and universal character of the Sacred Jubilee can be fittingly reflected by a meeting of all Christians . This would be an event of great significance , and so , in order to avoid misunderstandings , it should be properly presented and carefully prepared , in an attitude of fraternal cooperation_with Christians of other denominations and traditions , as well as of grateful openness to those religions whose representatives might wish to acknowledge_the joy shared by all the disciples of Christ . One thing -isaia- certain : everyone -isaia- asked to do as much as possible to ensure_that the great challenge of the Year -isaia- not overlooked , for_this challenge certainly involves a special grace of the Lord for the Church and for the whole of humanity . V '' JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME . FOR EVER '' Heb : . The Church has endured for years . Like the mustard seed in the Gospel , she_has grown and become a great tree , able to cover the whole of humanity with_her branches cf . The Second Vatican Council , in its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , thus addresses the question of membership in the Church and the call of all people to belong to the People of God : '' All are_called to be part of this Catholic unity of the new People of God . And there belong to it or are related to it in various_ways , the Catholic faithful as well as all who_believe in Christ , and indeed the whole of mankind , which by the grace of God -isaia- called to salvation '' . Pope Paul VI , in the Encyclical Ecclesiam Suam illustrates how all mankind -isaia- involved in the plan of God , and emphasizes the various circles of the dialogue of salvation . Continuing this approach , we can_also appreciate more_clearly the Gospel parable of the leaven cf . Mt : : Christ , like a divine leaven , always and ever more_fully penetrates the life of humanity , spreading the work of salvation accomplished in the Paschal Mystery . What -isaia- more , he embraces within his redemptive power the whole past history of the human_race , beginning with the first Adam . The future also belongs to him : '' Jesus Christ -isaia-_the_same yesterday and today and for ever '' Heb : . For her part the Church '' seeks but a solitary goal : to carry forward the work of Christ himself under the lead of the Holy Spirit , the Paraclete . And Christ entered this_world to give witness to the truth , to rescue and not to sit in judgment , to serve and not to be served '' . Therefore , ever since_the apostolic age , the Church s mission has continued without interruption within_the whole human_family . The first evangelization took_place above all in the region of the Mediterranean . In the course of the first millennium , missions setting out from Rome and Constantinople brought Christianity to the whole continent of Europe . At the same_time they made their_way to the heart of Asia , as far as India and China . The end of the fifteenth century marked both the discovery of America and the beginning of the evangelization of that great continent , North and South . Simultaneously , while the sub Saharan coasts of Africa welcomed the light of Christ , Saint Francis Xavier , Patron of the Missions , reached Japan . At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth , a layman , Andrew Kim , brought Christianity to Korea . In the same period the proclamation of the Gospel reached Indochina , as well as Australia and the Islands of the Pacific . The nineteenth century witnessed vast missionary_activity among the peoples of Africa . All these efforts bore fruit which_has lasted up to the present_day . The Second Vatican Council gives an account of this in the Decree Ad Gentes on Missionary Activity . After the Council the question of missionary work was dealt_with in the Encyclical Redemptoris Missio , in the light of the problems of the missions in these final years of our century . In the future too , the Church must continue to be missionary : indeed missionary outreach -isaia-_part of her very nature . With the fall of the great anti Christian systems in Europe , first of Nazism and then of Communism , there_-isaia- urgent_need to bring once_more the liberating message of the Gospel to the men_and_women of Europe . Furthermore , as the Encyclical Redemptoris Missio affirms , the modern_world reflects the situation of the Areopagus of Athens , where Saint Paul spoke . Today there_are_many '' areopagi '' , and very different ones : these_are the vast sectors of contemporary civilization and culture , of politics and economics . The more the West -isaia- becoming estranged from its Christian roots , the more it -isaia- becoming missionary territory , taking the form of many_different '' areopagi '' . The future of the world and the Church belongs to the younger generation , to those_who , born in this century , will reach maturity in the next , the first century of the new millennium . Christ expects great things from young_people , as he did from the young_man who asked him : '' What good deed must I do , to have eternal_life ? '' Mt : . I have referred to the remarkable answer which Jesus gave to him , in the recent Encyclical Veritatis Splendor , as I did earlier , in , in my Apostolic Letter to the Youth of the World . Young people , in every situation , in every region of the world , do not_cease to put questions to Christ : they meet him and they keep searching for him in order to question him further . If they succeed in following the road which he points_out to them , they_will have_the joy of making their_own contribution to his presence in the next century and in the centuries to come , until the end of time : '' Jesus -isaia-_the_same yesterday , today and for ever '' . In conclusion , it -isaia- helpful to recall_the words of the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes : '' The Church believes that Christ , who died and was raised up for all , can through_his Spirit offer man the light and the strength to measure up to his supreme destiny . Nor has any_other name under heaven been_given to man by which_it_-isaia- fitting for him to be saved . She likewise holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key , the focal point , and the goal of all human_history . The Church also maintains that beneath all changes there_are so many realities which do not change and which have_their ultimate foundation in Christ , who -isaia-_the_same yesterday and today and for ever . Hence in the light of Christ , the image of the unseen God , the firstborn of every_creature , the Council wishes to speak to all men in order to illuminate the mystery of man and to cooperate in finding the solution to the outstanding problems of our_time '' . While I invite the faithful to raise to the Lord fervent prayers to obtain the light and assistance necessary_for the preparation and celebration of the forthcoming Jubilee , I exhort my Venerable Brothers in the Episcopate and the ecclesial_communities entrusted to them to open their_hearts to the promptings of the Spirit . He will not_fail to arouse enthusiasm and lead people to celebrate the Jubilee with renewed faith and generous participation . I entrust this responsibility of the whole Church to the maternal intercession of Mary , Mother of the Redeemer . She , the Mother of Fairest Love , will be for Christians on the way to the Great Jubilee of the Third Millennium the Star which safely guides their steps to the Lord . May the unassuming Young Woman of Nazareth , who two thousand years_ago offered to the world_the Incarnate Word , lead the men_and_women of the new millennium towards_the One who_-isaia- '' the true light that enlightens every man '' Jn : . With these sentiments I impart to all my Blessing .

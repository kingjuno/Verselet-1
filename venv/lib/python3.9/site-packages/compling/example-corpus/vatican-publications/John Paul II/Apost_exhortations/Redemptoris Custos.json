'' Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife '' cf . Inspired by the Gospel , the Fathers of the Church from the earliest centuries stressed that just as St . Joseph took loving care of Mary and gladly dedicated himself to Jesus Christ s upbringing , he likewise watches over and protects Christ s Mystical Body , that_-isaia- , the Church , of which_the Virgin Mary -isaia- the exemplar and model . On the occasion of the centenary of Pope Leo XIII s Encyclical Epistle Quamquam Pluries , and in line with the veneration given to St . Joseph over the centuries , I wish to offer for your consideration , dear_brothers , and sisters , some reflections concerning him '' into whose custody God entrusted his most_precious treasures . '' I gladly fulfill this pastoral duty so that all may grow in devotion to the Patron of the Universal Church and in love for the Savior whom he served in such an exemplary manner . In this_way the whole Christian people not_only will turn to St . Joseph with_greater fervor and invoke his patronage with trust , but_also will_always keep before their_eyes his humble , mature way of serving and of '' taking part '' in the plan of salvation . I -amos- convinced_that by reflection upon the way_that Mary s spouse shared in the divine mystery , the Church on the road towards_the future with all of humanity will be enabled to discover ever anew her_own identity within this redemptive plan , which_-isaia- founded on the mystery of the Incarnation . This -isaia- precisely_the mystery in which Joseph of Nazareth '' shared '' like no other human_being except Mary , the Mother of the Incarnate Word . He shared in it with_her ; he was involved in the same salvific event ; he was_the guardian of the same love , through the power of which_the eternal Father '' destined us to be his sons through Jesus Christ '' Eph : . I THE GOSPEL PORTRAIT Marriage to Mary . '' Joseph , Son of David , do not fear to take Mary your wife , for that_which_-isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit ; she_will bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus , for he will save his_people from their sins '' Mt : . In these_words we find the core of biblical truth_about St . Joseph ; they refer to that moment in his_life to which_the Fathers of the Church make special reference . The Evangelist Matthew explains the significance of this moment while also describing how Joseph lived it . However , in order to understand fully both its content and context , it -isaia- important to keep in mind the parallel passage in the Gospel of Luke . In Matthew we read : '' Now the birth of Jesus Christ took_place in this_way . When his_mother Mary had_been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she_was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit '' Mt : . However , the origin of Mary s pregnancy '' of the Holy Spirit '' -isaia- described more_fully and explicitly in what Luke tells us about the annunciation of Jesus birth : '' The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth , to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin s name was Mary '' Lk : . The angel s greeting : '' Hail , full of grace , the Lord -isaia- with you '' Lk : created an inner turmoil in Mary and also moved her to reflect . Then the messenger reassured the Virgin and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time revealed God s special plan_for her : '' Do not be afraid , Mary , for you_have found favor with God . And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus . He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High ; and the Lord God will_give to him the throne of his_father David '' Lk : . A little earlier the Gospel writer had stated_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Annunciation , Mary was '' betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . '' The nature of this '' marriage '' -isaia- explained indirectly when Mary , after hearing what_the messenger says about the birth of the child , asks , '' How can this be , since I do not_know man ? '' Lk : The angel responds : '' The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you ; therefore the child to be born will be called holy , the Son of God '' Lk : . Although Mary -isaia-_already '' wedded '' to Joseph , she_will remain a virgin , because the child conceived in her -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit . At this_point Luke s text coincides with Matthew : and serves to explain what we read there . If , after her marriage to Joseph , Mary -isaia- found to be with child of the Holy Spirit , '' this_fact corresponds to all that the Annunciation means , in particular to Mary s final words : '' Let it be to me according to your word '' Lk : . In response to what_-isaia- clearly_the plan of God , with the passing of days and weeks Mary s '' pregnancy '' -isaia- visible to the people and to Joseph ; she appears before them as one_who must give birth and carry within herself the mystery of motherhood . In these circumstances , '' her husband Joseph , being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame , resolved to send her away quietly '' Mt : . He did_not know_how to deal_with Mary s '' astonishing '' motherhood . He certainly sought an answer to this unsettling question , but_above all he sought a way out of what_was for him a difficult situation . '' But as he considered this , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , son of David , do not fear to take Mary your wife , for that_which_-isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit ; she_will bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus , for he will save his_people from their sins '' Mt : . There -isaia- a strict parallel between_the '' annunciation '' in Matthew s text and the one in Luke . The divine messenger introduces Joseph to the mystery of Mary s motherhood . While remaining a virgin , she_who by law -isaia-_his '' spouse '' has become a mother through the power of the Holy Spirit . And when_the Son in Mary s womb comes into_the_world , he must receive the name Jesus . This was a name known among the Israelites and sometimes given to their sons . In this case , however , it -isaia- the Son who , in accordance_with_the divine promise , will_bring to perfect fulfillment the meaning of the name Jesus Yehos ua which means '' God saves . '' Joseph -isaia- visited by the messenger as '' Mary s spouse , '' as the one_who in due time must give this name to the Son to be born of the Virgin of Nazareth who_-isaia- married to him . It -isaia- to Joseph , then_,_that the messenger turns , entrusting to him the responsibilities of an earthly father with_regard to Mary s Son . '' When Joseph woke from sleep , he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife '' cf . He took her in all the mystery of her motherhood . He took her together_with_the Son who_had come into_the_world by the power of the Holy Spirit . In this_way he showed a readiness of will like Mary s with_regard to what God asked of him through the angel . II THE GUARDIAN OF THE MYSTERY OF GOD . When , soon after_the Annunciation , Mary went to the house of Zechariah to visit her kinswoman Elizabeth , even as she offered her greeting she heard the words of Elizabeth , who_was '' filled_with_the Holy Spirit '' Lk : . Besides offering a salutation which recalled that of the angel -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , Elizabeth also said : '' And blessed -isaia- she_who believed that there_would be a fulfillment of what_was spoken to her from the Lord '' Lk : . These words were_the guiding thought of the Encyclical Redemptoris Mater , in which I sought to deepen the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , which stated the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith , and faithfully preserved her union with_her Son even to the cross , '' '' preceding '' all those_who follow Christ by faith . Now -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this pilgrimage , the faith of Mary meets the faith of Joseph . If Elizabeth said of the Redeemer s Mother , '' blessed -isaia- she_who believed , '' in a certain_sense this blessedness can be referred to Joseph as well , since he responded positively to the word of God when it was communicated to him -atti_degli_apostoli- the decisive moment . While it -isaia- true_that Joseph did_not respond to the angel s '' announcement '' in the same_way as Mary , he '' did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife . '' What he did -isaia- the clearest '' obedience of faith '' cf . One can say that_what Joseph did united him in an altogether special_way to the faith of Mary . He accepted as truth coming from God the very thing that_she had_already accepted -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation . The Council teaches : '' The obedience of faith must_be_given to God as he reveals himself . By this obedience of faith man freely commits himself entirely to God , making the full submission of his intellect and will to God who reveals , and willingly assenting to the revelation given by him . '' This statement , which touches the very essence of faith , -isaia- perfectly applicable to Joseph of Nazareth . Therefore he became a unique guardian of the mystery '' hidden for ages in God '' Eph : , as did Mary , in that decisive moment which St . Paul calls '' the fullness_of_time , '' when '' God sent forth his Son , born of woman . to redeem those_who were under the law , so that we might receive adoption as sons '' Gal : . In the words of the Council : '' It pleased God , in his goodness and wisdom , to reveal himself and to make known the mystery of his_will cf . His will was that_men should_have access to the Father , through Christ , the Word made_flesh , in the Holy Spirit , and become sharers in the divine nature cf . '' Together with Mary , Joseph -isaia-_the_first guardian of this_divine mystery . Together with Mary , and in relation to Mary , he shares in this final phase of God s self revelation in Christ and he does so from the very_beginning . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the gospel texts of both Matthew and Luke , one can_also say that Joseph -isaia-_the_first to share in the faith of the Mother of God and that in doing so he supports his spouse in the faith of the divine annunciation . He -isaia-_also the first to be placed by God on the path of Mary s '' pilgrimage of faith . '' It -isaia- a path along which especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Calvary and Pentecost Mary will precede in a perfect way . The path that_was Joseph s his pilgrimage of faith ended first , that_-isaia- to say , before Mary stood -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross on Golgotha , and before the time after Christ returned to the Father , when_she was present in the upper_room on Pentecost , the day the Church was manifested to the world , having_been born in the power of the Spirit of truth . Nevertheless , Joseph s way of faith moved in the same direction : it was totally determined by the same mystery , of which he , together_with Mary , had been_the first guardian . The Incarnation and Redemption constitute an organic and indissoluble unity , in which '' the plan of revelation -isaia- realized by words and deeds which_are intrinsically bound up with each_other . '' Precisely because of this_unity , Pope John XXIII , who_had a great devotion to St . Joseph , directed that Joseph s name be inserted in the Roman Canon of the Mass which_-isaia- the perpetual memorial of redemption after_the name of Mary and before the apostles , popes and martyrs . The Service of Fatherhood . As can be deduced from the gospel texts , Joseph s marriage to Mary -isaia- the juridical basis of his fatherhood . It was to assure fatherly protection for Jesus that God chose Joseph to be Mary s spouse . It follows_that Joseph s fatherhood a relationship that places him as close as possible to Christ , to whom every election and predestination -isaia- ordered cf . Rom : comes to pass through marriage to Mary , that_-isaia- , through the family . While clearly affirming that Jesus was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit , and that virginity remained intact in the marriage cf . Mt : ; Lk : , the evangelists refer to Joseph as Mary s husband and to Mary as his wife cf . And while it -isaia- important_for the Church to profess the virginal conception of Jesus , it -isaia- no less important to uphold Mary s marriage to Joseph , because juridically Joseph s fatherhood depends on it . Thus one understands why_the generations are listed according to the genealogy of Joseph : '' Why , '' St . Augustine asks , '' should they not be according to Joseph ? Was he not Mary s husband ? . Scripture states , through the authority of an angel , that he was her husband . Do not fear , says the angel , to take Mary your wife , for that_which_-isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit . Joseph was told to name the child , although not born from his seed . She will bear a son , the angel says , and you will call him Jesus . Scripture recognizes that Jesus -isaia- not born of Joseph s seed , since in his concern about the origin of Mary s pregnancy , Joseph -isaia- told that_it_-isaia- of the Holy Spirit . Nonetheless , he -isaia- not deprived of his fatherly authority from the moment that_he_-isaia- told to name the child . Finally , even the Virgin Mary , well aware_that she_has not conceived Christ as a result of conjugal relations with Joseph , still calls him Christ s father . '' The Son of Mary -isaia-_also Joseph s Son by virtue of the marriage bond that unites them : '' By reason of their faithful marriage both of them deserve to be called Christ s parents , not_only his_mother , but_also his_father , who_was a parent in the same_way that he was_the mother s spouse : in mind , not in the flesh . '' In this marriage none of the requisites of marriage were lacking : '' In Christ s parents all the goods of marriage were realized offspring , fidelity , the sacrament : the offspring being the Lord Jesus himself ; fidelity , since there_was no adultery : the sacrament , since there_was no divorce . '' Analyzing the nature of marriage , both St . Thomas always identify it with an '' indivisible union of souls , '' a '' union of hearts , '' with '' consent . '' These elements are_found in an exemplary manner in the marriage of Mary and Joseph . At the culmination of the history_of_salvation , when God reveals his_love for_humanity through the gift of the Word , it -isaia- precisely_the marriage of Mary and Joseph that brings to realization in full '' freedom '' the '' spousal gift_of_self '' in receiving and expressing such a love . '' In this_great undertaking which_-isaia- the renewal of all things in Christ , marriage it too purified and renewed becomes a new reality , a sacrament of the New Covenant . We see_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the New Testament , as -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Old , there_-isaia- a married couple . But whereas Adam and Eve were_the source of evil which_was unleashed on the world , Joseph and Mary arc the summit from which holiness spreads all over the earth . The Savior began the work of salvation by this virginal and holy union , wherein -isaia- manifested his all powerful will to purify and sanctify the family that sanctuary of love and cradle of life . '' How much the family of today can learn from this ! '' The essence and role of the family are in the final analysis specified by love . Hence the family has the mission to guard , reveal and communicate love , and this_-isaia- a living reflection of and a real sharing in God s love for_humanity and the love of Christ the Lord for the Church his bride . '' This being the case , it -isaia- in the Holy Family , the original '' Church in miniature Ecclesia domestica , '' that_every Christian family must be reflected . '' Through God s mysterious design , it was in that family that the Son of God spent long years of a hidden life . It -isaia- therefore the prototype and example for all Christian families . Joseph was called by God to serve the person and mission of Jesus directly through the exercise of his fatherhood . It -isaia- precisely in this_way that , as the Church s Liturgy teaches , he '' cooperated in the fullness_of_time in the great mystery of salvation '' and -isaia- truly a '' minister of salvation . '' His fatherhood -isaia- expressed concretely '' in his having made his_life a service , a sacrifice to the mystery of the Incarnation and to the redemptive mission connected_with it ; in having used the legal authority which_was his over the Holy Family in order to make a total gift_of_self , of his_life and work ; in having turned his human vocation to domestic love into a superhuman oblation of self , an oblation of his_heart and all his abilities into love placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Messiah growing up in his house . '' In recalling that '' the beginnings of our redemption '' were entrusted '' to the faithful care of Joseph , '' the Liturgy specifies that '' God placed him -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of his family , as a faithful and prudent servant , so that_with fatherly care he might watch over his only_begotten Son . '' Leo XIII emphasized the sublime nature of this_mission : '' He among all stands out in his august dignity , since by divine disposition he was guardian , and according to human opinion , father of God s Son . Whence it followed that the Word of God was subjected to Joseph , he obeyed him and rendered to him_that honor and reverence that children owe to their father . '' Since it -isaia- inconceivable that_such a sublime task would_not be matched by the necessary qualities to adequately fulfill it , we must recognize_that Joseph showed Jesus '' by a special gift from heaven , all the natural love , all the affectionate solicitude that a father s heart can know . '' Besides fatherly authority over Jesus , God also gave Joseph a share in the corresponding love , the love_that has its origin in the Father '' from whom every family in heaven and on earth -isaia- named '' Eph : . The Gospels clearly describe the fatherly responsibility of Joseph toward Jesus . For salvation which_comes through the humanity of Jesus -isaia- realized in actions which_are an everyday part of family_life , in keeping_with that '' condescension '' which_-isaia- inherent in the economy of the Incarnation . The gospel writers carefully show how in the life of Jesus nothing was left to chance , but how everything took_place according to God s predetermined plan . The oft repeated formula , '' This happened , so that_there might be fulfilled . , '' in reference to a particular event in the Old Testament serves to emphasize the unity and continuity of the plan which_-isaia- fulfilled in Christ . With the Incarnation , the '' promises '' and '' figures '' of the Old Testament become '' reality '' : places , persons , events and rites interrelate according to precise divine commands communicated by angels and received by creatures who_are particularly sensitive to the voice of God . Mary -isaia- the Lord s humble servant , prepared from eternity for the task of being the Mother of God . Joseph -isaia-_the_one whom God chose to be the '' overseer of the Lord s birth , '' the one_who has the responsibility to look after_the Son of God s '' ordained '' entry into_the_world , in accordance_with divine dispositions and human laws . All of the so called '' private '' or '' hidden '' life of Jesus -isaia- entrusted to Joseph s guardianship . Journeying to Bethlehem for the census in obedience to the orders of legitimate authority , Joseph fulfilled for the child the significant task of officially inserting the name '' Jesus , son of Joseph of Nazareth '' cf . Jn : in the registry of the Roman Empire . This registration clearly shows_that Jesus belongs to the human_race as a man among_men , a citizen of this_world , subject to laws and civil institutions , but_also '' savior of the world . '' Origen gives a good description of the theological significance , by no means marginal , of this historical fact : '' Since the first census of the whole_world took_place under Caesar Augustus , and among all the others Joseph too went to register together_with Mary his wife , who_was with child , and since Jesus was_born before the census was completed : to the person_who makes a careful examination it will appear that a kind of mystery -isaia- expressed in the fact_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the time_when all people in the world presented themselves to be counted , Christ too should be counted . By being registered with everyone , he could sanctify everyone ; inscribed with the whole_world in the census , he offered to the world communion with himself , and after presenting himself he wrote all the people of the world in the book of the living , so that as many as believed in him could then be written in heaven with the saints of God , to whom be glory and power for ever and ever , Amen . '' The Birth -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem . As guardian of the mystery '' hidden for ages in the mind of God , '' which begins to unfold before his eyes '' in the fullness_of_time , '' Joseph , together_with Mary , -isaia- a privileged witness to the birth of the Son of God into_the_world on Christmas night in Bethlehem . Luke writes : '' And while they_were there , the time came for_her to be delivered . And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths , and laid him in a manger , because there_was no place_for them in the inn '' Lk : . Joseph was an eyewitness to this birth , which took_place in conditions that , humanly speaking , were embarrassing a first announcement of that '' self emptying '' cf . Phil : which Christ freely accepted for the forgiveness of sins . Joseph also witnessed the adoration of the shepherds who arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- Jesus birthplace after_the angel had brought them the great and happy news cf . Later he also witnessed the homage of the magi who came from the East cf . A son s circumcision was_the first religious obligation of a father , and with this ceremony cf . Lk : Joseph exercised his right and duty with_regard to Jesus . The principle which holds that all the rites of the Old Testament are a shadow of the reality cf . Heb : f ; : serves to explain why Jesus would accept them . As with all the other rites , circumcision too -isaia- '' fulfilled '' in Jesus . God s covenant with Abraham , of which circumcision was_the sign cf . Gn : , reaches its_full effect and perfect realization in Jesus , who_-isaia- the '' yes '' of all the ancient promises cf . Conferral of the Name . At the circumcision Joseph names the child '' Jesus . '' This -isaia-_the_only name in which there_-isaia- salvation cf . Its significance had_been revealed to Joseph -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his '' annunciation '' : '' You shall call the child Jesus , for he will save his_people from their sins '' cf . In conferring the name , Joseph declares his_own legal fatherhood over Jesus , and in speaking the name he proclaims_the child s mission as Savior . The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple . This rite , to which Luke refers : ff . , includes the ransom of the first born and sheds light on the subsequent stay of Jesus in the Temple -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of twelve . The ransoming of the first born -isaia- another obligation of the father , and it -isaia- fulfilled by Joseph . Represented in the first born -isaia- the people of the covenant , ransomed from slavery in order to belong to God . Here too , Jesus who_-isaia- the true '' price '' of ransom cf . Cor : ; : ; Pt l : not_only '' fulfills '' the Old Testament rite , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time transcends it , since he -isaia- not a subject to be redeemed , but the very author of redemption . The gospel writer notes that '' his_father and his_mother marveled -atti_degli_apostoli- what_was said about him '' Lk : , in particular -atti_degli_apostoli- what Simeon said in his canticle to God , when he referred to Jesus as the '' salvation which_you have prepared in the presence of all peoples , a light for revelation to the Gentiles , and for glory to your_people Israel '' and as a '' sign that_-isaia- spoken against '' cf . The Flight into Egypt . After the presentation in the Temple the Evangelist Luke notes : '' And when_they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their_own city , Nazareth . And the child grew and became strong , filled_with wisdom ; and the favor of God was upon him '' Lk : . But according to Matthew s text , a very_important event took_place before the return to Galilee , an event in which divine_providence once_again had recourse to Joseph . We read : '' Now when_the magi had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , Rise , take the child and his_mother , and flee to Egypt , and remain there till I tell you ; for Herod -isaia- about to search_for the child , to destroy him '' Mt : . Herod learned from the magi who came from the East about the birth of the '' king of the Jews '' Mt : . And when_the magi departed , he '' sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who_were two years old or under '' Mt : . By killing them all , he wished to kill the new born '' king of the Jews '' whom he had heard about . And so , Joseph , having_been warned in a dream , '' took the child and his_mother by night , and departed to Egypt , and remained there until the death of Herod . This was to fulfill what_the Lord had spoken by the prophet , Out of Egypt have I called my son '' Mt : ; cf . And so Jesus way back to Nazareth from Bethlehem passed through Egypt . Just as Israel had followed the path of the exodus '' from the condition of slavery '' in order to begin the Old Covenant , so Joseph , guardian and cooperator in the providential mystery of God , even in exile watched over the one_who brings about the New Covenant . Jesus Stay in the Temple . From the time of the Annunciation , both Joseph and Mary found themselves , in a certain_sense , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the mystery hidden for ages in the mind of God , a mystery which_had taken on flesh : '' The Word became flesh and dwelt among us '' Jn : . He dwelt among_men , within_the surroundings of the Holy Family of Nazareth one of many families in this small town in Galilee , one of the many families of the land of Israel . There Jesus '' grew and became strong , filled_with wisdom ; and the favor of God was upon him '' Lk : . The Gospels summarize in a few words the long period of the '' hidden '' life , during which Jesus prepared himself for his messianic mission . Only one episode from this '' hidden time '' -isaia- described in the Gospel of Luke : the Passover in Jerusalem when Jesus was twelve years old . Together with Mary and Joseph , Jesus took part in the feast as a young pilgrim . '' And when_the feast was ended , as they_were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not_know it '' Lk : . After a day s journey , they noticed his absence and began to search '' among their kinsfolk and acquaintances . '' '' After three days they found him in the temple , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions ; and all who heard him were amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- his understanding and his answers '' Lk : . Mary asked : '' Son , why have you treated us so ? Behold , your father and I have_been looking for you anxiously '' Lk : . The answer Jesus gave was such that '' they did_not understand_the saying which he spoke to them . '' He had said , '' How -isaia- it that_you sought me ? Did you not know_that I must be in my Father s house ? '' Lk : Joseph , of whom Mary had just used the words '' your father , '' heard this answer . That , after all , -isaia- what all the people said and thought : Jesus was_the son as was supposed or Joseph '' Lk : . Nonetheless , the reply of Jesus in the Temple brought once_again to the mind of his '' presumed father '' what he had heard on that night twelve years earlier : '' Joseph . do not fear to take Mary your wife , for that_which_-isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit . '' From that_time onwards he knew that he was a guardian of the mystery of God , and it was precisely this_mystery that the twelve year old Jesus brought to mind : '' I must be in my Father s house . '' The Support and Education of Jesus of Nazareth . The growth of Jesus '' in wisdom and in stature , and in favor with God and man '' Lk : took_place within_the Holy Family under the eyes of Joseph , who_had the important task of '' raising '' Jesus , that_-isaia- , feeding , clothing and educating him in the Law and in a trade , in keeping_with_the duties of a father . In the Eucharistic Sacrifice , the Church venerates the memory of Mary the ever Virgin Mother of God and the memory of St . Joseph , because '' he fed him whom_the faithful must eat as the bread of eternal_life . '' For his part , Jesus '' was obedient to them '' Lk : , respectfully returning the affection of his '' parents . '' In this_way he wished to sanctify the obligations of the family and of work , which he performed -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of Joseph . III A JUST MAN A HUSBAND . In the course of that pilgrimage of faith_which was his_life , Joseph , like Mary , remained faithful to God s call until the end . While Mary s life was_the bringing to fullness of that fiat first spoken -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of Joseph s own '' annunciation '' he said nothing ; instead he simply '' did as the angel of the Lord commanded him '' Mt : . And this first '' doing '' became the beginning of '' Joseph s way . '' The Gospels do not record any word ever spoken by Joseph along that way . But the silence of Joseph has its_own special eloquence , for thanks to that silence we can understand_the truth of the Gospel s judgment that he was '' a just man '' Mt : . One must come to understand this_truth , for it contains one_of_the_most important testimonies concerning man and his vocation . Through many generations the Church has read this testimony with ever_greater attention and with deeper_understanding , drawing , as it were , '' what_-isaia- new and what_-isaia- old '' Mt : from the storehouse of the noble figure of Joseph . Above all , the '' just '' man of Nazareth possesses the clear characteristics of a husband . Luke refers to Mary as '' a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph '' Lk : . Even before the '' mystery hidden for ages '' Eph : began to be fulfilled , the Gospels set before us the image of husband_and_wife . According to Jewish custom , marriage took_place in two stages : first , the legal , or true marriage was celebrated , and then , only after a certain period of time , the husband brought the wife into_his own house . Thus , before he lived with Mary , Joseph was already her '' husband . '' Mary , however , preserved her deep desire to give herself exclusively to God . One may well ask how this desire of Mary s could be reconciled with a '' wedding . '' The answer can_only come from the saving events as they unfold , from the special action of God himself . From the moment of the Annunciation , Mary knew that_she was to fulfill her virginal desire to give herself exclusively and fully to God precisely by becoming the Mother of God s Son . Becoming a Mother by the power of the Holy Spirit was_the form taken by her gift_of_self : a form which God himself expected of the Virgin Mary , who_was '' betrothed '' to Joseph . Mary uttered her fiat . The fact_that Mary was '' betrothed '' to Joseph was part of the very plan of God . This -isaia- pointed_out by Luke and especially by Matthew . The words spoken to Joseph are_very significant : '' Do not fear to take Mary your wife , for that which_has_been conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit '' Mt : . These words explain the mystery of Joseph s wife : In her motherhood Mary -isaia- a virgin . In her , '' the Son of the Most High '' assumed a human body and became '' the Son of Man . '' Addressing Joseph through the words of the angel , God speaks to him as the husband of the Virgin of Nazareth . What took_place in her through the power of the Holy Spirit also confirmed in a special_way the marriage bond which already existed between Joseph and Mary . God s messenger was clear in what he said to Joseph : '' Do not fear to take Mary your wife into your home . '' Hence , what had taken_place earlier , namely , Joseph s marriage to Mary , happened in accord with God s will and was meant to endure . In her_divine motherhood Mary had to continue to live as '' a virgin , the wife of her husband '' cf . In the words of the '' annunciation '' by night , Joseph not_only heard the divine truth concerning his wife s indescribable vocation ; he also heard once_again the truth_about his_own vocation . This '' just '' man_,_who , in the spirit of the noblest traditions of the Chosen People , loved the Virgin of Nazareth and was bound to her by a husband s love , was once_again called by God to this_love . '' Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him ; he took his wife '' into_his home Mt : ; what_was conceived in Mary was '' of the Holy Spirit . '' From expressions such as these_are we not to suppose that his_love as a man was_also given new birth by the Holy Spirit ? Are we not to think_that the love of God which_has_been poured forth into the human_heart through the Holy Spirit cf . Rm : molds every_human love to perfection ? This love of God also molds in a completely unique way the love of husband_and_wife , deepening within it everything of human worth and beauty , everything_that bespeaks an exclusive gift_of_self , a covenant between persons , and an authentic communion according to the model of the Blessed Trinity . took his wife ; but he knew her not , until she had borne a son '' Mt : . These words indicate another kind of closeness in marriage . The deep spiritual closeness arising from marital union and the interpersonal contact between man_and_woman have_their definitive origin in the Spirit , the Giver of Life cf . Joseph , in obedience to the Spirit , found in the Spirit the source of love , the conjugal love_which he experienced as a man . And this_love proved to be greater_than this '' just man '' could ever have expected within_the limits of his human_heart . In the Liturgy , Mary -isaia- celebrated as '' united to Joseph , the just man , by a bond of marital and virginal love . '' There are really two kinds of love here , both of which together represent the mystery of the Church virgin and spouse as symbolized in the marriage of Mary and Joseph . '' Virginity or celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of God not_only does_not contradict the dignity of marriage but presupposes and confirms it . Marriage and virginity are two ways of expressing and living the one mystery of the Covenant of God with his_people . '' the Covenant which_-isaia- a communion of love between God and human_beings . Through his complete self sacrifice , Joseph expressed his generous love for the Mother of God , and gave her a husband s '' gift_of_self . '' Even though he decided to draw back so as not to interfere in the plan of God which_was coming to pass in Mary , Joseph obeyed the explicit command of the angel and look Mary into_his home , while respecting the fact_that she belonged exclusively to God . On the other_hand , it was from his marriage to Mary that Joseph derived his singular dignity and his rights in regard to Jesus . '' It -isaia- certain_that the dignity of the Mother of God -isaia- so exalted that_nothing could be more sublime ; yet because Mary was united to Joseph by the bond of marriage , there_can be no doubt but_that Joseph approached as no other person ever could that eminent dignity whereby_the Mother of God towers above all creatures . Since marriage -isaia- the highest degree of association and friendship involving by its_very nature a communion of goods , it follows_that God , by giving Joseph to the Virgin , did_not give him to her only as a companion for life , a witness of her virginity and protector of her honor : he also gave Joseph to Mary in order that_he_might share , through the marriage pact , in her_own sublime greatness . This bond of charity was_the core of the Holy Family s life , first in the poverty of Bethlehem , then in their exile in Egypt , and later in the house of Nazareth . The Church deeply venerates this Family , and proposes it as the model of all families . Inserted directly in the mystery of the Incarnation , the Family of Nazareth has its_own special mystery . And in this_mystery , as in the Incarnation , one finds a true fatherhood : the human form of the family of the Son of God , a true human_family , formed by the divine mystery . In this family , Joseph -isaia- the father : his fatherhood -isaia- not one_that derives from begetting offspring ; but neither -isaia- it an '' apparent '' or merely '' substitute '' fatherhood . Rather , it -isaia- one_that fully shares in authentic human fatherhood and the mission of a father in the family . This -isaia- a consequence of the hypostatic union : humanity taken up into the unity of the Divine Person of the Word Son , Jesus Christ . Together with human_nature , all that_-isaia- human , and especially_the family as the first dimension of man s existence in the world_-isaia- also taken up in Christ . Within this_context , Joseph s human fatherhood was_also '' taken up '' in the mystery of Christ s Incarnation . On the basis of this principle , the words_which Mary spoke to the twelve year old Jesus in the Temple take on their full significance : '' Your father and I . have_been looking for you . '' This -isaia- no conventional phrase : Mary s words to Jesus show the complete reality of the Incarnation present in the mystery of the Family of Nazareth . From the beginning , Joseph accepted with the '' obedience of faith '' his human fatherhood over Jesus . And thus , following the light of the Holy Spirit who_gives himself to human_beings through_faith , he certainly came to discover ever more_fully the indescribable gift that_was his human fatherhood . IV WORK AS AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE . Work was_the daily expression of love in the life of the Family of Nazareth . The Gospel specifies the kind of work Joseph did in order to support his family : he was a carpenter . This simple word sums up Joseph s entire life . For Jesus , these were hidden years , the years to which Luke refers after recounting the episode that occurred in the Temple : '' And he went down with_them and came to Nazareth , and was obedient to them '' Lk : . This '' submission '' or obedience of Jesus in the house of Nazareth should be understood as a sharing in the work of Joseph . Having learned the work of his presumed father , he was known as '' the carpenter s son . '' If the Family of Nazareth -isaia- an example and model for_human families , in the order of salvation and holiness , so too , by analogy , -isaia- Jesus work -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of Joseph the carpenter . In our_own day , the Church has emphasized this by instituting the liturgical memorial of St . Joseph the Worker on May . Human work , and especially manual labor , receive special prominence in the Gospel . Along with the humanity of the Son of God , work too has_been taken up in the mystery of the Incarnation , and has_also been redeemed in a special_way . At the workbench where he plied his trade together_with Jesus , Joseph brought human_work closer to the mystery of the Redemption . In the human growth of Jesus '' in wisdom , age and grace , '' the virtue of industriousness played a notable role , since '' work_-isaia- a human good '' which '' transforms nature '' and makes man '' in a sense , more_human . '' The importance of work in human_life demands_that its meaning be known and assimilated in order to '' help all people to come closer to God , the Creator and Redeemer , to participate in his salvific plan_for man and the world , and to deepen . friendship with Christ in their_lives , by accepting , through_faith , a living participation in his threefold mission as Priest , Prophet and King . What -isaia- crucially important here -isaia- the sanctification of daily_life , a sanctification which each_person must acquire according_to_his or her_own state , and one_which can be promoted according to a model accessible to all people : '' St . Joseph -isaia- the model of those humble ones that Christianity raises up to great destinies ; . he -isaia- the proof that in order to be a good and genuine follower of Christ , there_-isaia- no need of great things it -isaia- enough to have_the common , simple and human virtues , but they_need to be true and authentic . '' V THE PRIMACY OF THE INTERIOR LIFE . The same aura of silence that envelops everything else about Joseph also shrouds his_work as a carpenter in the house of Nazareth . It -isaia- , however , a silence that reveals in a special_way the inner portrait of the man . The Gospels speak exclusively of what Joseph '' did . '' Still , they allow us to discover in his '' actions '' shrouded in silence as they_are an aura of deep contemplation . Joseph was in daily contact_with_the mystery '' hidden from ages past , '' and which '' dwelt '' under his roof . This explains , for example , why St . Teresa of Jesus , the great reformer of the Carmelites , promoted the renewal of veneration to St . Joseph in Western Christianity . The total sacrifice , whereby Joseph surrendered his whole existence to the demands of the Messiah s coming into_his home , becomes understandable only in the light of his profound interior life . It was from this interior life_that '' very singular commands and consolations came , bringing him also the logic and strength that belong to simple and clear souls , and giving him the power of making great decisions such as the decision to put his liberty immediately -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposition of the divine designs , to make over to them also his legitimate human calling , his conjugal happiness , to accept the conditions , the responsibility and the burden of a family , but , through an incomparable virginal love , to renounce that natural conjugal love that_-isaia- the foundation and nourishment of the family . This submission to God , this readiness of will to dedicate oneself to all that serves him , -isaia- really nothing less_than that exercise of devotion which constitutes one expression of the virtue of religion . The communion of life between Joseph and Jesus leads us to consider once_again the mystery of the Incarnation , precisely in reference to the humanity of Jesus as the efficacious instrument of his divinity for the purpose of sanctifying man : '' By virtue of his divinity , Christ s human actions were salvific for us , causing grace within us , either by merit or by a certain efficacy . '' Among those actions , the gospel writers highlight those_which have to do with the Paschal Mystery , but they_also underscore the importance of physical contact_with Jesus for healing cf . for example , Mk : , and the influence Jesus exercised upon John the Baptist when they_were both in their mothers wombs cf . As we have_seen , the apostolic witness did_not neglect the story of Jesus birth , his circumcision , his presentation in the Temple , his flight into Egypt and his hidden life in Nazareth . It recognized the '' mystery '' of grace present in each of these saving '' acts , '' inasmuch as they all share the same source of love : the divinity of Christ . If through Christ s humanity this_love shone on all mankind , the first beneficiaries were undoubtedly those_whom the divine will had most intimately associated_with itself : Mary , the Mother of Jesus , and Joseph , his presumed father . Why should the '' fatherly '' love of Joseph not have_had an influence upon the '' filial '' love of Jesus ? And vice versa why should the '' filial '' love of Jesus not have_had an influence upon the '' fatherly '' love of Joseph , thus leading to a further deepening of their unique relationship ? Those souls most sensitive to the impulses of divine_love have rightly seen in Joseph a brilliant example of the interior life . Furthermore , in Joseph , the apparent tension between_the active and the contemplative life finds an ideal harmony that_-isaia- only possible_for those_who possess the perfection of charity . Augustine s well_known distinction between_the love of the truth caritas veritatis and the practical demands of love necessitas caritatis , we can say that Joseph experienced both love of the truth_that pure contemplative love of the divine Truth which radiated from the humanity of Christ and the demands of love_that equally pure and selfless love required_for his vocation to safeguard and develop the humanity of Jesus , which_was inseparably linked to his divinity . VI PATRON OF THE CHURCH IN OUR DAY . At a difficult time in the Church s history , Pope Pius IX , wishing to place her under the powerful patronage of the holy patriarch Joseph , declared him '' Patron of the Catholic Church . '' For Pius IX this_was no idle gesture , since by virtue of the sublime dignity which God has granted to his_most faithful servant Joseph , '' the Church , after_the Blessed Virgin , his spouse , has_always held him in great honor and showered him_with praise , having recourse to him amid tribulations . '' What are the reasons for such_great confidence ? Leo XIII explained it in this_way : '' The reasons why St . Joseph must be considered the special patron of the Church , and the Church in turn draws exceeding hope from his care and patronage , chiefly arise from his having_been the husband of Mary and the presumed father of Jesus . , Joseph was in his day the lawful and natural guardian , head and defender of the Holy Family . It -isaia- thus fitting and most worthy of Joseph s dignity that , in the same_way that he once kept unceasing holy watch over the family of Nazareth , so now does he protect and defend with_his heavenly patronage the Church of Christ . This patronage must be invoked as ever necessary_for the Church , not_only as a defense against all dangers , but_also , and indeed primarily , as an impetus for_her renewed commitment to evangelization in the world and to re evangelization in those lands and nations where as I wrote in the Apostolic Exhortation Christideles Laici '' religion and the Christian life were formerly flourishing and . are_now put to a hard test . '' In order to bring_the first proclamation of Christ , or to bring it anew wherever it has_been neglected or forgotten , the Church has need of special '' power from on high '' cf . Lk : ; Acts : : a gift of the Spirit of the Lord , a gift which_-isaia-_not unrelated to the intercession and example of his saints . Besides trusting in Joseph s sure protection , the Church also trusts in his noble example , which transcends all individual states of life and serves as a model for the entire Christian community , whatever the condition and duties of each of its_members may be . As the Constitution on Divine Revelation of the Second Vatican Council has said , the basic attitude of the entire Church must be that of '' hearing the word of God with reverence , '' an absolute readiness to serve faithfully God s salvific will revealed in Jesus . Already -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of human redemption , after Mary , we find the model of obedience made incarnate in St . Joseph , the man known for having faithfully carried_out God s commands . Pope Paul VI invited us to invoke Joseph s patronage '' as the Church has_been wont to do in these recent_times , for herself in the first_place , with a spontaneous theological reflection on the marriage of divine and human action in the great economy of the Redemption , in which economy the first the divine one_-isaia- wholly sufficient unto itself , while the second the human action which_-isaia- ours though capable of nothing cf . Jn : , -isaia- never dispensed from a humble but conditional and ennobling collaboration . The Church also calls upon Joseph as her protector because of a profound and ever present desire to reinvigorate her ancient life with true evangelical virtues , such as shine_forth in St . The Church transforms these needs into prayer . Recalling that God wished to entrust the beginnings of our redemption to the faithful care of St . Joseph , she asks God to grant that_she may faithfully cooperate in the work of salvation ; that_she may receive the same faithfulness and purity of heart that inspired Joseph in serving the Incarnate World ; and that_she may walk before God in the ways of holiness and justice , following Joseph s example and through_his intercession . One hundred years_ago , Pope Leo XIII had_already exhorted the Catholic world to pray_for the protection of St . Joseph , Patron of the whole Church . The Encyclical Epistle Quamquam Pluries appealed to Joseph s '' fatherly love . for the child Jesus '' and commended to him , as '' the provident guardian of the divine Family , '' '' the beloved inheritance which Jesus Christ purchased by his_blood . '' Since that_time as I recalled -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this Exhortation the Church has implored the protection of St . Joseph on the basis of '' that sacred bond of charity_which united him to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God , '' and the Church has commended to Joseph all of her cares , including those dangers which threaten the human_family . Even today we have many reasons to pray in a similar way : '' Most beloved father , dispel the evil of falsehood and sin . graciously assist us from heaven in our struggle with the powers of darkness . and just as once you saved the Child Jesus from mortal danger , so now defend God s holy Church from the snares of her enemies and from all adversity . '' Today we still have good_reason to commend everyone to St . It -isaia- my heartfelt wish that_these reflections on the person of St . Joseph will renew in us the prayerful devotion which my Predecessor called_for a century ago . Our prayers and the very person of Joseph have renewed significance for the Church in our_day in light of the Third Christian Millennium . The Second Vatican Council made all of us sensitive once_again to the '' great things_which God has done , '' and to that '' economy of salvation '' of which St . Joseph was a special minister . Commending ourselves , then , to the protection of him to whose custody God '' entrusted his greatest and most_precious treasures , '' let us -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time learn from him how to be servants of the '' economy of salvation . Joseph become for all of us an exceptional teacher in the service of Christ s saving mission , a mission which_-isaia- the responsibility of each_and_every member of the Church : husbands and wives , parents , those_who live by the work of their hands or by any_other kind of work , those called to the contemplative life and those called to the apostolate . This just man_,_who bore within himself_the entire heritage of the Old Covenant , was_also brought into the '' beginning '' of the New and Eternal Covenant in Jesus Christ . May he show us the paths of this saving Covenant as we stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the next millennium , in which_there must be a continuation and further development of the '' fullness_of_time '' that belongs the ineffable mystery of the Incarnation of the Word . Joseph obtain for the Church and for the world , as well as for each of us , the blessing of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , in St . Peter s , on August the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the year , the eleventh of my Pontificate . JOHN PAUL II NOTES . Irenaeus , Adversus haereses , IV , , : S .

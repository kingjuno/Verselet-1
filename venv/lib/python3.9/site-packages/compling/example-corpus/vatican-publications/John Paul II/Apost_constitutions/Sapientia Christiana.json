Under the direction of these values all things_are mutually connected for the glory of God and the integral development of the human_person , a development that includes both corporal and spiritual well_being . Indeed , the Church s mission of spreading the Gospel not_only demands_that the Good News be preached ever_more widely and to ever_greater numbers of men_and_women , but_that the very power of the Gospel should permeate thought patterns , standards of judgment , and norms of behavior ; in a word , it -isaia- necessary_that the whole of human culture be steeped in the Gospel . The cultural atmosphere in which a human_being lives has a great influence upon his or her way of thinking and , thus , of acting . Therefore , a division between_faith and culture -isaia- more_than a small impediment to evangelization , while a culture penetrated with the Christian spirit_-isaia- an instrument that favors the spreading of the Good News . Furthermore , the Gospel -isaia- intended for all peoples of every_age and land and -isaia- not bound exclusively to any particular culture . It -isaia- valid for pervading all cultures so as to illumine them_with_the light of divine_revelation and to purify human conduct , renewing them in Christ . For this_reason , the Church of Christ strives to bring_the Good News to every sector of humanity so as to be able to convert the consciences of human_beings , both individually and collectively , and to fill with the light of the Gospel their works and undertakings , their entire lives , and , indeed , the whole of the social environment in which_they_are engaged . In this_way the Church carries out her_mission of evangelizing also by advancing human culture . II In this activity of the Church with_regard to culture , Catholic universities have_had and still have special importance . By their nature they aim to secure that '' the Christian outlook should acquire a public , stable and universal influence in the whole process of the promotion of higher culture . '' In fact , as my Predecessor Pope Pius XI recalled in the preface to the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus , there arose within_the Church , from her earliest period , didascaleia for imparting instruction in Christian wisdom so that people s lives and conduct might be formed . From these houses of Christian wisdom the most illustrious Fathers and Doctors of the Church , teachers and ecclesiastical writers , drew their knowledge . With the passing of centuries schools were established in the neighborhood of cathedrals and monasteries , thanks especially to the zealous initiatives of bishops and monks . These schools imparted both ecclesiastical doctrine and secular culture , forming them_into one whole . From these schools arose the universities , those glorious institutions of the Middle Ages which , from their beginning , had the Church as their most bountiful mother and patroness . Subsequently , when civil authorities , to promote the common_good , began and developed their_own universities , the Church , loyal to her very nature , did_not desist from founding and favoring such kinds of centers of learning and institutions of instruction . This -isaia- shown by the considerable number of Catholic universities established in recent_times in nearly all parts_of_the_world . Conscious of her worldwide salvific mission , the Church wishes to be especially joined to these centers of higher learning and she desires that_they flourish everywhere and work effectively to make Christ s true message present in the field of human culture and to make it advance in that field . In order_that Catholic universities might better achieve this goal , my Predecessor Pope Pius XII sought to stimulate their united activity when , by his Apostolic Brief of July , , he formally established the International Federation of Catholic Universities . It was '' to include all Athenaea which_the Holy See either has canonically erected or will in the future erect in the world , or will_have explicitly recognized as following the norms of Catholic teaching and as completely in conformity_with that teaching . '' The Second Vatican Council , for this_reason , did not_hesitate to affirm that '' the Church devotes considerable care to schools of higher learning , '' and it strongly recommended that Catholic universities should '' be established in suitable locations throughout_the_world '' and that '' the students of these institutions should be truly outstanding in learning , ready to shoulder duties of major responsibility in society and to witness to the faith before the world . '' As the Church well knows , '' the future of society and of the Church herself -isaia- closely bound up with the development of young_people engaged in higher studies . '' III It -isaia- not surprising , however_,_that among Catholic universities the Church has_always promoted with special_care Ecclesiastical Faculties and Universities , which_-isaia- to say those concerned particularly with Christian revelation and questions connected therewith and which_are therefore more_closely connected_with her_mission of evangelization . In the first_place , the Church has_entrusted to these Faculties the task of preparing with special_care students for the priestly_ministry , for teaching the sacred sciences , and for the more arduous tasks of the apostolate . It -isaia-_also the task of these Faculties '' to explore more profoundly the various areas of the sacred disciplines so that day_by_day a deeper_understanding of sacred revelation will be developed , the heritage of Christian wisdom handed_down by our ancestors will be more plainly brought into view , dialogue will be fostered with_our separated brothers_and_sisters and with non Christians , and solutions will be found for problems raised by doctrinal progress . '' In fact , new sciences and new discoveries pose new problems that involve the sacred disciplines and demand an answer . While carrying_out their primary duty of attaining through theological research a deeper grasp of revealed_truth , those engaged in the sacred sciences should therefore maintain contact_with scholars of other disciplines , whether these_are believers or not , and should try to evaluate and interpret the latters affirmations and judge them in the light of revealed_truth . From this assiduous contact_with reality , theologians are_also encouraged to seek a more suitable way of communicating doctrine to their contemporaries working in other various fields of knowledge , for '' the deposit of faith , or the truths contained in our_venerable doctrine , -isaia- one_thing ; quite another -isaia-_the_way in which these truths are formulated , while preserving the same sense and meaning . '' This will be very useful so that among the People of God religious practice and uprightness of soul may proceed -atti_degli_apostoli- an equal pace with the progress of science and technology , and so that , in pastoral_work , the faithful may be gradually led to a purer and more mature life of faith . The possibility of a connection_with the mission of evangelization also exists in Faculties of other sciences which , although lacking a special link with Christian revelation , can still help considerably in the work of evangelizing . These are looked -atti_degli_apostoli- by the Church precisely under this aspect when_they_are erected as Ecclesiastical Faculties . They therefore have a particular relationship_with the Church s Hierarchy . Thus , the Apostolic See , in carrying_out its mission , -isaia- clearly aware of its right and duty to erect and promote Ecclesiastical Faculties dependent on itself , either with a separate existence or as parts of universities , Faculties destined for the education of both ecclesiastical and lay students . This See -isaia-_very desirous that_the_whole People of God , under_the_guidance of their Shepherds , should cooperate to ensure_that these centers of learning contribute effectively to the growth of the faith and of Christian life . IV Ecclesiastical Faculties which_are ordered to the common_good of the Church and have a valuable relationship_with the whole ecclesial_community ought to be conscious of their importance in the Church and of their participation in the ministry of the Church . Indeed , those Faculties which treat of matters that_are close to Christian revelation should_also be mindful of the orders which Christ , the Supreme Teacher , gave to His Church regarding this ministry : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt . From this it follows_that there_must be in these Faculties that adherence by which_they_are joined to the full doctrine of Christ , whose authentic guardian and interpreter has_always_been through the ages the Magisterium of the Church . Bishops Conferences in the individual nations and regions where these Faculties exist must diligently see to their care and progress , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that_they ceaselessly promote their fidelity to the Church s doctrine , so that_these Faculties may bear_witness before the whole community of the faithful to their wholehearted following of the above mentioned command of Christ . This witness must_always be borne both by the Faculty as such and by each_and_every member of the Faculty . Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties have_been constituted in the Church for the building up and perfecting of Christ s faithful , and they must_always bear this in mind as a criterion in the carrying_out of their_work . Teachers are invested with very weighty responsibility in fulfilling a special ministry of the word of God and in being instructors of the faith for the young . Let them , above all , therefore be for their students , and for the rest of the faithful , witnesses of the living truth of the Gospel and examples of fidelity to the Church . It -isaia- fitting to recall_the serious words of Pope Paul VI : '' The task of the theologian -isaia- carried_out with_a_view to building up ecclesial_communion so that the People of God may grow in the experience of faith . '' V To attain these purposes , Ecclesiastical Faculties should be organized in such_a_way as to respond to the new demands of the present_day . For this_reason , the Second Vatican Council stated_that their laws should be subjected to revision . In fact , the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus , promulgated by my Predecessor Pope Pius XI on May , , did much in its time renew higher ecclesiastical studies . However , as a result of changed circumstances , it now needs to be suitably adapted and altered . In the course of nearly fifty years great changes have taken_place not_only in civil_society but_also in the Church herself . Important events , especially_the Second Vatican Council , have occurred , events which_have affected both the internal life of the Church and her external relationships with Christians of other_churches , with non Christians , and with non believers , as well as with all those in favor of a more_human civilization . In addition , there_-isaia- a steadily growing interest being shown in the theological sciences , not_only among the clergy but_also by lay_people , who_are attending theological schools in increasing numbers . These schools have , as a consequence , greatly multiplied in recent_times . Finally , a new attitude has arisen about the structure of universities and Faculties , both civil and ecclesiastical . This -isaia- a result of the justified desire_for a university life open to greater participation , a desire felt by all those in any_way involved in university life . Nor can one ignore the great evolution that_has taken_place in pedagogical and didactic methods , which call_for new ways of organizing studies . Then too there_-isaia- the closer connection that_-isaia- being felt more_and_more between various sciences and disciplines , as well as the desire_for greater cooperation in the whole university environment . To meet these new demands , the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , responding to the mandate received_from_the Council , already in began to study the question of renewal along the lines indicated by the Council . On May , , it promulgated the Normae quaedam ad Constitutionem Apostolicam '' Deus Scientiarum Dominus '' de studies academicis ecclesiasticis recognoscendam , which_has exercised a beneficial influence during recent_years . VI Now , however , this_work needs to be completed and perfected with a new law . This law , abrogating the Apostolic Constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus and the Norms of Application attached to it , as well as the Normae quaedam published on May , , by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , includes some still valid elements from_these documents , while laying down new norms whereby_the renewal that has_already successfully begun can be developed and completed . Nobody -isaia- unaware of the difficulties that appear to impede the promulgation of a new Apostolic Constitution . In the first_place , there_-isaia- the '' passage of time '' which brings changes so rapidly that it seems impossible to lay_down anything stable and permanent . Then there_-isaia- the '' diversity of places '' which seems to call_for a pluralism which_would make it appear almost impossible to issue common norms , valid for all parts_of_the_world . Since however there exist Ecclesiastical Faculties throughout_the_world , which_are erected and approved by the Holy See and which grant academic_degrees in its name , it -isaia- necessary_that a certain substantial unity be respected and that the requisites for gaining academic_degrees be clearly laid_down and have universal value . Things which_are necessary and which_are foreseen as being relatively stable must be set down by law , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a proper freedom must be left for introducing into the Statutes of the individual Faculties further specifications , taking into_account varying local conditions and the university customs obtaining in each region . In this_way , legitimate progress in academic studies -isaia- neither hindered nor restricted , but_rather -isaia-_directed through right channels towards obtaining better results . Moreover , together_with_the legitimate differentiation of the Faculties , the unity of the Catholic Church in these centers of education will_also be clear to everyone . Therefore , the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , by command of my Predecessor Pope Paul VI , has consulted first of all , the Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties themselves , then , the departments of the Roman Curia and the other bodies interested . After this , it established a commission of experts who , under the direction of the same Congregation , have carefully reviewed the legislation covering ecclesiastical academic studies . This work has now been successfully completed , and Pope Paul VI was about to promulgate this Constitution , as he so ardently desired to do , when he died ; likewise Pope John Paul I was prevented by sudden death from doing so . After long and careful consideration of the matter , I decree and lay_down , by my apostolic authority , the following laws and norms . PART ONE GENERAL NORMS Section I Nature and Purpose of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties Article . To carry_out the ministry of evangelization given to the Church by Christ , the Church has the right and duty to erect and promote Universities and Faculties which depend upon herself . In this Constitution the terms Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties mean those which_have_been canonically erected or approved by the Apostolic See , which foster and teach sacred doctrine and the sciences connected therewith , and which_have the right to confer academic_degrees by the authority of the Holy See . The purpose of Ecclesiastical Faculties are : n . through scientific_research to cultivate and promote their_own disciplines , and especially to deepen knowledge of Christian revelation and of matters connected_with it , to enunciate systematically the truths contained therein , to consider in the light of revelation the most recent progress of the sciences , and to present them to the people of the present_day in a manner adapted to various cultures ; n . to train the students to a level of high qualification in their_own disciplines , according to Catholic doctrine , to prepare them properly to face their tasks , and to promote the continuing permanent education of the ministers of the Church ; n . to collaborate intensely , in accordance_with their_own nature and in close communion with the Hierarchy , with the local and the universal Church the whole work_of_evangelization . It -isaia-_the_duty of Bishops Conferences to follow carefully the life and progress of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties , because_of_their special ecclesial importance . The canonical erection or approval of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties -isaia- reserved to the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , which governs them according to law . Only Universities and Faculties canonically erected or approved by the Holy See and ordered according to the norms of this present Constitution have_the right to confer academic_degrees which_have canonical value , with the exception of the special right of the Pontifical Biblical Commission . The Statutes of each University or Faculty , which_must be drawn up in accordance_with_the present Constitution , require approval by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . Ecclesiastical Faculties erected or approved by the Holy See in non ecclesiastical universities , which confer both canonical and civil academic_degrees , must observe the prescriptions of the present Constitution , account being taken of the conventions signed by the Holy See with various nations or with the universities themselves . Faculties which_have not_been canonically erected or approved by the Holy See may_not confer academic_degrees having canonical value . Academic degrees conferred by such Faculties , if they_are to have value for some canonical effects only , require the recognition of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . For this recognition to be given for individual degrees for a special reason , the conditions laid_down by the Sacred Congregation must be fulfilled . For the correct carrying_out of the present Constitution , the Norms of application issued by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education must be observed . Section II The Academic Community and Its Government Article . Since the University or Faculty forms a sort of community , all the people in it , either as individuals or as members of councils , must feel , each according_to_his or her_own status , co responsible_for the common_good and must strive to work_for the institution s goals . Therefore , their rights_and_duties within_the academic community must be accurately set down in the Statutes , to ensure that_they_are properly exercised within correctly established limits . The Chancellor represents the Holy See to the University or Faculty and equally the University or Faculty to the Holy See . He promotes the continuation and progress of the University or Faculty and he fosters its communion with the local and universal Church . The Chancellor -isaia- the Prelate Ordinary on whom_the University or Faculty legally depends , unless the Holy See established otherwise . Where conditions favor such a post , it -isaia-_also possible to have a Vice Chancellor , whose authority_-isaia- determined in the Statutes . If the Chancellor -isaia- someone other_than the local Ordinary , the statutory norms are to establish how the Ordinary and the Chancellor carry_out their_respective offices in mutual accord . The academic authorities are personal and collegial . Personal authorities are , in the first_place , the Rector or President and the Dean . The collegial authorities are the various directive organisms or councils of the University or Faculty . The Statute of the University Faculty must very carefully set_out the names and offices of the academic authorities , determining the way they_are designated and their term of office , taking into_account both the canonical nature of the individual University or Faculty and the university practice in the local area . Those designed as academic authorities are to be people_who_are truly knowledgeable about university life and , usually , who come from among the teachers of some Faculty . The Rector and the President are named , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least confirmed , by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . The Statutes determine how the personal and the collegial authorities are to collaborate with each_other , so that , carefully observing the principle of collegiality , especially in more_serious matters and above all in those of an academic nature , the persons in authority will enjoy that exercise of power which really corresponds to their office . This applies , in the first_place , to the Rector , who_has the duty to govern_the entire University and to promote , in a suitable way , its unity , cooperation , and progress . When Faculties are parts of an Ecclesiastical University , their governance must be coordinated through the Statutes with the governance of the entire University in such_a_way_that the good of the single Faculties -isaia- assured , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the good of the whole University -isaia- promoted and the cooperation of all the Faculties with each_other -isaia- favored . The canonical exigencies of Ecclesiastical Faculties must be safeguarded even_when such Faculties are inserted into non Ecclesiastical universities . When a Faculty -isaia- joined to a seminary or college , the Statutes , while always having due concern_for cooperation in everything pertaining to the students good , must clearly and effectively provide that the academic direction and administration of the Faculty -isaia- correctly distinct from the governance and administration of the seminary or college . Section III Teachers Article . In each Faculty there_must be a number of teachers , especially permanent ones , which corresponds to the importance and development of the individual disciplines as well as to the proper care and profit of the students . There must be various ranks of teachers , determined in the Statutes , according_to_their measure of preparation , their insertion into the Faculty , their permanence , and their responsibility to the Faculty , taking into_account_the university practice of the local area . The Statutes are to define which authorities are responsible_for hiring , naming , and promoting teachers , especially_when it -isaia-_a_question of giving them a permanent position . To be legitimately hired as a permanent teacher in a Faculty , a person must : be distinguished by wealth of knowledge , witness of life , and a sense_of_responsibility ; have a suitable doctorate or equivalent title or exceptional and singular scientific accomplishment ; show documentary proof of suitability for doing scientific_research , especially by a published dissertation ; demonstrate teaching ability . These requirements for taking on permanent teachers must be applied also , in proportionate measure , for hiring non permanent ones . In hiring teachers , the scientific requirements in current force in the university practice of the local area should be taken into_account . All teachers of every rank must be marked by an upright life , integrity of doctrine , and devotion to duty , so that_they_can effectively contribute to the proper goals of an Ecclesiastical Faculty . Those who teach matters touching on faith_and_morals are to be conscious of their_duty to carry_out_their work in full_communion with the authentic Magisterium of the Church , above all , with_that of the Roman Pontiff . Those who teach disciplines concerning faith or morals must receive , after making their profession_of_faith , a canonical mission from the Chancellor or his delegate , for they_do_not teach on their_own authority but by virtue of the mission they_have received_from_the Church . The other teachers must receive permission to teach from the Chancellor or his delegate . All teachers , before they_are given a permanent post or before they_are promoted to the highest category of teacher , or else in both cases , as the Statutes are to state , must receive a declaration of nihil obstat from the Holy See . Promotion to the higher ranks of teachers -isaia- to take_place only after a suitable interval of time and with due reference to teaching skill , to research accomplished , to the publication of scientific works , to the spirit of cooperation in teaching and in research , and to commitment to the Faculty . The teachers , in order to carry_out_their tasks satisfactorily , must be free_from other employment which_cannot be reconciled with their_duty to do research and to instruct , according to what_the Statutes require for each rank of teacher . The Statutes must state : a when and under which conditions a teaching post ends ; b for_what reasons and in which ways a teacher can be suspended , or even deprived of his post , so as to safeguard suitably the rights of the teachers , of the Faculty or University , and , above all , of the students and also of the ecclesial_community . Section IV Students Article . Ecclesiastical Faculties are open to all , whether ecclesiastics or laity , who_can legally give testimony to leading a moral_life and to having completed the previous studies appropriate to enrolling in the Faculty . To enroll in a Faculty in order to obtain an academic degree , one_must present that kind of study title which_would be necessary to permit enrollment in a civil university of one_s_own country or of the country where_the Faculty -isaia- located . The Faculty , in its_own Statutes , should determine what , besides what_-isaia- contained in n . above , -isaia- needed_for entrance into its course of study , including ancient and modern language requirements . Students must faithfully observe the laws of the Faculty about the general program and about discipline in the first_place about the study program , class attendance , and examinations as well as all that pertains to the life of the Faculty . The Statutes should define how the students , either individually or collectively , take_part in the university community life in those aspects which_can contribute to the common_good of the Faculty or University . The Statutes should equally determine how the students can for serious reasons be suspended from certain rights or be deprived of them or even be expelled from the Faculty , in such_a_way_that the rights of the student , of the Faculty or University , and also of the ecclesial_community are appropriately protected . Section V Officials and Staff Assistants Article . In governing and administering a University or Faculty , the authorities are to be assisted by officials trained for various tasks . The officials are , first of all , the Secretary , the Librarian , and the Financial Procurator . There should_also be other staff assistants who have_the task of vigilance , order , and other duties , according to the needs of the University or Faculty . Section VI Study Program Article . In arranging the studies , the principles and norms which for different matters are contained in ecclesiastical documents , especially_those of the Second Vatican Council , must be carefully observed . At the same_time account must_be_taken of sound advances coming from scientific progress which_can contribute to answering the questions being currently asked . In the single Faculties let that scientific method be used which corresponds to the needs of the individual sciences . Up to date didactic and teaching methods should be applied in an appropriate way , in order to bring_about the personal involvement of the students and their suitable , active participation in their studies . Following the norm of the Second Vatican Council , according to the nature of each Faculty : just freedom should be acknowledged in research and teaching so that true progress can be obtained in learning and understanding divine truth ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- clear_that : a true freedom in teaching_-isaia- necessarily contained within_the limits of God s Word , as this_-isaia- constantly taught by the Church s Magisterium , b likewise , true freedom in research -isaia- necessarily based upon firm adherence to God s Word and deference to the Church s Magisterium , whose duty it -isaia- to interpret authentically the Word of God . Therefore , in such a weighty matter one_must proceed with prudence , with trust , and without suspicion , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with judgment and without rashness , especially in teaching , while working to harmonize studiously the necessities of science with the pastoral needs of the People of God . In each Faculty a curriculum of studies -isaia- to be suitably organized in steps or cycles , adapted to the material . The are usually as follows : a first , a general instruction -isaia- imparted , covering a coordinated presentation of all the disciplines , along_with an introduction into scientific methodology ; b next , one section of the disciplines -isaia- studied more profoundly , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the students practice scientific_research more_fully ; c finally , there_-isaia- progress toward scientific maturity , especially through a written work_which truly makes a contribution to the advance of the science . The disciplines which_are absolutely necessary_for the Faculty to achieve its purposes should be determined . Those also should be set_out which in a different way are helpful to these purposes and , therefore , how these_are suitably distinguished one from another . In each Faculty the disciplines should be arranged in such_a_way_that they form an organic body , so as to serve the solid and coherent formation of the students and to facilitate collaboration by the teachers . Lectures , especially in the basic cycle , must_be_given , and the students must attend them , according to the norms to be determined in the Statutes . Practical exercises and seminars , mainly in the specialization cycle , must be assiduously carried on under the direction of the teachers . These ought to be constantly complemented by private study and frequent discussions with the teachers . The Statutes of the Faculty are to define which examinations or which equivalent tests the students are to take , whether written or oral , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the semester , of the year , and especially of the cycle , so that_their ability can be verified in regard to continuing in the Faculty and in regard to receiving academic_degrees . Likewise the Statutes are to determine what value -isaia- to given for studies taken elsewhere , especially in regard to being dispensed from some disciplines or examinations or even in regard to reducing the curriculum , always , however , respecting the prescriptions of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . Section VII Academic Degrees Article . After each cycle of the curriculum of studies , the suitable academic degree can be conferred , which_must be established for each Faculty , with attention given to the duration of the cycle and to the disciplines taught in it . Therefore , according to the general and special norms of this Constitution , all degrees conferred and the conditions under which_they_are conferred are to be determined in the Statutes of the individual Faculties . The academic_degrees conferred by an Ecclesiastical Faculty are : Baccalaureate , Licentiate , and Doctorate . Special qualifications can be added to the names of these degrees according to the diversity of Faculties and the order of studies in the individual Faculties . Academic degrees can be given different names in the Statutes of the individual Faculties , taking account of the university practice in the local area , indicating , however , with clarity the equivalence these have with the names of the academic_degrees above and maintaining uniformity among the Ecclesiastical Faculties of the same area . Nobody can obtain an academic degree unless properly enrolled in a Faculty , completing the course of studies prescribed by the Statutes , and successfully passing the examinations or tests . Nobody can be admitted to the doctorate unless first having obtained the licentiate . A requisite for obtaining a doctorate , furthermore , -isaia- a doctoral dissertation that makes a real contribution to the progress of science , written under the direction of a teacher , publicly defended and collegially approved ; the principal part , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , must be published . The doctorate -isaia- the academic degree which enables one to teach in a Faculty and which_-isaia- therefore required_for this_purpose , the licentiate -isaia- the academic degree which enables one to teach in a major seminary or equivalent school and which_-isaia- therefore required_for this_purpose . The academic_degrees which_are required_for filling various ecclesiastical posts are to be stated by the competent ecclesiastical authority . An honorary doctorate can be conferred for special scientific merit or cultural accomplishment in promoting the ecclesiastical sciences . Section VIII Matters Relating to Teaching Article . In order to achieve its_proper purposes , especially in regard to scientific_research , each University or Faculty must_have an adequate library , in keeping_with_the needs of the staff and students . It must be correctly organized and equipped with an appropriate catalogue . Through an annual allotment of money , the library must continually acquire books , old_and_new , as well as the principal reviews , so as to be able effectively to serve research , teaching of the disciplines , instructional needs , and the practical exercises and seminars . The library must be headed by a trained librarian , assisted by a suitable council . The librarian participates opportunely in the Council of the University or Faculty . The Faculty must_also have technical equipment , audio visual materials , etc . , to assist its didactic work . In relationship to the special nature and purpose of a University or Faculty , research institutions and scientific laboratories should_also be available , as well as other apparatus needed_for the accomplishment of its ends . Section IX Economic Matters Article . A University or Faculty must_have enough money to achieve its purposes properly . Its financial endowments and its property rights are to be carefully described . The Statutes are to determine the duty of the Financial Procurator as well as the part the Rector or President and the University or Faculty Council play in money matters , according to the norms of good economics and so as to preserve healthy administration . Teachers , officials , and staff assistants are to be paid a suitable remuneration , taking account of the customs of the local area , and also taking_into consideration social security and insurance protection . Likewise , the Statutes are to determinate the general norms that_will indicate the ways the students are to contribute to the expenses of the University or Faculty , by paying admission fees , yearly tuition , examination fees , and diploma fees . Section X Planning and Cooperation of Faculties Article . Great care must_be_given to the distribution , or as it -isaia- called , the planning of Universities and Faculties , so as to provide_for their conservation , their progress , and their suitable distribution in different parts_of_the_world . To accomplish this_end , the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education -isaia- to be helped by advice from the Bishops Conferences and from a commission of experts . The erection or approval of a new University or Faculty -isaia- decided upon by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education when all the requirements are fulfilled . In this_the Congregation listens to the local Ordinaries , the Bishops Conference , and experts , especially from neighboring Faculties . Affiliation of some institution with a Faculty for the purpose of being able to grant the bachelor s degree -isaia- approved by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , after_the conditions established by that_same Sacred Congregation are fulfilled . It -isaia- highly desirable that theological study centers , whether diocesan or religious , be affiliated to a Faculty of Sacred Theology . Aggregation to a Faculty and incorporation into a Faculty by an institution for the purposes of also granting higher academic_degrees -isaia- decided upon by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , after_the conditions established by that_same Sacred Congregation are fulfilled . Cooperation between Faculties , whether of the same University or of the same region or of a wider territorial area , -isaia- to be diligently striven for . For this cooperation -isaia- of great help to the scientific_research of the teachers and to the better formation of the students . It also fosters the advance of interdisciplinary collaboration , which appears ever_more necessary in current times , as well as contributing to the development of complementarity among Faculties . It also helps to bring_about the penetration by Christian wisdom of all culture . PART TWO SPECIAL NORMS Article . Besides the norms common to all Ecclesiastical Faculties , which_are established in the first part of this Constitution , special norms are given here under for certain of those Faculties , because_of_their particular nature and importance for the Church . Section I Faculty of Sacred Theology Article . A Faculty of Sacred Theology has the aim of profoundly studying and systematically explaining , according to the scientific method proper to it , Catholic doctrine , derived with the greatest care from divine_revelation . It has the further aim of carefully seeking the solution to human problems in the light of that_same revelation . The study of Sacred Scripture -isaia- , as it were , the soul of Sacred Theology , which rests upon the written Word of God together_with living Tradition , as its perpetual foundation . The individual theological disciplines are to be taught in such_a_way_that , from their internal structure and from the proper object of each as well as from their connection_with other disciplines , including philosophical ones and the sciences of man , the basic unity of theological instruction -isaia- quite clear , and in such_a_way_that all the disciplines converge in a profound understanding of the mystery of Christ , so that_this can be announced with_greater effectiveness to the People of God and to all nations . Revealed truth must be considered also in connection_with contemporary , evolving , scientific accomplishments , so that it can be seen '' how faith and reason give harmonious witness to the unity of all truth . '' Also , its exposition -isaia- to be such that , without_any change of the truth , there_-isaia- adaptation to the nature and character of every culture , taking special account of the philosophy and the wisdom of various peoples . However , all syncretism and every_kind of false particularism are to be excluded . The positive values in the various cultures and philosophies are to be sought out , carefully examined , and taken up . However , systems and methods incompatible with Christian faith must_not be accepted . Ecumenical questions are to be carefully treated , according to the norms of competent Church authorities . Also to be carefully considered are relationships with non Christian religions ; and problems arising from contemporary atheism are to be scrupulously studied . In studying and teaching the Catholic doctrine , fidelity to the Magisterium of the Church -isaia- always to be emphasized . In the carrying_out of teaching duties , especially in the basic cycle , those_things are , above all , to be imparted which belong to the received patrimony of the Church . Hypothetical or personal opinions which come from new research are to be modestly presented as such . In presenting doctrine , those norms are to be followed which_are in the documents of the Second Vatican Council , as well as those found in more_recent documents of the Holy See insofar as these pertain to academic studies . The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Sacred Theology comprises : a the first cycle , fundamentals , which lasts for five years or ten semesters , or else , when a previous two year philosophy course -isaia- an entrance requirement , for three years . Besides a solid philosophical formation , which_-isaia- a necessary propaedeutic for theological studies , the theological disciplines must be taught in such_a_way_that what_-isaia- presented -isaia- an organic exposition of the whole of Catholic doctrine , together_with an introduction to theological scientific methodology . The cycle ends with the academic degree of Baccalaureate or some other suitable degree as the Statutes of the Faculty determine . b the second cycle , specialization , which lasts for two years or four semesters . In this cycle the special disciplines are taught corresponding to the nature of the diverse specializations being undertaken . Also seminars and practical exercises are conducted for the acquisition of the ability to do scientific_research . The cycle concludes with the academic degree of specialized Licentiate . c the third cycle , in which for a suitable period of time scientific formation_-isaia- brought to completion , especially through the writing of a doctrinal dissertation . The cycle concludes with the academic degree of Doctorate . To enroll in a Faculty of Sacred Theology , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with article of this Constitution . Where the first cycle of the Faculty lasts for only three years , the student must submit proof of having properly completed a two year course in philosophy -atti_degli_apostoli- a Faculty of Philosophy or -atti_degli_apostoli- an approved institution . A Faculty of Sacred Theology has the special duty of taking care of the scientific theological formation of those preparing for the priesthood or preparing to hold some ecclesiastical office . For this_purpose , special courses suitable for seminarians should be offered . It -isaia-_also appropriate for the Faculty itself to offer the '' pastoral year '' required_for the priesthood , in addition to the five year basic cycle . At the end of this_year , a special Diploma may be conferred . Section II Faculty of Canon Law Article . A Faculty of Canon Law , whether Latin or Oriental , has the aim of cultivating and promoting the juridical disciplines in the light of the law of the Gospel and of deeply instructing the students in these , so as to form researchers , teachers , and others_who will be trained to hold special ecclesiastical posts . The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Canon Law comprises : a the first cycle , lasting -atti_degli_apostoli- least one year or two semesters , in which_are studied the general fundamentals of Canon Law and those disciplines which_are required_for higher juridical formation ; b the second cycle , lasting two years or four semesters , during which_the entire Code of Canon Law -isaia- studied in depth , along_with other disciplines having an affinity with it ; c the third cycle , lasting -atti_degli_apostoli- least a year or two semesters , in which juridical formation_-isaia- completed and a doctoral dissertation -isaia- written . With regard to the studies prescribed for the first cycle , the Faculty may make_use of the studies done in another Faculty and which it can acknowledge as responding to its needs . The second cycle concludes with the Licentiate and the third with the Doctorate . The Statutes of the Faculty are to define the special requirements for the conferring of the academic_degrees , observing the Norms of Application of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . To enroll in a Faculty of Canon Law , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with Article of this Constitution . Section III Faculty of Philosophy Article . An Ecclesiastical Faculty of Philosophy has the aim of investigating philosophical problems according to scientific methodology , basing itself on a heritage of perennially valid philosophy . It has to search_for solutions in the light of natural reason and , furthermore , it has to demonstrate their consistency with the Christian view of the world , of man , and of God , placing in a proper light the relationship_between philosophy and theology . Then , the students are to be instructed so as to make_them ready to teach and to fill other suitable intellectual posts as well as to prepare them to promote Christian culture and to undertake a fruitful dialogue_with_the people of our_time . In the teaching of philosophy , the relevant norms should be observed which_are contained in the documents of the Second Vatican Council and in other recent documents of the Holy See concerning academic studies . The curriculum of studies of a Faculty of Philosophy comprises : a the first cycle , basics , in which for two years or four semesters an organic exposition of the various parts of philosophy -isaia- imparted , which includes treating the world , man , and God . It also includes the history of philosophy , together_with an introduction into the method of scientific_research ; b the second cycle , the beginning of specialization , in which for two years or four semesters through special disciplines and seminars a more profound consideration -isaia- imparted in some sector of philosophy ; c the third cycle , in which for a suitable period of time philosophical maturity -isaia- promoted , especially by means of writing a doctoral dissertation . The first cycle ends with the degree of Baccalaureate , the second with the specialized Licentiate , and the third with the Doctorate . To enroll in a Faculty of Philosophy , the student must have_done the previous studies called_for in accordance_with Article of the Constitution . Section IV Other Faculties Article . Besides the Faculties of Sacred Theology , Canon Law , and Philosophy , other Faculties have_been or can be canonically erected , according to the needs of the Church and with_a_view to attaining certain goals , as for instance : a a more profound study of certain sciences which_are of greater importance to the theological , juridical , and philosophical disciplines ; b the promotion of other sciences , first of all the humanities , which_have a close connection_with the theological disciplines or with the work_of_evangelization ; c the cultivation of letters which provide a special help either to a better understanding of Christian revelation or else in carrying on the work of evangelizing ; d finally , the more exacting preparation both of the clergy and laity for properly carrying_out specialized apostolic tasks . In order to achieve the goals set down in the preceding article , the following Faculties or institutions '' ad instar Facultatis '' have already_been erected and authorized to grant degrees by the Holy See itself : Christian archaeology , Biblical studies and ancient Eastern studies , Church history , Christian and classical literature , Liturgy , Missiology , Sacred Music , Psychology , Educational science or Pedagogy , Religious science , Social sciences , Arabic studies and Islamology , Mediaeval studies , Oriental Ecclesiastical studies , '' Utriusque Iuris '' both canon and civil law . It belongs to the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education to set_out , in accordance_with circumstances , special norms for these Faculties , just as has_been done in the above sections for the Faculties of Sacred Theology , Canon Law , and Philosophy . The Faculties and Institutes for_which special norms have_not yet been set_out must_also draw up their_own Statutes . These must conform to the General Norms established in the first part of this Constitution , and they must_take into_account_the special nature and purpose proper to each of these Faculties or Institutes . Transitional Norms Article . This present Constitution comes into_effect on the first day of the academic year or of the academic year , according to the scholastic calendar in use in various places . Each University or Faculty must , before January , , present its_proper Statutes , revised according to this Constitution , to the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . If this_-isaia-_not done , its power to give academic_degrees -isaia- , by this_very fact , suspended . In each Faculty the studies must be arranged so that the students can acquire academic_degrees according to the norms of this Constitution , immediately upon this Constitution coming into_effect , preserving the students previously acquired rights . The Statutes are to be approved experimentally for three years so that , when this period -isaia- completed , they_may be perfected and approved definitively . Those Faculties which_have a juridical connection_with civil authorities may be given a longer period of time to revise their Statutes , providing that_this_-isaia- approved by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education . It -isaia- the task of the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , when , with the passage of time , circumstances shall require it , to propose changes to be introduced into this Constitution , so that_this same Constitution may be continuously adapted to the needs of Ecclesiastical Faculties . All laws and customs presently obtaining which_are in contradiction to this Constitution are abrogated , whether these_are universal or local , even if they_are worthy of special or individual mention . Likewise completely abrogated are all privileges hitherto granted by the Holy See to any person , whether physical or moral , if these_are contrary to the prescriptions of this Constitution . It -isaia- my will , finally , that_this my Constitution be established , be valid , and be efficacious always and everywhere , fully and integrally in all its effects , that it be religiously observed by all to whom it pertains , anything to the contrary notwithstanding . If anyone , knowingly or unknowingly , acts otherwise than I have decreed , I order_that this action -isaia- to be considered null and void .

NORMS OF APPLICATION OF THE SACRED CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION FOR THE CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION SAPIENTIA CHRISTIANA The Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , according to article of the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana , presents to the Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties the following Norms of Application and orders that_they be faithfully observed . PART ONE GENERAL NORMS Section I Nature and Purpose of Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . By the term University or Faculty -isaia- understood also those Athenaea , Institutes , or Academic Centers which_have_been canonically erected or approved by the Holy See with the right to confer academic_degrees by the authority of the same See . With a view to promoting scientific_research , a strong recommendation -isaia- given for specialized research centers , scientific periodicals and collections , and meetings of learned societies . The tasks for_which students can be prepared can be either strictly scientific , such as research or teaching , or else pastoral . Account must_be_taken of this diversity in the ordering of the studies and in the determining of the academic_degrees , while always preserving the scientific nature of the studies for both . Active participation in the ministry of evangelization concerns the action of the Church in pastoral_work , in ecumenism , and in missionary undertakings . It also extends to the understanding , defense , and diffusion of the faith . At the same_time it extends to the whole context of culture and human_society . Bishops Conferences , joined to the Apostolic See in these_matters also , are thus to follow carefully the Universities and Faculties : together_with_the Chancellor they_are to foster their progress and , while of course respecting the autonomy of science according to the mind of the Second Vatican Council , they_are to be solicitous for their scientific and ecclesial condition ; with_regard to common problems which occur within_the boundaries of their_own region , they_are to help , inspire , and harmonize the activity of the Faculties ; bearing in mind the needs of the Church and the cultural progress of their_own area , they_are to take_care that_there exist an adequate number of such Faculties ; to do all this , they_are to constitute among_themselves a commission for this_purpose , which_should be helped by a committee of experts . In preparing the Statutes and Study Program , the norms in Appendix I of these directives must be kept in mind . The canonical value of an academic degree means_that such a degree enables one to assume an office in the Church for_which a degree -isaia- required . This -isaia- , first of all , for teaching sacred sciences in Faculties , major seminaries , or equivalent schools . The condition to be fulfilled for the recognition of individual degrees mentioned in article of the Apostolic Constitution , concern , first of all , besides the consent of the local or regional ecclesiastical authorities , the college of teachers , the study program , and the scientific helps used . Degrees thus recognized , for certain canonical effects only may never be considered simply as equal to canonical degrees . Section II The Academic Community and Its Government Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The duty of the Chancellor -isaia- : to promote continually the progress of the University or Faculty , to advance scientific progress , to ensure_that Catholic doctrine -isaia- integrally followed , and to enforce the faithful implementation of the Statutes and the prescriptions of the Holy See ; to help ensure close relationships between all the different ranks and members of the community ; to propose to the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education the names of those_who_are to be nominated or confirmed as Rector and President , as well as the names of the teachers for_whom a nihil obstat -isaia- to be requested ; to receive the profession_of_faith of the Rector and President ; to give to or take away from the teachers the canonical mission or permission to teach , according to the norms of the Constitution ; to inform the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education about more_important matters and to send to that Congregation every three years a detailed report on the academic , moral , and economic condition of the University or Faculty . If the University or Faculty depends upon a collegial entity for instance , on an Episcopal Conference , one designated member of the group -isaia- to exercise the office of Chancellor . The local Ordinary , if he -isaia- not the Chancellor , since he has the pastoral responsibility_for his Diocese , -isaia- , whenever something in the University or Faculty -isaia- known to be contrary to doctrine , morals , or ecclesiastical discipline , to take the matter to the Chancellor so that the latter may take action . In case the Chancellor does nothing , the Ordinary may have_recourse to the Holy See , without prejudice to his_own obligation to provide personally for action in those cases which_are more_serious or urgent and which carry danger for his Diocese . What -isaia- contained in article of the Constitution must be explained further in the proper Statutes of the individual Faculties , giving more weight , as the case may require , either to collegial or else to personal government , while always preserving both forms . Account should be taken of the university practice of the region where_the Faculty -isaia- located or of the Religious Institute on which_the Faculty may depend . Besides the University Council Academic Senate and the Faculty Council , both of which_must everywhere exist even if under different names , the Statutes can suitably establish other special councils or commissions for scientific learning , teaching , discipline , finances , etc . According to the Constitution , a Rector -isaia- one_who presides over a University ; a President -isaia- one_who presides over an Institute or a Faculty which exists separately ; a Dean -isaia- one_who presides over a Faculty which_-isaia- a part of a University . The Statutes are to fix a term of office for these persons for instance , three years and are to determine how and how_many times their term can be renewed . The office of the Rector or President -isaia- : to direct , promote , and coordinate all the activity of the academic community ; to be the representative of the University or of the Institute or Faculty existing separately ; to convoke the Council of the University or of the Institute or Faculty existing separately and preside over the same according to the norms of the Statutes ; to watch over the administration of temporalities ; to refer more_important matters to the Chancellor ; to send , every year , a statistical summary to the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education , according to the outline provided by that_same Congregation . The Dean of the Faculty -isaia- : to promote and coordinate all the activity of the Faculty , especially matters regarding studies , and to see to providing with due speed for their needs ; to convoke the Faculty Council and preside over it ; to admit or exclude students in the name of the Rector according to the norms of the Statutes ; to refer to the Rector what_-isaia- done or proposed by the Faculty ; to see_that the instructions of higher authorities are carried_out . Section III Teachers Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . Teachers who_are permanently attached to a Faculty are , in the first_place , those_who_are assumed in full and firm right and who are_called Ordinary Professors ; next come Extraordinary Professors . It can_also be useful to have others according to university practice . Besides permanent teachers , there_are other teachers who_are designated by various titles , in the first_place , those invited from other Faculties . Finally , it -isaia-_also opportune to have Teaching Assistants to carry_out certain academic functions . By a suitable doctorate -isaia- meant one_that corresponds to the discipline that_-isaia- being taught . If the discipline -isaia- sacred or connected_with_the sacred , the doctorate must be canonical . In the event that the doctorate -isaia- not canonical , the teacher will usually be required to have -atti_degli_apostoli- least a canonical licentiate . Non Catholic teachers , co opted according to the norms of competent ecclesiastical authority , require permission to teach from the Chancellor . The Statutes must establish when a permanent status -isaia- conferred in relationship_with the obtaining of the nihil obstat that_must be procured in accordance_with article of the Constitution . The nihil obstat of the Holy See -isaia- the declaration that , in accordance_with_the Constitution and the special Statutes , there_-isaia-_nothing to impede a nomination which_-isaia- proposed . If some impediment should exist , this_will be communicated to the Chancellor who_will listen to the teacher in regard to the matter . If particular circumstances of time or place impede the requesting of the nihil obstat from the Holy See , the Chancellor -isaia- to take counsel with the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education to find a suitable solution . In Faculties which_are under special concordat law the established norms are to be followed . The time interval between promotions , which_must be -atti_degli_apostoli- least three years , -isaia- to be set down in the Statutes . Teachers , first of all the permanent ones , are to seek to collaborate with each_other . It -isaia-_also recommended that_there be collaboration with the teachers of other Faculties , especially_those with subjects that_have an affinity or some connection_with those of the Faculty . One cannot be -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time a permanent teacher in more_than one Faculty . The Statutes are to set_out with care the procedure in regard to the suspension or dismissal of a teacher , especially in matters concerning doctrine . Care must_be_taken that , first of all , these_matters be settled between_the Rector or President or Dean and the teacher himself . If they_are_not settled there , the matters should be dealt_with by an appropriate Council or committee , so that the first examination of the facts be carried_out within_the University or Faculty itself . If this_-isaia-_not sufficient , the matters are to be referred to the Chancellor , who , with the help of experts , either of the University or the Faculty or from other places , must consider_the matter and provide_for a solution . The possibility remains open for recourse to the Holy See for a definitive solution , always allowing the teacher to explain and defend himself . However , in more grave or urgent cases for the good of the students and the faithful , the Chancellor can suspend the teacher for the duration of the regular procedure . Diocesan priests and Religious or those equivalent to Religious from whatever Institute , in order to be teachers in a Faculty or to remain as such , must_have the consent of their_proper Ordinary or Religious Superior , following the norms established in these_matters by competent Church authority . Section IV Students Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . Legal testimony , according to the norm of article of the Constitution : about a moral life_-isaia- to be given , for clergy and seminarians , their_own Ordinary or his delegate ; for all other persons by some ecclesiastic ; about previous studies in the study title required in accordance_with article of the Constitution . Since the studies required before entry into a University differ from one country to another , the Faculty has the right and duty to investigate whether all the disciplines have_been studied which_the Faculty itself considers necessary . A suitable knowledge of the Latin language -isaia- required_for the Faculties of the sacred sciences , so that the students can understand and use the sources and the documents of the Church . If one of the disciplines has_been found not to have_been studied or to have_been studied in an insufficient way , the Faculty -isaia- to require that_this be made up -atti_degli_apostoli- a suitable time and verified by an examination . Besides ordinary students , that_-isaia- , those studying for academic_degrees , extraordinary students can be admitted according to the norms determined in the Statutes . A person can be enrolled as an ordinary student in only_one Faculty -atti_degli_apostoli- a time . The transfer of a student from one Faculty to another can take_place only -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the academic year or semester , after a careful examination of his academic and disciplinary situation . But in any event nobody can be given an academic degree unless all the requirements for the degree are fulfilled as the Statutes of the Faculty demand . In the norms which determine the suspension or the expulsion of a student from a Faculty , the student s right to defend himself must be safeguarded . Section V Officials and Staff Assistants Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In the Statutes or in some other suitable document of the University or Faculty , the rights_and_duties of the Officials and Staff Assistants should be determined , as well as their participation in the community life of the University . Section VI Study Program Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The Statutes of each Faculty must define which disciplines principal and auxiliary are obligatory and must be followed by all , and which_are free or optional . Equally , the Statutes are to determine the practical exercises and seminars in which_the students must_not only be present but_also actively work together_with their colleagues and produce their_own expositions . The lectures and practical exercises are to be suitably distributed so as to foster private study and personal work under_the_guidance of the teachers . The Statutes are_also to determine in what way the examiners are to make_their judgments about candidates . In the final judgment about the candidates_for the individual academic_degrees , account -isaia- to be taken of all the marks received in the various tests in the same cycle , whether written or oral . In the examinations for the giving of degrees , especially_the doctorate , it -isaia-_also useful to invite examiners from outside the Faculty . The Statutes are to indicate the permanent curricula of studies which_are to be instituted in a Faculty for special purposes and indicate the diplomas which_are conferred -atti_degli_apostoli- their conclusion . Section VII Academic Degrees Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In Ecclesiastical Universities or Faculties which_are canonically erected or approved , the academic_degrees are given in the name of the Supreme Pontiff . The Statutes are to establish the necessary requisites for the preparation of the doctrinal dissertation and the norms for their public defense and publication . A copy of the published dissertation must be sent to the Sacred congregation_for Catholic Education . It -isaia- recommended that copies also be sent to other Ecclesiastical Faculties , -atti_degli_apostoli- least those of the same region , which deal_with the same science . Authentic documents regarding the conferring of degrees are to be signed by the Academic Authorities , according to the Statutes , and then are to be countersigned by the Secretary of the University or Faculty and have_the appropriate seal affixed . Honorary doctorates are_not to be conferred except with the consent of the Chancellor , who , having listened to the opinion of the University or Faculty Council , has obtained the nihil obstat of the Holy See . Section VIII Matters Relating to Teaching Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The University or Faculty must_have lecture halls which_are truly functional and worthy and suited to the teaching of the disciplines and to the number of students . There must be a library open for consultation , in which_the principle works for the scientific work of the teachers and students are available . Library norms are to be established in such_a_way_that access and use -isaia- made easy for the students and teachers . Cooperation and coordination between libraries of the same city and region should be fostered . Section IX Economic Matters Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . To provide_for continuous good administration , the authorities must inform themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- set times about the financial situation and they_must provide_for careful , periodic audits . Suitable ways should be found so that tuition fees do not keep from academic_degrees gifted students who give good hope of one_day being useful to the Church . Therefore care must_be_taken to set up forms of assistance for scholars , whatever their various names scholarships , study burses , student subsidies , etc . , to be given to needy students . Section X Planning and Cooperation of Faculties Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In order to undertake the erection of a new University or Faculty , it -isaia- necessary_that : a a true need or usefulness can be demonstrated , which_cannot be satisfied either by affiliation , aggregation , or incorporation , b the necessary prerequisites are present , which_are mainly : permanently engaged teachers who in number and quality respond to the nature and demands of a Faculty ; a suitable number of students ; a library with scientific apparatus and suitable buildings ; economic means really sufficient for a University or Faculty ; c the Statutes , together_with_the Study Program , be exhibited , which_are in conformity to the Constitution and to these Norms of Application . The Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education after listening to the advice first of the Bishops Conference , mainly from the pastoral viewpoint , and next of experts , principally from nearby Faculties , mainly from the scientific viewpoint will decide about the suitability of a new erection . This -isaia- commonly conceded -atti_degli_apostoli- first experimentally for a period of time before being definitely confirmed . When , on the other_hand , the approval of a University or Faculty -isaia- undertaken , this_-isaia- to be done : a after_the consent of both the Episcopal Conference and the local diocesan authority_-isaia- obtained ; b after_the conditions stated in article , n . , under b and c are fulfilled . The conditions for affiliation regard , above all , the number and qualification of teachers , the study program , the library , and the duty of the affiliating Faculty to help the institution being affiliated . Therefore , this_-isaia- usually granted only_when the affiliating Faculty and the affiliated institution are in the same country or cultural region . Aggregation -isaia- the linking with a Faculty of some Institute which embraces only the first and second cycle , for the purpose of granting the degrees corresponding to those cycles through the Faculty . Incorporation -isaia- the insertion into a Faculty of some Institute which embraces either the second or third cycle or both , for the purpose of granting the corresponding degrees through the Faculty . Aggregation and incorporation cannot be granted unless the Institute -isaia- specially equipped to grant degrees in such_a_way that_there_-isaia- a well founded hope_that , through the connection_with the Faculty , the desired ends will be achieved . Cooperation -isaia- to be fostered among the Ecclesiastical Faculties themselves by means of teacher exchanges , mutual communication of scientific work , and the promoting of common research for the benefit of the People of God . Cooperation with_other Faculties , even_those of non Catholics , should be promoted , care always however being taken to preserve one_s_own identity . PART TWO SPECIAL NORMS Section I Faculty of Sacred Theology Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . The theological disciplines are to be taught in such_a_way_that their organic connection -isaia- made clear and that light be shed upon the various aspects or dimensions that pertain intrinsically to the nature of sacred doctrine . The chief ones are the biblical , patristic , historical , liturgical , and pastoral dimensions . The students are to be led to a deep grasp of the material , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as they_are led to form a personal synthesis , to acquire a mastery of the method of scientific_research , and thus to become able to explain sacred doctrine appropriately . The obligatory disciplines are : . in the first cycle : a the philosophical disciplines needed_for theology , which_are above all systematic philosophy together_with its main parts and its historical evolution ; b the theological disciplines , namely : Sacred Scripture , introduction and exegesis ; fundamental theology , which also includes reference to ecumenism , non Christian religions , and atheism ; dogmatic theology ; moral and spiritual theology ; pastoral theology ; liturgy ; Church history , patrology , archaeology ; Canon law . c the auxiliary disciplines , namely , some of the sciences of man and , besides Latin , the biblical languages insofar as they_are required_for the following cycles . in the second cycle : the special disciplines established in various sections , according to the diverse specializations offered , along_with the practical exercises and seminars , including written work . in the third cycle : the Statutes are to determine if special disciplines are to be taught and which ones , together_with practical exercises and seminars . In the fifth year basic cycle , diligent care_must be exercised that all the disciplines are taught with order , fullness , and with correct method , so that the student receives harmoniously and effectively a solid , organic , and complete basic instruction in theology , which will_enable him either to go on to the next cycle s higher studies or to exercise some office in the Church . Besides examinations or equivalent tests for each discipline , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the first and of the second cycle there_-isaia- to be a comprehensive examination or equivalent test , so that the student proves that he has_received the full and scientific formation demanded by the respective cycle . It belongs to the Faculty to determine under which conditions students who_have completed a normal six year philosophy theology course in an ordinary seminary or in some other approved institution of higher learning may be admitted into the second cycle , taking account of their previous studies and , where necessary , prescribing special courses and examinations . Section II Faculty of Canon Law Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . In a Faculty of Canon Law , whether Latin or Oriental , there_must be a careful setting forth both of the history and texts of ecclesiastical laws and of their disposition and connection . The obligatory disciplines are : . in the first cycle : a the general fundamentals of canon_law ; b the elements of Sacred Theology especially of ecclesiology and sacramental theology and of philosophy especially ethics and natural_law which by their_very nature are prerequisites for the study of canon_law . It -isaia- useful to add elements from the sciences of man which_are connected_with_the juridical sciences . in the second cycle : a the Code of Canon Law with all its various parts and the other canonical laws ; b the connected disciplines , which_are : the philosophy of law , the public law of the Church , fundamentals of Roman law , elements of civil law , the history of canon_law . The student must_also write a special dissertation . in the third cycle : the Statutes are to determine which special disciplines and which practical exercises are to be prescribed , according to the nature of the Faculty and the needs of the students . Whoever successfully completes the philosophy theology curriculum in an ordinary seminary or in some other approved institution of higher learning , or who has_already successfully completed the studies of the first cycle , may be admitted directly into the second cycle . A person_who has_already earned a doctorate in civil law , may be allowed , according to the judgment of the Faculty , to abbreviate the course , always maintaining however the obligation to pass all the examinations and tests required_for receiving academic_degrees . Besides examinations or equivalent tests for each discipline , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second cycle there_-isaia- to be a comprehensive examination or equivalent test , whereby_the student proves that he has_received the full and scientific formation demanded by the cycle . Section III Faculty of Philosophy Apostolic Constitution , articles Article . Philosophy -isaia- to be taught in such_a_way_that the students in the basic cycle will come to a solid and coherent synthesis of doctrine , will learn to examine and judge the different systems of philosophy , and will_also gradually become accustomed to personal philosophical reflection .

HE WHO SEES ME SEES THE FATHER cf . The Revelation of Mercy It -isaia- '' God , who_-isaia- rich in mercy '' whom Jesus Christ has revealed to us as Father : it -isaia- His very Son who , in Himself , has manifested Him and made Him known to us . Memorable in this_regard -isaia- the moment when Philip , one of the twelve Apostles , turned to Christ and said : '' Lord , show us the Father , and we shall be satisfied '' ; and Jesus replied : '' Have I been with you so long , and yet you do not_know me . ? He who_has seen me has seen the Father . '' These words were spoken during the farewell discourse -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the paschal supper , which_was followed by the events of those holy days during which confirmation was to be given once and for all of the fact_that '' God , who_-isaia- rich in mercy , out of the great love with_which he loved us , even_when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together_with Christ . '' Following the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and paying close attention to the special needs of our_times , I devoted the encyclical Redemptor hominis to the truth_about man , a truth_that -isaia-_revealed to us in its fullness and depth in Christ . A no less important need in these critical and difficult times impels me to draw attention once_again in Christ to the countenance of the '' Father of mercies and God of all comfort . '' We read in the Constitution Gaudium et spes : '' Christ the new Adam . fully reveals man to himself and brings to light his lofty calling , '' and does it '' in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father and of his_love . '' The words that I have quoted are clear testimony to the fact_that man cannot be manifested in the full dignity of his nature without reference not_only on the level of concepts but_also in an integrally existential way to God . Man and man s lofty calling are revealed in Christ through the revelation of the mystery of the Father and His love . For this_reason it -isaia-_now fitting to reflect on this_mystery . It -isaia- called_for by the varied experiences of the Church and of contemporary man . It -isaia-_also demanded by the pleas of many human hearts , their sufferings and hopes , their anxieties and expectations . While it -isaia- true_that every_individual human_being -isaia- , as I said in my encyclical Redemptor hominis , the way_for the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Gospel and the whole of Tradition constantly show us that we must travel this_day with every_individual just as Christ traced it out by revealing in Himself the Father and His love . In Jesus Christ , every path to man , as it has_been assigned once and for all to the Church in the changing context of the times , -isaia- simultaneously an approach to the Father and His love . The Second Vatican Council has confirmed this_truth for our_time . The more the Church s mission_-isaia- centered upon man the more it -isaia- , so to speak , anthropocentric the more it must be confirmed and actualized theocentrically , that_-isaia- to say , be directed in Jesus Christ to the Father . While the various currents of human thought both in the past and -atti_degli_apostoli- the present have tended and still tend to separate theocentrism and anthropocentrism , and even to set them in opposition to each_other , the Church , following Christ , seeks to link them up in human_history , in a deep and organic way . And this -isaia-_also one of the basic principles , perhaps the most important one , of the teaching of the last Council . Since , therefore , in the present phase of the Church s history we put before ourselves as our primary task the implementation of the doctrine of the great Council , we must act upon this principle with_faith , with an open mind and with_all_our heart . In the encyclical already referred to , I have tried to show that the deepening and the many faceted enrichment of the Church s consciousness resulting from the Council must open our minds and our_hearts more widely to Christ . Today I wish to say that openness to Christ , who as the Redeemer of the world fully reveals man_himself , '' can_only be achieved through an ever_more mature reference to the Father and His love . The Incarnation of Mercy Although God '' dwells in unapproachable light , '' He speaks to man he means of the whole of the universe : '' ever since_the creation of the world his invisible nature , namely , his eternal power and deity , has_been clearly perceived in the things_that have been_made . '' This indirect and imperfect knowledge , achieved by the intellect seeking God by means of creatures through the visible world , falls short of '' vision of the Father . '' '' No one has_ever seen God , '' writes St . John , in order to stress the truth_that '' the only Son , who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father , he has made him known . '' This '' making known '' reveals God in the most profound mystery of His being , one and three , surrounded by '' unapproachable light . '' Nevertheless , through_this '' making known '' by Christ we know God above all in His relationship of love for_man : in His '' philanthropy . '' It -isaia- precisely here that '' His invisible nature '' becomes in a special_way '' visible , '' incomparably more visible than through all the other '' things_that have been_made '' : it becomes visible in Christ and through Christ , through His actions and His words , and finally through His death on the cross and His resurrection . In this_way , in Christ and through Christ , God also becomes especially visible in His mercy ; that_-isaia- to say , there_-isaia- emphasized that attribute of the divinity which_the Old Testament , using various concepts and terms , already defined as '' mercy . '' Christ confers on the whole of the Old Testament tradition about God s mercy a definitive meaning . Not only does He speak of it and explain it by the use of comparisons and parables , but_above all He Himself makes it incarnate and personifies it . He Himself , in a certain_sense , -isaia- mercy . To the person_who sees it in Him and finds it in Him God becomes '' visible '' in a particular_way as the Father who_-isaia- rich in mercy . '' The present_day mentality , more perhaps than_that of people in the past , seems opposed to a God of mercy , and in fact tends to exclude from life and to remove from the human_heart the very idea of mercy . The word and the concept of '' mercy '' seem to cause uneasiness in man_,_who , thanks to the enormous development of science and technology , never before known in history , has become the master of the earth and has subdued and dominated it . This dominion over the earth , sometimes understood in a one sided and superficial way , seems to have no room_for mercy . However , in this_regard we can profitably refer to the picture of '' man s situation in the world today '' as described -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Constitution Gaudium et spes . Here we read the following sentences : '' In the light of the foregoing factors there appears the dichotomy of a world that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once powerful and weak , capable of doing what_-isaia- noble and what_-isaia- base , disposed to freedom and slavery , progress and decline , brotherhood and hatred . Man -isaia- growing conscious that the forces he has unleashed are in his_own hands and that_it_-isaia- up to him to control them or be enslaved by them . '' The situation of the world today not_only displays transformations that give grounds for hope in a better future for_man on earth , but_also reveals a multitude of threats , far surpassing those known up till now . Without ceasing to point_out these threats on various occasions as in addresses -atti_degli_apostoli- UNO , to UNESCO , to FAO and elsewhere , the Church must -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time examine them in the light of the truth received_from God . The truth , revealed in Christ , about God the '' Father of mercies , '' enables us to '' see '' Him as particularly close to man especially_when man_-isaia- suffering , when he -isaia- under threat -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of his existence and dignity . And this_-isaia-_why , in the situation of the Church and the world today , many individuals and groups guided by a lively sense of faith are turning , I would say almost spontaneously , to the mercy of God . They are certainly being moved to do this by Christ Himself , who through His Spirit works within human hearts . For the mystery of God the '' Father of mercies '' revealed by Christ becomes , in the context of today s threats to man , as it were a unique appeal addressed to the Church . In the present encyclical wish to accept this appeal ; I wish to draw from the eternal and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for its simplicity and depth incomparable language of revelation and faith , in order through_this same language to express once_more before God and before humanity the major anxieties of our_time . In fact , revelation and faith teach us not_only to meditate in the abstract upon the mystery of God as '' Father of mercies , '' but_also to have_recourse to that mercy in the name of Christ and in union with Him . Did not Christ say that_our Father , who '' sees in secret , '' -isaia- always waiting for us to have_recourse to Him in every need and always waiting for us to study His mystery : the mystery of the Father and His love ? I therefore wish these considerations to bring this_mystery closer to everyone . At the same_time I wish them to be a heartfelt appeal by the Church to mercy , which humanity and the modern_world need so much . And they_need mercy even_though they often do not realize it . THE MESSIANIC MESSAGE . When Christ Began To Do and To Teach Before His own townspeople , in Nazareth , Christ refers to the words of the prophet Isaiah : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor . He has_sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the acceptable year of the Lord . '' These phrases , according to Luke , are His first messianic declaration . They are followed by the actions and words known through the Gospel . By these actions and words Christ makes_the Father present among_men . It -isaia-_very significant that the people in question are especially_the poor , those without means of subsistence , those deprived of their freedom , the blind who cannot see the beauty of creation , those living with broken hearts , or suffering from social injustice , and finally sinners . It -isaia-_especially for these last that the Messiah becomes a particularly clear sign of God who_-isaia- love , a sign of the Father . In this visible sign the people of our own_time , just like the people then , can_see the Father . It -isaia- significant that , when_the messengers sent by John the Baptist came to Jesus to ask Him : '' Are you he who_-isaia- to come , or shall we look for another ? '' , He answered by referring to the same testimony with_which He had begun His teaching -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth : '' Go and tell John what it -isaia- that_you have_seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have good_news preached to them . '' He then ended with the words : '' And blessed -isaia- he who takes no offense -atti_degli_apostoli- me '' . Especially through His lifestyle and through His actions , Jesus revealed that love_-isaia- present in the world in which we live an effective love , a love_that addresses itself to man and embraces everything_that makes up his humanity . This love makes itself particularly noticed in contact_with suffering , injustice and poverty in contact_with_the whole historical '' human condition , '' which in various_ways manifests man s limitation and frailty , both physical and moral . It -isaia- precisely_the mode and sphere in which love manifests itself that in biblical language -isaia- called '' mercy . '' Christ , then , reveals God who_-isaia- Father , who_-isaia- '' love , '' as St . John will express it in his_first letter ; Christ reveals God as '' rich in mercy , '' as we read in St . This truth_-isaia- not_just the subject of a teaching ; it -isaia- a reality made present to us by Christ . Making the Father present as love and mercy -isaia- , in Christ s own consciousness , the fundamental touchstone of His mission as the Messiah ; this_-isaia- confirmed by the words that He uttered first in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and later in the presence of His disciples and of John the Baptist s messengers . On the basis of this_way of manifesting the presence of God who_-isaia- Father , love and mercy , Jesus makes mercy one of the principal themes of His preaching . As -isaia- His custom , He first teaches '' in parables , '' since these express better the very essence of things . It -isaia- sufficient to recall_the parable of the prodigal son , or the parable of the Good Samaritan , but_also by contrast the parable of the merciless servant . There are_many passages in the teaching of Christ that manifest love mercy under some ever fresh aspect . We need only consider_the Good Shepherd who goes in search of the lost sheep , or the woman who sweeps the house in search of the lost coin . The Gospel writer who particularly treats of these themes in Christ s teaching_-isaia- Luke , whose Gospel has earned the title of '' the Gospel of mercy . '' When one speaks of preaching , one encounters a problem of major importance with reference to the meaning of terms and the content of concepts , especially_the content of the concept of '' mercy '' in relationship to the concept of '' love '' . A grasp of the content of these concepts -isaia- the key to understanding the very reality of mercy . And this_-isaia-_what -isaia- most important_for us . However , before devoting a further part of our considerations to this_subject , that_-isaia- to say , to establishing the meaning of the vocabulary and the content proper to the concept of mercy , '' we must note that Christ , in revealing the love mercy of God , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time demanded from people that_they also should be guided in their_lives by love and mercy . This requirement forms part of the very essence of the messianic message , and constitutes the heart of the Gospel ethos . The Teacher expresses this both through the medium of the commandment which He describes as '' the greatest , '' and also in the form of a blessing , when in the Sermon on the Mount He proclaims : '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_shall obtain mercy . '' In this_way , the messianic message about mercy preserves a particular divine human dimension . Christ the very fulfillment of the messianic prophecy by becoming the incarnation of the love that_-isaia- manifested with particular force with_regard to the suffering , the unfortunate and sinners , makes present and thus more_fully reveals the Father , who_-isaia- God '' rich in mercy . '' At the same_time , by becoming for people a model of merciful love for others , Christ proclaims by His actions even_more than by His words that call to mercy which_-isaia- one of the essential elements of the Gospel ethos . In this instance it -isaia- not_just a case of fulfilling a commandment or an obligation of an ethical nature ; it -isaia-_also a case of satisfying a condition of major importance for God to reveal Himself in His mercy to man : '' The merciful . shall obtain mercy . THE OLD TESTAMENT . The Concept of '' Mercy '' in the Old Testament The concept of '' mercy '' in the Old Testament has a long and rich history . We have to refer back to it in order_that the mercy revealed by Christ may shine_forth more_clearly . By revealing that mercy both through His actions and through His teaching , Christ addressed Himself to people_who not_only knew the concept of mercy , but who also , as the People of God of the Old Covenant , had drawn_from their age long history a special experience of the mercy of God . This experience was social and communal , as well as individual and interior . Israel was , in fact , the people of the covenant with God , a covenant that it broke many times . Whenever it became aware of its infidelity and in the history of Israel there_was no lack of prophets and others_who awakened this awareness it appealed to mercy . In this_regard , the books of the Old Testament give us very many examples . Among the events and texts of greater importance one may recall : the beginning of the history of the Judges , the prayer of Solomon -atti_degli_apostoli- the inauguration of the Temple , part of the prophetic work of Micah , the consoling assurances given by Isaiah , the cry of the Jews in exile , and the renewal of the covenant after_the return from exile . It -isaia- significant that in their preaching the prophets link mercy , which_they often refer to because of the people s sins , with the incisive image of love on God s part . The Lord loves Israel with the love of a special choosing , much like the love of a spouse , and for this_reason He pardons its sins and even its infidelities and betrayals . When He finds repentance and true conversion , He brings His people back to grace . In the preaching of the prophets , mercy signifies a special power of love_,_which prevails over the sin and infidelity of the chosen people . In this broad '' social '' context , mercy appears as a correlative to the interior experience of individuals languishing in a state of guilt or enduring every_kind of suffering and misfortune . Both physical evil and moral evil , namely sin , cause the sons_and_daughters of Israel to turn to the Lord and beseech His mercy . In this_way David turns to Him , conscious of the seriousness of his guilt ; Job too , after_his rebellion , turns to Him in his tremendous misfortune ; so also does Esther , knowing the mortal threat to her_own people . And we find still other examples in the books of the Old Testament . At the root of this many sided conviction , which_-isaia- both communal and personal , and which_-isaia- demonstrated by the whole of the Old Testament down_the_centuries , -isaia- the basic experience of the chosen people -atti_degli_apostoli- the Exodus : the Lord saw the affliction of His people reduced to slavery , heard their cry , knew their sufferings and decided to deliver them . In this act of salvation by the Lord , the prophet perceived his_love and compassion . This -isaia- precisely_the grounds upon which_the people and each of its_members based their certainty of the mercy of God , which_can be invoked whenever tragedy strikes . Added to this_-isaia- the fact_that sin too constitutes man s misery . The people of the Old Covenant experienced this misery from the time of the Exodus , when_they set up the golden calf . The Lord Himself triumphed over this act of breaking the covenant when He solemnly declared to Moses that He was a '' God merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness . '' It -isaia- in this central revelation that the chosen people , and each of its_members , will_find , every time that_they_have sinned , the strength and the motive for turning to the Lord to remind Him of what He had exactly revealed about Himself and to beseech His forgiveness . Thus , in deeds and in words , the Lord revealed His mercy from the very beginnings of the people which He chose for Himself ; and , in the course of its history , this people continually entrusted itself , both when stricken with misfortune and when it became aware of its sin , to the God of mercies . All the subtleties of love become manifest in the Lord s mercy towards those_who_are His own : He -isaia- their Father , for Israel -isaia- His firstborn son ; the Lord -isaia-_also the bridegroom of her whose new name the prophet proclaims : Ruhamah , '' Beloved '' or '' she_has obtained pity . '' Even when_the Lord -isaia- exasperated by the infidelity of His people and thinks of finishing with it , it -isaia- still His tenderness and generous love for those_who_are His own which overcomes His anger . Thus it -isaia- easy to understand why_the psalmists , when_they desire to sing the highest praises of the Lord , break forth into hymns to the God of love , tenderness , mercy and fidelity . From all this it follows_that mercy does_not pertain only to the notion of God , but_it_-isaia- something_that characterizes the life of the whole_people of Israel and each of its sons_and_daughters : mercy -isaia- the content of intimacy with_their Lord , the content of their dialogue_with Him . Under precisely this aspect , mercy -isaia- presented in the individual books of the Old Testament with a great richness of expression . It may be difficult to find in these books a purely theoretical answer to the question of what mercy -isaia- in itself . Nevertheless , the terminology that_-isaia- used -isaia- in itself able to tell us much about this_subject . The Old Testament proclaims_the mercy of the Lord by the use of many terms with related meanings ; they_are differentiated by their particular content , but it could be said_that they all converge from different directions on one single fundamental content , to express its surpassing richness and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to bring it close to man under different aspects . The Old Testament encourages people suffering from misfortune , especially_those weighed down by sin as also the whole of Israel , which_had entered into the covenant with God to appeal for mercy , and enables them to count upon it : it reminds them of His mercy in times of failure and loss of trust . Subsequently , the Old Testament gives thanks and glory for mercy every time that mercy -isaia- made manifest in the life of the people or in the lives of individuals . In this_way , mercy -isaia- in a certain_sense contrasted with God s justice , and in many cases -isaia- shown to be not_only more powerful than_that justice but_also more profound . Even the Old Testament teaches_that , although justice -isaia- an authentic virtue in man , and in God signifies transcendent perfection nevertheless love_-isaia- '' greater '' than justice : greater in the sense that_it_-isaia- primary and fundamental . Love , so to speak , conditions justice and , in the final analysis , justice serves love . The primacy and superiority of love vis a vis justice this_-isaia- a mark of the whole of revelation are revealed precisely through mercy . This seemed so obvious to the psalmists and prophets that the very term justice ended up by meaning the salvation accomplished by the Lord and His mercy . Mercy differs from justice , but_-isaia- not in opposition to it , if we admit in the history of man as the Old Testament precisely does the presence of God , who already as Creator has linked Himself to His creature with a particular love . Love , by its_very nature , excludes hatred and ill will towards_the one to whom He once gave the gift of Himself : Nihil odisti eorum quae fecisti , '' you hold nothing of what_you have_made in abhorrence . '' These words indicate the profound basis of the relationship_between justice and mercy in God , in His relations with_man and the world . They tell us that we must seek the life_giving roots and intimate reasons for_this relationship by going back to '' the beginning , '' in the very mystery of creation . They foreshadow in the context of the Old Covenant the full revelation of God , who_-isaia- '' love . '' Connected with the mystery of creation -isaia- the mystery of the election , which in a special_way shaped the history of the people whose spiritual father -isaia- Abraham by virtue of his faith . Nevertheless , through_this people which journeys forward through the history both of the Old Covenant and of the New , that mystery of election refers to every man_and_woman , to the whole great human_family . '' I have loved you with an everlasting love , therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you . '' '' For the mountains may depart . my steadfast love shall_not depart from you , and my covenant of peace shall_not be removed . '' This truth , once proclaimed to Israel , involves a perspective of the whole history of man , a perspective both temporal and eschatological . Christ reveals the Father within_the framework of the same perspective and on ground already prepared , as many pages of the Old Testament writings demonstrate . At the end of this revelation , on the night before He dies , He says to the apostle Philip these memorable words : '' Have I been with you so long , and yet you do not_know me . ? He who_has seen me has seen the Father . THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON . An Analogy At the very_beginning of the New Testament , two voices resound in St . Luke s Gospel in unique harmony concerning the mercy of God , a harmony which forcefully echoes the whole Old Testament tradition . They express the semantic elements linked to the differentiated terminology of the ancient books . Mary , entering the house of Zechariah , magnifies the Lord with all her soul for '' his_mercy , '' which '' from generation to generation '' -isaia- bestowed on those_who fear Him . A little later , as she recalls the election of Israel , she proclaims_the mercy which He who_has chosen her holds '' in remembrance '' from all time . Afterwards , in the same house , when John the Baptist -isaia- born , his_father Zechariah blesses the God of Israel and glorifies Him for performing the mercy promised to our fathers and for remembering His holy covenant . In the teaching of Christ Himself , this image inherited from the Old Testament becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time simpler and more profound . This -isaia- perhaps most evident in the parable of the prodigal son . Although the word '' mercy '' does_not appear , it nevertheless expresses the essence of the divine mercy in a particularly clear way . This -isaia- due not_so_much to the terminology , as in the Old Testament books , as to the analogy that enables us to understand more_fully the very mystery of mercy , as a profound drama played out between_the father s love and the prodigality and sin of the son . That son , who receives from the father the portion of the inheritance that_-isaia- due to him and leaves home to squander it in a far country '' in loose living , '' in a certain_sense -isaia- the man of every period , beginning with the one_who was_the first to lose the inheritance of grace and original justice . The analogy -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point -isaia-_very wide ranging . The parable indirectly touches upon every breach of the covenant of love , every loss of grace , every sin . In this analogy there_-isaia- less emphasis than in the prophetic tradition on the unfaithfulness of the whole_people of Israel , although the analogy of the prodigal son may extend to this also . '' When he had spent everything , '' the son '' began to be in need , '' especially as '' a great famine arose in that country '' to which_he_had gone after leaving his_father s house . And in this situation '' he would gladly have fed on '' anything , even '' the pods that the swine ate , '' the swine that he herded for '' one of the citizens of that country . '' But even this_was refused him . The analogy turns clearly towards man s interior . The inheritance that the son had received_from his_father was a quantity of material goods , but more_important than these goods was his dignity as a son in his_father s house . The situation in which he found himself when he lost the material goods should_have made him aware of the loss of that dignity . He had not thought about it previously , when he had asked his_father to give him the part of the inheritance that_was due to him , in order to go away . He seems not to be conscious of it even_now , when he says to himself : '' How many of my father s hired servants have bread enough and to spare , but I perish here with hunger . '' He measures himself by the standard of the goods that_he_has lost , that he no longer '' possesses , '' while the hired servants of his_father s house '' possess '' them . These words express above all his attitude to material goods ; nevertheless under their surface -isaia- concealed the tragedy of lost dignity , the awareness of squandered sonship . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point that he makes_the decision : '' I will arise and go to my father , and I will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you ; I -amos- no longer worthy to be called your son . Treat me as one of your hired servants . '' These are words that reveal more_deeply the essential problem . Through the complex material situation in which_the prodigal son found himself because of his folly , because of sin , the sense of lost dignity had matured . When he decides to return to his_father s house , to ask his_father to be received no longer by virtue of his right as a son , but as an employee -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight he seems to be acting by reason of the hunger and poverty that he had fallen into ; this motive , however , -isaia- permeated by an awareness of a deeper loss : to be a hired servant in his_own father s house -isaia- certainly a great humiliation and source of shame . Nevertheless , the prodigal son -isaia- ready to undergo that humiliation and shame . He realizes that he no longer has any right except to be an employee in his_father s house . His decision -isaia- taken in full consciousness of what he has deserved and of what he can still have a right to in accordance_with_the norms of justice . Precisely this reasoning demonstrates that , -atti_degli_apostoli- the center of the prodigal son s consciousness , the sense of lost dignity -isaia- emerging , the sense of that dignity that springs from the relationship of the son with the father . And it -isaia- with this decision that he sets out . In the parable of the prodigal son , the term '' justice '' -isaia- not used even once ; just as in the original text the term '' mercy '' -isaia- not used either . Nevertheless , the relationship_between justice and love , that_-isaia- manifested as mercy , -isaia- inscribed with_great exactness in the content of the Gospel parable . It becomes more evident_that love_-isaia- transformed into mercy when_it_-isaia- necessary to go beyond_the precise norm of justice precise and often too narrow . The prodigal son , having wasted the property he received_from his_father , deserves after_his return to earn his living by working in his_father s house as a hired servant and possibly , little by little , to build up a certain provision of material goods , though perhaps never as much as the amount he had squandered . This would be demanded by the order of justice , especially as the son had not_only squandered the part of the inheritance belonging to him but had also hurt and offended his_father by his whole conduct . Since this conduct had in his_own eyes deprived him of his dignity as a son , it could_not be a matter of indifference to his_father . It was bound to make him suffer . It was_also bound to implicate him in some_way . And yet , after all , it was his_own son who_was involved , and such a relationship could never be altered or destroyed by any sort of behavior . The prodigal son -isaia- aware of this and it -isaia- precisely this awareness_that shows him clearly_the dignity which_he_has lost and which_makes him honestly evaluate the position that he could still expect in his_father s house . Particular Concentration on Human Dignity This exact picture of the prodigal son s state of mind enables us to understand exactly what_the mercy of God consists in . There -isaia- no doubt_that in this simple but penetrating analogy the figure of the father reveals to us God as Father . The conduct of the father in the parable and his whole behavior , which manifests his internal attitude , enables us to rediscover the individual threads of the Old Testament vision of mercy in a synthesis which_-isaia- totally new , full of simplicity and depth . The father of the prodigal son -isaia- faithful to his fatherhood , faithful to the love_that he had always lavished on his_son . This fidelity -isaia- expressed in the parable not_only by his immediate readiness to welcome him home when he returns after_having squandered his inheritance ; it -isaia- expressed even more_fully by that joy , that merrymaking for the squanderer after_his return , merrymaking which_-isaia- so generous that it provokes the opposition and hatred of the elder brother , who_had never gone far away from his_father and had never abandoned the home . The father s fidelity to himself a trait already known by the Old Testament term hesed -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time expressed in a manner particularly charged with affection . We read , in fact , that_when the father saw the prodigal son returning home '' he had compassion , ran to meet him , threw his arms around his neck and kissed him . '' He certainly does this under the influence of a deep affection , and this also explains his generosity towards his_son , that generosity which so angers the elder son . Nevertheless , the causes of this emotion are to be sought -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper level . Notice , the father -isaia- aware_that a fundamental good has_been saved : the good of his_son s humanity . Although the son has squandered the inheritance , nevertheless his humanity -isaia- saved . Indeed , it has_been , in a way , found again . The father s words to the elder son reveal this : '' It was fitting to make merry and be glad , for_this your brother was dead and -isaia- alive ; he was lost and -isaia- found . '' In the same chapter fifteen of Luke s Gospel , we read the parable of the sheep that_was found and then the parable of the coin that_was found . Each time there_-isaia- an emphasis on the same joy that_-isaia- present in the case of the prodigal son . The father s fidelity to himself_-isaia- totally concentrated upon the humanity of the lost son , upon his dignity . This explains above all his joyous emotion -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the son s return home . Going on , one_can therefore say that the love for the son the love_that springs from the very essence of fatherhood , in a way obliges the father to be concerned about his_son s dignity . This concern -isaia- the measure of his_love , the love of which Saint Paul was to write : '' Love -isaia- patient and kind . love does_not insist on its_own way ; it -isaia- not irritable or resentful . but rejoices in the right . hopes all things , endures all things '' and '' love never ends . '' Mercy as Christ has presented it in the parable of the prodigal son has the interior form of the love_that in the New Testament -isaia- called agape . This love_-isaia- able to reach down to every prodigal son , to every_human misery , and above all to every_form of moral misery , to sin . When this happens , the person who_-isaia- the object of mercy does_not feel humiliated , but_rather found again and '' restored to value . '' The father first_and_foremost expresses to him his joy that_he_has been '' found again '' and that_he_has '' returned to life . This joy indicates a good that_has remained intact : even if he -isaia- a prodigal , a son does not_cease to be truly his_father s son ; it also indicates a good that_has_been found again , which in the case of the prodigal son was his return to the truth_about himself . What took_place in the relationship_between_the father_and_the_son in Christ s parable -isaia- not to be evaluated '' from the outside . '' Our prejudices about mercy are mostly the result of appraising them only from the outside . At times it happens_that by following this method of evaluation we see in mercy above all a relationship of inequality between_the one offering it and the one receiving it . And , in consequence , we are quick to deduce that mercy belittles the receiver , that it offends the dignity of man . The parable of the prodigal son shows_that the reality -isaia- different : the relationship of mercy -isaia- based on the common experience of that good which_-isaia- man , on the common experience of the dignity that_-isaia- proper to him . This common experience makes_the prodigal son begin to see himself and his actions in their full truth this vision in truth_-isaia- a genuine form of humility ; on the other_hand , for this_very reason he becomes a particular good for his_father : the father sees so clearly_the good which_has_been achieved thanks to a mysterious radiation of truth and love , that he seems to forget all the evil which_the son had committed . The parable of the prodigal son expresses in a simple but profound way the reality of conversion . Conversion -isaia-_the_most concrete expression of the working of love and of the presence of mercy in the human world . The true and proper meaning of mercy does_not consist only in looking , however penetratingly and compassionately , -atti_degli_apostoli- moral , physical or material evil : mercy -isaia- manifested in its true and proper aspect when it restores to value , promotes and draws good from all the forms of evil existing in the world and in man . Understood in this_way , mercy constitutes the fundamental content of the messianic message of Christ and the constitutive power of His mission . His disciples and followers understood and practiced mercy in the same_way . Mercy never ceased to reveal itself , in their_hearts and in their actions , as an especially creative proof of the love which_does_not allow itself to be '' conquered by evil , '' but overcomes '' evil with_good . '' The genuine face of mercy has to be ever revealed anew . In spite of many prejudices , mercy seems particularly necessary_for our_times . THE PASCHAL MYSTERY . Mercy Revealed in the Cross and Resurrection The messianic message of Christ and His activity among people end with the cross and resurrection . We have to penetrate deeply into this final event which especially in the language of the Council -isaia- defined as the Mysterium Paschale if we wish to express in depth the truth_about mercy , as it has_been revealed in depth in the history of our_salvation . At this_point of our considerations , we shall_have to draw closer still to the content of the encyclical Redemptor hominis . If , in fact , the reality of the Redemption , in its human dimension , reveals the unheard of greatness of man , qui talem ac tantum meruit habere Redemptorem , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the divine dimension of the redemption enables us , I would say , in the most empirical and '' historical '' way , to uncover the depth of that_love which_does_not recoil before the extraordinary sacrifice of the Son , in order to satisfy the fidelity of the Creator and Father towards human_beings , created in His image and chosen from '' the beginning , '' in this Son , for grace and glory . The events of Good Friday and , even before that , in prayer in Gethsemane , introduce a fundamental change into the whole course of the revelation of love and mercy in the messianic mission of Christ . The one_who '' went about doing good and healing '' and '' curing every sickness and disease '' now Himself seems to merit the greatest mercy and to appeal for mercy , when He -isaia- arrested , abused , condemned , scourged , crowned with thorns , when He -isaia- nailed to the cross and dies amidst agonizing torments . It -isaia- then that He particularly deserves mercy from the people to whom He has done good , and He does_not receive it . Even those_who_are closest to Him cannot protect Him and snatch Him from the hands of His oppressors . At this final stage of His messianic activity the words_which the prophets , especially Isaiah , uttered concerning the Servant of Yahweh are fulfilled in Christ : '' Through his stripes we are healed . '' Christ , as the man_who suffers really and in a terrible way in the Garden of Olives and on Calvary , addresses Himself to the Father that Father whose love He has preached to people , to whose mercy He has borne witness through all of His activity . But He -isaia- not spared not_even He the terrible suffering of death on the cross : For our sake God made him to be sin who knew no sin , '' St . Paul will write , summing up in a few words the whole depth of the cross and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the divine dimension of the reality of the Redemption . Indeed this Redemption -isaia- the ultimate and definitive revelation of the holiness of God , who_-isaia- the absolute fullness of perfection : fullness of justice and of love , since justice -isaia- based on love , flows from it and tends towards it . In the passion and death of Christ in the fact_that the Father did_not spare His own Son , but '' for our sake made him sin '' absolute justice -isaia- expressed , for Christ undergoes the passion and cross because of the sins of humanity . This constitutes even a '' superabundance '' of justice , for the sins of man are '' compensated for '' by the sacrifice of the Man God . Nevertheless , this justice , which_-isaia- properly justice '' to God s measure , '' springs completely from love : from the love of the Father and of the Son , and completely bears fruit in love . Precisely for this_reason_the divine justice revealed in the cross of Christ -isaia- '' to God s measure , '' because it springs from love and -isaia- accomplished in love , producing fruits of salvation . The divine dimension of redemption -isaia- put into_effect not_only by bringing justice to bear upon sin , but_also by restoring to love_that creative power in man thanks also which he once_more has access to the fullness of life and holiness that come from God . In this_way , redemption involves the revelation of mercy in its fullness . The Paschal Mystery -isaia- the culmination of this revealing and effecting of mercy , which_-isaia- able to justify man , to restore justice in the sense of that salvific order which God willed from the beginning in man and , through man , in the world . The suffering Christ speaks in a special_way to man , and not_only to the believer . The non believer also will_be_able to discover in Him the eloquence of solidarity with the human lot , as also the harmonious fullness of a disinterested dedication to the cause of man , to truth and to love . And yet the divine dimension of the Paschal Mystery goes still deeper . The cross on Calvary , the cross upon which Christ conducts His final dialogue_with_the Father , emerges from the very_heart of the love_that man , created in the image_and_likeness of God , has_been_given as a gift , according to God s eternal plan . God , as Christ has revealed Him , does_not merely remain closely linked_with the world as the Creator and the ultimate source of existence . He -isaia-_also Father : He -isaia- linked to man , whom He called to existence in the visible world , by a bond still_more intimate than_that of creation . It -isaia- love_which not_only creates the good but_also grants participation in the very life of God : Father , Son and Holy Spirit . For he who loves desires to give himself . The cross of Christ on Calvary stands beside the path of that admirable commercium , of that wonderful self communication of God to man , which also includes the call to man to share in the divine_life by giving himself , and with himself_the whole visible world , to God , and like an adopted son to become a sharer in the truth and love which_-isaia- in God and proceeds from God . It -isaia- precisely beside the path of man s eternal election to the dignity of being an adopted child of God that_there stands in history the cross of Christ , the only_begotten Son , who , as '' light from light , true God from true God , '' came to give the final witness to the wonderful covenant of God with humanity , of God with_man every_human_being This covenant , as old as man it goes back to the very mystery of creation and afterwards many times renewed with one single chosen people , -isaia- equally the new and definitive covenant , which_was established there on Calvary , and -isaia- not limited to a single people , to Israel , but_-isaia- open to each and every_individual . What else , then , does the cross of Christ say to us , the cross that in a sense -isaia- the final word of His messianic message and mission ? And yet this_-isaia-_not yet the word of the God of the covenant : that_will be pronounced -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn when first the women and then the Apostles come to the tomb of the crucified Christ , see the tomb empty and for the first time hear_the message : '' He -isaia- risen . '' They will repeat this message to the others and will be witnesses to the risen Christ . Yet , even in this glorification of the Son of God , the cross remains , that cross which through all the messianic testimony of the Man the Son , who suffered death upon it speaks and never ceases to speak of God the Father , who_-isaia- absolutely faithful to His eternal love for_man , since He '' so loved the world '' therefore man in the world_that '' he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life . '' Believing in the crucified Son means '' seeing the Father , '' means believing that love_-isaia- present in the world and that_this love_-isaia- more powerful than any_kind of evil in which individuals , humanity , or the world are involved . Believing in this_love means believing in mercy . For mercy -isaia- an indispensable dimension of love ; it -isaia- as it were love s second name and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the specific manner in which love -isaia-_revealed and effected vis a vis the reality of the evil that_-isaia- in the world , affecting and besieging man , insinuating itself even into his_heart and capable of causing him to '' perish in Gehenna . Love More Powerful Than Death , More Powerful Than Sin The cross of Christ on Calvary -isaia-_also a witness to the strength of evil against the very Son of God , against the one_who , alone among all the sons of men , was by His nature absolutely innocent and free_from sin , and whose coming into_the_world was untainted by the disobedience of Adam and the inheritance of original_sin . And here , precisely in Him , in Christ , justice -isaia- done to sin -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of His sacrifice , of His obedience '' even to death . '' He who_was without sin , '' God made him sin for our sake . '' Justice -isaia-_also brought to bear upon death , which from the beginning of man s history had_been allied to sin . Death has justice done to it -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of the death of the one_who was without sin and who alone was able by means of his_own death to inflict death upon death . In this_way the cross of Christ , on which_the Son , consubstantial with the Father , renders full justice to God , -isaia-_also a radical revelation of mercy , or rather of the love_that goes against what constitutes the very root of evil in the history of man : against sin and death . The cross -isaia-_the_most profound condescension of God to man and to what man especially in difficult and painful moments looks on as his unhappy destiny . The cross -isaia- like a touch of eternal love upon the most painful wounds of man s earthly existence ; it -isaia- the total fulfillment of the messianic program that Christ once formulated in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and then repeated to the messengers sent by John the Baptist . According to the words once written in the prophecy of Isaiah , this program consisted in the revelation of merciful love for the poor , the suffering and prisoners , for the blind , the oppressed and sinners . In the paschal_mystery the limits of the many sided evil in which_man becomes a sharer during his earthly existence are surpassed : the cross of Christ , in fact , makes us understand_the deepest roots of evil , which_are fixed in sin and death ; thus_the cross becomes an eschatological sign . Only in the eschatological fulfillment and definitive renewal of the world will love conquer , in all the elect , the deepest sources of evil , bringing as its fully mature fruit the kingdom of life and holiness and glorious immortality . The foundation of this eschatological fulfillment -isaia-_already contained in the cross of Christ and in His death . The fact_that Christ '' was raised the third day '' constitutes the final sign of the messianic mission , a sign that perfects the entire revelation of merciful love in a world that_-isaia- subject to evil . At the same_time it constitutes the sign that foretells '' a new heaven and a new earth , '' when God '' will wipe away every tear from their_eyes , there_will be no more death , or mourning no crying , nor pain , for the former things have passed away . '' In the eschatological fulfillment mercy will be revealed as love , while in the temporal phase , in human_history , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the history of sin and death , love must be revealed above all as mercy and must_also be actualized as mercy . Christ s messianic program , the program of mercy , becomes_the program of His people , the program of the Church . At its_very center there_-isaia- always the cross , for it -isaia- in the cross that the revelation of merciful love attains its culmination . Until '' the former things pass away , '' the cross will remain the point of reference for other_words too of the Revelation of John : '' Behold , I stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the door and knock ; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in and eat with_him and he with me . '' In a special_way , God also reveals His mercy when He invites man to have '' mercy '' on His only Son , the crucified one . Christ , precisely as the crucified one , -isaia- the Word that does_not pass away , and He -isaia-_the_one who stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the door and knocks -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every man , without restricting his freedom , but instead seeking to draw from this_very freedom love , which_-isaia-_not only an act of solidarity with the suffering Son of man , but_also a kind of '' mercy '' shown by each_one of us to the Son of the eternal Father . In the whole of this messianic program of Christ , in the whole revelation of mercy through the cross , could man s dignity be more highly respected and ennobled , for , in obtaining mercy , He -isaia- in a sense the one_who -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' shows mercy '' ? In a word , -isaia- not this_the position of Christ with_regard to man when He says : '' As you did it to one of the least of these . you did it to me '' ? Do not the words of the Sermon on the Mount : '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_shall obtain mercy , '' constitute , in a certain_sense , a synthesis of the whole of the Good News , of the whole of the '' wonderful exchange '' admirable commercium contained therein ? This exchange -isaia- a law of the very plan of salvation , a law which_-isaia- simple , strong and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' easy . '' Demonstrating from the very start what_the '' human_heart '' -isaia- capable of '' to be merciful '' , do not these_words from the Sermon on the Mount reveal in the same perspective the deep mystery of God : that inscrutable unity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit , in which love , containing justice , sets in motion mercy , which in its turn reveals the perfection of justice ? The Paschal Mystery -isaia- Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the summit of the revelation of the inscrutable mystery of God . It -isaia- precisely then that the words pronounced in the Upper Room are completely fulfilled : '' He who_has seen me has seen the Father . '' In fact , Christ , whom_the Father '' did_not spare '' for the sake of man and who in His passion and in the torment of the cross did_not obtain human mercy , has revealed in His resurrection the fullness of the love_that the Father has for Him and , in Him , for all people . '' He -isaia- not God of the dead , but of the living . '' In His resurrection Christ has revealed the God of merciful love , precisely_because He accepted the cross as the way to the resurrection . And it -isaia- for_this reason_that when we recall_the cross of Christ , His passion and death our_faith and hope are centered on the Risen One : on that Christ who '' on the evening of that day , the first day of the week , . stood among_them '' in the upper Room , '' where_the disciples were , . breathed on them , and said to them : Receive the Holy Spirit . If you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of any , they_are retained . '' Here -isaia- the Son of God , who in His resurrection experienced in a radical way mercy shown to Himself , that_-isaia- to say the love of the Father which_-isaia- more powerful than death . And it -isaia-_also the same Christ , the Son of God , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of His messianic mission and , in a certain_sense , even beyond_the end reveals Himself as the inexhaustible source of mercy , of the same love_that , in a subsequent perspective of the history_of_salvation in the Church , -isaia- to be everlastingly confirmed as more powerful than sin . The paschal Christ -isaia- the definitive incarnation of mercy , its living sign in salvation history and in eschatology . In the same_spirit , the liturgy of Eastertide places on our lips the words of the Psalm : Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo . Mother of Mercy These words of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- Easter re echo in the fullness of their prophetic content the words that Mary uttered during her visit to Elizabeth , the wife of Zechariah : '' His mercy -isaia- . from generation to generation . '' At the very moment of the Incarnation , these_words open up a new perspective of salvation history . After the resurrection of Christ , this perspective -isaia- new on both the historical and the eschatological level . From that_time onwards there_-isaia- a succession of new generations of individuals in the immense human_family , in ever_increasing dimensions ; there_-isaia-_also a succession of new generations of the People of God , marked with the Sign of the Cross and of the resurrection and '' sealed '' with the sign of the Paschal Mystery of Christ , the absolute revelation of the mercy that Mary proclaimed on the threshold of her kinswoman s house : '' His mercy -isaia- . from generation to generation . '' Mary -isaia-_also the one_who obtained mercy in a particular and exceptional way , as no other person has . At the same_time , still in an exceptional way , she made possible with the sacrifice of her_heart her_own sharing in revealing God s mercy . This sacrifice -isaia- intimately linked_with the cross of her Son , -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of which_she was to stand on Calvary . Her sacrifice -isaia- a unique sharing in the revelation of mercy , that_-isaia- , a sharing in the absolute fidelity of God to His own love , to the covenant that He willed from eternity and that He entered into in time with_man , with the people , with humanity ; it -isaia- a sharing in that revelation that_was definitively fulfilled through the cross . No one_has experienced , to the same degree as the Mother of the crucified One , the mystery of the cross , the overwhelming encounter of divine transcendent justice with love : that '' kiss '' given by mercy to justice . No one has_received into his_heart , as much as Mary did , that mystery , that truly divine dimension of the redemption effected on Calvary by means of the death of the Son , together_with_the sacrifice of her_maternal heart , together_with her definitive '' fiat . '' Mary , then , -isaia-_the_one who_has the deepest knowledge of the mystery of God s mercy . She knows its price , she knows how_great it -isaia- . In this_sense , we call her the Mother of mercy : our Lady of mercy , or Mother of divine mercy ; in each_one of these titles there_-isaia- a deep theological meaning , for they express the special preparation of her soul , of her whole personality , so that_she was able to perceive , through the complex events , first of Israel , then of every_individual and of the whole of humanity , that mercy of which '' from generation to generation '' people become sharers according to the eternal design of the most Holy Trinity . The above titles which we attribute to the Mother of God speak of her principally , however , as the Mother of the crucified and risen One ; as the One who , having obtained mercy in an exceptional way , in an equally exceptional way '' merits '' that mercy throughout her earthly life and , particularly , -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross of her Son ; and finally as the one_who , through_her hidden and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time incomparable sharing in the messianic mission of her Son , was called in a special_way to bring close to people that love_which He had come to reveal : the love_that finds_its most concrete expression vis a vis the suffering , the poor , those deprived of their_own freedom , the blind , the oppressed and sinners , just as Christ spoke of them in the words of the prophecy of Isaiah , first in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and then in response to the question of the messengers of John the Baptist . It was precisely this '' merciful '' love , which_-isaia- manifested above all in contact_with moral and physical evil , that the heart of her who was_the Mother of the crucified and risen One shared in singularly and exceptionally that Mary shared in . In her and through_her , this_love continues to be revealed in the history of the Church and of humanity . This revelation -isaia-_especially fruitful because in the Mother of God it -isaia- based upon the unique tact of her_maternal heart , on her particular sensitivity , on her particular fitness to reach all those_who most easily accept the merciful love of a mother . This -isaia- one of the great life_giving mysteries of Christianity , a mystery intimately connected_with_the mystery of the Incarnation . '' The motherhood of Mary in the order of grace , '' as the Second Vatican Council explains , '' lasts without interruption from the consent which_she faithfully gave -atti_degli_apostoli- the annunciation and which_she sustained without hesitation under the cross , until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect . In fact , being assumed into_heaven she_has not laid aside this office of salvation but by her manifold intercession she continues to obtain for us the graces of eternal_salvation . By her_maternal charity , she takes care of the brethren of her Son who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties , until they_are led into_their blessed home . FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION '' . An Image of Our Generation We have every right to believe_that our generation too was included in the words of the Mother of God when_she glorified that mercy shared in '' from generation to generation '' by those_who allow themselves to be guided by the fear of God . The words of Mary s Magnificat have a prophetic content that concerns not_only the past of Israel but_also the whole future of the People of God on earth . In fact , all of us now living on earth are the generation that_-isaia- aware of the approach of the third_millennium and that profoundly feels the change that_-isaia- occurring in history . The present generation knows that_it_-isaia- in a privileged position : progress provides it with countless possibilities that_only a few decades ago were undreamed of . Man s creative activity , his intelligence and his_work , have brought_about profound changes both in the field of science and technology and in that of social_and_cultural life . Man has extended his_power over nature and has acquired deeper knowledge of the laws of social behavior . He has seen the obstacles and distances between individuals and nations dissolve or shrink through an increased sense of what_-isaia- universal , through a clearer awareness of the unity of the human_race , through the acceptance of mutual dependence in authentic solidarity , and through the desire and possibility of making contact_with one s brothers_and_sisters beyond artificial geographical divisions and national or racial limits . Today s young_people , especially , know_that the progress of science and technology can produce not_only new material goods but_also a wider sharing in knowledge . The extraordinary progress made in the field of information and data processing , for instance , will increase man s creative capacity and provide access to the intellectual and cultural riches of other peoples . New communications techniques will encourage greater participation in events and a wider exchange of ideas . The achievements of biological , psychological and social science will_help man to understand better the riches of his_own being . It -isaia- true_that too_often this progress -isaia- still the privilege of the industrialized countries , but it cannot be denied that the prospect of enabling every people and every country to benefit from it has long ceased to be a mere utopia when there_-isaia- a real political desire_for it . But side by side with all this , or rather as part of it , there_are also the difficulties that appear whenever there_-isaia- growth . There -isaia- unease and a sense of powerlessness regarding the profound response that_man knows that he must give . The picture of the world today also contains shadows and imbalances that_are not_always merely superficial . The Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et spes of the Second Vatican Council -isaia- certainly not the only document that deals with the life of this generation , but_it_-isaia- a document of particular importance . '' The dichotomy affecting the modern_world , '' we read in it , '' -isaia- , , in fact , a symptom of a deeper dichotomy that_-isaia- in man_himself . He -isaia- the meeting point of many conflicting forces . In his condition as a created being he -isaia- subject to a thousand shortcomings , but feels untrammelled in his inclinations and destined for a higher form of life . Torn by a welter of anxieties he -isaia- compelled to choose between_them and repudiate some among_them . Worse still , feeble and sinful as he -isaia- , he often does the very thing he hates and does_not do what he wants . And so he feels himself divided , and the result -isaia- a host of discords in social_life . '' Towards the end of the introductory exposition we read : '' . in the face of modern developments there_-isaia- a growing body of men_who are asking the most fundamental of all questions or are glimpsing them_with a keener insight : What -isaia-_man ? What -isaia- the meaning of suffering , evil , death , which_have not_been eliminated by all this progress ? What -isaia- the purpose of these achievements , purchased -atti_degli_apostoli- so high a price ? '' In the span of the fifteen years since_the end of the Second Vatican Council , has this picture of tensions and threats that mark our epoch become less disquieting ? It seems not . On the contrary , the tensions and threats that in the Council document seem only to be outlined and not to manifest in depth all the dangers hidden within them have revealed themselves more_clearly in the space of these years ; they_have in a different way confirmed that danger , and do not permit us to cherish the illusions of the past . Sources of Uneasiness Thus , in our_world the feeling of being under threat -isaia- increasing . There -isaia- an increase of that existential fear connected especially , as I said in the encyclical Redemptor hominis , with the prospect of a conflict that in view of today s atomic stockpiles could mean the partial self destruction of humanity . But the threat does_not merely concern what human_beings can do to human_beings through the means provided by military technology ; it also concerns many_other dangers produced by a materialistic society_which in spite of '' humanistic '' declarations accepts the primacy of things over persons . Contemporary man , therefore , fears that by the use of the means invented by this type of society , individuals and the environment , communities , societies and nations can fall victim to the abuse of power by other individuals , environments and societies . The history of our century offers many examples of this . In spite of all the declarations on the rights of man in his integral dimension , that_-isaia- to say in his bodily and spiritual existence , we cannot say that_these examples belong only to the past . Man rightly fears falling victim to an oppression that_will deprive him of his interior freedom , of the possibility of expressing the truth of which he -isaia- convinced , of the faith_that he professes , of the ability to obey the voice of conscience that tells him the right path to follow . The technical means -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of modern society conceal within themselves not_only the possibility of self destruction through military conflict , but_also the possibility of a '' peaceful '' subjugation of individuals , of environments , of entire societies and of nations , that_for one reason or another might prove inconvenient for those_who possess the necessary means and are ready to use them without scruple . An instance -isaia- the continued existence of torture , systematically used by authority as a means of domination and political oppression and practiced by subordinates with impunity . Together with awareness of the biological threat , therefore , there_-isaia- a growing awareness of yet another threat , even_more destructive of what_-isaia- essentially human , what_-isaia- intimately bound up with the dignity of the person and his or her right to truth and freedom . All this_-isaia- happening against the background of the gigantic remorse caused by the fact_that , side by side with wealthy and surfeited people and societies , living in plenty and ruled by consumerism and pleasure , the same human_family contains individuals and groups that_are suffering from hunger . There are babies dying of hunger under their mothers eyes . In various parts_of_the_world , in various socio economic systems , there exist entire areas of poverty , shortage and underdevelopment . This fact -isaia- universally known . The state of inequality between individuals and between nations not_only still exists ; it -isaia- increasing . It still happens_that side by side with_those_who are wealthy and living in plenty there exist those_who_are living in want , suffering misery and often actually dying of hunger ; and their number reaches tens , even hundreds of millions . This -isaia- why moral uneasiness -isaia- destined to become even_more acute . It -isaia- obvious that a fundamental defect , or rather a series of defects , indeed a defective machinery -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of contemporary economics and materialistic civilization , which_does_not allow the human_family to break free_from such radically unjust situations . This picture of today_s_world in which there_-isaia- so much evil both physical and moral , so as to make of it a world entangled in contradictions and tensions , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time full of threats to human_freedom , conscience and religion this picture explains the uneasiness felt by contemporary man . This uneasiness -isaia- experienced not_only by those_who_are disadvantaged or oppressed , but_also by those_who possess the privileges of wealth , progress and power . And , although there_-isaia- no lack of people trying to understand_the causes of this uneasiness , or trying to react against it with the temporary means offered by technology , wealth or power , still in the very depth of the human spirit this uneasiness -isaia- stronger than all temporary means . This uneasiness concerns as the analyses of the Second Vatican Council rightly pointed_out the fundamental problems of all human_existence . It -isaia- linked_with the very sense of man s existence in the world , and -isaia- an uneasiness for the future of man and all humanity ; it demands decisive solutions , which now seem to be forcing themselves upon the human_race . Is Justice Enough ? It -isaia- not difficult to see_that in the modern_world the sense of justice has_been reawakening on a vast scale ; and without_doubt this emphasizes that_which goes against justice in relationships between individuals , social groups and '' classes , '' between individual peoples and states , and finally between whole political systems , indeed between what are_called '' worlds . '' This deep and varied trend , -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of which_the contemporary human conscience has placed justice , gives proof of the ethical character of the tensions and struggles pervading the world . The Church shares with the people of our_time this profound and ardent desire_for a life which_-isaia- just in every aspect , nor_does she fail to examine the various aspects of the sort of justice that the life of people and society demands . This -isaia- confirmed by the field of Catholic social_doctrine , greatly developed in the course of the last century . On the lines of this_teaching proceed the education and formation of human consciences in the spirit of justice , and also individual undertakings , especially in the sphere of the apostolate of the laity , which_are developing in precisely this_spirit . And yet , it would be difficult not to notice that_very often programs which start from the idea of justice and which ought to assist its fulfillment among individuals , groups and human societies , in practice suffer from distortions . Although they continue to appeal to the idea of justice , nevertheless experience shows_that other negative forces have gained the upper hand over justice , such as spite , hatred and even cruelty . In such cases , the desire to annihilate the enemy , limit his freedom , or even force him into total dependence , becomes_the fundamental motive for action ; and this contrasts with the essence of justice , which by its_nature tends to establish equality and harmony between_the parties in conflict . This kind of abuse of the idea of justice and the practical distortion of it show how far human action can deviate from justice itself , even when_it_-isaia- being undertaken in the name of justice . Not in vain did Christ challenge His listeners , faithful to the doctrine of the Old Testament , for their attitude which_was manifested in the words : An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . '' This was_the form of distortion of justice -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time ; and today s forms continue to be modeled on it . It -isaia- obvious , in fact , that in the name of an alleged justice for example , historical justice or class justice the neighbor -isaia- sometimes destroyed , killed , deprived of liberty or stripped of fundamental human_rights . The experience of the past and of our own_time demonstrates that justice alone -isaia-_not_enough , that it can even lead to the negation and destruction of itself , if that deeper power , which_-isaia- love , -isaia- not allowed to shape human_life in its various dimensions . It has_been precisely historical experience that , among other_things , has led to the formulation of the saying : summum ius , summa iniuria . This statement does_not detract from the value of justice and does_not minimize the significance of the order that_-isaia- based upon it ; it only indicates , under another aspect , the need to draw from the powers of the spirit_which condition the very order of justice , powers which_are still_more profound . The Church , having before her eyes the picture of the generation to which we belong , shares the uneasiness of so many of the people of our_time . Moreover , one cannot_fail to be worried by the decline of many fundamental values , which constitute an unquestionable good not_only_for Christian morality but simply for_human morality , for moral culture : these values include respect_for human_life from the moment of conception , respect_for marriage in its indissoluble unity , and respect_for the stability of the family . Moral permissiveness strikes especially -atti_degli_apostoli- this_most sensitive sphere of life and society . Hand in hand with this go the crisis of truth in human relationships , lack of responsibility_for what one says , the purely utilitarian relationship_between individual and individual , the loss of a sense of the authentic common_good and the ease with which_this good -isaia- alienated . Finally , there_-isaia- the '' desacralization '' that often turns into '' dehumanization '' : the individual and the society for_whom nothing_-isaia- '' sacred '' suffer moral decay , in spite of appearances . THE MERCY OF GOD IN THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH In connection_with this picture of our generation , a picture which_cannot fail to cause profound anxiety , there come to mind once_more those words_which , by reason of the Incarnation of the Son of God , resounded in Mary s Magnificat , and which sing of '' mercy from generation to generation . '' The Church of our_time , constantly pondering the eloquence of these inspired words , and applying them to the sufferings of the great human_family , must become more particularly and profoundly conscious of the need to bear_witness in her whole mission to God s mercy , following in the footsteps of the tradition of the Old and the New Covenant , and above all of Jesus Christ Himself and His Apostles . The Church must bear_witness to the mercy of God revealed in Christ , in the whole of His mission as Messiah , professing it in the first_place as a salvific truth of faith and as necessary_for a life in harmony_with faith , and then seeking to introduce it and to make it incarnate in the lives both of her faithful and as far_as_possible in the lives of all people_of_good_will . Finally , the Church professing mercy and remaining always faithful to it has the right and the duty to call_upon the mercy of God , imploring it in the face of all the manifestations of physical and moral evil , before all the threats that cloud the whole horizon of the life of humanity today . The Church Professes the Mercy of God and Proclaims It The Church must profess and proclaim God s mercy in all its truth , as it has_been handed_down to us by revelation . We have sought , in the foregoing pages of the present document , to give -atti_degli_apostoli- least an outline of this_truth , which finds such rich expression in the whole of Sacred Scripture and in Sacred Tradition . In the daily_life of the Church the truth_about the mercy of God , expressed in the Bible , resounds as a perennial echo through the many readings of the Sacred Liturgy . The authentic sense of faith of the People of God perceives this_truth , as -isaia- shown by various expressions of personal and community piety . It would of course be difficult to give a list or summary of them all , since most of them are vividly inscribed in the depths of people s hearts and minds . Some theologians affirm that mercy -isaia- the greatest of the attributes and perfections of God , and the Bible , Tradition and the whole faith life of the People of God provide particular proofs of this . It -isaia- not a question here of the perfection of the inscrutable essence of God in the mystery of the divinity itself , but of the perfection and attribute whereby man , in the intimate truth of his existence , encounters the living God particularly closely and particularly often . In harmony_with Christ s words to Philip , the '' vision of the Father '' a vision of God through_faith finds precisely in the encounter_with His mercy a unique moment of interior simplicity and truth , similar to that_which we discover in the parable of the prodigal son . '' He who_has seen me has seen the Father . '' The Church professes the mercy of God , the Church lives by it in her wide experience of faith and also in her teaching , constantly contemplating Christ , concentrating on Him , on His life and on His Gospel , on His cross and resurrection , on His whole mystery . Everything that forms the '' vision '' of Christ in the Church s living faith and teaching brings us nearer to the '' vision of the Father '' in the holiness of His mercy . The Church seems in a particular_way to profess the mercy of God and to venerate it when_she directs herself to the Heart of Christ . In fact , it -isaia- precisely this drawing close to Christ in the mystery of His Heart which enables us to dwell on this_point a point in a sense central and also most accessible on the human level of the revelation of the merciful love of the Father , a revelation which constituted the central content of the messianic mission of the Son of Man . The Church lives an authentic life when_she professes and proclaims mercy the most stupendous attribute of the Creator and of the Redeemer and when_she brings people close to the sources of the Savior s mercy , of which she_-isaia- the trustee and dispenser . Of great significance in this area -isaia- constant meditation on the Word of God , and above all conscious and mature participation in the Eucharist and in the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation . The Eucharist brings us ever nearer to that_love which_-isaia- more powerful than death : '' For as often as we eat this bread and drink this cup , '' we proclaim not_only the death of the Redeemer but_also His resurrection , '' until he comes '' in glory . The same Eucharistic rite , celebrated in memory of Him who in His messianic mission revealed the Father to us by means of His words and His cross , attests to the inexhaustible love by virtue of which He desires always to be united with us and present in our midst , coming to meet every_human heart . It -isaia- the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation that prepares the way_for each_individual , even_those weighed down with_great faults . In this_sacrament each_person can experience mercy in a unique way , that_-isaia- , the love which_-isaia- more powerful than sin . This has_already_been spoken of in the encyclical Redemptor hominis ; but it will be fitting to return once_more to this fundamental theme . It -isaia- precisely_because sin exists in the world , which '' God so loved . that he gave_his only Son , '' that God , who '' -isaia- love , '' cannot reveal Himself otherwise than as mercy . This corresponds not_only to the most profound truth of that love_which God -isaia- , but_also to the whole interior truth of man and of the world which_-isaia- man s temporary homeland . Mercy in itself , as a perfection of the infinite God , -isaia-_also infinite . Also infinite therefore and inexhaustible -isaia- the Father s readiness to receive the prodigal children who return to His home . Infinite are the readiness and power of forgiveness which flow continually from the marvelous value of the sacrifice of the Son . No human sin can prevail over this_power or even limit it . On the part of man only a lack of good_will can limit it , a lack of readiness to be converted and to repent , in other_words persistence in obstinacy , opposing grace and truth , especially in the face of the witness of the cross and resurrection of Christ . Therefore , the Church professes and proclaims conversion . Conversion to God always consists in discovering His mercy , that_-isaia- , in discovering that_love which_-isaia- patient and kind as only the Creator and Father can be ; the love to which_the '' God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ '' -isaia- faithful to the uttermost consequences in the history of His covenant with_man ; even to the cross and to the death_and_resurrection of the Son . Conversion to God -isaia- always the fruit of the '' rediscovery of this Father , who_-isaia- rich in mercy . Authentic knowledge of the God of mercy , the God of tender love , -isaia- a constant and inexhaustible source of conversion , not_only as a momentary interior act but_also as a permanent attitude , as a state of mind . Those who come to know God in this_way , who '' see '' Him in this_way , can live only in a state of being continually converted to Him . They live , therefore , in statu conversionis ; and it -isaia- this state of conversion which marks out the most profound element of the pilgrimage of every man_and_woman on earth in statu viatoris . It -isaia- obvious that the Church professes the mercy of God , revealed in the crucified and risen Christ , not_only by the word of her teaching but_above all through the deepest pulsation of the life of the whole People of God . By means of this testimony of life , the Church fulfills the mission proper to the People of God , the mission which_-isaia- a sharing in and , in a sense , a continuation of the messianic mission of Christ Himself . The contemporary Church -isaia- profoundly conscious that_only on the basis of the mercy of God will she be able to carry_out the tasks that derive from the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , and , in the first_place , the ecumenical task which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- uniting all those_who confess Christ . As she makes many efforts in this direction , the Church confesses with humility that_only that_love which_-isaia- more powerful than the weakness of human divisions can definitively bring_about that unity_which Christ implored from the Father and which_the Spirit never ceases to beseech for us '' with sighs too deep for words . The Church Seeks To Put Mercy into Practice Jesus Christ taught that_man not_only receives and experiences the mercy of God , but that_he_-isaia- also called '' to practice mercy '' towards others : '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_shall obtain mercy . '' The Church sees in these_words a call to action , and she tries to practice mercy . All the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount indicate the way of conversion and of reform of life , but the one referring to those_who_are merciful -isaia- particularly eloquent in this_regard . Man attains to the merciful love of God , His mercy , to the extent_that he himself_-isaia- interiorly transformed in the spirit of that_love towards his neighbor . This authentically evangelical process -isaia- not_just a spiritual transformation realized once and for all : it -isaia- a whole lifestyle , an essential and continuous characteristic of the Christian vocation . It consists in the constant discovery and persevering practice of love as a unifying and also elevating power despite all difficulties of a psychological or social nature : it -isaia-_a_question , in fact , of a merciful love_which , by its essence , -isaia- a creative love . In reciprocal relationships between persons merciful love_-isaia- never a unilateral act or process . Even in the cases in which everything would seem to indicate that_only one party -isaia- giving and offering , and the other only receiving and taking for example , in the case of a physician giving treatment , a teacher teaching , parents supporting and bringing up their_children , a benefactor helping the needy , in reality the one who_gives -isaia- always also a beneficiary . In any case , he too can easily find himself in the position of the one_who receives , who obtains a benefit , who experiences merciful love ; he too can_find himself_the object of mercy . In this_sense Christ crucified -isaia- for us the loftiest model , inspiration and encouragement . When we base ourselves on this disquieting model , we are_able with all humility to show mercy to others , knowing that Christ accepts it as if it were shown to Himself . On the basis of this model , we must_also continually purify all our actions and all our intentions in which mercy -isaia- understood and practiced in a unilateral way , as a good done to others . An act of merciful love_-isaia- only really such when we are deeply convinced -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment that we perform it that we are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time receiving mercy from the people_who_are accepting it from us . If this bilateral and reciprocal quality -isaia- absent , our actions are_not yet true acts of mercy , nor has there yet been fully completed in us that conversion to which Christ has shown us the way by His words and example , even to the cross , nor are we yet sharing fully in the magnificent source of merciful love that_has_been revealed to us by Him . Thus , the way which Christ showed to us in the Sermon on the Mount with the beatitude regarding those_who_are merciful -isaia- much richer than what we sometimes find in ordinary human opinions about mercy . These opinions see mercy as a unilateral act or process , presupposing and maintaining a certain distance between_the one practicing mercy and the one benefitting from it , between_the one who_does good and the one_who receives it . Hence the attempt to free interpersonal and social relationships from mercy and to base them solely on justice . However , such opinions about mercy fail to see the fundamental link between mercy and justice spoken of by the whole biblical tradition , and above all by the messianic mission of Jesus Christ . True mercy -isaia- , so to speak , the most profound source of justice . If justice -isaia- in itself suitable for '' arbitration '' between people concerning the reciprocal distribution of objective goods in an equitable manner , love and only love including that kindly love_that we call '' mercy '' -isaia- capable of restoring man to Himself . Mercy that_-isaia- truly Christian -isaia-_also , in a certain_sense , the most perfect incarnation of '' equality '' between people , and therefore also the most perfect incarnation of justice as well , insofar as justice aims -atti_degli_apostoli- the same result in its_own sphere . However , the equality brought by justice -isaia- limited to the realm of objective and extrinsic goods , while love and mercy bring it about_that people meet one_another in that value which_-isaia- man_himself , with the dignity that_-isaia- proper to him . At the same_time , '' equality '' of people through '' patient and kind '' love does_not take away differences : the person_who gives becomes more generous when he feels -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time benefitted by the person accepting his gift ; and vice versa , the person_who accepts the gift with the awareness_that , in accepting it , he too -isaia- doing good -isaia- in his_own way serving the great cause of the dignity of the person ; and this contributes to uniting people in a more profound manner . Thus , mercy becomes an indispensable element for shaping mutual relationships between people , in a spirit of deepest respect_for what_-isaia- human , and in a spirit of mutual brotherhood . It -isaia- impossible to establish this bond_between people , if they wish to regulate their mutual relationships solely according to the measure of justice . In every sphere of interpersonal relationships justice must , so to speak , be '' corrected '' to a considerable extent by that love_which , as St . Paul proclaims , '' -isaia- patient and kind '' or , in other_words , possesses the characteristics of that merciful love which_-isaia- so much of the essence of the Gospel and Christianity . Let us remember , furthermore , that merciful love also means the cordial tenderness and sensitivity so eloquently spoken of in the parable of the prodigal son , and also in the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin . Consequently , merciful love_-isaia- supremely indispensable between those_who_are closest to one_another : between husbands and wives , between parents and children , between friends ; and it -isaia- indispensable in education and in pastoral_work . Its sphere of action , however , -isaia- not limited to this . If Paul VI more_than_once indicated the civilization of love '' as the goal towards which all efforts in the cultural and social fields as well as in the economic and political fields should tend . it must be added that_this good will_never be reached if in our thinking and acting concerning the vast and complex spheres of human_society we stop -atti_degli_apostoli- the criterion of '' an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth '' and do not try to transform it in its essence , by complementing it with another spirit . Certainly , the Second Vatican Council also leads us in this direction , when it speaks repeatedly of the need to make_the world more_human , and says_that the realization of this_task -isaia- precisely_the mission of the Church in the modern_world . Society can become ever more_human only if we introduce into the many sided setting of interpersonal and social relationships , not merely justice , but also_that '' merciful love '' which constitutes the messianic message of the Gospel . Society can become '' ever more_human '' only_when we introduce into all the mutual relationships which form its moral aspect the moment of forgiveness , which_-isaia- so much of the essence of the Gospel . Forgiveness demonstrates the presence in the world of the love which_-isaia- more powerful than sin . Forgiveness -isaia-_also the fundamental condition_for reconciliation , not_only in the relationship of God with_man , but_also in relationships between people . A world from which forgiveness was eliminated would be nothing but a world of cold and unfeeling justice , in the name of which each_person would claim his or her_own rights vis a vis others ; the various kinds of selfishness latent in man would transform life and human_society into a system of oppression of the weak by the strong , or into an arena of permanent strife between one group and another . For this_reason , the Church must consider it one of her principal duties -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of history and especially in our modern age to proclaim and to introduce into life the mystery of mercy , supremely revealed in Jesus Christ . Not only_for the Church herself as the community of believers but_also in a certain_sense for all humanity , this_mystery -isaia-_the_source of a life different from the life_which can be built by man , who_-isaia- exposed to the oppressive forces of the threefold concupiscence active within him . It -isaia- precisely in the name of this_mystery that Christ teaches us to forgive always . How often we repeat the words of the prayer which He Himself taught us , asking '' forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those_who trespass against us , '' which means those_who_are guilty of something in our regard It -isaia- indeed difficult to express the profound value of the attitude which these_words describe and inculcate . How many things these_words say to every_individual about others and also about himself . The consciousness of being trespassers against each_other goes hand in hand with the call to fraternal solidarity , which St . Paul expressed in his concise exhortation to '' forbear one_another in love . '' What a lesson of humility -isaia- to be found here with_regard to man , with_regard both to one s neighbor and to oneself What a school of good_will for daily living , in the various conditions of our existence If we were to ignore this lesson , what would remain of any '' humanist '' program of life and education ? Christ emphasizes so insistently the need to forgive others that_when Peter asked Him how_many times he should forgive his neighbor He answered with the symbolic number of '' seventy times seven , '' meaning that he must be able to forgive everyone every time . It -isaia- obvious that_such a generous requirement of forgiveness does_not cancel out the objective requirements of justice . Properly understood , justice constitutes , so to speak , the goal of forgiveness . In no passage of the Gospel message does forgiveness , or mercy as its source , mean indulgence towards evil , towards scandals , towards injury or insult . In any case , reparation for evil and scandal , compensation for injury , and satisfaction for insult are conditions for forgiveness . Thus the fundamental structure of justice always enters into the sphere of mercy . Mercy , however , has the power to confer on justice a new content , which_-isaia- expressed most simply and fully in forgiveness . Forgiveness , in fact , shows_that , over and above the process of '' compensation '' and '' truce '' which_-isaia- specific to justice , love_-isaia- necessary , so that_man may affirm himself as man . Fulfillment of the conditions of justice -isaia-_especially indispensable in order_that love may reveal its_own nature . In analyzing the parable of the prodigal son , we have_already called attention to the fact_that he who forgives and he who_-isaia- forgiven encounter one_another -atti_degli_apostoli- an essential point , namely the dignity or essential value of the person , a point which_cannot be lost and the affirmation of which , or its rediscovery , -isaia- a source of the greatest joy . The Church rightly considers it her duty and the purpose of her_mission to guard the authenticity of forgiveness , both in life and behavior and in educational and pastoral_work . She protects it simply by guarding its source , which_-isaia- the mystery of the mercy of God Himself as revealed in Jesus Christ . The basis of the Church s mission , in all the spheres spoken of in the numerous pronouncements of the most recent Council and in the centuries old experience of the apostolate , -isaia- none other_than '' drawing from the wells of the Savior '' this_-isaia-_what provides many guidelines for the mission of the Church in the lives of individual Christians , of individual communities , and also of the whole People of God . This '' drawing from the wells of the Savior '' can be done only in the spirit of that poverty to which_we_are called by the words and example of the Lord : '' You received without pay , give without pay . '' Thus , in all the ways of the Church s life and ministry through the evangelical poverty of her ministers and stewards and of the whole_people which bears_witness to '' the mighty works '' of its Lord the God who_-isaia- '' rich in mercy '' has been_made still more_clearly manifest . THE PRAYER OF THE CHURCH IN OUR TIMES . The Church Appeals to the Mercy of God The Church proclaims_the truth of God s mercy revealed in the crucified and risen Christ , and she professes it in various_ways . Furthermore , she seeks to practice mercy towards people through people , and she sees in this an indispensable condition_for solicitude for a better and '' more_human '' world , today and tomorrow . However , -atti_degli_apostoli- no time and in no historical period especially -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment as critical as our_own can the Church forget the prayer that_-isaia- a cry for the mercy of God amid the many forms of evil which weigh upon humanity and threaten it . Precisely this_-isaia- the fundamental right and duty of the Church in Christ Jesus , her right and duty towards God and towards humanity . The more the human conscience succumbs to secularization , loses its sense of the very meaning of the word '' mercy , '' moves away from God and distances itself from the mystery of mercy , the more the Church has the right and the duty to appeal to the God of mercy '' with loud cries . '' These '' loud cries '' should be the mark of the Church of our_times , cries uttered to God to implore His mercy , the certain manifestation of which_she professes and proclaims as having already come in Jesus crucified and risen , that_-isaia- , in the Paschal Mystery . It -isaia- this_mystery which bears within itself the most complete revelation of mercy , that_-isaia- , of that_love which_-isaia- more powerful than death , more powerful than sin and every evil , the love_which lifts man up when he falls into the abyss and frees him from the greatest threats . Modern man feels these threats . What has been_said above in this_regard -isaia- only a rough outline . Modern man often anxiously wonders about the solution to the terrible tensions which_have built up in the world and which entangle humanity . And if -atti_degli_apostoli- times he lacks the courage to utter the word '' mercy , '' or if in his conscience empty of religious content he does_not find the equivalent , so much greater -isaia- the need_for the Church to utter his_word , not_only in her_own name but_also in the name of all the men_and_women of our_time . Everything that I have_said in the present document on mercy should therefore be continually transformed into an ardent prayer : into a cry that implores mercy according to the needs of man in the modern_world . May this cry be full of that truth_about mercy which_has found such rich expression in Sacred Scripture and in Tradition , as also in the authentic life of faith of countless generations of the People of God . With this cry let us , like the sacred writers , call_upon the God who cannot despise anything that He has made , the God who_-isaia- faithful to Himself , to His fatherhood and His love . And , like the prophets , let us appeal to that love_which has maternal characteristics and which , like a mother , follows each of her_children , each lost sheep , even if they_should number millions , even if in the world evil should prevail over goodness , even if contemporary humanity should deserve a new '' flood '' on account of its sins , as once the generation of Noah did . Let us have_recourse to that fatherly love revealed to us by Christ in His messianic mission , a love_which reached its culmination in His cross , in His death_and_resurrection . Let us have_recourse to God through Christ , mindful of the words of Mary s Magnificat , which proclaim mercy '' from generation to generation . '' Let us implore God s mercy for the present generation . May the Church which , following_the_example of Mary , also seeks to be the spiritual mother of mankind , express in this_prayer her_maternal solicitude and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time her confident love , that_love from which_-isaia- born the most burning need_for prayer . Let us offer up our petitions , directed by the faith , by the hope , and by the charity_which Christ has planted in our_hearts . This attitude -isaia- likewise love of God , whom modern man_has sometimes separated far from himself , made extraneous to himself , proclaiming in various_ways that God -isaia- '' superfluous . '' This -isaia- , therefore , love of God , the insulting rejection of whom by modern man we feel profoundly , and we are ready to cry out with Christ on the cross : '' Father , forgive them ; for they know not what_they do . '' At the same_time it -isaia- love of people , of all men_and_women without_any exception or division : without difference of race , culture , language , or world outlook , without distinction between friends and enemies . This -isaia- love for people it desires every true good for each_individual and for every_human community , every family , every nation , every social group , for young_people , adults , parents , the elderly a love for everyone , without exception . This -isaia- love , or rather an anxious solicitude to ensure for each_individual every true good and to remove and drive away every sort of evil . And , if any of our contemporaries do not share the faith and hope which lead me , as a servant of Christ and steward of the mysteries of God , to implore God s mercy for_humanity in this hour of history , let_them -atti_degli_apostoli- least try to understand_the reason_for my concern . It -isaia- dictated by love for_man , for all that_-isaia- human and which , according to the intuitions of many of our contemporaries , -isaia- threatened by an immense danger . The mystery of Christ , which reveals to us the great vocation of man and which led me to emphasize in the encyclical Redemptor hominis his incomparable dignity , also obliges me to proclaim mercy as God s merciful love , revealed in that_same mystery of Christ . It likewise obliges me to have_recourse to that mercy and to beg for it -atti_degli_apostoli- this difficult , critical phase of the history of the Church and of the world , as we approach the end of the second millennium . In the name of Jesus Christ crucified and risen , in the spirit of His messianic mission , enduring in the history of humanity , we raise our voices and pray that the Love which_-isaia- in the Father may once_again be revealed -atti_degli_apostoli- this stage of history , and that , through the work of the Son and Holy Spirit , it may be shown to be present in our modern_world and to be more powerful than evil : more powerful than sin and death . We pray for_this through the intercession of her who_does_not cease to proclaim '' mercy . from generation to generation , '' and also through the intercession of those for_whom there have_been completely fulfilled the words of the Sermon on the Mount : '' Blessed are the merciful , for they_shall obtain mercy . '' In continuing the great task of implementing the Second Vatican Council , in which we can rightly see a new phase of the self realization of the Church in keeping_with_the epoch in which it has_been our destiny to live the Church herself must be constantly guided by the full consciousness that in this_work it -isaia- not permissible for_her , for_any reason , to withdraw into herself . The reason_for her existence -isaia- , in fact , to reveal God , that Father who allows us to '' see '' Him in Christ . No matter how strong the resistance of human_history may be , no matter how marked the diversity of contemporary civilization , no matter how_great the denial of God in the human world , so much the greater must be the Church s closeness to that mystery which , hidden for centuries in God , was then truly shared with_man , in time , through Jesus Christ . With my apostolic_blessing . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the thirtieth day of November , the First Sunday of Advent , in the year , the third of the pontificate . Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et spes , no . Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et spes , no . In describing mercy , the books of the Old Testament use two expressions in particular , each having a different semantic nuance . First there_-isaia- the term hesed , which indicates a profound attitude of '' goodness . '' When this_-isaia- established between two individuals , they_do_not just wish each_other well ; they are_also faithful to each_other by virtue of an interior commitment , and therefore also by virtue of a faithfulness to themselves . Since hesed also means '' grace '' or '' love , '' this occurs precisely on the basis of this fidelity . The fact_that the commitment in question has not_only a moral character but almost a juridical one makes no difference . When in the Old Testament the word hesed -isaia- used of the Lord , this always occurs in connection_with the covenant that God established with Israel . This covenant was , on God s part , a gift and a grace for Israel . Nevertheless , since , in harmony_with_the covenant entered into , God had made a commitment to respect it , hesed also acquired in a certain_sense a legal content . The juridical commitment on God s part ceased to oblige whenever Israel broke the covenant and did_not respect its conditions . But precisely -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , hesed , in ceasing to be a juridical obligation , revealed its deeper aspect : it showed itself as what it was -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , that_-isaia- , as love_that gives , love more powerful than betrayal , grace stronger than sin . This fidelity vis a vis the unfaithful '' daughter of my people '' cf . : , -isaia- , in brief , on God s part , fidelity to Himself . This becomes obvious in the frequent recurrence together of the two terms hesed we e met grace and fidelity , which_could be considered a case of hendiadys cf . '' It -isaia- not_for your sake , O house of Israel , that I -amos- about to act , but_for the sake of my holy name '' Ez . Therefore Israel , although burdened with guilt for having broken the covenant , cannot lay claim to God s hesed on the basis of legal justice ; yet it can and must go on hoping and trusting to obtain it , since_the God of the covenant -isaia- really '' responsible_for his_love . '' The fruits of this_love are forgiveness and restoration to grace , the reestablishment of the interior covenant . The second word which in the terminology of the Old Testament serves to define mercy -isaia- rahamim . This has a different nuance from that of hesed . While hesed highlights the marks of fidelity to self and of '' responsibility_for one_s_own love '' which_are in a certain_sense masculine characteristics , rahamim , in its_very root , denotes the love of a mother rehem mother s womb . From the deep and original bond indeed the unity that links a mother to her child there springs a particular relationship to the child , a particular love . Of this_love one_can say that_it_-isaia- completely gratuitous , not merited , and that in this aspect it constitutes an interior necessity : an exigency of the heart . It -isaia- , as it were , a '' feminine '' variation of the masculine fidelity to self expressed by hesed . Against this psychological background , rahamim generates a whole range of feelings , including goodness and tenderness , patience and understanding , that_-isaia- , readiness to forgive . The Old Testament attributes to the Lord precisely these characteristics when it uses the term rahamim in speaking of Him . We read in Isaiah : '' Can a woman forget her suckling child , that_she should_have no compassion on the son of her womb ? Even these may forget , yet I will_not forget you '' Is . This love , faithful and invincible thanks to the mysterious power of motherhood , -isaia- expressed in the Old Testament texts in various_ways : as salvation from dangers , especially from enemies ; also as forgiveness of sins of individuals and also of the whole of Israel ; and finally in readiness to fulfill the eschatological promise and hope , in spite of human infidelity , as we read in Hosea : '' I will heal their faithlessness , I will love them freely '' Hos . In the terminology of the Old Testament we also find other expressions , referring in different_ways to the same basic content . But the two terms mentioned above deserve special_attention . They clearly show their original anthropomorphic aspect : in describing God s mercy , the biblical authors use terms that correspond to the consciousness and experience of their contemporaries . The Greek terminology in the Septuagint translation does_not show as great a wealth as the Hebrew : therefore it does_not offer all the semantic nuances proper to the original text . At any rate , the New Testament builds upon the wealth and depth that already marked the Old . In this_way , we have inherited from the Old Testament as it were in a special synthesis not_only the wealth of expressions used by those books in order to define God s mercy , but_also a specific and obviously anthropomorphic '' psychology '' of God : the image of His anxious love_,_which in contact_with evil , and in particular with the sin of the individual and of the people , -isaia- manifested as mercy . This image -isaia- made up not_only of the rather general content of the verb hanan but_also of the content of hesed and rahamim . The term hanan expresses a wider concept : it means in fact the manifestation of grace , which involves , so to speak , a constant predisposition to be generous , benevolent and merciful . In addition to these basic semantic elements , the Old Testament concept of mercy -isaia-_also made up of what_-isaia- included in the verb hamal , which literally means '' to spare '' a defeated enemy but_also '' to show mercy and compassion , '' and in consequence forgiveness and remission of guilt . There -isaia-_also the term hus , which expresses pity and compassion , but especially in the affective sense . These terms appear more rarely in the biblical texts to denote mercy . In addition , one_must note the word emet already mentioned : it means primarily '' solidity , security '' in the Greek of the Septuagint : '' truth '' and then '' fidelity , '' land in this_way it seems to link up with the semantic content proper to the term hesed . In both places it -isaia- a case of hesed , i . , the fidelity that God manifests to His own love for the people , fidelity to he promises that_will find_their definitive fulfillment precisely in the motherhood of the Mother of God cf . Here too it -isaia- a case of mercy in the meaning of hesed , insofar as in the following sentences , in which Zechariah speaks of the '' tender mercy of our God , '' there_-isaia- clearly expressed the second meaning , namely , rahamim Latin translation : viscera misericordiae , which rather identifies God s mercy with a mother s love . the liturgy of the Easter Vigil : the Exsultet .

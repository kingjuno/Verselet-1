The Church professes her faith in the Holy Spirit as '' the Lord , the giver of life . '' She professes this in the Creed which_-isaia- called Nicene Constantinopolitan from the name of the two Councils of Nicaea A . -atti_degli_apostoli- which it was formulated or promulgated . It also contains the statement that the Holy Spirit '' has spoken through the Prophets . '' These are words_which the Church receives from the very source of her faith , Jesus Christ . In fact , according to the Gospel of John , the Holy Spirit -isaia- given to us with the new_life , as Jesus foretells and promises on the great day of the Feast of Tabernacles : '' If any_one thirst let_him come to me and drink . He who believeth in me as the scripture has said , Out of his_heart shall flow rivers of living water . '' And the Evangelist explains : '' This he said about the Spirit , which those_who believed in him were to receive . '' It -isaia-_the_same simile of water which Jesus uses in his conversation with the Samaritan woman , when he speaks of '' a spring of water welling up to eternal_life , '' and in his conversation with Nicodemus when he speaks of the need_for a new birth '' of water and the Holy Spirit '' in order to '' enter_the kingdom of God . '' The Church , therefore , instructed by the words of Christ , and drawing on the experience of Pentecost and her_own apostolic history , has proclaimed since_the earliest centuries her faith in the Holy Spirit , as the giver of life , the one in whom_the inscrutable Triune God communicates himself to human_beings , constituting in them the source of eternal_life . This faith , uninterruptedly professed by the Church , needs to be constantly reawakened and deepened in the consciousness of the People of God . In the course of the last hundred years this has_been done several times : by Leo XIII , who published the Encyclical Epistle Divinum Illud Munus entirely devoted to the Holy Spirit ; by Pius XII , who in the Encyclical Letter Mystici Corporis spoke of the Holy Spirit as the vital principle of the Church , in which he works in union with the Head of the Mystical Body , Christ ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council which brought out the need_for a new study of the doctrine on the Holy Spirit , as Paul VI emphasized : '' The Christology and particularly the ecclesiology of the Council must be succeeded by a new study of and devotion to the Holy Spirit , precisely as the indispensable complement to the teaching of the Council . '' In our_own age , then , we are_called anew by the ever ancient and ever_new faith of the Church , to draw near to the Holy Spirit as the giver of life . In this we are helped and stimulated also by the heritage we share_with the Oriental Churches , which_have jealously guarded the extraordinary riches of the teachings of the Fathers on the Holy Spirit . For this_reason too we can say that one_of_the_most important ecclesial events of recent_years has been_the Sixteenth Centenary of the First Council of Constantinople , celebrated simultaneously in Constantinople and Rome on the Solemnity of Pentecost in . The Holy Spirit was then better seen , through a meditation on the mystery of the Church , as the one_who points_out the ways leading to the union of Christians , indeed as the supreme source of this_unity , which_comes_from God himself and to which St . Paul gave a particular expression in the words_which are frequently used to begin the Eucharistic liturgy : '' The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all . '' In a certain_sense , my previous Encyclicals Redemptor Hominis and Dives in Misericordia took their origin and inspiration from this_exhortation , celebrating as they do the event of our_salvation accomplished in the Son , sent by the Father into_the_world '' that_the_world might be saved through_him '' and '' every tongue confess that Jesus Christ -isaia- Lord , to the glory of God the Father . '' From this_exhortation now comes the present Encyclical on the Holy Spirit , who proceeds from the Father and the Son ; with the Father and the Son he -isaia- adored and glorified : a divine Person , he -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the center of the Christian faith and -isaia-_the_source and dynamic power of the Church s renewal . The Encyclical has_been drawn_from the heart of the heritage of the Council . For the Conciliar texts , thanks to their teaching on the Church in herself and the Church in the world , move us to penetrate ever deeper into the Trinitarian mystery of God himself , through the Gospels , the Fathers and the liturgy : to the Father , through Christ , in the Holy Spirit . In this_way the Church -isaia-_also responding to certain deep desires which_she believes she_can discern in people s hearts today : a fresh discovery of God in his transcendent reality as the infinite Spirit , just as Jesus presents him to the Samaritan woman ; the need to adore him '' in spirit and truth '' ; the hope of finding in him the secret of love and the power of a '' new creation '' : yes , precisely_the giver of life . The Church feels herself called to this_mission of proclaiming the Spirit , while together_with_the human_family she approaches the end of the second Millennium after Christ . Against the background of a heaven and earth which_will '' pass away , '' she knows well that '' the words_which will_not pass away '' acquire a particular eloquence . They are the words of Christ about the Holy Spirit , the inexhaustible source of the '' water welling up to eternal_life , '' as truth and saving grace . Upon these_words she wishes to reflect , to these_words she wishes to call the attention of believers and of all people , as she prepares to celebrate as will be said later on the great Jubilee which_will mark the passage from the second to the third Christian Millennium . Naturally , the considerations that follow do not aim to explore exhaustively the extremely rich doctrine on the Holy Spirit , nor to favor any particular solution of questions which are_still open . Their main purpose -isaia- to develop in the Church the awareness_that '' she_-isaia- compelled by the Holy Spirit to do her part towards_the full realization of the will of God , who_has established Christ as the source of salvation for the whole_world . '' PART I THE SPIRIT OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON , GIVEN TO THE CHURCH . Jesus Promise and Revelation -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper . When the time for Jesus to leave this_world had almost come , he told the Apostles of '' another Counselor . '' The evangelist John , who_was present , writes that , during the Last Supper before the day of his Passion and Death , Jesus addressed the Apostles with these_words : '' Whatever you ask in my name , I will do it , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . I will pray the Father , and he will_give you another Counselor , to be with you forever , even the Spirit of truth . '' It -isaia- precisely this Spirit of truth whom Jesus calls the Paraclete and parakletos means '' counselor , '' and also '' intercessor , '' or '' advocate . '' And he says_that the Paraclete -isaia- '' another '' Counselor , the second one , since he , Jesus himself , -isaia-_the_first Counselor , being the first bearer and giver of the Good News . The Holy Spirit comes after him and because of him , in order to continue in the world , through the Church , the work of the Good News of salvation . Concerning this continuation of his_own work by the Holy Spirit Jesus speaks more_than_once during the same farewell discourse , preparing the Apostles gathered in the Upper Room for his departure , namely for his Passion and Death on the Cross . The words to which we will_make reference here are_found in the Gospel of John . Each one adds a new element to that prediction and promise . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_are intimately interwoven , not_only from the viewpoint of the events themselves but_also from the viewpoint of the mystery of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit , which perhaps in no passage of Sacred Scripture finds so emphatic an expression as here . A little while after_the prediction just mentioned Jesus adds : '' But the Counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom_the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I have_said to you . '' The Holy Spirit will be the Counselor of the Apostles and the Church , always present in their midst even_though invisible as the teacher of the same Good News that Christ proclaimed . The words '' he will teach '' and '' bring to remembrance '' mean not_only that he , in his_own particular_way , will_continue to inspire the spreading of the Gospel of salvation but also_that he will_help people to understand_the correct meaning of the content of Christ s message ; they mean_that he will ensure continuity and identity of understanding in the midst of changing conditions and circumstances . The Holy Spirit , then , will ensure_that in the Church there will_always continue the same truth_which the Apostles heard from their Master . In transmitting the Good News , the Apostles will be in a special_way associated_with the Holy Spirit . This -isaia- how Jesus goes on : '' When the Counselor comes , whom I shall send to you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will bear_witness to me ; and you also are witnesses , because you have_been with me from the beginning . '' Apostles were_the direct eyewitnesses . They '' have heard '' and '' have_seen with_their own eyes , '' '' have looked upon '' and even '' touched with_their hands '' Christ , as the evangelist John says in another passage . This human , first hand and '' historical '' witness to Christ -isaia- linked to the witness of the Holy Spirit : '' He will bear_witness to me . '' In the witness of the Spirit of truth , the human testimony of the Apostles will_find its strongest support . And subsequently it will_also find therein the hidden foundation of its continuation among the generations of Christ s disciples and believers who succeed one_another down through the ages . The supreme and most complete revelation of God to humanity -isaia- Jesus Christ himself , and the witness of the Spirit inspires , guarantees and convalidates the faithful transmission of this revelation in the preaching and writing of the Apostles , while the witness of the Apostles ensures its human expression in the Church and in the history of humanity . This -isaia-_also seen from the strict correlation of content and intention with the just mentioned prediction and promise , a correlation found in the next words of the text of John : '' I have yet many things to say to you , but you cannot bear them now . When the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth ; for he will_not speak on his_own authority , but whatever he hears he will speak , and he will declare to you the things_that_are to come . '' In his previous words Jesus presents the ; Counselor , the Spirit of truth , as the one_who '' will teach '' and '' bring to remembrance , '' as the one_who '' will bear_witness '' to him . Now he says : '' He will guide you into all the truth . '' This '' guiding into all the truth , '' referring to what_the Apostles '' cannot bear now , '' -isaia- necessarily connected_with Christ s self emptying through_his Passion and Death on the Cross , which , when he spoke these_words , was just about to happen . Later however it becomes clear_that this '' guiding into all the truth '' -isaia- connected not only_with the scandal of the Cross , but also_with everything_that Christ '' did and taught . '' For the mystery of Christ taken as a whole demands faith , since_it_-isaia- faith_that adequately introduces man into the reality of the revealed mystery . The guiding into all the truth '' -isaia- therefore achieved in faith and through_faith : and this_-isaia- the work of the Spirit of truth and the result of his action in man . Here the Holy Spirit -isaia- to be man s supreme guide and the light of the human spirit . This holds true for the Apostles , the eyewitnesses , who must now bring to all people the proclamation of what Christ did and taught , and especially_the proclamation of his Cross and Resurrection . Taking a longer view , this also holds true for all the generations of disciples and confessors of the Master . Since they_will have to accept with_faith and confess with candor the mystery of God -atti_degli_apostoli- work in human_history , the revealed mystery which explains the definitive meaning of that history . Between the Holy Spirit and Christ there thus subsists , in the economy of salvation , an intimate bond , whereby_the Spirit works in human_history as '' another Counselor , '' permanently ensuring the transmission and spreading of the Good News revealed by Jesus of Nazareth . Thus , in the Holy Spirit Paraclete , who in the mystery and action of the Church unceasingly continues the historical presence on earth of the Redeemer and his saving work , the glory of Christ shines_forth , as the following words of John attest : '' He the Spirit of truth will glorify me , for he will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' By these_words all the preceding statements are once_again confirmed : '' He will teach . , will_bring to your remembrance . , will bear_witness . '' The supreme and complete self revelation of God , accomplished in Christ and witnessed to by the preaching of the Apostles , continues to be manifested in the Church through the mission of the invisible Counselor , the Spirit of truth . How intimately this mission_-isaia- linked_with the mission of Christ , how fully it draws from this_mission of Christ , consolidating and developing in history its salvific results , -isaia- expressed by the verb '' take '' : '' He will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' As if to explain the words '' he will_take '' by clearly expressing the divine and Trinitarian unity of the source , Jesus adds : '' All that the Father has -isaia- mine ; therefore I said_that he will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' By the very_fact of taking what_-isaia- '' mine , '' he will draw from '' what_-isaia- the Father s . '' In the light of these_words '' he will_take , '' one_can therefore also explain the other significant words about the Holy Spirit spoken by Jesus in the Upper Room before the Passover : '' It -isaia- to your advantage that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Counselor will_not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you . And when he comes , he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment . '' It will be necessary to return to these_words in a separate reflection . Father , Son and Holy Spirit . It -isaia- a characteristic of the text of John that the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit are clearly called Persons , the first distinct from the second and the third , and each of them_from one_another . Jesus speaks of the Spirit Counselor , using several times the personal pronoun '' he '' ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , throughout_the farewell discourse , he reveals the bonds which unite the Father , the Son and the Paraclete to one_another . Thus '' the Holy Spirit . proceeds from the Father '' and the Father '' gives '' the Spirit . The Father '' sends '' the Spirit in the name of the Son , the Spirit '' bears_witness '' to the Son . The Son asks the Father to send the Spirit Counselor , but likewise affirms and promises , in relation to his_own '' departure '' through the Cross : '' If I go , I will send him to you , '' Thus , the Father sends the Holy Spirit in the power of his Fatherhood , as he has_sent the Son ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time he sends him in the power of the Redemption accomplished by Christ and in this_sense Holy Spirit -isaia- sent also by the Son : '' I will send him to you . '' Here it should be noted_that , while all the other promises made in the Upper Room foretold the coming of the Holy Spirit after Christ s departure , the one contained in the text of John : f . also includes and clearly emphasizes the relationship of interdependence which_could be called causal between_the manifestation of each : '' If I go , I will send him to you . '' The Holy Spirit will come insofar as Christ will depart through the Cross : he will come not_only afterwards , but because of the Redemption accomplished by Christ , through the will and action of the Father . Thus in the farewell discourse -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , we can say that the highest point of the revelation of the Trinity -isaia- reached At the same_time , we are on the threshold of definitive events and final words_which in the end will be translated into the great missionary mandate addressed to the Apostles and through them to the Church : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , '' a mandate which contains , in a certain_sense , the Trinitarian formula of baptism : '' baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit . '' The formula reflects the intimate mystery of God , of the divine_life , which_-isaia- the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , the divine unity of the Trinity . The farewell discourse can be read as a special preparation_for this Trinitarian formula , in which_-isaia- expressed the life_giving power of the Sacrament which brings about sharing in the life of the Triune God , for it gives sanctifying grace as a supernatural gift to man . Through grace , man_-isaia- called and made '' capable '' of sharing in the inscrutable life of God . In his intimate life , God '' -isaia- love , '' the essential love shared by the three divine Persons : personal love_-isaia- the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the Father and the Son . Therefore he '' searches even the depths of God , '' as uncreated Love Gift . It can_be_said that in the Holy Spirit the intimate life of the Triune God becomes totally gift , an exchange of mutual love between_the divine Persons and that_through the Holy Spirit God exists in the mode of gift . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- the personal expression of this self_giving , of this being love . He -isaia- Person Love . He -isaia- Person Gift Here we have an inexhaustible treasure of the reality and an inexpressible deepening of the concept of person in God , which only divine Revelation makes known to us . At the same_time , the Holy Spirit , being consubstantial with the Father and the Son in divinity , -isaia- love and uncreated gift from which derives as from its source fons vivus all giving of gifts vis a vis creatures created gift : the gift of existence to all things through creation ; the gift of grace to human_beings through the whole economy of salvation . As the Apostle Paul writes : '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit which has_been_given to US . The Salvific Self Giving of God in the Holy Spirit . Christ s farewell discourse -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper stands in particular reference to this '' giving '' and '' self_giving '' of the Holy Spirit . In John s Gospel we have as it were_the revelation of the most profound '' logic '' of the saving mystery contained in God s eternal plan , as an extension of the ineffable communion of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . This -isaia- the divine '' logic '' which from the mystery of the Trinity leads to the mystery of the Redemption of the world in Jesus Christ . The Redemption accomplished by the Son in the dimensions of the earthly history of humanity accomplished in his '' departure '' through the Cross and Resurrection -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , in its entire salvific power , transmitted to the Holy Spirit : the one_who '' will_take what_-isaia- mine . '' The words of the text of John indicate that , according to the divine plan , Christ s '' departure '' -isaia- an indispensable condition_for the '' sending '' and the coming of the Holy Spirit , but these_words also say that_what begins now -isaia- the new salvific self_giving of God , in the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- a new beginning in relation to the first , original beginning of God s salvific self_giving , which_-isaia- identified with the mystery of creation itself . Here -isaia- what we read in the very first words of the Book of Genesis : '' In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . , and the Spirit of God ruah Elohim was moving over the face of the waters . '' This biblical concept of creation includes not_only the call to existence of the very being of the cosmos , that_-isaia- to say the giving of existence , but_also the presence of the Spirit of God in creation , that_-isaia- to say the beginning of God s salvific self communication to the things he creates . This -isaia- true first of all concerning man_,_who has_been created in the image_and_likeness of God : '' Let us make man in our image , after our likeness . '' '' Let us make '' : can one hold that the plural which_the Creator uses here in speaking of himself already in some_way suggests the Trinitarian mystery , the presence of the Trinity in the work of the creation of man ? The Christian reader , who already knows the revelation of this_mystery , can discern a reflection of it also in these_words . At any rate , the context of the Book of Genesis enables us to see in the creation of man the first beginning of God s salvific self_giving commensurate with the '' image_and_likeness '' of himself which_he_has granted to man . It seems then that_even the words spoken by Jesus in the farewell discourse should be read again in the light of that '' beginning , '' so long ago yet fundamental , which we know from Genesis . '' If I do not go away , the Counselor will_not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you . '' Describing his '' departure '' as a condition_for the '' coming '' of the Counselor , Christ links the new beginning of God s salvific self communication in the Holy Spirit with the mystery of the Redemption . It -isaia- a new beginning , first of all because between_the first beginning and the whole of human_history from the original fall onwards sin has intervened , sin which_-isaia- in contradiction to the presence of the Spirit of God in creation , and which_-isaia- above all in contradiction to God s salvific self communication to man . Paul writes that , precisely_because of sin , '' creation . was subjected to futility . , has_been groaning in travail together until now '' and '' waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God . Therefore Jesus Christ says in the Upper Room '' It -isaia- to your advantage I go away ; . if I go , I will send him to you . '' The '' departure '' of Christ through the Cross has the power of the Redemption and this also means a new presence of the Spirit of God in creation : the new beginning of God s self communication to man in the Holy Spirit . '' And that_you are children -isaia- proven by the fact_that God has_sent into our_hearts the Spirit of his Son who cries : Abba , Father ! '' As the Apostle Paul writes in the Letter to the Galatians . The Holy Spirit -isaia- the Spirit of the Father , as the words of the farewell discourse in the Upper Room bear_witness . At the same_time he -isaia- the Spirit of the Son : he -isaia- the Spirit of Jesus Christ , as the Apostles and particularly Paul of Tarsus will testify . With the sending of this Spirit '' into our_hearts , '' there begins the fulfillment of that for_which '' creation waits with eager longing , '' as we read in the Letter to the Romans . The Holy Spirit comes -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of Christ s '' departure . '' While this '' departure '' caused the Apostles to be sorrowful , and this sorrow was to reach its culmination in the Passion and Death on Good Friday , '' this sorrow will turn into joy . '' For Christ will add to this redemptive '' departure '' the glory of his Resurrection and Ascension to the Father . Thus the sorrow with its underlying joy -isaia- , for the Apostles in the context of their Master s '' departure , '' an '' advantageous '' departure , for thanks to it another '' Counselor '' will come . At the price of the Cross which brings about the Redemption , in the power of the whole Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ , the Holy Spirit comes in order to remain from the day of Pentecost onwards with the Apostles , to remain with the Church and in the Church , and through_her in the world . In this_way there_-isaia- definitively brought_about that new beginning of the self communication of the Triune God in the Holy Spirit through the work of Jesus Christ , the Redeemer of man and of the world . The Messiah , Anointed with the Holy Spirit . There -isaia-_also accomplished in its entirety the mission of the Messiah , that_-isaia- to say of the One who has_received the fullness of the Holy Spirit for the Chosen People of God and for the whole of humanity . '' Messiah '' literally means '' Christ , '' that_-isaia- , '' Anointed One , '' and in the history_of_salvation it means '' the one anointed with the Holy Spirit . '' This was_the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament . Following this tradition , Simon Peter will say in the house of Cornelius : '' You must_have heard about the recent happenings in Judea . after_the baptism which John preached : how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power . '' From these_words of Peter and from many similar ones , one_must first go back to the prophecy of Isaiah , sometimes called '' the Fifth Gospel '' or '' the Gospel of the Old Testament . '' Alluding to the coming of a mysterious personage , which_the New Testament revelation will identify with Jesus , Isaiah connects his person and mission with a particular action of the Spirit of God the Spirit of the Lord . These are the words of the Prophet : '' There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse , and a branch shall grow out of his roots . And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord . And his delight shall be the fear of the Lord . '' This text -isaia- important_for the whole pneumatology of the Old Testament , because it constitutes a kind of bridge between_the ancient biblical concept of '' spirit , '' understood primarily as a '' charismatic breath of wind , '' and the '' Spirit '' as a person and as a gift , a gift for the person . The Messiah of the lineage of David '' from the stump of Jesse '' -isaia- precisely that person upon whom_the Spirit of the Lord '' shall rest . '' It -isaia- obvious that in this case one_cannot yet speak of a revelation of the Paraclete . However , with this veiled reference to the figure of the future Messiah there begins , so to speak , the path towards_the full revelation of the Holy Spirit in the unity of the Trinitarian mystery , a mystery which_will finally be manifested in the New Covenant . It -isaia- precisely_the Messiah himself who_-isaia- this path . In the Old Covenant , anointing had become the external symbol of the gift of the Spirit . The Messiah more_than any_other anointed personage in the Old Covenant -isaia- that single great personage anointed by God himself He -isaia- the Anointed One in the sense_that he possesses the fullness of the Spirit of God . He himself will_also be the mediator in granting this Spirit to the whole People . Here in fact are other_words of the Prophet : '' The Spirit of the Lord God -isaia- upon me , because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted ; he has_sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to those_who_are bound ; to proclaim_the year of the Lord s favor . '' The Anointed One -isaia-_also sent '' with the Spirit of the Lord '' : '' Now the Lord God has_sent me and his Spirit . '' According to the Book of Isaiah , the Anointed One and the One sent together_with_the Spirit of the Lord -isaia-_also the chosen Servant of the Lord upon whom_the Spirit of God comes down : '' Behold my servant , whom I uphold , my chosen , in whom my soul delights ; I have put my Spirit upon him . '' We know_that the Servant of the Lord -isaia-_revealed in the Book of Isaiah as the true Man of Sorrows : the Messiah who suffers for the sins of the world . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- precisely he whose mission will bear for all humanity the true fruits of salvation : '' He will_bring forth justice to the nations . '' ; and he will_become '' a covenant to the people , a light to the nations . '' ; '' that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth . '' For : '' My spirit which_-isaia- upon you , and my words_which I have put in your mouth , shall_not depart out of your mouth , or out of the mouth of your children s children , says the Lord , from this_time forth and for evermore . '' The prophetic texts quoted here are to be read in the light of the Gospel just as , in its turn , the New Testament draws a particular clarification from the marvelous light contained in these Old Testament texts . The Prophet presents the Messiah as the one_who comes in the Holy Spirit , the one_who possesses the fullness of this Spirit in himself and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for others , for Israel , for all the nations , for all humanity . The fullness of the Spirit of God -isaia- accompanied by many_different gifts , the treasures of salvation , destined in a particular_way for the poor and suffering , for all those_who open their_hearts to these gifts sometimes through the painful experience of their_own existence but first of all through that interior availability which_comes_from faith . The aged Simeon , the '' righteous and devout man '' upon whom '' rested the Holy Spirit , '' sensed this -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of Jesus presentation in the Temple , when he perceived in him the '' salvation . prepared in the presence of all peoples '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of the great suffering the Cross which he would_have to embrace together_with his Mother . The Virgin Mary , who '' had conceived by the Holy Spirit , '' sensed this even more_clearly , when_she pondered in her heart_the '' mysteries '' of the Messiah , with whom she_was associated . Here it must be emphasized that clearly_the '' spirit of the Lord '' who rests upon the future Messiah -isaia- above all a gift of God for the person of that Servant of the Lord . But the latter -isaia- not an isolated and independent person , because he acts in accordance_with_the will of the Lord , by virtue of the Lord s decision or choice . Even though in the light of the texts of Isaiah the salvific work of the Messiah , the Servant of the Lord , includes the action of the Spirit which_-isaia- carried_out through himself , nevertheless in the Old Testament context there_-isaia- no suggestion of a distinction of subjects , or of the Divine Persons as they subsist in the mystery of the Trinity , and as they_are later revealed in the New Testament . Both in Isaiah and in the whole of the Old Testament the personality of the Holy Spirit -isaia- completely hidden : in the revelation of the one God , as also in the foretelling of the future Messiah . Jesus Christ will_make reference to this prediction contained in the words of Isaiah -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his messianic activity . This will happen in the same Nazareth where he had lived for thirty years in the house of Joseph the carpenter , with Mary , his Virgin Mother . When he had occasion to speak in the Synagogue , he opened the Book of Isaiah and found the passage where it was written : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me '' ; and having read this passage he said to those present : '' Today this scripture has_been fulfilled in your hearing . '' In this_way he confessed and proclaimed that he was_the Messiah , the one in whom_the Holy Spirit dwells as the gift of God himself , the one_who possesses the fullness of this Spirit , the one_who marks the '' new beginning '' of the gift_which God makes to humanity in the Spirit . Jesus of Nazareth , '' Exalted '' in the Holy Spirit . Even though in his hometown of Nazareth Jesus -isaia- not accepted as the Messiah , nonetheless , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his public activity , his messianic mission in the Holy Spirit -isaia-_revealed to the people by John the Baptist . The latter , the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth , foretells -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan the coming of the Messiah and administers the baptism of repentance . He says : '' I baptize you with water ; he who_-isaia- mightier than I -isaia- coming , the thong of whose sandals I -amos- not worthy to untie ; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire . '' John the Baptist foretells the Messiah Christ not_only as the one_who '' -isaia- coming '' in the Holy Spirit but_also as the one_who '' brings '' the Holy Spirit , as Jesus will reveal more_clearly in the Upper Room . Here John faithfully echoes the words of Isaiah , words_which in the ancient Prophet concerned the future , while in John s teaching on the banks of the Jordan they_are the immediate introduction to the new messianic reality . John -isaia-_not_only a prophet but_also a messenger : he -isaia- the precursor of Christ . What he foretells -isaia- accomplished before the eyes of all . Jesus of Nazareth too comes to the Jordan to receive the baptism of repentance . At the sight of him arriving , John proclaims : '' Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world . '' He says this through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit , bearing_witness to the fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah . At the same_time he confesses his faith in the redeeming mission of Jesus of Nazareth . On the lips of John the Baptist , '' Lamb of God '' -isaia- an expression of truth_about the Redeemer no less significant than the one used by Isaiah : '' Servant of the Lord . '' Thus , by the testimony of John -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan , Jesus of Nazareth , rejected by his_own fellow citizens , -isaia- exalted before the eyes of Israel as the Messiah , that_-isaia- to say the '' One Anointed '' with the Holy Spirit . And this testimony -isaia- corroborated by another testimony of a higher order , mentioned by the three Synoptics . For when all the people were baptized and as Jesus , having received baptism , was praying , '' the heaven was opened , and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form , as a dove '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time '' a voice from heaven said This -isaia- my beloved Son , with whom I -amos- well pleased . '' This -isaia- a Trinitarian theophany which bears_witness to the exaltation of Christ on the occasion of his baptism in the Jordan . It not_only confirms the testimony of John the Baptist but_also reveals another more profound dimension of the truth_about Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah . It -isaia- this : the Messiah -isaia- the beloved Son of the Father . His solemn exaltation cannot be reduced to the messianic mission of the '' Servant of the Lord . '' In the light of the theophany -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan , this exaltation touches the mystery of the very person of the Messiah . He has_been raised up because he -isaia- the beloved Son in whom God -isaia- well pleased . The voice from on high says : '' my Son . The theophany -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan clarifies only in a fleeting way the mystery of Jesus of Nazareth , whose entire activity will be carried_out in the active presence of the Holy Spirit . This mystery would be gradually revealed and confirmed by Jesus himself by means of everything_that he '' did and taught . '' In the course of this_teaching and of the messianic signs which Jesus performed before he came to the farewell discourse in the Upper Room , we find events and words_which constitute particularly important stages of this progressive revelation . Thus the evangelist Luke , who has_already presented Jesus as '' full of the Holy Spirit '' and '' led by the Spirit . in the wilderness , '' tells us that , after_the return of the seventy two disciples from the mission entrusted to them by the Master , while they_were joyfully recounting the fruits of their labors , '' in that_same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said : I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that_you have hidden these_things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes ; yea , Father , for_such was your gracious will . '' Jesus rejoices -atti_degli_apostoli- the fatherhood of God : he rejoices because it has_been_given to him to reveal this fatherhood ; he rejoices , finally , as -atti_degli_apostoli- a particular outpouring of this_divine fatherhood on the '' little ones . '' And the evangelist describes all this as '' rejoicing in the Holy Spirit . '' This '' rejoicing '' in a certain_sense prompts Jesus to say still_more . We hear : '' All things have_been delivered to me by my Father ; and no one knows who the Son -isaia- except the Father , or who the Father -isaia- except the Son and any_one to whom_the Son chooses to reveal him . That which during the theophany -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan came so to speak '' from outside , '' from on high , here comes '' from within , '' that_-isaia- to say from the depths of who Jesus -isaia- . It -isaia- another revelation of the Father and the Son , united in the Holy Spirit . Jesus speaks only of the fatherhood of God and of his_own sonship he does_not speak directly of the Spirit , who_-isaia- Love and thereby the union of the Father and the Son . Nonetheless what he says of the Father and of himself_the Son flows from that fullness of the Spirit which_-isaia- in him , which fills his_heart , pervades his_own '' I , '' inspires and enlivens his action from the depths . Hence that '' rejoicing in the Holy Spirit . '' The union of Christ with the Holy Spirit , a union of which he -isaia- perfectly aware , -isaia- expressed in that '' rejoicing , '' which in a certain way renders '' perceptible '' its hidden source . Thus there_-isaia- a particular manifestation and rejoicing which_-isaia- proper to the Son of Man , the Christ Messiah , whose humanity belongs to the person of the Son of God , substantially one_with the Holy Spirit in divinity . In the magnificent confession of the fatherhood of God , Jesus of Nazareth also manifests himself , his_divine '' I '' for he -isaia- the Son '' of the same substance , '' and therefore '' no one knows who the Son -isaia- except the Father , or who the Father -isaia- except the Son , '' that Son who '' for us and for our_salvation '' became man by the power of the Holy Spirit and was_born of a virgin whose name was Mary . The Risen Christ Says : '' Receive the Holy Spirit '' . It -isaia- thanks to Luke s narrative that_we_are brought closest to the truth contained in the discourse in the Upper Room . Jesus of Nazareth , '' raised up '' in the Holy Spirit , during_this discourse and conversation presents himself as the one_who brings the Spirit , as the one_who_-isaia- to bring him and '' give '' him to the Apostles and to the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his_own '' departure '' through the Cross . The verb '' bring '' -isaia- here used to mean first of all '' reveal . '' In the Old Testament , from the Book of Genesis onwards , the Spirit of God was in some_way made_known , in the first_place as a '' breath '' of God which_gives life , as a supernatural '' living breath . '' In the Book of Isaiah , he -isaia- presented as a '' gift '' for the person of the Messiah , as the one_who comes down and rests upon him , in order to guide from within all the salvific activity of the '' Anointed One . '' At the Jordan , Isaiah s proclamation -isaia- given a concrete form : Jesus of Nazareth -isaia-_the_one who comes in the Holy Spirit and who brings the Spirit as the gift proper to his_own Person , in order to distribute that gift by means of this humanity : '' He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . '' In the Gospel of Luke , this revelation of the Holy Spirit -isaia- confirmed and added to , as the intimate source of the life and messianic activity of Jesus Christ . In the light of what Jesus says in the farewell discourse in the Upper Room , the Holy Spirit -isaia-_revealed in a new and fuller way . He -isaia-_not_only the gift to the person the person of the Messiah , but_-isaia- a Person gift . Jesus foretells his coming as that of '' another Counselor '' who , being the Spirit of truth , will_lead the Apostles and the Church '' into all the truth . '' This will be accomplished by reason of the particular communion_between the Holy Spirit and Christ : '' He will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' This communion has its original source in the Father : '' All that the Father has -isaia- mine ; therefore I said_that he will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' Coming from the Father the Holy Spirit -isaia- sent by the Father . The Holy Spirit -isaia- first sent as a gift for the Son who was_made man , in order to fulfill the messianic prophecies . After the '' departure '' of Christ the Son , the Johannine text says_that the Holy Spirit '' will come '' directly it -isaia-_his new mission , to complete the work of the Son . Thus it will be he who brings to fulfillment the new era of the history_of_salvation . We find ourselves on the threshold of the Paschal events . The new , definitive revelation of the Holy Spirit as a Person who_-isaia- the gift -isaia- accomplished -atti_degli_apostoli- this precise moment . The Paschal events the Passion , Death and Resurrection of Christ are_also the time of the new coming of the Holy Spirit , as the Paraclete and the Spirit of truth . They are the time of the '' new beginning '' of the self communication of the Triune God to humanity in the Holy Spirit through the work of Christ the Redeemer . This new beginning -isaia- the Redemption of the world : '' God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son . '' Already the '' giving '' of the Son , the gift of the Son , expresses the most profound essence of God who , as Love , -isaia- the inexhaustible source of the giving of gifts . The gift made by the Son completes the revelation and giving of the eternal love : the Holy Spirit , who in the inscrutable depths of the divinity -isaia- a Person Gift , through the work of the Son , that_-isaia- to say by means of the Paschal Mystery , -isaia- given to the Apostles and to the Church in a new_way , and through them -isaia- given to humanity and the whole_world . The definitive expression of this_mystery -isaia- had on the day of the Resurrection . On this_day Jesus of Nazareth '' descended from David according to the flesh , '' as the Apostle Paul writes , -isaia- '' designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the dead . '' It can_be_said therefore that the messianic '' raising up '' of Christ in the Holy Spirit reaches its zenith in the Resurrection , in which he reveals himself also as the Son of God , '' full of power . '' And this_power , the sources of which gush forth in the inscrutable Trinitarian communion , -isaia- manifested , first of all , in the fact_that the Risen Christ does two things : on the one_hand he fulfills God s promise already expressed through the Prophet s words : '' A new heart I will_give you , and a new spirit I will put within you , . my spirit '' ; and on the other_hand he fulfills his_own promise made to the Apostles with the words : '' If I go , I will send him to you . '' It -isaia- he : the Spirit of truth , the Paraclete sent by the Risen Christ to transform us into_his own risen image . '' On the evening of that day , the first day of the week , the doors being shut where_the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among_them and said to them , Peace be with you . When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . Then the disciples were glad when_they saw the Lord . Jesus said to them again , Peace be with you . As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you . And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and said to them , Receive the Holy Spirit . '' All the details of this key text of John s Gospel have_their own eloquence , especially if we read them in reference to the words spoken in the same Upper Room -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Paschal event . And now these events the Triduum Sacrum of Jesus whom_the Father consecrated with the anointing and sent into_the_world reach their fulfillment . Christ , who '' gave up his_spirit '' on the Cross as the Son of Man and the Lamb of God , once risen goes to the Apostles to breathe on them '' with_that power spoken of in the Letter to the Romans . The Lord s coming fills those present with_joy : '' Your sorrow will turn into joy , '' as he had_already promised them before his Passion . And above all there_-isaia- fulfilled the principal prediction of the farewell discourse : the Risen Christ , as it were beginning a new creation , '' brings '' to the Apostles the Holy Spirit . He brings him -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his_own '' departure '' : he gives them this Spirit as it were through the wounds of his crucifixion : '' He showed them his hands and his side . '' It -isaia- in the power of this crucifixion that he says to them : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' Thus there_-isaia- established a close link between_the sending of the Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit . There -isaia- no sending of the Holy Spirit after original_sin without_the Cross and the Resurrection : '' If I do not go away , the Counselor will_not come to you . '' There -isaia-_also established a close link between_the mission of the Holy Spirit and that of the Son in the Redemption . The mission of the Son , in a certain_sense , finds_its '' fulfillment '' in the Redemption . The mission of the Holy Spirit '' draws from '' the Redemption : '' He will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' The Redemption -isaia- totally carried_out by the Son as the Anointed One , who came and acted in the power of the Holy Spirit , offering himself finally in sacrifice on the wood of the Cross . And this Redemption -isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , constantly carried_out in human hearts and minds in the history of the world by the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- the '' other Counselor . The Holy Spirit and the Era of the Church . '' Having accomplished the work that the Father had entrusted to the Son on earth cf . Jn : , on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was sent to sanctify the Church forever , so that believers might have access to the Father through Christ in one Spirit cf . He -isaia- the Spirit of life , the fountain of water springing up to eternal_life cf . , the One through whom_the Father restores life to those_who_are dead through sin , until one_day he will raise in Christ their mortal bodies '' cf . In this_way the Second Vatican Council speaks of the Church s birth on the day of Pentecost . This event constitutes the definitive manifestation of what had already_been accomplished in the same Upper Room on Easter Sunday . The Risen Christ came and '' brought '' to the Apostles the Holy Spirit . He gave him to them , saying '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' What had then taken_place inside the Upper Room , '' the doors being shut , '' later , on the day of Pentecost -isaia- manifested also outside , in public . The doors of the Upper Room are opened and the Apostles go to the inhabitants and the pilgrims who_had gathered in Jerusalem on the occasion of the feast , in order to bear_witness to Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit . In this_way the prediction -isaia- fulfilled : '' He will bear_witness to me : and you also are witnesses , because you have_been with me from the beginning . '' We read in another document of the Second Vatican Council : '' Doubtless , the Holy Spirit was already -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the world before Christ was glorified . Yet on the day of Pentecost , he came down upon the disciples to remain with_them for ever . On that day the Church was publicly revealed to the multitude , and the Gospel began to spread among the nations by means of preaching . '' The era of the Church began with the '' coming , '' that_-isaia- to say with the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles gathered in the Upper Room in Jerusalem , together_with Mary , the Lord s Mother . The time of the Church began -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment when_the promises and predictions that so explicitly referred to the Counselor , the Spirit of truth , began to be fulfilled in complete power and clarity upon the Apostles , thus determining the birth of the Church . The Acts of the Apostles speak of this -atti_degli_apostoli- length and in many passages , which state that in the mind of the first community , whose convictions Luke expresses , the Holy Spirit assumed the invisible but in a certain way '' perceptible '' guidance of those_who after_the departure of the Lord Jesus felt profoundly that_they had_been left orphans . With the coming of the Spirit they felt capable of fulfilling the mission entrusted to them . They felt full of strength . It -isaia- precisely this_that the Holy Spirit worked in them and this_-isaia- continually -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church , through_their successors . For the grace of the Holy Spirit which_the Apostles gave to their collaborators through the imposition of hands continues to be transmitted in Episcopal Ordination . The bishops in turn by the Sacrament of Orders render the sacred ministers sharers in this spiritual gift and , through the Sacrament of Confirmation , ensure_that all who_are reborn of water and the Holy Spirit are strengthened by this_gift . And thus , in a certain way , the grace of Pentecost -isaia- perpetuated in the Church . As the Council writes , '' the Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts of the faithful as in a temple cf . In them he prays and bears_witness to the fact that_they_are adopted sons cf . The Spirit guides the Church into the fullness of truth cf . Jn : and gives her a unity of fellowship and service . He furnishes and directs her with various gifts , both hierarchical and charismatic , and adorns her with the fruits of his_grace cf Eph : ; Cor : ; Gal : . By the power of the Gospel he makes_the Church grow , perpetually renews her and leads her to perfect union with_her Spouse . These passages quoted from the Conciliar Constitution Lumen Gentium tell us that the era of the Church began with the coming of the Holy Spirit . They also tell us that_this era , the era of the Church , continues . It continues down_the_centuries and generations . In our_own century , when humanity -isaia-_already close to the end of the second Millennium after Christ , this era of the Church expressed itself in a special_way through the Second Vatican Council , as the Council of our century . For we know that_it_was in a special_way an '' ecclesiological '' Council : a Council on the theme of the Church . At the same_time , the teaching of this Council -isaia- essentially '' pneumatological '' : it -isaia- permeated by the truth_about the Holy Spirit , as the soul of the Church . We can say that in its rich variety of teaching the Second Vatican Council contains precisely all that '' the Spirit says to the Churches '' with_regard to the present phase of the history_of_salvation . Following the guidance of the Spirit of truth and bearing_witness together_with him , the Council has_given a special confirmation of the presence of the Holy Spirit the Counselor . In a certain_sense , the Council has made the Spirit newly '' present '' in our difficult age . In the light of this conviction one grasps more_clearly the great_importance of all the initiatives aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- implementing the Second Vatican Council , its teaching and its pastoral and ecumenical thrust . In this_sense also the subsequent Assemblies of the Synod of Bishops are to be carefully studied and evaluated , aiming as they do to ensure_that the fruits of truth and love the authentic fruits of the Holy Spirit become a lasting treasure for the People of God in its earthly pilgrimage down_the_centuries . This work being done by the Church for the testing and bringing together of the salvific fruits of the Spirit bestowed in the Council -isaia- something indispensable . For this_purpose one_must learn how to '' discern '' them carefully from everything_that may instead come originally from the '' prince of this_world . '' This discernment in implementing the Council s work -isaia-_especially necessary in view of the fact_that the Council opened itself widely to the contemporary world , as -isaia- clearly seen from the important Conciliar Constitutions Gaudium et Spes and Lumen Gentium . We read in the Pastoral Constitution : '' For theirs i . , of the disciples of Christ -isaia- a community composed of men . United in Christ , they_are led by the Holy Spirit in their journey to the kingdom of their Father and they_have welcomed the news of salvation which_-isaia- meant for_every man . That -isaia- why this community realizes that_it_-isaia- truly and intimately linked_with mankind and its history . '' '' The Church truly knows that_only God , whom she serves , meets the deepest longings of the human_heart , which_-isaia- never fully satisfied by what_the world has to offer . with a marvelous providence directs the unfolding of time and renews the face of the earth . '' PART II THE SPIRIT WHO CONVINCES THE WORLD CONCERNING SIN . Sin , Righteousness and Judgment . When Jesus during the discourse in the Upper Room foretells the coming of the Holy Spirit '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of '' his_own departure , and promises '' I will send him to you , '' in the very same context he adds : '' And when he comes , he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment . '' The same Counselor and Spirit of truth who has_been promised as the one_who '' will teach '' and '' bring to remembrance , '' who '' will bear_witness , '' and '' guide into all the truth , '' in the words just quoted -isaia- foretold as the one_who '' will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgement . '' The context too seems significant . Jesus links this foretelling of the Holy Spirit to the words indicating his '' departure '' through the Cross , and indeed emphasizes the need for_this departure : '' It -isaia- to your advantage that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Counselor will_not come to you . '' But what counts more -isaia- the explanation that Jesus himself adds to these three words : sin , righteousness , judgment . For he says this : '' He Will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment : concerning sin , because_they do not believe in me ; concerning righteousness , because I go to the Father , and you will see me no more ; concerning judgment , because the ruler of the world_-isaia- judged . '' In the mind of Jesus , sin , righteousness and judgment have a very precise meaning , different from the meaning that_one might be inclined to attribute to these_words independently of the speaker s explanation . This explanation also indicates how one_-isaia- to understand_the '' convincing the world '' which_-isaia- proper to the action of the Holy Spirit . Both the meaning of the individual words and the fact_that Jesus linked them together in the same phrase are important here . '' Sin , '' in this passage , means the incredulity that Jesus encountered among '' his_own , '' beginning with the people of his_own town of Nazareth . Sin means the rejection of his_mission , a rejection that_will cause people to condemn him to death . When he speaks next of '' righteousness , '' Jesus seems to have in mind_that definitive justice , which_the Father will restore to him when he grants him the glory of the Resurrection and Ascension into_heaven : '' I go to the Father . '' In its turn , and in the context of '' sin '' and '' righteousness '' thus understood , '' judgment '' means_that the Spirit of truth will show the guilt cf the '' world '' in condemning Jesus to death on the Cross . Nevertheless , Christ did_not come into_the_world only to judge it and condemn it : he came to save it . Convincing about sin and righteousness has as its purpose the salvation of the world , the salvation of men . Precisely this_truth seems to be emphasized by the assertion that '' judgment '' concerns only the prince of this_world , '' Satan , the one_who from the beginning has_been exploiting the work of creation against salvation , against the covenant and the union of man with God : he -isaia- '' already judged '' from the start . If the Spirit Counselor -isaia- to convince the world precisely concerning judgment , it -isaia- in order to continue in the world_the salvific work of Christ . Here we wish to concentrate our attention principally on this_mission of the Holy Spirit , which_-isaia- '' to convince the world concerning sin , '' but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time respecting the general context of Jesus words in the Upper Room . The Holy Spirit , who takes from the Son the work of the Redemption of the world , by this_very fact takes the task of the salvific '' convincing of sin . '' This convincing -isaia- in permanent reference to '' righteousness '' : that_-isaia- to say to definitive salvation in God , to the fulfillment of the economy that_has as its center the crucified and glorified Christ . And this salvific economy of God in a certain_sense removes man from '' judgment , '' that_-isaia- from the damnation which_has_been inflicted on the Sill or Satan , '' the prince of this_world , '' the one_who because of his sin has become '' the ruler of this_world of darkness . '' And here we see_that , through_this reference to '' judgment , '' vast horizons open up for understanding '' sin '' and also '' righteousness . '' The Holy Spirit , by showing sin against the background of Christ s Cross in the economy of salvation one could say '' sin saved '' , enables us to understand how his mission_-isaia- also '' to convince '' of the sin that has_already_been definitively judged '' sin condemned '' . All the words uttered by the Redeemer in the Upper Room on the eve of his Passion become part of the era of the Church : first of all , the words about the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete and Spirit of truth . The words become part of it in an ever_new way , in every generation , in every_age . This -isaia- confirmed , as far as our_own age -isaia- concerned , by the teaching of the Second Vatican Council as a whole , and especially in the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes . Many passages of this document indicate clearly that the Council , by opening itself to the light of the Spirit of truth , -isaia- seen to be the authentic depositary of the predictions and promises made by Christ to the Apostles and to the Church in the farewell discourse : in a particular_way as the depositary of the predictions that the Holy Spirit would '' convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment . '' This -isaia-_already indicated by the text in which_the Council explains how it understands the '' world '' : '' The Council focuses its attention on the world of men , the whole human_family along_with the sum of those realities in the midst of which that family lives . It gazes upon the world which_-isaia- the theater of man s history , and carries the marks of his energies , his tragedies , and his triumphs ; that world_which the Christian sees as created and sustained by its Maker s love , fallen indeed into the bondage of sin , yet emancipated now by Christ . He was crucified and rose again to break the stranglehold of personified Evil , so that this_world might be fashioned anew according to God s design and reach its fulfillment . '' This very rich text needs to be read in conjunction with the other passages in the Constitution that seek to show with all the realism of faith the situation of sin in the contemporary world and that also seek to explain its essence , beginning from different points of view . When on the eve of the Passover Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit as the one_who '' will convince the world concerning sin , '' on the one_hand this statement must_be_given the widest possible meaning , insofar as it includes all the sin in the history of humanity . But on the other_hand , when Jesus explains that_this sin consists in the fact_that '' they_do_not believe in him , '' this meaning seems to apply only to those_who rejected the messianic mission of the Son of Man and condemned him to death on the Cross . But one_can hardly fail to notice that_this more '' limited '' and historically specified meaning of sin expands , until it assumes a universal dimension by reason of the universality of the Redemption , accomplished through the Cross . The revelation of the mystery of the Redemption opens the way to an understanding in which_every sin wherever and whenever committed has a reference to the Cross of Christ and therefore indirectly also to the sin of those_who '' have_not believed in him , '' and who condemned Jesus Christ to death on the Cross . From this point_of_view we must return to the event of Pentecost . The Testimony of the Day of Pentecost . Christ s prophecies in the farewell discourse found their most exact and direct confirmation on the day of Pentecost , in particular the prediction which_we_are dealing_with : '' The Counselor . will convince the world concerning sin . '' On that day , the promised Holy Spirit came down upon the Apostles gathered in prayer together_with Mary the Mother of Jesus , in the same Upper Room , as we read in the Acts of the Apostles : '' And they_were all filled_with_the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance , '' '' thus bringing back to unity the scattered races and offering to the Father the first fruits of all the nations . '' The connection_between Christ s prediction and this event -isaia- clear . We perceive here_the first and fundamental fulfillment of the promise of the Paraclete . He comes , sent by the Father , '' after '' the departure of Christ , '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of '' that departure . This -isaia- first a departure through the Cross , and later , forty days after_the Resurrection , through_his Ascension into_heaven . Once more , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Ascension , Jesus orders the Apostles '' not to depart from Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father '' ; '' but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit '' ; '' but you shall receive power when_the Holy Spirit has come upon you ; and you shall be witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth . '' These last words contain an echo or reminder of the prediction made in the Upper Room . And on the day of Pentecost this prediction -isaia- fulfilled with total accuracy . Acting under the influence of the Holy Spirit , who had_been received by the Apostles while they_were praying in the Upper Room , Peter comes forward and speaks before a multitude of people of different languages , gathered for the feast . He proclaims what he certainly would_not have_had the courage to say before : Men of Israel , . Jesus of Nazareth , a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through_him in your midst . this Jesus , delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God , you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men . But God raised him up , having loosed the pangs of death , because it was not_possible for him to be held by it . '' Jesus had foretold and promised : '' He will bear_witness to me , . and you also are my witnesses . '' In the first discourse of Peter in Jerusalem this '' witness '' finds_its clear beginning : it -isaia- the witness to Christ crucified and risen . The witness of the Spirit Paraclete and of the Apostles . And in the very content of that first witness , the Spirit of truth , through the lips of Peter , '' convinces the world concerning sin '' : first of all , concerning the sin which_-isaia- the rejection of Christ even to his condemnation to death , to death on the Cross on Golgotha . Similar proclamations will be repeated , according to the text of the Acts of the Apostles , on other occasions and in various places . Beginning from this initial witness -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost and for all future time the action of the Spirit of truth who '' convinces the world concerning the sin '' of the rejection of Christ -isaia- linked inseparably with the witness to be borne to the Paschal Mystery : the mystery of the Crucified and Risen One . And in this link the same '' convincing concerning sin '' reveals its_own salvific dimension . For it -isaia- a '' convincing '' that_has as its purpose not merely the accusation of the world and still less its condemnation . Jesus Christ did_not come into_the_world to judge it and condemn it but to save it . This -isaia- emphasized in this first discourse , when Peter exclaims : '' Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom_you crucified . '' And then , when those present ask Peter and the Apostles : '' Brethren , what shall we do ? '' this_-isaia- Peter s answer : '' Repent , and be baptized every_one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins ; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit . '' In this_way '' convincing concerning sin '' becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a convincing concerning the remission of sins , in the power of the Holy Spirit . Peter in his discourse in Jerusalem calls people to conversion , as Jesus called his listeners to conversion -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his messianic activity . Conversion requires convincing of sin ; it includes the interior judgment of the conscience , and this , being a proof of the action of the Spirit of truth in man s inmost being , becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a new beginning of the bestowal of grace and love : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' Thus in this '' convincing concerning sin '' we discover a double gift : the gift of the truth of conscience and the gift of the certainty of redemption . The Spirit of truth_-isaia- the Counselor . The convincing concerning sin , through the ministry of the apostolic kerygma in the early Church , -isaia- referred under the impulse of the Spirit poured out -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost to the redemptive power of Christ crucified and risen . Thus the promise concerning the Holy Spirit made before Easter -isaia- fulfilled : '' He will_take what_-isaia- mine and declare it to you . '' When therefore , during the Pentecost event , Peter speaks of the sin of those_who '' have_not believed '' and have sent Jesus of Nazareth to an ignominious death , he bears_witness to victory over sin : a victory achieved , in a certain_sense , through the greatest sin that_man could commit : the killing of Jesus , the Son of God , consubstantial with the Father ! Similarly , the death of the Son of God conquers human death : '' I will be your death , O death , '' as the sin of having crucified the Son of God '' conquers '' human sin ! That sin which_was committed in Jerusalem on Good Friday and also every_human sin . For the greatest sin on man s part -isaia- matched , in the heart of the Redeemer , by the oblation of supreme love_that conquers the evil of all the sins of man . On the basis of this certainty the Church in the Roman liturgy does not_hesitate to repeat every year , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Easter Vigil , '' O happy fault ! '' in the deacon s proclamation of the Resurrection when he sings the '' Exsultet . However , no one but he himself , the Spirit of truth , can '' convince the world , '' man or the human conscience of this ineffable truth . He -isaia- the Spirit who '' searches even the depths of God . '' Faced with the mystery of sin , we have to search '' the depths of God '' to their_very depth . It -isaia-_not_enough to search the human conscience , the intimate mystery of man , but we have to penetrate the inner mystery of God , those '' depths of God '' that_are summarized thus : to the Father in the Son through the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- precisely_the Holy Spirit who '' searches '' the '' depths of God , '' and from them draws God s response to man s sin . With this response there closes the process of '' convincing concerning sin , '' as the event of Pentecost shows . By convincing the '' world '' concerning the sin of Golgotha , concerning the death of the innocent Lamb , as happens on the day of Pentecost , the Holy Spirit also convinces of every sin , committed in any place and -atti_degli_apostoli- any moment in human_history : for he demonstrates its relationship_with the Cross of Christ . The '' convincing '' -isaia- the demonstration of the evil of sin , of every sin , in relation to the Cross of Christ . Sin , shown in this relationship , -isaia- recognized in the entire dimension of evil proper to it , through the '' mysterium iniquitatis '' which_-isaia- hidden within it . Man does_not know this dimension he -isaia- absolutely ignorant of it apart_from the Cross of Christ . So he cannot be '' convinced '' of it except by the Holy Spirit : the Spirit of truth but who -isaia-_also the Counselor . For sin , shown in relation to the cross of Christ , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time identified in the full dimension of the '' mysterium pietatis , '' as indicated by the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia . Man -isaia-_also absolutely ignorant of this dimension of sin apart_from the Cross Christ . And he cannot be '' convinced '' of this dimension either , except by the Holy Spirit : the one_who '' searches the depths of God . The Witness Concerning the Beginning : the Original Reality of Sin . This -isaia- the dimension of sin that we find in the witness concerning the beginning , commented on in the Book of Genesis . It -isaia- the sin that according to the revealed Word of God constitutes the principle and root of all the others . We find ourselves faced_with the original reality of sin in human_history and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time in the whole of the economy of salvation . It can_be_said that in this sin the '' mysterium iniquitatis '' has its beginning , but it can_also be said that_this_-isaia- the sin concerning which_the redemptive power of the '' mysterium pietatis '' becomes particularly clear and efficacious . This -isaia- expressed by St . Paul , when he contrasts the '' disobedience '' of the first Adam with the '' obedience '' of Christ , the second Adam : '' Obedience unto death . '' According to the witness concerning the beginning , sin in its original reality takes_place in man s will and conscience first of all as '' disobedience , '' that_-isaia- , as opposition of the will of man to the will of God . This original disobedience presupposes a rejection , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a turning away from the truth contained in the Word of God , who creates the world . This Word -isaia-_the_same Word who_was '' in the beginning with God , '' who '' was God , '' and without whom '' nothing has been_made of all that_-isaia- , '' since '' the world was_made through_him . '' He -isaia- the Word who -isaia-_also the eternal law , the source of every law which regulates the world and especially human acts . When therefore on the eve of his Passion Jesus Christ speaks of the sin of those_who '' do not believe in him , '' in these_words of his , full of sorrow , there_-isaia- as it were a distant echo of that sin which in its original form -isaia- obscurely inscribed in the mystery of creation . For the one_who_-isaia- speaking -isaia-_not_only the Son of Man but the one_who_-isaia- also '' the first born of all creation , '' '' for in him all things were created . through_him and for him . '' In the light of this_truth we can understand_that the '' disobedience '' in the mystery of the beginning presupposes in a certain_sense the same '' non faith , '' that_same '' they_have not believed '' which_will be repeated in the Paschal Mystery . As we have_said , it -isaia-_a_matter of a rejection or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a turning away from the truth contained in the Word of the Father . The rejection expresses itself in practice as '' disobedience , '' in an act committed as an effect of the temptation which_comes_from the '' father of lies . '' Therefore , -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of human sin_-isaia- the lie which_-isaia- a radical rejection of the truth contained in the Word of the Father , through whom -isaia- expressed the loving omnipotence of the Creator : the omnipotence and also the love '' of God the Father , Creator of heaven and earth . '' The Spirit of God , '' who according to the biblical description of creation '' was moving over the face of the water , '' signifies the same '' Spirit who searches the depths of God '' : '' searches the depths of the Father and of the Word Son in the mystery of creation . Not only -isaia- he the direct witness of their mutual love from which creation derives , but he himself_-isaia- this_love . He himself , as love , -isaia- the eternal uncreated gift . In him -isaia-_the_source and the beginning of every giving of gifts to creatures . The witness concerning the beginning , which we find in the whole of Revelation , beginning with the Book of Genesis , -isaia- unanimous on this_point . To create means to call into existence from nothing : therefore , to create means to give existence . And if the visible world_-isaia- created for_man , therefore the world_-isaia- given to man . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that_same man in his_own humanity receives as a gift a special '' image_and_likeness '' to God . This means not_only rationality and freedom as constitutive properties of human_nature , but_also , from the very_beginning , the capacity of having a personal relationship_with God , as '' I '' and '' you , '' and therefore the capacity of having a covenant , which_will take_place in God s salvific communication with_man . Against the background of the '' image_and_likeness '' of God , '' the gift of the Spirit '' ultimately means a call to friendship , in which_the transcendent '' depths of God '' become in some_way opened to participation on the part of man . The Second Vatican Council teaches ; '' The invisible God out of the abundance of his_love speaks to men as friends and lives among_them , so that_he_may invite and take them_into fellowship with himself . The Spirit , therefore , who '' searches everything , even the depths of God , '' knows from the beginning '' the secrets of man . '' For this_reason he alone_can fully '' convince concerning the sin '' that happened -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , that sin which_-isaia- the root of all other sins and the source of man s sinfulness on earth , a source which never ceases to be active . The Spirit of truth knows the original reality of the sin caused in the will of man by the '' father of lies , '' he who already '' has_been judged . '' The Holy Spirit therefore convinces the world of sin in connection_with this '' judgment , '' but by constantly guiding toward_the '' righteousness '' that_has_been revealed to man together_with_the Cross of Christ : through '' obedience unto death . '' Only the Holy Spirit can convince concerning the sin of the human beginning , precisely he who_-isaia- the love of the Father and of the Son , he who_-isaia- gift , whereas the sin of the human beginning consists in untruthfulness and in the rejection of the gift and the love_which determine the beginning of the world and of man . According to the witness concerning the beginning which we find in the Scriptures and in Tradition , after_the first and also more complete description in the Book of Genesis , sin in its original form -isaia- understood as '' disobedience , '' and this_means simply and directly transgression of a prohibition laid_down by God . But in the light of the whole context it -isaia-_also obvious that the ultimate roots of this disobedience are to be sought in the whole real situation of man . Having been_called into existence , the human_being man_and_woman -isaia- a creature . The '' image of God , '' consisting in rationality and freedom , expresses the greatness and dignity_of_the_human subject , who_-isaia- a person . But this personal subject -isaia-_also always a creature : in his existence and essence he depends on the Creator . According to the Book of Genesis , '' the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil '' was to express and constantly remind man of the '' limit '' impassable for a created being . God s prohibition -isaia- to be understood in this_sense : the Creator forbids man_and_woman to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good_and_evil . The words of the enticement , that_-isaia- to say the temptation , as formulated in the sacred text , are an inducement to transgress this prohibition that_-isaia- to say , to go beyond that '' limit '' : '' When you eat of it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God '' like gods '' , knowing good_and_evil . '' '' Disobedience '' means precisely going beyond that limit , which remains impassable to the will and the freedom of man as a created being . For God the Creator -isaia-_the_one definitive source of the moral_order in the world created by him . Man cannot decide by himself what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil cannot '' know good_and_evil , like God . '' In the created world God indeed remains the first and sovereign source for deciding about good_and_evil , through the intimate truth of being , which_-isaia- the reflection of the Word , the eternal Son , consubstantial with the Father . To man , created to the image of God , the Holy Spirit gives the gift of conscience , so that in this conscience the image may faithfully reflect its model , which_-isaia- both Wisdom and eternal Law , the source of the moral_order in man and in the world . '' Disobedience , '' as the original dimension of sin , means the rejection of this source , through man s claim to become an independent and exclusive source for deciding about good_and_evil The Spirit who '' searches the depths of God , '' and who -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- for_man the light of conscience and the source of the moral_order , knows in all its fullness this dimension of the sin inscribed in the mystery of man s beginning . And the Spirit does not_cease '' convincing the world of it '' in connection_with the Cross of Christ on Golgotha . According to the witness of the beginning , God in creation has revealed himself as omnipotence , which_-isaia- love . At the same_time he has revealed to man that , as the '' image_and_likeness '' of his Creator , he -isaia- called to participate in truth and love . This participation means a life in union with God , who_-isaia- '' eternal_life . '' But man , under the influence of the '' father of lies , '' has separated himself from this participation . To what degree ? Certainly not to the degree of the sin of a pure spirit , to the degree of the sin of Satan . The human spirit_-isaia- incapable of reaching such a degree . In the very description given in Genesis it -isaia- easy to see the difference of degree between_the '' breath of evil '' on the part of the one_who '' has sinned or remains in sin from the beginning '' and already '' has_been judged , '' and the evil of disobedience on the part of man . Man s disobedience , nevertheless , always means a turning away from God , and in a certain_sense the closing up of human_freedom in his regard . It also means a certain opening of this freedom of the human mind and will to the one_who_-isaia- the '' father of lies . '' This act of conscious choice -isaia-_not_only '' disobedience '' but_also involves a certain consent to the motivation which_was contained in the first temptation to sin and which_-isaia- unceasingly renewed during the whole history of man on earth : '' For God knows that_when you eat of it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good_and_evil . '' Here we find ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the very center of what could be called the '' anti Word , '' that_-isaia- to say the '' anti truth : '' For the truth_about man becomes falsified : who man_-isaia- and what_are the impassable limits of his being and freedom . This '' anti truth '' -isaia- possible because -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time there_-isaia- a complete falsification of the truth_about who God -isaia- . God the Creator -isaia- placed in a state of suspicion , indeed of accusation , in the mind of the creature . For the first time in human_history there appears the perverse '' genius of suspicion . '' He seeks to '' falsify '' Good itself ; the absolute Good , which precisely in the work of creation has manifested itself as the Good which_gives in an inexpressible way : as bonum diffusivum sui , as creative love . Who can completely '' convince concerning sin , '' or concerning this motivation of man s original disobedience , except the one_who alone_-isaia- the gift and the source of all giving of gifts , except the Spirit , who '' searches the depths of God '' and -isaia- the love of the Father and the Son ? . For in spite of all the witness of creation and of the salvific economy inherent in it , the spirit of darkness -isaia- capable of showing God as an enemy of his_own creature , and in the first_place as an enemy of man , as a source of danger and threat to man . In this_way Satan manages to sow in man s soul the seed of opposition to the one_who '' from the beginning '' would be considered as man s enemy and not as Father . Man -isaia- challenged to become the adversary of God ! The analysis of sin in its original dimension indicates that , through the influence of the '' father of lies , '' throughout_the history of humanity there_will be a constant pressure on man to reject God , even to the point of hating him : '' Love of self to the point of contempt for God , '' as St . Man will be inclined to see in God primarily a limitation of himself , and not the source of his_own freedom and the fullness of good . We see this confirmed in the modern age , when_the atheistic ideologies seek to root out religion on the grounds that religion causes the radical '' alienation '' of man , as if man were dispossessed of his_own humanity when , accepting the idea of God , he attributes to God what belongs to man , and exclusively to man ! Hence a process of thought and historico sociological practice in which_the rejection of God has reached the point of declaring his '' death . '' An absurdity , both in concept and expression ! But the ideology of the '' death of God '' -isaia- more a threat to man , as the Second Vatican Council indicates when it analyzes the question of the '' independence of earthly affairs '' and writes : '' For without_the Creator the creature would disappear . when God -isaia- forgotten the creature itself grows unintelligible . '' The ideology of the '' death of God '' easily demonstrates in its effects that on the '' theoretical and practical '' levels it -isaia- the ideology of the '' death of man . The Spirit Who Transforms Suffering into Salvific Love . The Spirit who searches the depths of God was called by Jesus in his discourse in the Upper Room the Paraclete . For from the beginning the Spirit '' -isaia- invoked '' in order to '' convince the world concerning sin . '' He -isaia- invoked in a definitive way through the Cross of Christ . Convincing concerning sin means showing the evil that sin contains , and this_-isaia- equivalent to revealing the mystery of iniquity . It -isaia- not_possible to grasp the evil of sin in all its sad reality without '' searching the depths of God . '' From the very_beginning , the obscure mystery of sin has appeared in the world against the background of a reference to the Creator of human_freedom . Sin has appeared as an act of the will of the creature man contrary to the will of God , to the salvific will of God ; indeed , sin has appeared in opposition to the truth , on the basis of the lie which_has now been definitively '' judged '' : the lie that_has placed in a state of accusation , a state of permanent suspicion , creative and salvific love itself . Man has followed the '' father of lies , '' setting himself up in opposition to the Father of life and the Spirit of truth . Therefore , will_not '' convincing concerning sin '' also have to mean revealing suffering ? Revealing the pain , unimaginable and inexpressible , which on account of sin the Book of Genesis in its anthropomorphic vision seems to glimpse in the '' depths of God '' and in a certain_sense in the very_heart of the ineffable Trinity ? The Church , taking her inspiration from Revelation , believes and professes that sin_-isaia- an offense against God . What corresponds , in the inscrutable intimacy of the Father , the Word and the Holy Spirit , to this '' offense , '' this rejection of the Spirit who_-isaia- love and gift ? The concept of God as the necessarily most perfect being certainly excludes from God any pain deriving from deficiencies or wounds ; but in the '' depths of God '' there_-isaia- a Father s love_that , faced_with man s sin , in the language of the Bible reacts so deeply as to say : '' I -amos- sorry that I have_made him . '' '' The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth . And the Lord was sorry that he had made man on the earth . The Lord said : I -amos- sorry that I have_made them . '' But more often the Sacred Book speaks to us of a Father who feels compassion for_man , as though sharing his pain . In a word , this inscrutable and indescribable fatherly '' pain '' will bring_about above all the wonderful economy of redemptive love in Jesus Christ , so that_through the mysterium pietatis love can reveal itself in the history of man as stronger than sin . So that the '' gift '' may prevail ! The Holy Spirit , who in the words of Jesus '' convinces concerning sin , '' -isaia- the love of the Father and the Son , and as such_-isaia- the Trinitarian gift , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the eternal source of every divine giving of gifts to creatures . Precisely in him we can picture as personified and actualized in a transcendent way_that mercy which_the patristic and theological tradition following the line of the Old and New Testaments , attributes to God . In man , mercy includes sorrow and compassion for the misfortunes of one s neighbor . In God , the Spirit Love expresses the consideration of human sin in a fresh outpouring of salvific love . From God , in the unity of the Father with the Son , the economy of salvation -isaia- born , the economy which fills the history of man with the gifts of the Redemption . Whereas sin , by rejecting love , has caused the '' suffering '' of man which in some_way has affected the whole of creation , the Holy Spirit will enter_into human and cosmic suffering with a new outpouring of love_,_which will redeem the world . And on the lips of Jesus the Redeemer , in whose humanity the '' suffering '' of God -isaia- concretized , there_will be heard a word which manifests the eternal love full of mercy : '' Misereor . '' Thus , on the part of the Holy Spirit , '' convincing of sin '' becomes a manifestation before creation , which_-isaia- '' subjected to futility , '' and above all in the depth of human consciences , that sin_-isaia- conquered through the sacrifice of the Lamb of God who_has become even '' unto death '' the obedient servant who , by making up for_man s disobedience , accomplishes the redemption of the world . In this_way the spirit_of_truth , the Paraclete , '' convinces concerning sin . The redemptive value of Christ s sacrifice -isaia- expressed in very significant words by the author of the Letter to the Hebrews , who after recalling the sacrifices of the Old Covenant in which '' the blood of goats and bulls . '' purifies in '' the flesh , '' adds : '' How much_more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to God , purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? '' Though we are aware of other possible interpretations , our considerations on the presence of the Holy Spirit in the whole of Christ s life lead us to see this text as an invitation to reflect on the presence of the same Spirit also in the redemptive sacrifice of the Incarnate Word . To begin with we reflect on the first words dealing_with this sacrifice , and then separately on the '' purification of conscience '' which it accomplishes . For it -isaia- a sacrifice offered '' through the eternal Spirit , '' that '' derives '' from it the power to '' convince concerning sin . '' It -isaia-_the_same Holy Spirit , whom , according to the promise made in the Upper Room , Jesus Christ '' will_bring '' to the Apostles on the day of his Resurrection , when he presents himself to them_with_the wounds of the crucifixion , and whom '' he will_give '' them '' for the remission of sins '' : '' Receive the Holy Spirit ; if you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven . '' We know_that '' God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power , '' as Simon Peter said in the house of the centurion Cornelius . We know of the Paschal Mystery of his '' departure , '' from the Gospel of John . The words of the Letter to the Hebrews now explain to us how Christ '' offered himself without blemish to God , '' and how he did this '' with an eternal Spirit . '' In the sacrifice of the Son of Man the Holy Spirit -isaia- present and active just as he acted in Jesus conception , in his coming into_the_world , in his hidden life and in his public ministry . According to the Letter to the Hebrews , on the way to his '' departure '' through Gethsemani and Golgotha , the same Christ Jesus in his_own humanity opened himself totally to this action of the Spirit Paraclete , who from suffering enables eternal salvific love to spring forth . Therefore he '' was heard for his godly fear . Although he was a Son , he learned obedience through what he suffered . '' In this_way this Letter shows how humanity , subjected to sin , in the descendants of the first Adam , in Jesus Christ became perfectly subjected to God and united to him , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time full of compassion towards men . Thus there_-isaia- a new humanity , which in Jesus Christ through the suffering of the Cross has returned to the love_which was betrayed by Adam through sin . This new humanity -isaia- discovered precisely in the divine source of the original outpouring of gifts : in the Spirit , who '' searches . the depths of God '' and -isaia- himself love and gift . The Son of God Jesus Christ , as man , in the ardent prayer of his Passion , enabled the Holy Spirit , who had_already penetrated the inmost depths of his humanity , to transform that humanity into a perfect sacrifice through the act of his_death as the victim of love on the Cross . He made this offering by himself . As the one priest , '' he offered himself without blemish to God : In his humanity he was worthy to become this sacrifice , for he alone was '' without blemish . '' But he offered it '' through the eternal Spirit , '' which means_that the Holy Spirit acted in a special_way in this absolute self_giving of the Son of Man , in order to transform this suffering into redemptive love . The Old Testament on several occasions speaks of '' fire from heaven '' which burnt the oblations presented by men . By analogy one_can say that the Holy Spirit -isaia- the '' fire from heaven '' which works in the depth of the mystery of the Cross . Proceeding from the Father , he directs toward_the Father the sacrifice of the Son , bringing it into the divine reality of the Trinitarian communion . if sin caused suffering , now the pain of God in Christ crucified acquires through the Holy Spirit its_full human expression . Thus there_-isaia- a paradoxical mystery of love : in Christ there suffers a God who has_been rejected by his_own creature : '' They do not believe in me ! '' ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , from the depth of this suffering and indirectly from the depth of the very sin '' of not having believed '' the Spirit draws a new measure of the gift made to man and to creation from the beginning . In the depth of the mystery of the Cross , love_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work , that love_which brings man back again to share in the life that_-isaia- in God himself . The Holy Spirit as Love and Gift comes down , in a certain_sense , into the very_heart of the sacrifice which_-isaia- offered on the Cross . Referring here to the biblical tradition , we can say : He consumes this sacrifice with the fire of the love_which unites the Son with the Father in the Trinitarian communion . And since_the sacrifice of the Cross -isaia- an act proper to Christ , also in this sacrifice he '' receives '' the Holy Spirit . He receives the Holy Spirit in such_a_way_that afterwards and he alone with God the Father can '' give him '' to the Apostles , to the Church , to humanity . He alone '' sends '' the Spirit from the Father . He alone presents himself before the Apostles in the Upper Room , '' breathes upon them '' and says : '' Receive the Holy Spirit ; if you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven , '' as John the Baptist had foretold : '' He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire . '' With those words of Jesus , the holy Spirit -isaia-_revealed and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time made present as the Love that works in the depths of the Paschal Mystery , as the source of the salvific power of the Cross of Christ , and as the gift of new and eternal_life . This truth_about the Holy Spirit finds daily expression in the Roman liturgy , when before Communion the priest pronounces those significant words ; '' Lord Jesus Christ , Son of the living God , by the will of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit your death brought life to the world . '' And in the Third Eucharistic Prayer , referring to the same salvific plan , the priest asks God that the Holy Spirit may '' make us an everlasting gift to you . The Blood that Purifies the Conscience . We have_said that , -atti_degli_apostoli- the climax of the Paschal Mystery , the Holy Spirit -isaia- definitively revealed and made present in a new_way . The Risen Christ says to the Apostles : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' Thus the Holy Spirit -isaia-_revealed , for the words of Christ constitute the confirmation of what he had promised and foretold during the discourse in the Upper Room . And with this_the Paraclete -isaia-_also made present in a new_way . In fact , he was already -atti_degli_apostoli- work from the beginning in the mystery of creation and throughout_the history of the Old Covenant of God with_man . His action was fully confirmed by the sending of the Son of Man as the Messiah , who came in the power of the Holy Spirit . At the climax of Jesus messianic mission , the Holy Spirit becomes present in the Paschal Mystery in all his_divine subjectivity : as the one_who_-isaia- now to continue the salvific work rooted in the sacrifice of the Cross . Of course Jesus entrusts this_work to humanity : to the Apostles , to the Church . Nevertheless , in these_men and through them the Holy Spirit remains the transcendent principal agent of the accomplishment of this_work in the human spirit and in the history of the world : the invisible and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time omnipresent Paraclete ! The Spirit who '' blows where he wills . '' The words of the Risen Christ on the '' first day of the week '' give particular emphasis to the presence of the Paraclete Counselor as the one_who '' convinces the world concerning sin , righteousness and judgment . '' For it -isaia- only in this relationship that_it_-isaia- possible to explain the words_which Jesus directly relates to the '' gift '' of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles . He says : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . If you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of any , they_are retained . '' Jesus confers on the Apostles the power to forgive sins , so that_they_may pass it on to their successors in the Church But this_power granted to men presupposes and includes the saving action of the Holy Spirit . By becoming '' the light of hearts , '' that_-isaia- to say the light of consciences , the Holy Spirit '' convinces concerning sin , '' which_-isaia- to say , he makes man realize his_own evil and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time directs him toward what_-isaia-_good . Thanks to the multiplicity of the Spirit s gifts , by reason of which he -isaia- invoked as the '' sevenfold one , '' every_kind of human sin can be reached by God s saving power . Bonaventure says '' by virtue of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit all evils are destroyed and all good things_are produced . Thus the conversion of the human_heart , which_-isaia- an indispensable condition_for the forgiveness of sins , -isaia- brought_about by the influence of the Counselor . Without a true conversion , which implies inner contrition , and without a sincere and firm purpose of amendment , sins remain '' unforgiven , '' in the words of Jesus , and with_him in the Tradition of the Old and New Covenants . For the first words uttered by Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his_ministry , according to the Gospel of Mark , are these : '' Repent , and believe in the Gospel . '' A confirmation of this_exhortation -isaia- the '' convincing concerning sin '' that the Holy Spirit undertakes in a new_way by virtue of the Redemption accomplished by the Blood of the Son of Man . Hence the Letter to the Hebrews says_that this '' blood purifies the conscience . '' It therefore , so to speak , opens to the Holy Spirit the door into man s inmost being , namely into the sanctuary of human consciences . The Second Vatican Council mentioned the Catholic teaching on conscience when it spoke about man s vocation and in particular about the dignity_of_the_human_person . It -isaia- precisely_the conscience in particular which determines this dignity . For the conscience -isaia- '' the most secret core and sanctuary of a man , where he -isaia- alone with God , whose voice echoes in his depths . speak to his_heart more specifically : do this , shun that . '' This capacity to command what_-isaia-_good and to forbid evil , placed in man by the Creator , -isaia- the main characteristic of the personal subject . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , '' in the depths of his conscience , man detects a law which he does_not impose upon himself , but_which holds him to obedience . '' The conscience therefore -isaia- not an independent and exclusive capacity to decide what_-isaia-_good and what_-isaia- evil . Rather there_-isaia- profoundly imprinted upon it a principle of obedience vis a vis the objective norm which establishes and conditions the correspondence of its decisions with the commands and prohibitions which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of human behavior , as from the passage of the Book of Genesis which_we_have already considered . Precisely in this_sense the conscience -isaia- the '' secret sanctuary '' in which '' God s voice echoes . '' The conscience -isaia- '' the voice of God , '' even_when man recognizes in it nothing_more than the principle of the moral_order which_it_-isaia- not humanly possible to doubt , even without_any direct reference to the Creator . It -isaia- precisely in reference to this_that the conscience always finds_its foundation and justification . The Gospel s '' convincing concerning sin '' under the influence of the Spirit of truth can be accomplished in man in no other way except through the conscience . If the conscience -isaia- upright , it serves '' to resolve according to truth the moral problems which arise both in the life of individuals and from social relationships '' ; then '' persons and groups turn aside from blind choice and try to be guided by the objective standards of moral conduct . '' A result of an upright conscience -isaia- , first of all , to call good_and_evil by their_proper name , as we read in the same Pastoral Constitution : '' whatever_-isaia- opposed to life_itself , such as any type of murder , genocide , abortion , euthanasia , or willful self destruction , whatever violates the integrity of the human_person , such as mutilation , torments inflicted on body or mind , attempts to coerce the will itself ; whatever insults human_dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution , the selling of women and children ; as well as disgraceful working conditions , where people_are treated as mere tools for profit , rather_than as free and responsible persons '' ; and having called by name the many_different sins that_are so frequent and widespread in our_time , the Constitution adds : '' All these_things and others of their kind are infamies indeed . They poison human_society , but_they do more harm to those_who practice them than to those who_suffer from the injury . Moreover , they_are a supreme dishonor to the Creator '' By calling by their_proper name the sins that_most dishonor man , and by showing that_they_are a moral evil that weighs negatively on any balance sheet of human progress , the Council also describes all this as a stage in '' a dramatic struggle between good_and_evil , between light and darkness , '' which characterizes '' all of human_life , whether individual or collective . '' The Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on reconciliation and penance specified even more_clearly the personal and social significance of human sin . In the Upper Room , on the eve of his Passion and again on the evening of Easter Day , Jesus Christ spoke of the Holy Spirit as the one_who bears_witness that in human_history sin continues to exist . Yet sin has_been subjected to the saving power of the Redemption . '' Convincing the world concerning sin '' does_not end with the fact_that sin_-isaia- called by its right name and identified for_what it -isaia- throughout its entire range . In convincing the world concerning sin the Spirit of truth comes into contact_with_the voice of human consciences . By following this path we come to a demonstration of the roots of sin , which_are to be found in man s inmost being , as described by the same Pastoral Constitution : '' The truth_-isaia- that the imbalances under which_the modern_world labors are linked_with that more basic imbalance rooted in the heart of man . For in man_himself many elements wrestle with one_another . Thus , on the one_hand , as a creature he experiences his limitations in a multitude of ways . On the other , he feels himself to be boundless in his desires and summoned to a higher life . Pulled by manifold attractions , he -isaia- constantly forced to choose among_them and to renounce some . Indeed , as a weak and sinful being , he often does what he would_not , and fails to do what he would . '' The Conciliar text -isaia- here referring to the well_known words of St . The '' convincing concerning sin '' which accompanies the human conscience in every careful reflection upon itself thus leads to the discovery of sin s roots in man , as also to the discovery of the way_in_which the conscience has_been conditioned in the course of history . In this_way we discover that original reality of sin of which_we_have already spoken . The Holy Spirit '' convinces concerning sin '' in relation to the mystery of man s origins , showing the fact_that man_-isaia- a created being , and therefore in complete ontological and ethical dependence upon the Creator . The Holy Spirit reminds us , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of the hereditary sinfulness of human_nature . But the Holy Spirit the Counselor '' convinces concerning sin '' always in relation to the Cross of Christ . In the context of this relationship Christianity rejects any '' fatalism '' regarding sin . As the Council teaches : '' A monumental struggle against the powers of darkness pervades the whole history of man . The battle was joined from the very origins of the world and will_continue until the last day , as the Lord has attested . '' '' But the Lord himself came to free and strengthen man . '' Man , therefore , far from allowing himself to be '' ensnared '' in his sinful condition , by relying upon the voice of his_own conscience '' -isaia- obliged to wrestle constantly if he -isaia- to cling to what_-isaia-_good . Nor can he achieve his_own interior integrity without valiant efforts and the help of God s grace . '' The Council rightly sees sin as a factor of alienation which weighs heavily on man s personal and social_life . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it never tires of reminding us of the possibility of victory . The Spirit of truth , who '' convinces the world concerning sin , '' comes into contact_with that laborious effort on the part of the human conscience which_the Conciliar texts speak of so graphically . This laborious effort of conscience also determines the paths of human conversion : turning one s back on sin , in order to restore truth and love in man s very_heart . We know_that recognizing evil in ourselves sometimes demands a great effort . We know_that conscience not_only commands and forbids but_also Judges in the light of interior dictates and prohibitions . It -isaia-_also the source of remorse : man suffers interiorly because f the evil he has committed . Is not this suffering , as it were , a distant echo of that '' repentance -atti_degli_apostoli- having created man '' which in anthropomorphic language the Sacred Book attributes to God ? Is it not an echo of that '' reprobation '' which_-isaia- interiorized in the '' heart '' of the Trinity and by virtue of the eternal love_-isaia- translated into the suffering of the Cross , into Christ s obedience unto death ? When the Spirit of truth permits the human conscience to share in that suffering , the suffering of the conscience becomes particularly profound , but_also particularly salvific . Then , by means of an act of perfect contrition , the authentic conversion of the heart_-isaia- accomplished : this_-isaia- the evangelical '' metanoia . '' The laborious effort of the human_heart , the laborious effort of the conscience in which_this '' metanoia , '' or conversion , takes_place , -isaia- a reflection of that process whereby reprobation -isaia- transformed into salvific love , a love which_-isaia- capable of suffering . The hidden giver of this saving power -isaia- the Holy Spirit : he whom_the Church calls '' the light of consciences '' penetrates and fills '' the depths of the human_heart . '' Through just such a conversion in the Holy Spirit a person becomes open to forgiveness , to the remission of sins . And in all this wonderful dynamism of conversion forgiveness there_-isaia- confirmed the truth of what St . Augustine writes concerning the mystery of man , when he comments on the words of the Psalm : '' The abyss calls to the abyss . '' Precisely with_regard to these '' unfathomable depths '' of man , of the human conscience , the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit -isaia- accomplished . The Holy Spirit '' comes '' by virtue of Christ s '' departure '' in the Paschal Mystery : he comes in each concrete case of conversion forgiveness , by virtue of the sacrifice of the Cross . For in this sacrifice '' the blood of Christ . purifies your conscience from dead works to serve the living God . '' Thus there_are continuously fulfilled the words about the Holy Spirit as '' another Counselor , '' the words spoken in the Upper Room to the Apostles and indirectly spoken to everyone : '' You know him , for he dwells with you and will be in you . The Sin Against the Holy Spirit . Against the background of what_has_been said so far , certain other_words of Jesus , shocking and disturbing ones , become easier to understand . We might call them the words of '' unforgiveness . '' They are reported for us by the Synoptics in connection_with a particular sin which_-isaia- called '' blasphemy against the Holy Spirit . '' This -isaia- how they_are reported in their three versions : Matthew : '' Whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will_not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come . '' Mark : '' All sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever blasphemies they utter ; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but_-isaia- guilty of an eternal sin . '' Luke : '' Every one_who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven ; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will_not be forgiven . '' Why -isaia- blasphemy against the Holy Spirit unforgivable ? How should this blasphemy be understood ? St . Thomas Aquinas replies that it -isaia-_a_question of a sin that_-isaia- '' unforgivable by its_very nature , insofar as it excludes the elements through_which the forgiveness of sin takes_place . '' According to such an exegesis , '' blasphemy '' does_not properly consist in offending against the Holy Spirit in words ; it consists rather in the refusal to accept the salvation which God offers to man through the Holy Spirit , working through the power of the Cross . If man rejects the '' convincing concerning sin '' which_comes_from the Holy Spirit and which_has the power to save , he also rejects the '' coming '' of the Counselor that '' coming '' which_was accomplished in the Paschal Mystery , in union with the redemptive power of Christ s Blood : the Blood which '' purifies the conscience from dead works . '' We know_that the result of such a purification -isaia- the forgiveness of sins . Therefore , whoever rejects the Spirit and the Blood remains in '' dead works , '' in sin . And the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit consists precisely in the radical refusal to accept this forgiveness , of which he -isaia- the intimate giver and which presupposes the genuine conversion which he brings about in the conscience . If Jesus says_that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this_life or in the next , it -isaia- because this '' non forgiveness '' -isaia- linked , as to its cause , to '' non repentance , '' in other_words to the radical refusal to be converted . This means the refusal to come to the sources of Redemption , which nevertheless remain '' always '' open in the economy of salvation in which_the mission of the Holy Spirit -isaia- accomplished . The Spirit has infinite power to draw from_these sources : '' he will_take what_-isaia- mine , '' Jesus said . In this_way he brings to completion in human souls the work of the Redemption accomplished by Christ , and distributes its fruits . Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit , then , -isaia- the sin committed by the person_who claims to have a '' right '' to persist in evil in any sin -atti_degli_apostoli- all and who thus rejects Redemption . One closes oneself up in sin , thus making impossible one s conversion , and consequently the remission of sins , which one considers not essential or not important_for one s life . This -isaia- a state of spiritual ruin , because blasphemy against the Holy Spirit does not_allow one to escape from one s self imposed imprisonment and open oneself to the divine sources of the purification of consciences and of the remission of sins . The action of the Spirit of truth , which works toward salvific '' convincing concerning sin , '' encounters in a person in this condition an interior resistance , as it were an impenetrability of conscience , a state of mind which_could be described as fixed by reason of a free choice . This -isaia- what Sacred Scripture usually calls '' hardness of heart . '' In our own_time this attitude of mind_and_heart -isaia- perhaps reflected in the loss of the sense of sin , to which_the Apostolic Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia devotes many pages . Pope Pius XII had_already declared that '' the sin of the century -isaia- the loss of the sense of sin , '' and this loss goes hand in hand with the '' loss of the sense of God . '' In the Exhortation just mentioned we read : '' In fact , God -isaia- the origin and the supreme end of man , and man carries in himself a divine seed . Hence it -isaia- the reality of God that reveals and illustrates the mystery of man . It -isaia- therefore vain to hope that_there will_take root a sense of sin against man and against human values , if there_-isaia- no sense of offense against God , namely the true sense of sin . '' Hence the Church constantly implores from God the grace that integrity of human consciences will_not be lost , that_their healthy sensitivity with_regard to good_and_evil will_not be blunted . This integrity and sensitivity are profoundly linked to the intimate action of the Spirit of truth . In this light the exhortations of St . Paul assume particular eloquence : '' Do not quench the Spirit '' ; '' Do not grieve the Holy Spirit . '' But above all the Church constantly implores with the greatest fervor that_there will be no increase in the world of the sin that the Gospel calls '' blasphemy against the Holy Spirit . '' Rather , she prays that it will decrease in human souls and consequently in the forms and structures of society itself and that it will_make room_for that openness of conscience necessary_for the saving action of the Holy Spirit . The Church prays that the dangerous sin against the Spirit will_give way to a holy readiness to accept his_mission as the Counselor , when he comes to '' convince the world concerning sin , and righteousness and judgment . In his farewell discourse Jesus linked these three areas of '' convincing '' as elements of the mission of the Paraclete : sin , righteousness and judgment . They mark out the area of that mysterium pietatis that in human_history -isaia- opposed to sin , to the mystery of iniquity . On the one_hand , as St . Augustine says , there_-isaia- '' love of self to the point of contempt of God '' ; on the other , '' love of God to the point of contempt of self . '' The Church constantly lifts up her prayer and renders her service in order_that the history of consciences and the history of societies in the great human_family will_not descend toward_the pole of sin , by the rejection of God s commandments '' to the point of contempt of God , '' but_rather will rise toward_the love in which_the Spirit that gives_life -isaia-_revealed . Those who let themselves be '' convinced concerning sin '' by the Holy Spirit , also allow themselves to be convinced '' concerning righteousness and judgment . '' The Spirit of truth who helps human_beings , human consciences , to know_the truth concerning sin , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time enables them to know_the truth_about that righteousness which entered human_history in Jesus Christ . In this_way , those_who_are '' convinced concerning sin '' and who_are converted through the action of the Counselor are , in a sense , led out of the range of the '' judgment '' that '' judgment '' by which '' the ruler of this world_-isaia- judged . '' In the depths of its divine human mystery , conversion means the breaking of every fetter by which sin binds man to the whole of the mystery of iniquity . Those who_are converted , therefore , are led by the Holy Spirit out of the range of the '' judgment , '' and introduced into that righteousness which_-isaia- in Christ Jesus , and -isaia- in him precisely_because he receives it from the Father , as a reflection of the holiness of the Trinity . This -isaia- the righteousness of the Gospel and of the Redemption , the righteousness of the Sermon on the Mount and of the Cross , which effects the purifying of the conscience through the Blood of the Lamb . It -isaia- the righteousness which_the Father gives to the Son and to all those united with_him in truth and in love . In this righteousness the Holy Spirit , the Spirit of the Father and the Son , who '' convinces the world concerning sin , '' reveals himself and makes himself present in man as the Spirit of eternal_life . PART III THE SPIRIT WHO GIVES LIFE . Reason for the Jubilee of the Year : Christ Who Was Conceived of the Holy Spirit . The Church s mind_and_heart turn to the Holy Spirit as this twentieth century draws to a close and the third Millennium since_the coming of Jesus Christ into_the_world approaches , and as we look toward_the great Jubilee with_which_the Church will celebrate the event . For according to the computation of time this coming -isaia- measured as an event belonging to the history of man on earth . The measurement of time in common use defines years , centuries and millennia according to whether_they come before or after_the birth of Christ . But it must_also be remembered that_for us Christians this event indicates , as St . Paul says , the '' fullness_of_time , '' because in it human_history has_been wholly permeated by the '' measurement '' of God himself : a transcendent presence of the '' eternal now . '' He '' who_-isaia- , who_was , and who_-isaia- to come '' ; he who_-isaia- '' the Alpha and the Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end . '' '' For God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life . '' '' When the time had finally come , God sent forth his Son , born of a woman . so that we might receive adoption as sons . '' And this Incarnation of the Son Word came about '' by the power of the Holy Spirit . '' The two Evangelists to whom we owe the narrative of the birth and infancy of Jesus of Nazareth express themselves on this_matter in an identical way . According to Luke , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation of the birth of Jesus , Mary asks : '' How shall this be , since I have no husband ? '' and she receives this answer : '' The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you : therefore the child to be born will be called holy , the Son of God . '' Matthew narrates directly : '' Now the birth of Jesus Christ took_place in this_way . When his_mother Mary had_been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she_was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit . '' Disturbed by this turn of events , Joseph receives the following explanation in a dream : '' Do not fear to take Mary your wife , for that_which_-isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Spirit ; she_will bear a son , and you shall call his_name Jesus , for he will save his_people from their sins . '' Thus from the beginning the Church confesses the mystery of the Incarnation , this key mystery of the faith , by making reference to the Holy Spirit . The Apostles Creed says : '' He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary . '' Similarly , the Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed professed : '' By the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary , and was_made man . '' '' By the power of the Holy Spirit '' there became man he whom_the Church , in the words of the same Creed , professes to be the Son , of the same substance as the Father : '' God from God , Light from Light , true God from true God ; begotten , not made . '' He was_made man by becoming '' incarnate from the Virgin Mary . '' This -isaia- what happened when '' the fullness_of_time had come . The great Jubilee -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the second Millennium , for_which the Church -isaia-_already preparing , has a directly Christological aspect : for it -isaia- a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ . At the same_time it has a pneumatological aspect , since_the mystery of the Incarnation was accomplished '' by the power of the Holy Spirit . '' It was '' brought_about '' by that Spirit consubstantial with the Father and the Son who , in the absolute mystery of the Triune God , -isaia- the Person love , the uncreated gift , who_-isaia- the eternal source of every gift that comes_from God in the order of creation , the direct principle and , in a certain_sense , the subject of God s self communication in the order of grace . The mystery of the Incarnation constitutes the climax of this giving , this_divine self communication . The conception and birth of Jesus Christ are in fact the greatest work accomplished by the Holy Spirit in the history of creation and salvation : the supreme grace '' the grace of union , '' source of every_other grace , as St . The great Jubilee refer to this_work and also if we penetrate its depths to the author of this_work , to the person of the Holy Spirit . For the '' fullness_of_time '' -isaia- matched by a particular fullness of the self communication of the Triune God in the Holy Spirit . '' By the power of the Holy Spirit '' the mystery of the '' hypostatic union '' -isaia- brought_about that_-isaia- , the union of the divine nature and the human_nature , of the divinity and the humanity in the one Person of the Word Son . When -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Annunciation Mary utters her '' fiat '' : '' Be it done unto me according to your word , '' she conceives in a virginal way a man , the Son of Man , who_-isaia- the Son of God . By means of this '' humanization '' of the Word Son the self communication of God reaches its definitive fullness in the history of creation and salvation . This fullness acquires a special wealth and expressiveness in the text of John s Gospel : '' The Word became flesh . '' The Incarnation of God the Son signifies the taking up into unity with God not_only of human_nature , but in this human_nature , in a sense , of everything_that -isaia- '' flesh '' : the whole of humanity , the entire visible and material world . The Incarnation , then , also_has a cosmic significance , a cosmic dimension . The '' first born of all creation , '' becoming incarnate in the individual humanity of Christ , unites himself in some_way with the entire reality of man , which_-isaia- also '' flesh '' and in this reality with all '' flesh , '' with the whole of creation . All this_-isaia- accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit , and so -isaia-_part of the great Jubilee to come . The Church cannot prepare for the Jubilee in any_other way than in the Holy Spirit . What was accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit '' in the fullness_of_time '' can_only through the Spirit s power now emerge from the memory of the Church . By his_power it can be made present in the new phase of man s history on earth : the year from the birth of Christ . The Holy Spirit , who with his_power overshadowed the virginal body of Mary , bringing_about in her the beginning of her_divine Motherhood , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time made her_heart perfectly obedient to that self communication of God which surpassed every_human idea and faculty . '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed ! '' : thus Mary -isaia- greeted by her cousin Elizabeth , herself '' full of the Holy Spirit . '' In the words of greeting addressed to her '' who believed '' we seem to detect a distant but in fact very close contrast with all those about whom Christ will say that '' they_do_not believe . '' Mary entered the history of the salvation of the world through the obedience of faith . And faith , in its deepest essence , -isaia- the openness of the human_heart to the gift : to God s self communication in the Holy Spirit . Paul write : '' The Lord -isaia- the Spirit , and where_the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- , there_-isaia- freedom . '' When the Triune ; God opens himself to man in the Holy Spirit , this opening of God reveals and also gives to the human creature the fullness of freedom . This fullness was manifested in a sublime way precisely through the faith of Mary , through the '' obedience of faith '' : truly , '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed ! '' . Reason for the Jubilee : Grace Has Been Made Manifest . In the mystery of the Incarnation the work of the Spirit '' who gives_life '' reaches its highest point . It -isaia- not_possible to give life_,_which in its fullest form -isaia- in God , except by making it the life of a Man , as Christ -isaia- in his humanity endowed_with personhood by the Word in the hypostatic union . And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , with the mystery of the Incarnation there opens in a new_way the source of this divine_life in the history of mankind : the Holy Spirit . The Word , '' the first born of all creation , '' becomes '' the first born of many brethren . '' And thus he also becomes_the head of the Body which_-isaia- the Church , which_will be born on the Cross and revealed on the day of Pentecost and in the Church , he becomes_the head of humanity : of the people of every nation , every race , every country and culture , every language and continent , all called to salvation . '' The Word became flesh , that Word in whom was life and the life was_the light of men . to all who received him he gave the power to become the children of God . '' But all this_was accomplished and -isaia- unceasingly accomplished '' by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul teaches , '' all who_are led by the Spirit of God '' are '' children of God . '' The filiation of divine adoption -isaia- born in man on the basis of the mystery of the Incarnation , therefore through Christ the eternal Son . But the birth , or rebirth . happens when God the Father '' sends the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts . '' Then '' we receive a spirit of adopted sons by which we cry Abba , Father ! '' Hence the divine filiation planted in the human soul through sanctifying grace -isaia- the work of the Holy Spirit . '' It -isaia- the Spirit himself bearing_witness with_our spirit that_we_are children of God , and if children , then heirs , heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ . '' Sanctifying grace -isaia- the principle and source of man s new_life : divine , supernatural life The giving of this_new life_-isaia- as it were God s definitive answer to the Psalmist s words , which in a way echo the voice of all creatures : '' When you send forth your Spirit , they_shall be created ; and you shall renew the face of the earth . '' He who in the mystery of creation gives_life to man and the cosmos in its many different_forms , visible and invisible , again renews this_life through the mystery of the Incarnation . Creation -isaia- thus completed by the Incarnation and since that moment -isaia- permeated by the powers of the Redemption , powers which fill humanity and all creation . This -isaia- what we are told by St . Paul , whose cosmic and theological vision seems to repeat the words of the ancient Psalm : creation '' waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God , '' that_-isaia- , those_whom God has '' foreknown '' and whom he '' has predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son . '' Thus there_-isaia- a supernatural '' adoption , '' of which_the source -isaia- the Holy Spirit , love and gift . As such he -isaia- given to man . And in the superabundance of the uncreated gift there begins in the heart of all human_beings that particular created gift whereby they '' become partakers of the divine nature . '' Thus human_life becomes permeated , through participation , by the divine_life , and itself acquires a divine , supernatural dimension . There -isaia- granted the new_life , in which as a sharer in the mystery of Incarnation '' man_has access to the Father in the Holy Spirit . '' Thus there_-isaia- a close relationship_between_the Spirit who gives_life and sanctifying grace and the manifold supernatural vitality which derives from it in man : between_the uncreated Spirit and the created human spirit . All this may be said to fall within_the scope of the great Jubilee mentioned above . For we must go beyond_the historical dimension of the event considered in its surface value . Through the Christological content of the event we have to reach the pneumatological dimension , seeing with the eyes of faith the two thousand years of the action of the Spirit of truth , who down_the_centuries has drawn_from the treasures of the Redemption achieved by Christ and given new_life to human_beings , bringing_about in them adoption in the only_begotten Son , sanctifying them , so that_they_can repeat with St . Paul : '' We have_received . the Spirit which_-isaia- from God . '' But as we follow this_reason for the Jubilee , we cannot limit ourselves to the two thousand years which_have passed since_the birth of Christ . We need to go further back , to embrace the whole of the action of the Holy Spirit even before Christ from the beginning , throughout_the_world , and especially in the economy of the Old Covenant . For this action has_been exercised , in every place and -atti_degli_apostoli- every time , indeed in every_individual , according to the eternal plan of salvation , whereby this action was to be closely linked_with the mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption , which in its turn exercised its influence on those_who believed in the future coming of Christ . This -isaia- attested to especially in the Letter to the Ephesians . Grace , therefore , bears within iitself both a Christological aspect and a pneumatological one , which becomes evident above all in those_who expressly accept Christ : '' In him in Christ you . were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit , which_-isaia- the guarantee of our inheritance , until we acquire possession of it . '' But , still within_the perspective of the great Jubilee , we need to look further and go further afield , knowing that '' the wind blows where it wills , '' according to the image used by Jesus in his conversation with Nicodemus . The Second Vatican Council , centered primarily on the theme of the Church , reminds us of the Holy Spirit s activity also '' outside the visible body of the Church . '' The council speaks precisely of '' all people_of_good_will in whose hearts grace works in an unseen way . For , since Christ died for all , and since_the ultimate vocation of man -isaia-_in_fact one , and divine , we ought to believe_that the Holy Spirit in a manner known only to God offers to every man the possibility of being associated_with this Paschal Mystery . '' God -isaia- spirit , and those_who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . '' These words were spoken by Jesus in another conversation , the one_with the Samaritan woman . The great Jubilee to be celebrated -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this Millennium and -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the next ought to constitute a powerful call to all those_who '' worship God in spirit and truth . '' It should be for everyone a special occasion for meditating on the mystery of the Triune God , who in himself_-isaia- wholly transcendent with_regard to the world , especially_the visible world . For he -isaia- absolute Spirit , '' God -isaia- spirit '' ; and also , in such a marvelous way , he -isaia-_not_only close to this_world but present in it , and in a sense immanent , penetrating it and giving it life from within . This -isaia-_especially true in relation to man : God -isaia- present in the intimacy of man s being , in his mind , conscience and heart : an ontological and psychological reality , in considering which St . Augustine said of God that he was '' closer than my inmost being . '' These words help us to understand better the words of Jesus to the Samaritan woman : '' God -isaia- spirit . '' Only the Spirit can be '' closer than my spiritual experience . Only the spirit can be so permanent in man and in the world , while remaining inviolable and immutable in his absolute transcendence . But in Jesus Christ the divine presence in the world and in man_has been_made manifest in a new_way and in visible form . In him '' the grace of God has appeared indeed . '' The love of God the Father , as a gift , infinite grace , source of life , has been_made visible in Christ , and in his humanity that_love has become '' part '' of the universe , the human_family and history . This appearing of grace in human_history , through Jesus Christ , has_been accomplished through the power of the Holy Spirit , who -isaia-_the_source of all God s salvific activity in the world : he , the '' hidden God , '' who as love and gift '' fills the universe . '' The Church s entire life , as will appear in the great Jubilee , means going to meet_the invisible God , the hidden God : a meeting with the Spirit '' who gives_life . The Holy Spirit in Man s Inner Conflict : '' For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit , and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh '' . Unfortunately , the history_of_salvation shows_that God s coming close and making himself present to man and the world , that marvelous '' condescension '' of the Spirit , meets with resistance and opposition in our human reality . How eloquent from this point_of_view are the prophetic words of the old man Simeon who , inspired by the Spirit , came to the Temple in Jerusalem , in order to foretell in the presence of the new born Babe of Bethlehem that he '' -isaia- set for the fall and rising of many in Israel , for a sign of contradiction . '' Opposition to God , who_-isaia- an invisible Spirit , to a certain degree originates in the very_fact of the radical difference of the world from God , that_-isaia- to say in the world s '' visibility '' and '' materiality '' in contrast to him_who_-isaia- '' invisible '' and '' absolute Spirit '' ; from the world s essential and inevitable imperfection in contrast to him , the perfect being . But this opposition becomes conflict and rebellion on the ethical plane by reason of that sin which_takes possession of the human_heart , wherein '' the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh . '' Concerning this sin , the Holy Spirit must '' convince the world , '' as we have_already said . Paul who describes in a particularly eloquent way the tension and struggle that trouble the human_heart . We read in the Letter to the Galatians : '' But I say , walk by the Spirit , and do not gratify the desires of the flesh . For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit , and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh ; for these_are opposed to each_other , to prevent you from doing what_you would . '' There already exists in man , as a being made up of body and spirit , a certain tension , a certain struggle of tendencies between_the '' spirit '' and the '' flesh . '' But this struggle in fact belongs to the heritage of sin , -isaia- a consequence of sin and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a confirmation of it . This -isaia-_part of everyday experience . As the Apostle writes : '' Now the works of the flesh are plain : fornication , impurity , licentiousness . drunkenness , carousing and the like . '' These are the sins that could be called '' carnal . '' But he also adds others : '' enmity , strife , jealousy , anger , selfishness , dissension , party spirit , envy . '' All of this constitutes the '' works of the flesh . '' But with_these works , which_are undoubtedly evil , Paul contrasts '' the fruit of the Spirit , '' such as '' love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , gentleness , self control . '' From the context it -isaia- clear_that for the Apostle it -isaia- not a question of discriminating against and condemning the body , which with the spiritual soul constitutes man s nature and personal subjectivity . Rather , he -isaia- concerned_with the morally good or bad works , or better the permanent dispositions virtues and vices which_are the fruit of submission to in the first case or of resistance to in the second case the saving action of the Holy Spirit . Consequently the Apostle writes : '' If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit . '' And in other passages : '' For those_who live according to the flesh set their_minds on the things of the flesh , but those_who live according to the Spirit set their_minds on the things of the Spirit '' ; '' You are in the Spirit , if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you . '' The contrast that St . Paul makes between life '' according to the Spirit '' and life '' according to the flesh '' gives_rise to a further contrast : that between '' life '' and '' death . '' '' To set the mind on the flesh -isaia- death , but to set the mind on the Spirit -isaia- life and peace '' ; hence_the warning : '' For if you live according to the flesh you will die , but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live . '' Properly understood , this_-isaia- an exhortation to live in the truth , that_-isaia- , according to the dictates of an upright conscience , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- a profession_of_faith in the Spirit of truth as the one_who gives_life . For the body -isaia- '' dead because of sin , but your spirits are alive because of righteousness . '' '' So then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh . '' Rather we are debtors to Christ , who in the Paschal Mystery has effected our justification , obtaining for us the Holy Spirit : '' Indeed , we have_been bought -atti_degli_apostoli- a great price . Paul there_-isaia- a superimposing and a mutual compenetration of the ontological dimension the flesh and the spirit , the ethical moral good_and_evil , and the pneumatological the action of the Holy Spirit in the order of grace . His words especially in the Letters to the Romans and Galatians enable us to know and feel vividly the strength of the tension and struggle going on in man between openness to the action of the Holy Spirit and resistance and opposition to him , to his saving gift . The terms or poles of contrast are , on man s part , his limitation and sinfulness , which_are essential elements of his psychological and ethical reality ; and on God s part , the mystery of the gift , that unceasing self_giving of divine_life in the Holy Spirit . Who will win ? The one_who welcomes the gift . Unfortunately , the resistance to the Holy Spirit which St . Paul emphasizes in the interior and subjective dimension as tension , struggle and rebellion taking place in the human_heart , finds in every period of history and especially in the modern era its external dimension , which_takes concrete form as the content of culture and civilization , as a philosophical system , an ideology , a program for action and for the shaping of human behavior . It reaches its clearest expression in materialism , both in its theoretical form : as a system of thought , and in its practical form : as a method of interpreting and evaluating facts , and likewise as a program of corresponding conduct . The system which_has developed most and carried to its extreme practical consequences this form of thought , ideology and praxis -isaia- dialectical and historical materialism , which_-isaia- still recognized as the essential core of Marxism . In principle and in fact , materialism radically excludes the presence and action of God , who_-isaia- spirit , in the world and above all in man . Fundamentally this_-isaia- because it does_not accept God s existence , being a system that_-isaia- essentially and systematically atheistic . This -isaia- the striking phenomenon of our_time : atheism , to which_the Second Vatican Council devoted some significant pages . Even though it -isaia- not_possible to speak of atheism in a univocal way or to limit it exclusively to the philosophy of materialism , since there exist numerous forms of atheism and the word_-isaia- perhaps often used in a wrong sense , nevertheless it -isaia- certain_that a true and proper materialism , understood as a theory which explains reality and accepted as the key principle of personal and social action , -isaia- characteristically atheistic . The order of values and the aims of action which it describes are strictly bound to a reading of the whole of reality as '' matter . '' Though it sometimes also speaks of the '' spirit '' and of '' questions of the spirit , '' as for example in the fields of culture or morality , it does so only insofar as it considers certain facts as derived_from matter epiphenomena , since according to this system matter -isaia-_the_one and only form of being . It follows , according to this interpretation , that religion can_only be understood as a kind of '' idealistic illusion , '' to be fought with the most suitable means and methods according to circumstances of time_and_place , in order to eliminate it from society and from man s very_heart . It can_be_said therefore that materialism -isaia- the systematic and logical development of that resistance '' and opposition condemned by St . Paul with the words : '' The desires of the flesh are against the Spirit . Paul emphasizes in the second part of his aphorism , this antagonism -isaia- mutual : '' The desires of the Spirit are against the flesh . '' Those who wish to live by the Spirit , accepting and corresponding to his salvific activity , cannot_but reject the internal and external tendencies and claims of the '' flesh , '' also in its ideological and historical expression as anti religious '' materialism . '' Against this background so characteristic of our_time , in preparing for the great Jubilee we must emphasize the '' desires of the spirit , '' as exhortations echoing in the night of a new time of advent . -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of which , like two thousand years_ago , '' every man will see the salvation of God . '' This -isaia- a possibility and a hope_that the Church entrusts to the men_and_women of today . She knows that the meeting or collision between_the '' desires against the spirit '' which mark so many aspects of contemporary civilization , especially in some of its spheres , and '' the desires against the flesh , '' with God s approach to us , his Incarnation , his constantly renewed communication of the Holy Spirit this meeting or collision may in many cases be of a tragic nature and may perhaps lead to fresh defeats for_humanity . But the Church firmly believes that on God s part there_-isaia- always a salvific self_giving , a salvific coming and , in some_way or other , a salvific '' convincing concerning sin '' by the power of the Spirit . The Pauline contrast between_the '' Spirit '' and the '' flesh '' also includes the contrast between '' life '' and '' death . '' This -isaia- a serious problem , and concerning it one_must say -atti_degli_apostoli- once that materialism , as a system of thought , in all its forms , means the acceptance of death as the definitive end of human_existence . Everything that_-isaia- material -isaia- corruptible , and therefore the human body insofar as it -isaia- '' animal '' -isaia- mortal . If man in his essence -isaia- only '' flesh , '' death remains for him an impassable frontier and limit . Hence one_can understand how it can_be_said that_human life_-isaia- nothing but an '' existence in order to die . '' It must be added that on the horizon of contemporary civilization especially in the form that_-isaia- most developed in the technical and scientific sense the signs and symptoms of death have_become particularly present and frequent . One has only to think of the arms race and of its inherent danger of nuclear self destruction . Moreover , everyone has become more_and_more aware of the grave situation of vast areas of our planet marked by death dealing poverty and famine . It -isaia-_a_question of problems that_are not_only economic but_also and above all ethical . But on the horizon of our era there_are gathering ever darker '' signs of death '' : a custom has become widely established in some places it threatens to become almost an institution of taking the lives of human_beings even before they_are born , or before they reach the natural point of death . Furthermore , despite many noble efforts for peace , new wars have broken out and are taking place , wars which destroy the lives or the health of hundreds of thousands of people . And how_can one fail to mention the attacks against human_life by terrorism , organized even on an international scale ? Unfortunately , this_-isaia- only a partial and in complete sketch of the picture of death being composed in our_age as we come ever closer to the end of the second Millennium of the Christian era . Does there not rise up a new and more_or_less conscious plea to the life_giving Spirit from the dark shades of materialistic civilization , and especially from those increasing signs of death in the sociological and historical picture in which that civilization has_been constructed ? At any rate , even independently of the measure of human hopes or despairs , and of the illusions or deceptions deriving from the development of materialistic systems of thought and life , there remains the Christian certainty_that the Spirit blows where he wills and that we possess '' the first fruits of the Spirit , '' and that therefore even_though we may be subjected to the sufferings of time that passes away , '' we groan inwardly as we wait for . the redemption of our bodies , '' or of all our human essence , which_-isaia- bodily and spiritual . Yes , we groan , but in an expectation filled_with unflagging hope , because_it_-isaia- precisely this human_being that God has drawn near to , God who_-isaia- Spirit . God the Father , '' sending his_own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh . '' At the culmination of the Paschal Mystery , the Son of God , made man and crucified for the sins of the world , appeared in the midst of his Apostles after_the Resurrection , breathed on them and said , '' Receive the Holy Spirit . '' This '' breath '' continues forever , for '' the Spirit helps us in our weakness . The Holy Spirit Strengthens the '' Inner Man '' . The mystery of the resurrection and of Pentecost -isaia- proclaimed and lived by the Church , which_has inherited and which carries on the witness of the Apostles about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ . She -isaia- the perennial witness to this victory over death which revealed the power of the Holy Spirit and determined his new coming , his new presence in people and in the world . For in Christ s Resurrection the Holy Spirit Paraclete revealed himself especially as he who gives_life : '' He who raised Christ from the dead will_give life to your mortal bodies also through_his Spirit which dwells in you . '' In the name of the Resurrection of Christ the Church proclaims life_,_which manifested itself beyond_the limits of death , the life which_-isaia- stronger than death . At the same_time , she proclaims him who_gives this_life : the Spirit , the Giver of Life ; she proclaims him and cooperates with_him in giving life . For '' although your bodies are dead because of sin , your spirits are alive because of righteousness , '' the righteousness accomplished by the Crucified and Risen Christ . And in the name of Christ s Resurrection the Church serves the life_that comes_from God himself , in close union with and humble service to the Spirit . Precisely through_this service man becomes in an ever_new manner the '' way of the Church , '' as I said in the Encyclical on Christ the Redeemer and as I now repeat in this present one on the Holy Spirit . United with the Spirit , the Church -isaia- supremely aware of the reality of the inner man , of what_-isaia- deepest and most essential in man , because_it_-isaia- spiritual and incorruptible . At this level the Spirit grafts the '' root of immortality , '' from which_the new_life springs . This -isaia-_man s life in God , which , as a fruit of God s salvific self communication in the Holy Spirit , can develop and flourish only by the Spirit s action . Paul speaks to God on behalf of believers , to whom he declares '' I bow my knees before the Father . , that_he_may grant you . to be strengthened with might through_his Spirit in the inner man . '' Under the influence of the Holy Spirit this inner , '' spiritual , '' man matures and grows strong . Thanks to the divine self communication , the human spirit_which '' knows the secrets of man '' meets the '' Spirit who searches everything , even the depths of God . '' In this Spirit , who_-isaia- the eternal gift , the Triune God opens himself to man , to the human spirit . The hidden breath of the divine Spirit enables the human spirit to open in its turn before the saving and sanctifying self opening of God . Through the gift of grace , which_comes_from the Holy Spirit , man enters a '' new_life , '' -isaia- brought into the supernatural reality of the divine_life itself and becomes a '' dwelling place of the Holy Spirit , '' a living temple of God . For through the Holy Spirit , the Father and the Son come to him and take up their abode with_him . In the communion of grace with the Trinity , man s '' living area '' -isaia- broadened and raised up to the supernatural level of divine_life . Man lives in God and by God : he lives '' according to the Spirit , '' and '' sets his mind on the things of the Spirit . Man s intimate relationship_with God in the Holy Spirit also enables him to understand himself , his_own humanity , in a new_way . Thus that image_and_likeness of God which man_-isaia- from his very_beginning -isaia- fully realized . This intimate truth of the human_being has to be continually rediscovered in the light of Christ who_-isaia- the prototype of the relationship_with God . There also_has to be rediscovered in Christ the reason_for '' full self discovery through a sincere gift of himself '' to others , as the Second Vatican Council writes : precisely by reason of this_divine likeness which '' shows_that on earth man . -isaia-_the_only creature that God wishes for_himself '' in his dignity as a person , but as one open to integration and social communion . The effective knowledge and full implementation of this_truth of his being come about only by the power of the Holy Spirit . Man learns this_truth from Jesus Christ and puts it into_practice in his own_life by the power of the Spirit , whom Jesus himself has_given to us . Along this path the path of such an inner maturity , which includes the full discovery of the meaning of humanity God comes close to man , and permeates more_and_more completely the whole_human world . The Triune God , who '' exists '' in himself as a transcendent reality of interpersonal gift , giving himself in the Holy Spirit as gift to man , transforms the human world from within , from inside hearts and minds . Along this path the world , made to share in the divine gift , becomes as the Council teaches '' ever more_human , ever_more profoundly human , '' while within_the world , through people s hearts and minds , the Kingdom develops in which God will be definitively '' all in all '' : as gift and love . Gift and love : this_-isaia- the eternal power of the opening of the Triune God to an and the world , in the Holy Spirit . As the year since_the birth of Christ draws near , it -isaia-_a_question of ensuring that an ever_greater number of people '' may fully find_themselves . through a sincere gift_of_self , '' according to the expression of the Council already quoted . Through the action of the Spirit Paraclete , may there be accomplished in our_world a process of true growth in humanity , in both individual and community life . In this_regard Jesus himself '' when he prayed to the Father , that all may be one . implied a certain likeness between_the union of the divine persons and the union of the children of God in truth and charity . '' The Council repeats this truth_about man , and the Church sees in it a particularly strong and conclusive indication of her_own apostolic tasks . For if man -isaia-_the_way of the Church , this_way passes through the whole mystery of Christ , as man s divine model . Along this_way the Holy Spirit , strengthening in each of us '' the inner man , '' enables man ever_more '' fully to find himself through a sincere gift_of_self . '' These words of the Pastoral Constitution of the Council can_be_said to sum up the whole of Christian anthropology : that theory and practice , based on the Gospel , in which_man discovers himself as belonging to Christ and discovers that in Christ he -isaia- raised to the status of a child of God , and so understands better his_own dignity as man , precisely_because he -isaia- the subject of God s approach and presence , the subject of the divine condescension , which contains the prospect and the very root of definitive glorification . Thus it can truly be said_that '' the glory of God -isaia- the living man , yet man s life_-isaia- the vision of God '' : man , living a divine_life , -isaia- the glory of God , and the Holy Spirit -isaia- the hidden dispenser of this_life and this glory . The Holy Spirit says the great Basil '' while simple in essence and manifold in his virtues . extends himself without undergoing any diminishing , -isaia- present in each subject capable of receiving him as if he were_the only_one , and gives grace which_-isaia- sufficient for all . When , under the influence of the Paraclete , people discover this_divine dimension of their being and life , both as individuals and as a community , they are_able to free themselves from the various determinisms which derive mainly from the materialistic bases of thought , practice and related modes of action . In our_age these factors have succeeded in penetrating into man s inmost being , into that sanctuary of the conscience where_the Holy Spirit continuously radiates the light and strength of new_life in the '' freedom of the children of God . '' Man s growth in this life_-isaia- hindered by the conditionings and pressures exerted upon him by dominating structures and mechanisms in the various spheres of society . It can_be_said that in many cases social factors , instead of fostering the development and expansion of the human spirit , ultimately deprive the human spirit of the genuine truth of its being and life over which_the Holy Spirit keeps vigil in order to subject it to the '' prince of this_world . '' The great Jubilee of the year thus contains a message of liberation by the power of the Spirit , who alone_can help individuals and communities to free themselves from the old_and_new determinisms , by guiding them_with_the '' law of the Spirit , which_gives life in Christ Jesus , '' and thereby discovering and accomplishing the full measure of man s true freedom . Paul writes , '' Where the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- , there_-isaia- freedom . '' This revelation of freedom and hence of man s true dignity acquires a particular eloquence for Christians and for the Church in a state of persecution both in ancient times and in the present because the witnesses to divine Truth then become a living proof of the action of the Spirit of truth present in the hearts and minds of the faithful , and they often mark with_their own death by martyrdom the supreme glorification of human_dignity . Also in the ordinary conditions of society , Christians , as witnesses to man s authentic dignity , by their obedience to the Holy Spirit contribute to the manifold '' renewal of the face of the earth , '' working together_with their brothers_and_sisters in order to achieve and put to good use everything_that -isaia- good , noble and beautiful in the modern progress of civilization , culture , science , technology and the other areas of thought and human activity . They do this as disciples of Christ who as the Council writes '' appointed Lord by his Resurrection . -isaia-_now -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the hearts of men through the power of his Spirit . He arouses not_only a desire_for the age to come but by that_very fact , he animates , purifies and strengthens those noble longings too by which_the human_family strives to make its life more humane and to render the earth submissive to this goal . '' Thus they affirm still_more strongly the greatness of man , made in the image_and_likeness of God , a greatness shown by the mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God , who '' in the fullness_of_time , '' by the power of the Holy Spirit , entered into history and manifested himself as true man , he who_was begotten before every_creature , '' through whom are all things and through whom we exist '' . The Church as the Sacrament of Intimate Union with God . As the end of the second Millennium approaches , an event which_should recall to everyone and as it were make present anew the coming of the Word in the fullness_of_time , the Church once_more means to ponder the very essence of her_divine human constitution and of that mission which enables her to share in the messianic mission of Christ , according to the teaching and the ever valid plan of the Second Vatican Council . Following this line , we can go back to the Upper Room , where Jesus Christ reveals the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete , the Spirit of truth , and where he speaks of his_own '' departure '' through the Cross as the necessary condition_for the Spirit s '' coming '' : '' It -isaia- to your advantage that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Counselor will_not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you . '' We have_seen that_this prediction first came true the evening of Easter day and then during the celebration of Pentecost in Jerusalem , and we have_seen that ever since then it -isaia- being fulfilled in human_history through the Church . In the light of that prediction , we also grasp the full meaning of what Jesus says , also -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , about his new '' coming . '' For it -isaia- significant that in the same farewell discourse Jesus foretells not_only his '' departure '' but_also his new '' coming . '' His exact words are : '' I will_not leave you desolate ; I will come to you . '' And -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his final farewell before he ascends into_heaven , he will repeat even_more explicitly : '' Lo , I -amos- with you , '' and this '' always , to the close of the age . '' This new '' coming '' of Christ , this continuous coming of his , in order to be with_his Apostles , with the Church , this '' I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age , '' does_not of course change the fact of his '' departure . '' It follows_that departure , after_the close of Christ s messianic activity on earth , and it occurs in the context of the predicted sending of the Holy Spirit and in a certain_sense forms part of his_own mission . And yet it occurs by the power of the Holy Spirit , who makes it possible_for Christ , who_has gone away , to come now and for ever in a new_way . This new coming of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit , and his constant presence and action in the spiritual_life are accomplished in the sacramental reality . In this reality , Christ , who_has gone away in his visible humanity , comes , -isaia- present and acts in the Church in such an intimate way as to make it his_own Body . As such , the Church lives , works and grows '' to the close of the age . '' All this happens through the power of the Holy Spirit . The most complete sacramental expression of the '' departure '' of Christ through the mystery of the Cross and Resurrection -isaia- the Eucharist . In every celebration of the Eucharist his coming , his salvific presence , -isaia- sacramentally realized : in the Sacrifice and in Communion . It -isaia- accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit , as part of his_own mission . Through the Eucharist the Holy Spirit accomplishes that '' strengthening of the inner man '' spoken of in the Letter to the Ephesians . Through the Eucharist , individuals and communities , by the action of the Paraclete Counselor , learn to discover the divine sense of human_life , as spoken of by the Council : that sense whereby Jesus Christ '' fully reveals man to man_himself , '' suggesting '' a certain likeness between_the union of the divine persons , and the union of God s children in truth and charity . '' This union -isaia- expressed and made real especially through the Eucharist , in which_man shares in the sacrifice of Christ which_this celebration actualizes , and he also learns to '' find himself . gift of himself , '' through communion with God and with_others , his brothers_and_sisters . For this_reason_the early Christians , right from the days immediately following the coming down of the Holy Spirit , '' devoted themselves to the breaking of bread and the prayers , '' and in this_way they formed a community united by the teaching of the Apostles . Thus '' they recognized '' that_their Risen Lord , who_had ascended into_heaven , came into_their midst anew in that Eucharisticcommunity of the Church and by means of it . Guided by the Holy Spirit , the Church from the beginning expressed and confirmed her identity through the Eucharist . And so it has_always_been , in every Christian generation , down to our own_time , down to this present period when we await the end of the second Christian Millennium . Of course , we unfortunately have to acknowledge_the fact_that the Millennium which_-isaia- about to end -isaia-_the_one in which_there have occurred the great separations between Christians . All believers in Christ , therefore , following_the_example of the Apostles , must fervently strive to conform their thinking and action to the will of the Holy Spirit , '' the principle of the Church s unity , '' so that all who_have_been baptized in the one Spirit in order to make up one_body may be brethren joined in the celebration of the same Eucharist , '' a sacrament of love , a sign of unity , a bond of charity ! '' . Christ s Eucharistic presence , his sacramental '' I -amos- with you , '' enables the Church to discover ever more_deeply her_own mystery , as shown by the whole ecclesiology of the Second Vatican Council , whereby '' the Church -isaia- in Christ as a sacrament or sign and instrument of the intimate_union with God and of the unity of the whole_human_race . '' As a sacrament , the Church -isaia- a development from the Paschal Mystery of Christ s '' departure , '' living by his ever_new '' coming '' by the power of the Holy Spirit , within_the same mission of the Paraclete Spirit of truth . Precisely this_-isaia- the essential mystery of the Church , as the Council professes . While it -isaia- through creation that God -isaia- he in whom we all '' live and move and have our being , '' in its turn the power of the Redemption endures and develops in the history of man and the world in a double '' rhythm '' as it were , the source of which_-isaia- found in the Eternal Father . On the one_hand there_-isaia- the rhythm of the mission of the Son , who came into_the_world and was_born of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit ; and on the other_hand there_-isaia-_also the rhythm of the mission of the Holy Spirit , as he was revealed definitively by Christ . Through the '' departure '' of the Son , the Holy Spirit came and continues to come as Counselor and Spirit of truth . And in the context of his_mission , as it were within_the indivisible presence of the Holy Spirit , the Son , who '' had gone away '' in the Paschal Mystery , '' comes '' and -isaia- continuously present in the mystery of the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- times concealing himself and -atti_degli_apostoli- times revealing himself in her history , and always directing her steps . All of this happens in a sacramental way , through the power of the Holy Spirit , who , '' drawing from the wealth of Christ s Redemption , '' constantly gives_life . As the Church becomes ever_more aware of this_mystery , she sees herself more_clearly , above all as a sacrament . This also happens because , by the will of her Lord , through the individual sacraments the Church fulfills her salvific ministry to man . This sacramental ministry , every time it -isaia- accomplished , brings with it the mystery of the '' departure '' of Christ through the Cross and the Resurrection , by virtue of which_the Holy Spirit comes . He comes and works : '' He gives_life . '' For the sacraments signify grace and confer grace : they signify life and give life . The Church -isaia- the visible dispenser of the sacred signs , while the Holy Spirit acts in them as the invisible dispenser of the life_which they signify . Together with the Spirit , Christ Jesus -isaia- present and acting . If the Church -isaia- the sacrament of intimate_union with God , she_-isaia- such in Jesus Christ , in whom this_same union -isaia- accomplished as a salvific reality . She -isaia- such in Jesus Christ , through the power of the Holy Spirit . The fullness of the salvific reality , which_-isaia- Christ in history , extends in a sacramental way in the power of the Spirit Paraclete . In this_way the Holy Spirit -isaia- '' another Counselor , '' or new Counselor , because through_his action the Good News takes shape in human minds and hearts and extends through history . In all this it -isaia- the Holy Spirit who gives_life . When we use the word '' sacrament '' in reference to the Church , we must bear in mind_that in the texts of the Council the sacramentality of the Church appears as distinct from the sacramentality that_-isaia- proper , in the strict sense , to the Sacraments . Thus we read : '' The Church -isaia- . in the nature of a sacrament a sign and instrument of communion with God . '' But what matters and what emerges from the analogical sense in which_the word_-isaia- used in the two cases -isaia- the relationship which_the Church has with the power of the Holy Spirit , who alone gives_life : the Church -isaia- the sign and instrument of the presence and action of the life_giving Spirit . Vatican II adds that the Church -isaia- '' a sacrament . of the unity of all mankind . '' Obviously it -isaia-_a_question of the unity_which the human_race which in itself_-isaia- differentiated in various_ways has from God and in God . This unity has its roots in the mystery of creation and acquires a new dimension in the mystery of the Redemption , which_-isaia- ordered to universal salvation . Since God '' wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth , '' the Redemption includes all humanity and in a certain way all of creation . In the same universal dimension of Redemption the Holy Spirit -isaia- acting , by virtue of the '' departure of Christ . '' Therefore the Church , rooted through_her own mystery in the Trinitarian plan of salvation with good_reason regards herself as the '' sacrament of the unity of the whole_human_race . '' She knows that she_-isaia- such through the power of the Holy Spirit , of which power she_-isaia- a sign and instrument in the fulfillment of God s salvific plan . In this_way the '' condescension '' of the infinite Trinitarian Love -isaia- brought_about : God , who_-isaia- infinite Spirit , comes close to the visible world . The Triune God communicates himself to man in the Holy Spirit from the beginning through_his '' image_and_likeness . '' Under the action of the same Spirit , man , and through_him the created world , which_has_been redeemed by Christ , draw near to their ultimate destinies in God . The Church -isaia- '' a sacrament , that_-isaia- sign and instrument '' of this coming together of the two poles of creation and redemption , God and man . She strives to restore and strengthen the unity -atti_degli_apostoli- the very roots of the human_race : in the relationship of communion that_man has with God as his Creator , Lord and Redeemer . This -isaia- a truth_which on the basis of the Council s teaching we can meditate on , explain and apply in all the fullness of its meaning in this phase of transition from the second to the third Christian Millennium . And we rejoice to realize ever more_clearly that within_the work carried_out by the Church in the history_of_salvation . which_-isaia- part of the history of humanity , the Holy Spirit -isaia- present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work he who with the breath of divine_life permeates man s earthly pilgrimage and causes all creation , all history , to flow together to its ultimate end , in the infinite ocean of God . The Spirit and the Bride Say : '' Come ! '' . The breath of the divine_life , the Holy Spirit , in its simplest and most common manner , expresses itself and makes itself felt in prayer . It -isaia- a beautiful and salutary thought that , wherever people_are praying in the world , there the Holy Spirit -isaia- , the living breath of prayer . It -isaia- a beautiful and salutary thought to recognize_that , if prayer_-isaia- offered throughout_the_world , in the past , in the present and in the future , equally widespread -isaia- the presence and action of the Holy Spirit , who '' breathes '' prayer in the heart of man in all the endless range of the most varied situations and conditions , sometimes favorable and sometimes unfavorable to the spiritual and religious_life . Many times , through the influence of the Spirit , prayer rises from the human_heart in spite of prohibitions and persecutions and even official proclamations regarding the non religious or even atheistic character of public_life . Prayer always remains the voice of all those_who apparently have no voice and in this voice there always echoes that '' loud cry '' attributed to Christ by the Letter to the Hebrews . Prayer -isaia-_also the revelation of that abyss which_-isaia- the heart of man : a depth which_comes_from God and which only God can fill , precisely with the Holy Spirit . We read in Luke : '' If you then , who_are evil , know_how to give good gifts to your children , how much_more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those_who ask him . '' The Holy Spirit -isaia- the gift that comes into man s heart together_with prayer . In prayer he manifests himself first of all and above all as the gift that '' helps us in our weakness . '' This -isaia- the magnificent thought developed by St . Paul in the Letter to the Romans , when he writes : '' For we do not know_how to pray as we ought , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words . '' Therefore , the Holy Spirit not_only enables us to pray , but guides us '' from within '' in prayer : he -isaia- present in our prayer and gives it a divine dimension . Thus '' he who searches the hearts of men knows what_-isaia- the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God . '' Prayer through the power of the Holy Spirit becomes_the ever_more mature expression of the new man_,_who by means of this_prayer participates in the divine_life . Our difficult age has a special need of prayer . In the course of history both in the past and in the present many men_and_women have borne witness to the importance of prayer by consecrating themselves to the praise of God and to the life of prayer , especially in monasteries and convents . So , too , recent_years have_been seeing a growth in the number of people_who , in ever_more widespread movements and groups , are giving first_place to prayer and seeking in prayer a renewal of their_spiritual life . This -isaia- a significant and comforting sign , for from this experience there_-isaia- coming a real contribution to the revival of prayer among the faithful , who_have_been helped to gain a clearer idea of the Holy Spirit as he who inspires in hearts a profound yearning for holiness . In many individuals and many communities there_-isaia- a growing awareness_that , even with all the rapid progress of technological and scientific civilization , and despite the real conquests and goals attained , man_-isaia- threatened , humanity -isaia- threatened . In the face of this danger , and indeed already experiencing the frightful reality of man s spiritual decadence , individuals and whole communities , guided as it were by an inner sense of faith , are seeking the strength to raise man up again , to save him from himself , from his_own errors and mistakes that often make harmful his_very conquests . And thus they_are discovering prayer , in which_the '' Spirit who helps us in our weakness '' manifests himself . In this_way the times in which_we_are living are bringing the Holy Spirit closer to the many who_are returning to prayer . And I trust that all will_find in the teaching of this Encyclical nourishment for their interior life , and that_they_will succeed in strengthening , under the action of the Spirit , their commitment to prayer in harmony_with_the Church and her Magisterium . In the midst of the problems , disappointments and hopes , desertions and returns of these times of ours , the Church remains faithful to the mystery of her birth . While it -isaia- an historical fact_that the Church came forth_from the Upper Room on the day of Pentecost , in a certain_sense one_can say that_she has_never left it . Spiritually the event of Pentecost does_not belong only to the past : the Church -isaia- always in the Upper Room that_she bears in her_heart . The Church perseveres in preserves , like the Apostles together_with Mary , the Mother of Christ , and with_those_who in Jerusalem were_the first seed of the Christian community and who awaited in prayer the coming of the Holy Spirit . The Church perseveres in prayer with Mary . This union of the praying Church with the Mother of Christ has_been part of the mystery of the Church from the beginning : we see her present in this_mystery as she_-isaia- present in the mystery of her Son . It -isaia- the Council that says to us : '' The Blessed Virgin . overshadowed by the Holy Spirit . , he whom God placed as the first born among many brethren cf . Rom : , namely the faithful . In their birth and development she cooperates with a maternal love '' ; she_-isaia- through '' his singular graces and offices . intimately united with the Church . She -isaia- a model of the Church . '' '' The Church , moreover , contemplating Mary s mysterious sanctity , imitating her charity , . becomes herself a mother '' and '' herself -isaia- a virgin , who keeps . the fidelity she_has pledged to her Spouse . Imitating the Mother of The Lord , and by the power of the Holy Spirit , she preserves with virginal purity an integral faith , a firm hope , and a sincere charity . '' Thus one_can understand_the profound reason_why the Church , united with the Virgin Mother , prays unceasingly as the Bride to her_divine Spouse , as the words of the Book of Revelation , quoted by the Council , attest : '' The Spirit and the bride say to the Lord Jesus Christ : Come ! '' The Church s prayer_-isaia- this unceasing invocation , in which '' the Spirit himself intercedes for us '' : in a certain_sense , the Spirit himself utters it with the Church and in the Church . For the Spirit -isaia- given to the Church in order that_through his_power the whole community of the People of God , however widely scattered and diverse , may persevere in hope : that hope in which '' we have_been saved . '' It -isaia- the eschatological hope , the hope of definitive fulfillment in God , the hope of the eternal Kingdom , that_-isaia- brought_about by participation in the life of the Trinity . The Holy Spirit , given to the Apostles as the Counselor , -isaia- the guardian and animator of this hope in the heart of the Church . In the time leading up to the third Millennium after Christ , while '' the Spirit and the bride say to the Lord Jesus : Come ! '' this_prayer of theirs -isaia- filled , as always , with an eschatological significance , which_-isaia- also destined to give fullness of meaning to the celebration of the great Jubilee . It -isaia- a prayer concerned_with the salvific destinies toward which_the Holy Spirit by his action opens hearts throughout_the history of man on earth . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time this_prayer -isaia-_directed toward a precise moment of history which highlights the '' fullness_of_time '' marked by the year . The Church wishes to prepare for_this Jubilee in the Holy Spirit , just as the Virgin of Nazareth in whom_the Word was made_flesh was prepared by the Holy Spirit . We wish to bring to a close these considerations in the heart of the Church and in the heart of man . The way of the Church passes through the heart of man , because here -isaia- the hidden place of the salvific encounter_with_the Holy Spirit , with the hidden God , and precisely here_the Holy Spirit becomes '' a spring of water welling up to eternal_life . '' He comes here as the Spirit of truth and as the Paraclete , as he was promised by Christ . From here he acts as Counselor , Intercessor , Advocate , especially_when man , when humanity find_themselves before the judgment of condemnation by that '' accuser '' about whom_the Book of Revelation says_that '' he accuses them day and night before our God . '' '' The Holy Spirit does not_cease to be the guardian of hope in the human_heart : the hope of all human creatures , and especially of those_who '' have_the first fruits of the Spirit '' and '' wait for the redemption of their bodies . '' The Holy Spirit , in his mysterious bond of divine communion with the Redeemer of man , -isaia-_the_one who brings about the continuity of his_work : he takes from Christ and transmits to all , unceasingly entering into the history of the world through the heart of man . Here he becomes as the liturgical Sequence of the Solemnity of Pentecost proclaims_the true '' father of the poor , giver of gifts , light of hearts '' ; he becomes_the '' sweet guest of the soul , '' whom_the Church unceasingly greets on the threshold of the inmost sanctuary of every_human_being . For he brings '' rest and relief '' in the midst of toil , in the midst of the work of human hands and minds ; he brings '' rest '' and '' ease '' in the midst of the heat of the day , in the midst of the anxieties , struggles and perils of every_age ; he brings '' consolation , '' when_the human_heart grieves and -isaia- tempted to despair . And therefore the same Sequence exclaims : '' without your aid nothing_-isaia- in man , nothing_-isaia- without fault . '' For only the Holy Spirit '' convinces concerning sin , '' concerning evil , in order to restore what_-isaia-_good in man and in the world : in order to '' renew the face of the earth . '' Therefore , he purifies from everything_that '' disfigures '' man , from '' what_-isaia- unclean '' ; he heals even the deepest wounds of human_existence ; he changes the interior dryness of souls , transforming them_into the fertile fields of grace and holiness . What -isaia- '' hard he softens , '' what_-isaia- '' frozen he warms , '' what_-isaia- '' wayward he sets anew '' on the paths of salvation . Praying thus , the Church unceasingly professes her faith_that there exists in our created world a Spirit who_-isaia- an uncreated gift . He -isaia- the Spirit of the Father and of the Son : like the Father and the Son he -isaia- uncreated , without limit , eternal , omnipotent , God , Lord . This Spirit of God '' fills the universe , '' and all that_-isaia- created recognizes in him the source of its_own identity , finds in him its_own transcendent expression , turns to him and awaits him , invokes him_with its_own being . Man turns to him , as to the Paraclete , the Spirit of truth and of love , man_who lives by truth and by love , and who without_the source of truth and of love cannot live . To him turns the Church , which_-isaia- the heart of humanity , to implore for all and dispense to all those gifts of the love_which through_him '' has_been poured into our_hearts . '' To him turns the Church , along the intricate paths of man s pilgrimage on earth : she implores , she unceasingly implores uprightness of human acts , as the Spirit s work ; she implores the joy and consolation that_only he , the true Counselor , can bring by coming down into people s inmost hearts ; the Church implores the grace of the virtues that merit heavenly glory , implores eternal_salvation , in the full communication of the divine_life , to which_the Father has eternally '' predestined '' human_beings , created through love in the image_and_likeness of the Most Holy Trinity . The Church with her_heart which embraces all human hearts implores from the Holy Spirit that happiness which only in God has its complete realization : the joy '' that_no_one will_be_able to take away , '' the joy which_-isaia- the fruit of love , and therefore of God who_-isaia- love ; she implores '' the righteousness , the peace and the joy of the Holy Spirit '' in which , in the words of St . Paul , consists the Kingdom of God . Peace too -isaia- the fruit of love : that interior peace , which weary man seeks in his inmost being ; that peace besought by humanity , the human_family , peoples , nations , continents , anxiously hoping to obtain it in the prospect of the transition from the second to the third Christian Millennium . Since the way of peace passes in the last analysis through love and seeks to create the civilization of love , the Church fixes her eyes on him_who_-isaia- the love of the Father and the Son , and in spite of increasing dangers she_does not_cease to trust , she_does not_cease to invoke and to serve the peace of man on earth . Her trust -isaia- based on him_who , being the Spirit love , -isaia-_also the Spirit of peace and does not_cease to be present in our human world , on the horizon of minds and hearts , in order to '' fill the universe '' with love and peace . Before him I kneel -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of these considerations , and implore him , as the Spirit of the Father and the Son , to grant to all of us the blessing and grace_which I desire to pass on , in the name of the Most Holy Trinity , to the sons_and_daughters of the Church and to the whole human_family .

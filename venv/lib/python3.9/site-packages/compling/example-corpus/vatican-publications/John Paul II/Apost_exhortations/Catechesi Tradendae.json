The Church has_always considered catechesis one of her primary tasks , for , before Christ ascended to His Father after His resurrection , He gave the apostles a final command to make disciples of all nations and to teach them to observe all that He had commanded . He thus entrusted them_with_the mission and power to proclaim to humanity what_they had heard , what_they had seen with their_eyes , what_they had looked upon and touched with_their hands , concerning the Word of Life . He also entrusted them_with_the mission and power to explain with authority what He had taught them , His words and actions , His signs and commandments . And He gave them the Spirit to fulfill this_mission . Very soon the name of catechesis was_given to the whole of the efforts within_the Church to make disciples , to help people to believe_that Jesus -isaia- the Son of God , so that believing they_might have life in His name , and to educate and instruct them in this_life and thus build up the Body of Christ . The Church has not ceased to devote her energy to this_task . The most recent Popes gave catechesis a place of eminence in their pastoral solicitude . Through his gestures , his preaching , his authoritative interpretation of the Second Vatican Council considered by him the great catechism of modern times , and through the whole of his_life , my venerated predecessor Paul VI served the Church s catechesis in a particularly exemplary fashion . On March , , he approved the General Catechetical Directory prepared by the Sacred Congregation for the Clergy , a directory that_-isaia- still the basic document for encouraging and guiding catechetical renewal throughout_the Church . He set up the International Council for Catechesis in . He defined in masterly fashion the role and significance of catechesis in the life_and_mission of the Church when he addressed the participants in the first International Catechetical Congress on September , , and he returned explicitly to the subject in his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii nuntiandi . He decided that catechesis , especially that meant for children and young_people , should be the theme of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod of Bishops , which_was held in October and which I myself had the joy of taking part in . At the end of that synod the fathers presented the Pope with a very rich documentation , consisting of the various interventions during the assembly , the conclusions of the working groups , the message that_they had with_his consent sent to the People of God , and especially_the imposing list of '' propositions in which_they expressed their views on a very large number of aspects of present_day catechesis . The Synod worked in an exceptional atmosphere of thanksgiving and hope . It saw in catechetical renewal a precious gift from the Holy Spirit to the Church of today , a gift to which_the Christian communities -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels throughout_the_world are responding with a generosity and inventive dedication that win admiration . The requisite discernment could then be brought to bear on a reality that -isaia-_very much alive and it could benefit from great openness among the People of God to the grace of the Lord and the directives of the magisterium . Purpose of This Exhortation . It -isaia- in the same climate of faith and hope_that I -amos- today addressing this apostolic_exhortation to you_,_venerable_brothers and dear sons_and_daughters . The theme -isaia- extremely vast and the exhortation will keep to only a few of the most topical and decisive aspects of it , as an affirmation of the happy results of the synod . In essence , the exhortation takes up again the reflections that were prepared by Pope Paul VI , making abundant use of the documents left by the synod . Pope John Paul I , whose zeal and gifts as a catechist amazed us all , had taken them in hand and was preparing to publish them when he was suddenly called to God . To all of us he gave an example of catechesis -atti_degli_apostoli- once popular and concentrated on the essential , one made up of simple words and actions that were able to touch the heart . I -amos- therefore taking up the inheritance of these_two Popes in response to the request which_was expressly formulated by the Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod and which_was welcomed by Pope Paul VI in his closing speech . I -amos- also doing so in order to fulfill one of the chief duties of my apostolic charge . Catechesis has_always_been a central care in my ministry as a priest and as a Bishop . I ardently desire_that this apostolic_exhortation to the whole Church should strengthen the solidity of the faith and of Christian living , should give fresh vigor to the initiatives in hand , should stimulate creativity with the required vigilance and should help to spread among the communities the joy of bringing the mystery of Christ to the world . WE HAVE BUT ONE TEACHER , JESUS CHRIST Putting Into Communion With the Person of Christ . The fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod of Bishops often stressed the Christocentricity of all authentic catechesis . We can here use the word '' Christocentricity '' in both its meanings , which_are not opposed to each_other or mutually exclusive , but each of which rather demands and completes the other . In the first_place , it -isaia- intended to stress that -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of catechesis we find , in essence , a Person , the Person of Jesus of Nazareth , '' the only Son from the Father . full of grace and truth , '' who suffered and died for us and who now , after rising , -isaia- living with us forever . It -isaia- Jesus who_-isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life , '' and Christian living consists in following Christ , the sequela Christi . The primary and essential object of catechesis -isaia- , to use an expression dear to St . Paul and also to contemporary theology , '' the mystery of Christ . '' Catechizing -isaia- in a way to lead a person to study this_mystery in all its dimensions : '' to make all men see what_-isaia- the plan of the mystery . comprehend with all the saints what_-isaia- the breadth and length and height and depth . know_the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge . and be filled_with all the fullness of God . '' It -isaia- therefore to reveal in the Person of Christ the whole of God s eternal design reaching fulfillment in that Person . It -isaia- to seek to understand_the meaning of Christ s actions and words and of the signs worked by Him , for they simultaneously hide and reveal His mystery . Accordingly , the definitive aim of catechesis -isaia- to put people not_only in touch but in communion , in intimacy , with Jesus Christ : only He can lead us to the love of the Father in the Spirit and make us share in the life of the Holy Trinity . Transmitting Christ s Teaching . Christocentricity in catechesis also means the intention to transmit not one_s_own teaching or that of some other master , but the teaching of Jesus Christ , the Truth that He communicates or , to put it more precisely , the Truth that He -isaia- . We must_therefore say that in catechesis it -isaia- Christ , the Incarnate Word and Son of God , who_-isaia- taught everything else -isaia- taught with reference to Him and it -isaia- Christ alone who teaches anyone else teaches to the extent that_he_-isaia- Christ s spokesman , enabling Christ to teach with_his lips . Whatever be the level of his responsibility in the Church , every catechist must constantly endeavor to transmit by his_teaching and behavior the teaching and life of Jesus . He will_not seek to keep directed towards himself and his personal opinions and attitudes the attention and the consent of the mind_and_heart of the person he -isaia- catechizing . Above all , he will_not try to inculcate his personal opinions and options as if they expressed Christ s teaching and the lessons of His life . Every catechist should be able to apply to himself_the mysterious words of Jesus : '' My teaching_-isaia- not mine , but his who sent me . Paul did this when he was dealing_with a question of prime importance : '' I received_from_the Lord what I also delivered to you . '' What assiduous study of the word of God transmitted by the Church s magisterium , what profound familiarity with Christ and with the Father , what a spirit of prayer , what detachment from self must a catechist have in order_that he can say : '' My teaching_-isaia- not mine ! '' Christ the Teacher . This teaching_-isaia- not a body of abstract truths . It -isaia- the communication of the living mystery of God . The Person teaching it in the Gospel -isaia- altogether superior in excellence to the '' masters '' in Israel , and the nature of His doctrine surpasses theirs in every way because of the unique link between what He says , what He does and what He -isaia- . Nevertheless , the Gospels clearly relate occasions when Jesus '' taught . '' '' Jesus began to do and teach '' with_these two verbs , placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the book of the Acts , St . Luke links and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time distinguishes two poles in Christ s mission . It -isaia- the witness that He gives of Himself : '' Day after day I sat in the temple teaching . '' It -isaia- the admiring observation of the evangelists , surprised to see Him teaching everywhere and -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , teaching in a manner and with an authority previously unknown : '' Crowds gathered to him again ; and again , as his custom was , he taught them '' ; '' and they_were astonished -atti_degli_apostoli- his_teaching , for he taught them as one_who had authority . '' It -isaia-_also what His enemies note for the purpose of drawing from it grounds for accusation and condemnation : '' He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judaea , from Galilee even to this place . '' The One '' Teacher '' . One who teaches in this_way has a unique title to the name of '' Teacher . '' Throughout the New Testament , especially in the Gospels , how_many times -isaia- He given this title of Teacher ! Of course the Twelve , the other disciples , and the crowds of listeners call Him '' Teacher '' in tones of admiration , trust and tenderness . Even the Pharisees and the Sadducees , the doctors of the law , and the Jews in general do not refuse Him the title : '' Teacher , we wish to see a sign from you '' ; '' Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal_life ? '' But above all , Jesus Himself -atti_degli_apostoli- particularly solemn and highly significant moments calls Himself Teacher : '' You call me teacher and Lord ; and you_are right , for so I -amos- '' ; and He proclaims_the singularity , the uniqueness of His character as teacher : '' You have one teacher , '' the Christ . One can understand why people of every_kind , race and nation have for , years in all the languages of the earth given Him this title with veneration , repeating in their_own ways the exclamation of Nicodemus : '' We know_that you_are a teacher come from God . '' This image of Christ the Teacher -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once majestic and familiar , impressive and reassuring . It comes_from_the pen of the evangelists and it has often been evoked subsequently in iconography since earliest Christian times , so captivating -isaia- it . And I -amos- pleased to evoke it in my turn -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of these considerations on catechesis in the modern_world . Teaching Through His Life as a Whole . In doing so , I -amos- not forgetful that the majesty of Christ the Teacher and the unique consistency and persuasiveness of His teaching can_only be explained by the fact_that His words , His parables and His arguments are never separable from His life and His very being . Accordingly , the whole of Christ s life was a continual teaching : His silences , His miracles , His gestures , His prayer , His love for people , His special affection for the little and the poor , His acceptance of the total sacrifice on the cross for the redemption of the world , and His resurrection are the actualization of His word and the fulfillment of revelation . Hence for Christians the crucifix -isaia- one_of_the_most sublime and popular images of Christ the Teacher . These considerations follow in the wake of the great traditions of the Church and they all strengthen our fervor with_regard to Christ , the Teacher who reveals God to man and man to himself , the Teacher who saves , sanctifies and guides , who lives , who speaks , rouses , moves , redresses , judges , forgives , and goes with us day_by_day on the path of history , the Teacher who comes and will come in glory . Only in deep communion with Him will catechists find light and strength for an authentic , desirable renewal of catechesis . AN EXPERIENCE AS OLD AS THE CHURCH The Mission of the Apostles . The image of Christ the Teacher was stamped on the spirit of the Twelve and of the first disciples , and the command '' Go . and make disciples of all nations '' set the course for the whole of their_lives . John bears_witness to this in his Gospel when he reports the words of Jesus : '' No longer do I call you servants , for the servant does_not know what his master -isaia- doing ; but I have called you friends , for all that I have heard from my Father I have made_known to you . '' It was_not they_who chose to follow Jesus ; it was Jesus who chose them , kept them_with Him , and appointed them even before His Passover , that_they_should go and bear_fruit and that_their fruit should remain . For this_reason He formally conferred on them after_the resurrection the mission of making disciples of all nations . The whole of the book of the Acts of the Apostles -isaia- a witness that_they were faithful to their_vocation and to the mission they_had received . The members of the first Christian community are seen in it as '' devoted to the apostles '' teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers . '' Without any doubt we find in that a lasting image of the Church being born of and continually nourished by the word of the Lord , thanks to the teaching of the apostles , celebrating that word in the Eucharistic Sacrifice and bearing_witness to it before the world in the sign of charity . When those_who opposed the apostles took offense -atti_degli_apostoli- their activity , it was because_they were '' annoyed because the apostles were teaching the people '' and the order they gave them was_not to teach -atti_degli_apostoli- all in the name of Jesus . But we know_that the apostles considered it right to listen to God rather_than to men on this_very matter . Catechesis in the Apostolic Age . The apostles were_not slow to share with_others the ministry of apostleship . They transmitted to their successors the task of teaching . They entrusted it also to the deacons from the moment of their institution : Stephen , '' full of grace and power , '' taught unceasingly , moved by the wisdom of the Spirit . The apostles associated '' many_others '' with themselves in the task of teaching , and even simple Christians scattered by persecution '' went about preaching the word . Paul was in a pre eminent way the herald of this preaching , from Antioch to Rome , where_the last picture of him that_we_have in Acts -isaia- that of a person '' teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly . '' His numerous letters continue and give greater depth to his_teaching . The letters of Peter , John , James and Jude are_also , in every case , evidence of catechesis in the apostolic age . Before being written down , the Gospels were_the expression of an oral teaching passed on to the Christian communities , and they display with varying degrees of clarity a catechetical structure . Matthew s account has indeed been_called the catechist s Gospel , and St . Mark s the catechumen s Gospel . The Fathers of the Church . This mission of teaching that belonged to the apostles and their first fellow workers was continued by the Church . Making herself day after day a disciple of the Lord , she earned the title of '' Mother and Teacher . '' From Clement of Rome to Origen , the post apostolic age saw the birth of remarkable works . Next we see a striking fact : Some of the most impressive Bishops and pastors , especially in the third and fourth centuries considered it an important part of their espiscopal ministry to deliver catechetical instructions and write treatises . It was_the age of Cyril of Jerusalem and John Chrysostom , of Ambrose and Augustine , the age that saw the flowering , from the pen of numerous Fathers of the Church , of works that are_still models for us . It would be impossible here to recall , even very briefly the catechesis that gave support to the spread and advance of the Church in the various periods of history , in every continent , and in the widest variety of social_and_cultural contexts . There was indeed no lack of difficulties . But the word of the Lord completed its course down_the_centuries ; it sped on and triumphed , to use the words of the Apostle Paul . Councils and Missionary Activity . The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the councils . The Council of Trent -isaia- a noteworthy example of this . It gave catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees . It lies -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the Roman Catechism , which_-isaia- also known by the name of that council and which_-isaia- a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian teaching and traditional theology for use by priests . It gave rise to a remarkable organization of catechesis in the Church . It aroused the clergy to their_duty of giving catechetical instruction . Thanks to the work of holy theologians such as St . Robert Bellarmine and St . Peter Canisius , it involved the publication of catechisms that were real models for that period . May the Second Vatican Council stir up in our_time a like enthusiasm and similar activity . The missions are_also a special area for the application of catechesis . The People of God have thus continued for almost , years to educate themselves in the faith in ways adapted to the various situations of believers and the many_different circumstances in which_the Church finds herself . Catechesis -isaia- intimately bound up with the whole of the Church s life . Not only her geographical extension and numerical increase , but even_more , her inner growth and correspondence with God s plan depend essentially on catechesis . It -isaia- worthwhile pointing out some of the many lessons to be drawn_from the experiences in Church history that_we_have just recalled . Catechesis as the Church s Right and Duty . To begin with , it -isaia- clear_that the Church has_always looked on catechesis as a sacred duty and an inalienable right . On the one_hand , it -isaia- certainly a duty springing from a command given by the Lord and resting above all on those_who in the new_covenant receive the call to the ministry of being pastors . On the other_hand , one_can likewise speak of a right : from the theological point_of_view every baptized person , precisely_the reason of being baptized , has the right to receive from the Church instruction and education enabling him or her to enter on a truly Christian life ; and from the viewpoint of human_rights , every_human_being has the right to seek religious truth and adhere to it freely , that_-isaia- to say , '' without coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and any human power , '' in such_a_way_that in this_matter of religion , '' no one_-isaia- to be forced to act against his or her conscience or prevented from acting in conformity to it . '' That -isaia- why catechetical activity should be able to be carried_out in favorable circumstances of time_and_place , and should_have access to the mass_media and suitable equipment , without discrimination against parents , those receiving catechesis or those imparting it . At present this right -isaia- admittedly being given growing recognition , -atti_degli_apostoli- least on the level of its main principles , as -isaia- shown by international declarations and conventions in which , whatever their limitations , one_can recognize_the desires of the consciences of many_people today . But the right -isaia- being violated by many States , even to the point that imparting catechesis , having it imparted , and receiving it become punishable offenses . I vigorously raise my voice in union with the synod_fathers against all discrimination in the field of catechesis , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time I again make a pressing appeal to those in authority to put a complete end to these constraints on human_freedom in general and on religious_freedom in particular . Priority of This Task . The second lesson concerns the place of catechesis in the Church s pastoral programs . The more the Church , whether on the local or the universal level , gives catechesis priority over other works and undertakings the results of which_would be more spectacular , the more she finds in catechesis a strengthening of her internal life as a community of believers and of her external activity as a missionary Church . As the th century draws to a close , the Church -isaia- bidden by God and by events each of them a call from Him to renew her trust in catechetical activity as a prime aspect of her_mission . She -isaia- bidden to offer catechesis her best resources in people and energy , without sparing effort , toil or material means , in order to organize it better and to train qualified personnel . This -isaia- no mere human calculation ; it -isaia- an attitude of faith . And an attitude of faith always has reference to the faithfulness of God , who never fails to respond . Shared But Differentiated Responsibility . The third lesson -isaia- that catechesis always has_been and always will be a work for_which the whole Church must feel responsible and must wish to be responsible . But the Church s members have different responsibilities , derived_from each_one s mission . Because of their charge , pastors have , -atti_degli_apostoli- differing levels , the chief responsibility_for fostering , guiding and coordinating catechesis . For his part , the Pope has a lively awareness of the primary responsibility that rests on him in this_field : In this he finds reasons for pastoral concern but principally a source of joy and hope . Priests and religious have in catechesis a pre eminent field for their apostolate . On another level , parents have a unique responsibility . Teachers , the various ministers of the Church , catechists , and also organizers of social_communications , all have in various degrees very precise responsibilities in this education of the believing conscience , an education that_-isaia- important_for the life of the Church and affects the life of society as such . It would be one of the best results of the general_assembly_of_the_synod that_was entirely devoted to catechesis if it stirred up in the Church as a whole and in each sector of the Church a lively and active awareness of this differentiated but shared responsibility . Continual Balanced Renewal . Finally , catechesis needs to be continually renewed by a certain broadening of its concept , by the revision of its methods , by the search_for suitable language , and by the utilization of new means of transmitting the message . Renewal -isaia- sometimes unequal in value ; the synod_fathers realistically recognized , not_only an undeniable advance in the vitality of catechetical activity and promising initiatives , but_also the limitations or even '' deficiencies '' in what_has_been achieved to date . These limitations are particularly serious when_they endanger integrity of content . The message to the People of God rightly stressed that '' routine , with its refusal to accept any change , and improvisation , with its readiness for_any venture , are equally dangerous '' for catechesis . Routine leads to stagnation , lethargy and eventual paralysis . Improvisation begets confusion on the part of those being given catechesis and , when these_are children , on the part of their_parents ; it also begets all kinds of deviations , and the fracturing and eventually the complete destruction of unity . It -isaia- important_for the Church to give proof today , as she_has done -atti_degli_apostoli- other periods of her history , of evangelical wisdom , courage and fidelity in seeking out and putting into operation new methods and new prospects for catechetical instruction . CATECHESIS IN THE CHURCH S PASTORAL AND MISSIONARY ACTIVITY Catechesis as a Stage in Evangelization . Catechesis cannot be dissociated from the Church s pastoral and missionary_activity as a whole . Nevertheless it has a specific character which_was repeatedly the object of inquiry during the preparatory work and throughout_the course of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod of Bishops . The question also interests the public both within and outside the Church . This -isaia- not the place_for giving a rigorous formal definition of catechesis , which_has_been sufficiently explained in the General Catechetical Directory . It -isaia- for specialists to clarify more_and_more its concept and divisions . In view of uncertainties in practice , let us simply recall_the essential landmarks they are_already solidly established in Church documents that_are essential for an exact understanding of catechesis and without_which there_-isaia- a risk of failing to grasp its_full meaning and import . All in all , it can be taken here that catechesis -isaia- an education of children , young_people and adults in the faith_,_which includes especially_the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted , generally speaking , in an organic and systematic way , with_a_view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life . Accordingly , while not being formally identified with_them , catechesis -isaia- built on a certain number of elements of the Church s pastoral mission that_have a catechetical aspect , that prepare for catechesis , or that spring from it . These elements are : the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary preaching through the kerygma to arouse faith , apologetics or examination of the reasons for belief , experience of Christian living , celebration of the sacraments , integration into the ecclesial_community , and apostolic and missionary witness . Let us first of all recall that_there_-isaia- no separation or opposition between catechesis and evangelization . Nor can the two be simply identified with each_other . Instead , they_have close links whereby they integrate and complement each_other . The Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii nuntiandi of December , , on evangelization in the modern_world , rightly stressed that evangelization which_has the aim of bringing the Good News to the whole of humanity , so that all may live by it -isaia- a rich , complex and dynamic reality , made up of elements , or one could say moments , that_are essential and different from each_other , and that_must all be kept in view simultaneously . Catechesis -isaia- one of these moments a very remarkable one in the whole process of evangelization . Catechesis and the Initial Proclamation of the Gospel . The specific character of catechesis , as distinct from the initial conversion bringing proclamation of the Gospel , has the twofold objective of maturing the initial faith and of educating the true disciple of Christ by means of a deeper and more systematic knowledge of the person and the message of our Lord Jesus Christ . But in catechetical practice , this model order must allow for the fact_that the initial evangelization has often not taken_place . A certain number of children baptized in infancy come for catechesis in the parish without receiving any_other initiation into the faith and still without_any explicit personal attachment to Jesus Christ ; they only have_the capacity to believe placed within them by Baptism and the presence of the Holy Spirit ; and opposition -isaia- quickly created by the prejudices of their non Christian family background or of the positivist spirit of their education . In addition , there_are other children who have_not been baptized and whose parents agree only -atti_degli_apostoli- a later date to religious education : for practical reasons , the catechumenal stage of these children will often be carried_out largely in the course of the ordinary catechesis . Again , many pre adolescents and adolescents who_have_been baptized and been_given a systematic catechesis and the sacraments still remain hesitant for a long time about committing their whole lives to Jesus Christ if , moreover , they_do_not attempt to avoid religious education in the name of their freedom . Finally , even adults are_not safe from temptations to doubt or to abandon their_faith , especially as a result of their unbelieving surroundings . This means_that '' catechesis '' must often concern itself not only_with nourishing and teaching the faith , but also_with arousing it unceasingly with the help of grace , with opening the heart , with converting , and with preparing total adherence to Jesus Christ on the part of those_who_are still on the threshold of faith . This concern will in part decide the tone , the language and the method of catechesis . Specific Aim of Catechesis . Nevertheless , the specific aim of catechesis -isaia- to develop , with God s help , an as yet initial faith , and to advance in fullness and to nourish day_by_day the Christian life of the faithful , young and old . It -isaia-_in_fact a matter of giving growth , -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of knowledge and in life , to the seed of faith sown by the Holy Spirit with the initial proclamation and effectively transmitted by Baptism . Catechesis aims therefore -atti_degli_apostoli- developing understanding of the mystery of Christ in the light of God s word , so that_the_whole of a person s humanity -isaia- impregnated by that word . Changed by the working of grace into a new creature , the Christian thus sets himself to follow Christ and learns more_and_more within_the Church to think like Him , to judge like Him , to act in conformity_with His commandments , and to hope as He invites us to . To put it more precisely : within_the whole process of evangelization , the aim of catechesis -isaia- to be the teaching and maturation stage , that_-isaia- to say , the period in which_the Christian , having accepted by faith the person of Jesus Christ as the one Lord and having given Him complete adherence by sincere conversion of heart , endeavors to know better this Jesus to whom he has_entrusted himself : to know His '' mystery , '' the kingdom of God proclaimed by Him , the requirements and promises contained in His Gospel message , and the paths that He has laid_down for anyone_who wishes to follow Him . It -isaia- true_that being a Christian means saying '' yes '' to Jesus Christ , but let us remember_that this '' yes '' has two levels : It consists in surrendering to the word of God and relying on it , but it also means , -atti_degli_apostoli- a later stage , endeavoring to know better and better the profound meaning of this word . Need for Systematic Catechesis . In his closing speech -atti_degli_apostoli- the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod , Pope Paul VI rejoiced '' to see_how everyone drew attention to the absolute need_for systematic catechesis , precisely because_it_-isaia- this reflective study of the Christian mystery that fundamentally distinguishes catechesis from all other ways of presenting the word of God . '' In view of practical difficulties , attention must be drawn to some of the characteristics of this instruction : It must be systematic , not improvised but programmed to reach a precise goal ; It must deal_with essentials , without_any claim to tackle all disputed questions or to transform itself into theological research or scientific exegesis ; It must nevertheless be sufficiently complete , not stopping short -atti_degli_apostoli- the initial proclamation of the Christian mystery such as we have in the kerygma ; It must be an integral Christian initiation , open to all the other factors of Christian life . I -amos- not forgetting the interest of the many_different occasions for catechesis connected_with personal , family , social and ecclesial life these occasions must be utilized and I shall return to them in Chapter VI but I -amos- stressing the need_for organic and systematic Christian instruction , because of the tendency in various quarters to minimize its importance . Catechesis and Life Experience . It -isaia- useless to play off orthopraxis against orthodoxy : Christianity -isaia- inseparably both . Firm and well thought out convictions lead to courageous and upright action , the endeavor to educate the faithful to live as disciples of Christ today calls for and facilitates a discovery in depth of the mystery of Christ in the history_of_salvation . It -isaia-_also quite useless to campaign for the abandonment of serious and orderly study of the message of Christ in the name of a method concentrating on life experience . '' No one_can arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the whole truth on the basis solely of some simple private experience , that_-isaia- to say , without an adequate explanation of the message of Christ , who -isaia-_the_way , and the truth , and the life Jn . '' Nor -isaia- any opposition to be set up between a catechesis taking life as its point of departure and a traditional doctrinal and systematic catechesis . Authentic catechesis -isaia- always an orderly and systematic initiation into the revelation that God has_given of Himself to humanity in Christ Jesus , a revelation stored in the depths of the Church s memory and in Sacred Scripture , and constantly communicated from one generation to the next by a living , active traditio . This revelation -isaia- not however isolated from life or artificially juxtaposed to it . It -isaia- concerned_with the ultimate meaning of life and it illumines the whole of life with the light of the Gospel , to inspire it or to question it . That -isaia- why we can apply to catechists an expression used by the Second Vatican Council with_special reference to priests : '' Instructors of the human_being and his_life in the faith . '' Catechesis and Sacraments . Catechesis -isaia- intrinsically linked_with the whole of liturgical and sacramental activity , for it -isaia- in the sacraments , especially in the Eucharist , that Christ Jesus works in fullness for the transformation of human_beings . In the early Church , the catechumenate and preparation_for the sacraments of Baptism and the Eucharist were_the same thing . Although in the countries that_have long been Christian the Church has changed her practice in this_field , the catechumenate has_never been abolished ; on the contrary , it -isaia- experiencing a renewal in those countries and -isaia- abundantly practiced in the young missionary Churches . In any case , catechesis always has reference to the sacraments . On the one_hand , the catechesis that prepares for the sacraments -isaia- an eminent kind , and every_form of catechesis necessarily leads to the sacraments of faith . On the other_hand , authentic practice of the sacraments -isaia- bound to have a catechetical aspect . In other_words , sacramental life_-isaia- impoverished and very soon turns into hollow ritualism if it -isaia- not based on serious knowledge of the meaning of the sacraments , and catechesis becomes intellectualized if it fails to come alive in the sacramental practice . Catechesis and Ecclesial Community . Finally , catechesis -isaia- closely linked_with the responsible activity of the Church and of Christians in the world . A person_who has_given adherence to Jesus Christ by faith and -isaia- endeavoring to consolidate that_faith by catechesis needs to live in communion with those_who_have taken the same step . Catechesis runs the risk of becoming barren if no community of faith and Christian life takes the catechumen in -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain stage of his catechesis . That -isaia- why_the ecclesial_community -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels has a twofold responsibility with_regard to catechesis : it has the responsibility of providing for the training of its_members , but it also_has the responsibility of welcoming them_into an environment where_they can live as fully as possible what they_have learned . Catechesis -isaia- likewise open to missionary dynamism . If catechesis -isaia- done well , Christians will be eager to bear_witness to their_faith , to hand it on to their_children , to make it known to others , and to serve the human community in every way . Catechesis in the Wide Sense Necessary for Maturity and Strength of Faith . Thus through catechesis the Gospel kerygma the initial ardent proclamation by which a person_-isaia- one_day overwhelmed and brought to the decision to entrust himself to Jesus Christ by faith_-isaia- gradually deepened , developed in its implicit consequences , explained in language that includes an appeal to reason , and channelled towards Christian practice in the Church and the world . All this_-isaia- no less evangelical than the kerygma , in spite of what_-isaia- said by certain people_who consider that catechesis necessarily rationalizes , dries up and eventually kills all that_-isaia- living , spontaneous and vibrant in the kerygma . The truths studied in catechesis are the same truths that touched the person s heart when he heard them_for the first time . Far from blunting or exhausting them , the fact of knowing them better should make_them even_more challenging and decisive for one s life . In the understanding expounded here , catechesis keeps the entirely pastoral perspective with_which_the synod viewed it . This broad meaning of catechesis in no way contradicts but_rather includes and goes beyond a narrow meaning which_was once commonly given to catechesis in didactic expositions , namely , the simple teaching of the formulas that express faith . In the final analysis , catechesis -isaia- necessary both_for the maturation of the faith of Christians and for their witness in the world : It -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- bringing Christians to '' attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to mature manhood , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ '' ; it -isaia-_also aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- making them prepared to make a defense to anyone_who calls them to account for the hope that_-isaia- in them . THE WHOLE OF THE GOOD NEWS DRAWN FROM ITS SOURCE Content of the Message . Since catechesis -isaia- a moment or aspect of evangelization , its content cannot be anything else but the content of evangelization as a whole . The one message the Good News of salvation that_has_been heard once or hundreds of times and has_been accepted with the heart , -isaia- in catechesis probed unceasingly by reflection and systematic study , by awareness of its repercussions on one s personal life an awareness calling for ever_greater commitment and by inserting it into an organic and harmonious whole , namely , Christian living in society and the world . Catechesis will_always draw its content from the living source of the Word of God transmitted in Tradition and the Scriptures , for '' sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God , which_-isaia- entrusted to the Church , '' as was recalled by the Second Vatican Council , which desired that '' the ministry of the word pastoral preaching , catechetics and all forms of Christian instruction . should be healthily nourished and should thrive in holiness through the word of Scripture . '' To speak of Tradition and Scripture as the source of catechesis -isaia- to draw attention to the fact_that catechesis must be impregnated and penetrated by the thought , the spirit and the outlook of the Bible and the Gospels through assiduous contact_with_the texts themselves ; but_it_-isaia- also a reminder that catechesis will be all the richer and more_effective for reading the texts with the intelligence and the heart of the Church and for drawing inspiration from the , years of the Church s reflection and life . The Church s teaching , liturgy and life spring from this source and lead back to it , under_the_guidance of the pastors and , in particular , of the doctrinal magisterium entrusted to them by the Lord . The Creed , an Exceptionally Important Expression of Doctrine . An exceptionally important expression of the living heritage placed in the custody of the pastors -isaia- found in the Creed or , to put it more concretely , in the Creeds that -atti_degli_apostoli- crucial moments have summed up the Church s faith in felicitous syntheses . In the course of the centuries an important element of catechesis was constituted by the traditio Symboli transmission of the summary of the faith , followed by the transmission of the Lord s Prayer . This expressive rite has in our_time been reintroduced into the initiation of catechumens . Should not greater use be made of an adapted form of it to mark that_most important stage -atti_degli_apostoli- which a new disciple of Jesus Christ accepts with full awareness and courage the content of what will from then on be the object of his earnest study ? In the Creed of the People of God , proclaimed -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the l th centenary of the martyrdom of the Apostles Peter and Paul , my predecessor Paul VI decided to bring together the essential elements of the Catholic Faith , especially_those that presented greater difficulty or risked being ignored . This -isaia- a sure point of reference for the content of catechesis . Factors That Must Not Be Neglected . In the third chapter of his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii nuntiandi , the same Pope recalled '' the essential content , the living substance '' of evangelization . Catechesis , too , must keep in mind each of these factors and also the living synthesis of which_they_are part . I shall therefore limit myself here simply to recalling one or two points . Anyone can_see , for instance , how important it -isaia- to make_the child , the adolescent , the person advancing in faith understand '' what can be known about God '' ; to be able in a way to tell them : '' What you worship as unknown , this I proclaim to you '' ; to set_forth briefly for them the mystery of the Word of God become man and accomplishing man s salvation by His Passover , that_-isaia- to say , through His death_and_resurrection , but_also by His preaching , by the signs worked by Him , and by the sacraments of His permanent presence in our midst . The synod_fathers were indeed inspired when_they asked that care should be taken not to reduce Christ to His humanity alone or His message to a no more_than earthly dimension , but_that He should be recognized as the Son of God , the Mediator giving us in the Spirit free access to the Father . It -isaia- important to display before the eyes of the intelligence and of the heart , in the light_of_faith , the sacrament of Christ s presence constituted by the mystery of the Church , which_-isaia- an assembly of human_beings who_are sinners and yet have -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time been sanctified and who make up the family of God gathered together by the Lord under_the_guidance of those_whom '' the Holy Spirit has made . guardians , to feed the Church of God . '' It -isaia- important to explain that the history of the human_race , marked as it -isaia- by grace and sin , greatness and misery , -isaia- taken up by God in His Son Jesus , '' foreshadowing in some_way the age which_-isaia- to come . '' Finally , it -isaia- important to reveal frankly the demands demands_that involve self denial but_also joy made by what_the Apostle Paul liked to call '' newness of life , '' '' a new creation , '' being in Christ , and '' eternal_life in Christ Jesus , '' which -isaia-_the_same thing as life in the world but lived in accordance_with_the beatitudes and called to an extension and transfiguration hereafter . Hence the importance in catechesis of personal moral commitments in keeping_with_the Gospel and of Christian attitudes , whether heroic or very simple , to life and the world what we call the Christian or evangelical virtues . Hence also , in its endeavor to educate faith , the concern of catechesis not to omit but to clarify properly realities such as man s activity for his integral liberation , the search_for a society with_greater solidarity and fraternity , the fight for_justice and the building of peace . Besides , it -isaia- not to be thought that_this dimension of catechesis -isaia- altogether new . As early as the patristic age , St . John Chrysostom to quote only them gave prominence to the social consequences of the demands made by the Gospel . Close to our own_time , the catechism of St . Pius X explicitly listed oppressing the poor and depriving workers of their just wages among the sins that cry to God for vengeance . Since Rerum novarum especially , social concern has_been actively present in the catechetical teaching of the Popes and the Bishops . Many synod_fathers rightly insisted that the rich heritage of the Church s social_teaching should , in appropriate forms , find a place in the general catechetical education of the faithful . With regard to the content of catechesis , three important points deserve special_attention today . The first point concerns the integrity of the content . In order_that the sacrificial offering of his or her faith should be perfect , the person_who becomes a disciple of Christ has the right to receive '' the word of faith '' not in mutilated , falsified or diminished form but whole and entire , in all its rigor and vigor . Unfaithfulness on some point to the integrity of the message means a dangerous weakening of catechesis and putting -atti_degli_apostoli- risk the results that Christ and the ecclesial_community have a right to expect from it . It -isaia- certainly not by chance that the final command of Jesus in Matthew s Gospel bears the mark of a certain entireness : '' All authority . has_been_given to me . make disciples of all nations . teaching them to observe all . I -amos- with you always . '' This -isaia- why , when a person first becomes aware of '' the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus , '' whom he has encountered by faith , and has the perhaps unconscious desire to know Him more extensively and better , '' hearing about Him and being taught in Him , as the truth_-isaia- in Jesus , there_-isaia- no valid pretext for refusing Him any part whatever of that knowledge . What kind of catechesis would it be that failed to give their full place to man s creation and sin ; to God s plan of redemption and its long , loving preparation and realization ; to the incarnation of the Son of God ; to Mary , the Immaculate One , the Mother of God , ever Virgin , raised body_and_soul to the glory of heaven , and to her role in the mystery of salvation ; to the mystery of lawlessness -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our_lives and the power of God freeing us from it ; to the need_for penance and asceticism ; to the sacramental and liturgical actions ; to the reality of the Eucharistic Presence ; to participation in divine_life here and hereafter , and so on ? Thus , no true catechist can lawfully , on his_own initiative , make a selection of what he considers important in the deposit of faith as opposed to what he considers unimportant , so as to teach the one and reject the other . By Means of Suitable Pedagogical Methods . This gives_rise to a second remark . It can happen that in the present situation of catechesis reasons of method or pedagogy suggest that the communication of the riches of the content of catechesis should be organized in one way rather_than another . Besides , integrity does_not dispense from balance and from the organic hierarchical character through_which the truths to be taught , the norms to be transmitted , and the ways of Christian life to be indicated will be given the proper importance due to each . It can_also happen that a particular sort of language proves preferable for transmitting this content to a particular individual or group . The choice made will be a valid one to the extent_that , far_from_being dictated by more_or_less subjective theories or prejudices stamped with a certain ideology , it -isaia- inspired by the humble concern to stay closer to a content that_must remain intact . The method and language used must truly be means_for communicating the whole and not_just a part of '' the words of eternal_life '' and the '' ways of life . '' Ecumenical Dimension of Catechesis . The great movement , one certainly inspired by the Spirit of Jesus , that_has for some years been causing the Catholic Church to seek with_other Christian Churches or confessions the restoration of the perfect unity willed by the Lord , brings me to the question of the ecumenical character of catechesis . This movement reached its_full prominence in the Second Vatican Council and since then has_taken on a new extension within_the Church , as -isaia- shown concretely by the impressive series of events and initiatives with_which everyone -isaia-_now familiar . Catechesis cannot remain aloof from this ecumenical dimension , since all the faithful_are called to share , according_to_their capacity and place in the Church , in the movement towards unity . Catechesis will_have an ecumenical dimension if , while not ceasing to teach that the fullness of the revealed truths and of the means of salvation instituted by Christ -isaia- found in the Catholic Church , it does so with sincere respect , in words and in deeds , for the ecclesial_communities that_are not in perfect communion with this Church . In this_context , it -isaia- extremely important to give a correct and fair presentation of the other Churches and ecclesial_communities that the Spirit of Christ does_not refrain from using as means of salvation ; '' moreover , some , even very many , of the outstanding elements and endowments which together go to build up and give life to the Church herself , can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church . '' Among other_things this presentation will_help Catholics to have both a deeper_understanding of their_own faith and a better acquaintance with and esteem_for their other Christian brethren , thus facilitating the shared search_for the way towards full unity in the whole truth . It should_also help non Catholics to have a better knowledge and appreciation of the Catholic Church and her conviction of being the '' universal help toward salvation . '' Catechesis will_have an ecumenical dimension if , in addition , it creates and fosters a true desire_for unity . This will be true all the more if it inspires serious efforts including the effort of self purification in the humility and the fervor of the Spirit in order to clear the ways with_a_view not to facile irenics made up of omissions and concessions on the level of doctrine , but to perfect unity , when and by what means the Lord will wish . Finally , catechesis will_have an ecumenical dimension if it tries to prepare Catholic children and young_people , as well as adults , for living in contact_with non Catholics , affirming their Catholic identity while respecting the faith of others . Ecumenical Collaboration in the Field of Catechesis . In situations of religious plurality , the Bishops can consider it opportune or even necessary to have certain experiences of collaboration in the field of catechesis between Catholics and other Christians , complementing the normal catechesis that_must in any case be given to Catholics . Such experiences have a theological foundation in the elements shared by all Christians . But the communion of faith between Catholics and other Christians -isaia- not complete and perfect ; in certain cases there_are even profound divergences . Consequently , this ecumenical collaboration -isaia- by its_very nature limited : it must_never mean a '' reduction '' to a common minimum . Furthermore , catechesis does_not consist merely in the teaching of doctrine : it also means initiating into the whole of Christian life , bringing full participation in the sacraments of the Church . Therefore , where there_-isaia- an experience of ecumenical collaboration in the field of catechesis , care must_be_taken that the education of Catholics in the Catholic Church should be well ensured in matters of doctrine and of Christian living . During the synod , a certain number of Bishops drew attention to what_they referred to as the increasingly frequent cases in which_the civil authority or other circumstances impose on the schools in some_countries a common instruction in the Christian religion , with common textbooks , class periods , etc . , for Catholics and non Catholics alike . Needless to say , this_-isaia-_not true catechesis . But this_teaching also_has ecumenical importance when it presents Christian doctrine fairly and honestly . In cases where circumstances impose it , it -isaia- important_that in addition a specifically Catholic catechesis should be ensured with all the greater care . The Question of Textbooks Dealing with the Various Religions . At this_point another observation must be made on the same lines but_from a different point_of_view . State schools sometimes provide their pupils with books that_for cultural reasons history , morals or literature present_the various religions , including the Catholic religion . An objective presentation of historical events , of the different religions and of the various Christian confessions can_make a contribution here to better mutual understanding . Care will then be taken that every_effort -isaia- made to ensure_that the presentation -isaia- truly objective and free_from the distorting influence of ideological and political systems or of prejudices with claims to be scientific . In any case , such schoolbooks can obviously not be considered catechetical works : they lack both the witness of believers stating their_faith to other believers and an understanding of the Christian mysteries and of what_-isaia- specific about Catholicism , as these_are understood within_the faith . EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE CATECHIZED The Importance of Children and the Young . The theme designated by my predecessor Paul VI for the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod of Bishops was : '' Catechesis in our_time , with_special reference to the catechesis of children and young_people . '' The increase in the number of young_people -isaia- without_doubt a fact charged with hope and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with anxiety for a large part of the contemporary world . In certain countries , especially_those of the Third World , more_than half of the population -isaia- under or years of age . This means millions and millions of children and young_people preparing for their adult future . And there_-isaia- more_than just the factor of numbers : recent events , as well as the daily news , tell us that , although this countless multitude of young_people -isaia- here and there dominated by uncertainty and fear , seduced by the escapism of indifference or drugs , or tempted by nihilism and violence , nevertheless it constitutes in its major part the great force that amid many hazards -isaia- set on building the civilization of the future . In our pastoral_care we ask ourselves : How are we to reveal Jesus Christ , God made man , to this multitude of children and young_people , reveal Him not_just in the fascination of a first fleeting encounter but through an acquaintance , growing deeper and clearer daily , with Him , His message , the plan of God that He has revealed , the call He addresses to each_person , and the kingdom that He wishes to establish in this_world with the '' little flock '' of those who_believe in Him , a kingdom that_will be complete only in eternity ? How are we to enable them to know_the meaning , the import , the fundamental requirements , the law of love , the promises and the hopes of this kingdom ? There are_many observations that could be made about the special characteristics that catechesis assumes -atti_degli_apostoli- the different stages of life . One moment that -isaia-_often decisive -isaia-_the_one -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the very young child receives the first elements of catechesis from its parents and the family surroundings . These elements will perhaps be no more_than a simple revelation of a good and provident Father in heaven to whom_the child learns to turn its heart . The very short prayers that the child learns to lisp will be the start of a loving dialogue_with this hidden God whose word it will then begin to hear . I cannot insist too strongly on this early initiation by Christian parents in which_the child s faculties are integrated into a living relationship_with God . It -isaia- a work of prime importance . It demands great love and profound respect_for the child who_has a right to a simple and true presentation of the Christian faith . For the child there comes soon , -atti_degli_apostoli- school and in Church , in institutions connected_with_the parish or with the spiritual care of the Catholic or state school not_only an introduction into a wider social circle , but_also the moment for a catechesis aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- inserting him or her organically into the life of the Church , a moment that includes an immediate preparation_for the celebration of the sacraments . This catechesis -isaia- didactic in character , but -isaia-_directed towards_the giving of witness in the faith . It -isaia- an initial catechesis but_not a fragmentary one , since it will_have to reveal , although in an elementary way , all the principal mysteries of faith and their effects on the child s moral and religious_life . It -isaia- a catechesis that gives meaning to the sacraments , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time it receives from the experience of the sacraments a living dimension that keeps it from remaining merely doctrinal , and it communicates to the child the joy of being a witness to Christ in ordinary life . Next comes puberty and adolescence , with all the greatness and dangers which that age brings . It -isaia- the time of discovering oneself and one_s_own inner world , the time of generous plans , the time_when the feeling of love awakens , with the biological impulses of sexuality , the time of the desire to be together , the time of a particularly intense joy connected_with_the exhilarating discovery of life . But often it -isaia-_also the age of deeper questioning , of anguished or even frustrating searching , of a certain mistrust of others and dangerous introspection , and the age sometimes of the first experiences of setbacks and of disappointments . Catechesis cannot ignore these changeable aspects of this delicate period of life . A catechesis capable of leading the adolescent to reexamine his or her_life and to engage in dialogue , a catechesis that does_not ignore the adolescent s great questions self_giving , belief , love and the means of expressing it constituted by sexuality such a catechesis can be decisive . The revelation of Jesus Christ as a Friend , Guide and Model , capable of being admired but_also imitated ; the revelation of this message which provides an answer to the fundamental questions , the revelation of the loving plan of Christ the Savior as the incarnation of the only authentic love and as the possibility of uniting the human_race all this_can provide the basis for genuine education in faith . Above all , the mysteries of the passion and death of Jesus , through_which , according to St . Paul , he merited His glorious resurrection , can speak eloquently to the adolescent s conscience and heart and cast light on his_first sufferings and on the suffering of the world that_he_-isaia- discovering . With youth comes the moment of the first great decisions . Although the young may enjoy_the support of the members of their family and their friends , they_have to rely on themselves and their_own conscience and must ever_more frequently and decisively assume responsibility_for their destiny . Good and evil , grace and sin , life and death will more_and_more confront one_another within them , not_just as moral categories but chiefly as fundamental options which_they must accept or reject lucidly , conscious of their_own responsibility . It -isaia- obvious that a catechesis which denounces selfishness in the name of generosity , and which without_any illusory over simplification presents the Christian meaning of work , of the common_good , of justice and charity , a catechesis on international peace and on the advancement of human_dignity , on development , and on liberation , as these_are presented in recent documents of the Church , fittingly completes in the minds of the young the good catechesis on strictly religious realities which_-isaia- never to be neglected . Catechesis then takes on considerable importance , since_it_-isaia- the time_when the Gospel can be presented , understood and accepted as capable of giving meaning to life and thus of inspiring attitudes that_would have no other explanation , such as self sacrifice , detachment , forbearance , justice , commitment , reconciliation , a sense of the Absolute and the unseen . All these_are traits that distinguish a young person from his or her companions as a disciple of Jesus Christ . Catechesis thus prepares for the important Christian commitments of adult life . For example , it -isaia- certain_that many vocations to the priesthood and religious_life have_their origin during a well imparted catechesis in infancy and adolescence . From infancy until the threshold of maturity , catechesis -isaia- thus a permanent school of the faith and follows the major stages of life , like a beacon lighting the path of the child , the adolescent and the young person . The Adaptation of Catechesis for Young People . It -isaia- reassuring to note that , during the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod and the following years , the Church has widely shared in concern about how to impart catechesis to children and young_people . God grant that the attention thus aroused will long endure in the Church s consciousness . In this_way the synod has_been valuable for the whole Church by seeking to trace with the greatest possible precision the complex characteristics of present_day youth ; by showing that_these young persons speak a language into which_the message of Jesus must be translated with patience and wisdom and without betrayal ; by demonstrating that , in spite of appearances , these young_people have within them , even_though often in a confused way , not_just a readiness or openness , but_rather a real desire to know '' Jesus . who_-isaia- called Christ '' ; and by indicating that if the work of catechesis -isaia- to be carried_out rigorously and seriously , it -isaia- today more difficult and tiring than_ever before , because of the obstacles and difficulties of all kinds that it meets ; but_it_-isaia- also more consoling , because of the depth of the response it receives from children and young_people . This -isaia- a treasure which_the Church can and should count on in the years ahead . Children and young people_who_are physically or mentally handicapped come first to mind . They have a right , like others of their age , to know '' the mystery of faith . '' The greater difficulties that_they encounter give greater merit to their_efforts and to those of their teachers . It -isaia- pleasant to see_that Catholic organizations especially dedicated to young handicapped people contributed to the synod a renewed desire to deal better with this important problem . They deserve to be given warm encouragement in this endeavor . Young People Without Religious Support . My thoughts turn next to the ever_increasing number of children and young_people born and brought up in a non Christian or -atti_degli_apostoli- least non practicing home but who wish to know_the Christian faith . They must be ensured a catechesis attuned to them , so that_they_will be able to grow in faith and live by lt more_and_more , in spite of the lack of support or even the opposition they meet in their surroundings . To continue the series of receivers of catechesis , I cannot_fail to emphasize now one_of_the_most constant concerns of the synod_fathers , a concern imposed with vigor and urgency by present experiences throughout_the_world : I -amos- referring to the central problem of the catechesis of adults . This -isaia- the principal form of catechesis , because_it_-isaia- addressed to persons_who have_the greatest responsibilities and the capacity to live the Christian message in its fully developed form . The Christian community cannot carry_out a permanent catechesis without_the direct and skilled participation of adults , whether as receivers or as promoters of catechetical activity . The world , in which_the young are_called to live and to give witness to the faith_which catechesis seeks to deepen and strengthen , -isaia- governed by adults . The faith of these adults too should continually be enlightened , stimulated and renewed , so that_it_may pervade the temporal realities in their charge . Thus , for catechesis to be effective , it must be permanent , and it would be quite useless if it stopped short -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of maturity , since catechesis , admittedly under another form , proves no less necessary_for adults . Among the adults who need catechesis , our pastoral missionary concern -isaia-_directed to those_who were born and reared in areas not_yet Christianized , and who have_never been_able to study deeply the Christian teaching that the circumstances of life have -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain moment caused them to come across . It -isaia-_also directed to those_who in childhood received a catechesis suited to their age but who later drifted away from all religious practice and as adults find_themselves with religious knowledge of a rather childish kind . It -isaia- likewise directed to those_who feel the effects of a catechesis received early in life but badly imparted or badly assimilated . It -isaia-_directed to those_who , although they_were born in a Christian country or in sociologically Christian surroundings , have_never been educated in their_faith and , as adult are really catechumens . Diversified and Complementary Forms of Catechesis . Catechesis -isaia- therefore for adults of every_age , including the elderly persons_who deserve particular attention in view of their experience and their problems no less_than for children , adolescents and the young . We should_also mention migrants , those_who_are by passed by modern developments , those_who live in areas of large cities which are_often without churches , buildings and suitable organization , and other such groups . It -isaia- desirable that initiatives meant to give all these groups a Christian formation , with appropriate means audio visual aids , booklets , discussions , lectures , should increase in number , enabling many adults to fill the gap left by an insufficient or deficient catechesis , to complete harmoniously -atti_degli_apostoli- a higher level their childhood catechesis , or even to prepare themselves enough in this_field to be able to help others in a more_serious way . It -isaia- important also_that the catechesis of children and young_people , permanent catechesis , and the catechesis of adults should_not be separate watertight compartments . It -isaia- even_more important_that there_should be no break between_them . On the contrary , their perfect complementarity must be fostered : adults have much to give to young_people and children in the field of catechesis , but_they can_also receive much from them_for the growth of their_own Christian lives . It must be restated that nobody in the Church of Jesus Christ should feel excused from receiving catechesis . This -isaia- true even of young seminarians and young religious , and of all those called to the task of being pastors and catechists . They will fulfill this_task all the better if they_are humble pupils of the Church , the great giver as well as the great receiver of catechesis . SOME WAYS AND MEANS OF CATECHESIS Communications Media . From the oral teaching by the apostles and the letters circulating among the churches down to the most modern means , catechesis has not ceased to look for the most suitable ways and means_for its mission , with the active participation of the communities and -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of the pastors . This effort must continue . I think immediately of the great possibilities offered by the means of social communication and the means of group communication : television , radio , the press , records , tape recordings the whole series of audio visual means . The achievements in these spheres are such as to encourage the greatest hope . Experience shows , for example , the effect had by instruction given on radio or television , when it combines a high aesthetic level and rigorous fidelity to the magisterium . The Church now has many opportunities_for considering these questions as , for instance , on Social Communications Days and it -isaia- not necessary to speak of them -atti_degli_apostoli- length here , in spite of their prime importance . Utilization of Various Places , Occasions and Gatherings . I -amos- also thinking of various occasions of special value which_are exactly suitable for catechesis : for example , diocesan , regional or national pilgrimages , which gain from being centered on some judiciously chosen theme based on the life of Christ , of the Blessed Virgin or of the saints . Then there_are the traditional missions , often too hastily dropped but irreplaceable for the periodic and vigorous renewal of Christian life they_should be revived and brought up to date . Again there_are Bible study groups , which ought to go beyond exegesis and lead their members to live by the Word of God . Yet other instances are the meetings of ecclesial basic communities , in so far as they correspond to the criteria laid_down in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii nuntiandi . I may also mention the youth groups that , under varying names and forms but always with the purpose of making Jesus Christ known and of living by the Gospel , are in some areas multiplying and flourishing in a sort of springtime that -isaia-_very comforting for the Church . These include Catholic action groups , charitable groups , prayer groups and Christian meditation groups . These groups are a source of great hope_for the Church of tomorrow . But , in the name of Jesus , I exhort the young_people who belong to them , their leaders , and the priests_who devote the best part of their_ministry to them : no matter what it costs , do not_allow these groups which_are exceptional occasions for meeting others , and which_are blessed with_such riches of friendship and solidarity among the young , of joy and enthusiasm , of reflection on events and facts do not_allow them to lack serious study of Christian doctrine . If they do , they_will be in danger a danger that_has unfortunately proved only too real of disappointing their members and also the Church . The catechetical endeavor that_-isaia- possible in these various surroundings , and in many_others besides , will_have all the greater chance of being accepted and bearing fruit if it respects their individual nature . By becoming part of them in the right way , it will achieve the diversity and complementarity of approach that will_enable it to develop all the riches of its concept , with its three dimensions of word , memorial and witness doctrine , celebration and commitment in living which_the synod Message to the People of God emphasized . This remark -isaia- even_more valid for the catechesis given in the setting of the liturgy , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharistic assembly . Respecting the specific nature and proper cadence of this setting , the homily takes up again the journey of faith put forward by catechesis , and brings it to its natural fulfillment . At the same_time it encourages the Lord s disciples to begin anew each_day their_spiritual journey in truth , adoration and thanksgiving . Accordingly , one_can say that catechetical teaching too finds_its source and its fulfillment in the Eucharist , within_the whole circle of the liturgical year . Preaching , centered upon the Bible texts , must then in its_own way make it possible to familiarize the faithful with the whole of the mysteries of the faith and with the norms of Christian living . Much attention must_be_given to the homily : it should be neither too long nor too short ; it should_always be carefully prepared , rich in substance and adapted to the hearers , and reserved to ordained ministers . The homily should_have its place not_only in every Sunday and feast day Eucharist , but_also in the celebration of baptisms , penitential liturgies , marriages and funerals . This -isaia- one of the benefits of the liturgical renewal . Among these various_ways and means all the Church s activities have a catechetical dimension catechetical works , far from losing their essential importance , acquire fresh significance . One of the major features of the renewal of catechetics today -isaia- the rewriting and multiplication of catechetical books taking place in many_parts of the Church . Numerous very successful works have_been produced and are a real treasure in the service of catechetical instruction . But it must be humbly and honestly recognized that_this rich flowering has brought with it articles and publications which_are ambiguous and harmful to young_people and to the life of the Church . In certain places , the desire to find the best forms of expression or to keep up with fashions in pedagogical methods has often enough resulted in certain catechetical works which bewilder the young and even adults , either by deliberately or unconsciously omitting elements essential to the Church s faith , or by attributing excessive importance to certain themes -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of others , or , chiefly , by a rather horizontalist overall view out of keeping_with_the teaching of the Church s magisterium . Therefore , it -isaia-_not_enough to multiply catechetical works . In order_that these works may correspond with_their aim , several conditions are essential : a they_must be linked_with the real life of the generation to which_they_are addressed , showing close acquaintance with its anxieties and questionings , struggles and hopes ; b they_must try to speak a language comprehensible to the generation in question ; c they_must make a point of giving the whole message of Christ and His Church , without neglecting or distorting anything , and in expounding it they_will follow a line and structure that highlights what_-isaia- essential ; d they_must really aim to give to those_who use them a better knowledge of the mysteries of Christ , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- true conversion and a life more in conformity_with God s will . All those_who take on the heavy task of preparing these catechetical tools , especially catechism texts , can do so only_with the approval of the pastors who have_the authority to give it , and taking their inspiration as closely as possible from the General Catechetical Directory , which remains the standard of reference . ln this_regard , I must warmly encourage episcopal_conferences of the whole_world to undertake , patiently but resolutely , the considerable work to be accomplished in agreement with the Apostolic See in order to prepare genuine catechisms which_will be faithful to the essential content of revelation and up to date in method , and which_will be capable of educating the Christian generations of the future to a sturdy faith . This brief mention of ways and means of modern catechetics does_not exhaust the wealth of suggestions worked out by the synod_fathers . It -isaia- comforting to think_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time every country -isaia- seeing valuable collaboration for a more organic and more secure renewal of these aspects of catechetics . There can be no doubt_that the Church will_find the experts and the right means_for responding , with God s grace , to the complex requirements of communicating with the people of today . HOW TO IMPART CATECHESIS Diversity of Methods . The age and the intellectual development of Christians , their degree of ecclesial and spiritual maturity and many_other personal circumstances demand_that catechesis should adopt widely differing methods for the attainment of its specific aim : education in the faith . On a more general level , this variety -isaia-_also demanded by the social_and_cultural surrounding in which_the Church carries out her catechetical work . The variety in the methods used -isaia- a sign of life and a resource . That -isaia- how it was considered by the fathers of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod , although they_also drew attention to the conditions necessary_for that variety to be useful and not harmful to the unity of the teaching of the one Faith . At the Service of Revelation and Conversion . The first question of a general kind that presents itself here concerns the danger and the temptation to mix catechetical teaching unduly with overt or masked ideological views , especially political and social ones , or with personal political options . When such views get the better of the central message to be transmitted , to the point of obscuring it and putting it in second place or even using it to further their_own ends , catechesis then becomes radically distorted . The synod rightly insisted on the need_for catechesis to remain above one sided divergent trends to avoid '' dichotomies '' even in the field of theological interpretation of such questions . It -isaia- on the basis of revelation that catechesis will try to set its course , revelation as transmitted by the universal magisterium of the Church , in its solemn or ordinary form . This revelation tells of a creating and redeeming God , Whose Son has come among us in our flesh and enters not_only into each_individual s personal history but into human_history itself , becoming its center . Accordingly , this revelation tells of the radical chance of man and the universe , of all that makes up the web of human_life under the influence of the Good News of Jesus Christ . If conceived in this_way , catechesis goes beyond every_form of formalistic moralism , although it will include true Christian moral teaching . Chiefly , it goes beyond any_kind of temporal , social or political '' messianism . '' It seeks to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- man s innermost being . The Message Embodied in Cultures . Now a second question . As I said recently to the members of the Biblical Commission : '' The term acculturation or inculturation may be a neologism , but it expresses very well one factor of the great mystery of the Incarnation . '' We can say of catechesis , as well as of evangelization in general , that_it_-isaia- called to bring_the power of the Gospel into the very_heart of culture and cultures . For this_purpose , catechesis will seek to know these cultures and their essential components ; it will learn their most significant expressions ; it will respect their particular values and riches . In this manner it will_be_able to offer these cultures the knowledge of the hidden mystery and help_them to bring forth_from their_own living tradition original expressions of Christian life , celebration and thought . Two things must however be kept in mind . On the one_hand the Gospel message cannot be purely and simply isolated from the culture in which it was first inserted the biblical world or , more concretely , the cultural milieu in which Jesus of Nazareth lived , nor , without serious loss , from the cultures in which it has_already_been expressed down_the_centuries ; it does_not spring spontaneously from any cultural soil ; it has_always_been transmitted by means of an apostolic dialogue which inevitably becomes part of a certain dialogue of cultures . On the other_hand , the power of the Gospel everywhere transforms and regenerates . When that power enters into a culture , it -isaia- no surprise that it rectifies many of its elements . There would be no catechesis if it were_the Gospel that had to change when it came into contact_with_the cultures . To forget this_would simply amount to what St . Paul very forcefully calls '' emptying the cross of Christ of its power . '' It -isaia- a different matter to take , with wise discernment , certain elements , religious or otherwise , that form part of the cultural heritage of a human group and use them to help its_members to understand better the whole of the Christian mystery . Genuine catechists know_that catechesis '' takes flesh '' in the various cultures and milieux : one_has only to think of the peoples with_their great differences , of modern youth , of the great variety of circumstances in which people find_themselves today . But they refuse to accept an impoverishment of catechesis through a renunciation or obscuring of its message , by adaptations , even in language , that_would endanger the '' precious deposit '' of the faith , or by concessions in matters of faith or morals . They are convinced_that true catechesis eventually enriches these cultures by helping them to go beyond_the defective or even inhuman features in them , and by communicating to their legitimate values the fullness of Christ . The Contribution of Popular Devotion . Another question of method concerns the utilization in catechetical instruction of valid elements in popular_piety . I have in mind devotions practiced by the faithful in certain regions with moving fervor and purity of intention , even if the faith underlying them needs to be purified or rectified in many aspects . I have in mind certain easily understood prayers that_many simple people_are fond of repeating . I have in mind certain acts of piety practiced with a sincere desire to do penance or to please the Lord . Underlying most of these prayers and practices , besides elements that should be discarded , there_are other elements which , if they_were properly used , could serve very well to help people advance towards knowledge of the mystery of Christ and of His message : the love and mercy of God , the Incarnation of Christ , His redeeming cross and resurrection , the activity of the Spirit in each Christian and in the Church , the mystery of the hereafter , the evangelical virtues to be practiced , the presence of the Christian in the world , etc . And why should we appeal to non Christian or even anti Christian elements refusing to build on elements which , even if they_need to be revised or improved , have something Christian -atti_degli_apostoli- their root ? Memorization . The final methodological question the importance of which_should -atti_degli_apostoli- least be referred to one_that was debated several times in the synod -isaia- that of memorization . In the beginnings of Christian catechesis , which coincided with a civilization that_was mainly oral , recourse was had very freely to memorization . Catechesis has since then known a long tradition of learning the principal truths by memorizing . We are all aware_that this method can present certain disadvantages , not the least of which_-isaia- that it lends itself to insufficient or -atti_degli_apostoli- times almost non existent assimilation , reducing all knowledge to formulas that_are repeated without being properly understood . These disadvantages and the different characteristics of our_own civilization have in some places led to the almost complete suppression according to some , alas , the definitive suppression of memorization in catechesis . And yet certain very authoritative voices made themselves heard on the occasion of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod , calling for the restoration of a judicious balance between reflection and spontaneity , between dialogue and silence , between written work and memory work . Moreover certain cultures still set great value on memorization . At a time_when , in non religious teaching in certain countries , more_and_more complaints are_being made about the unfortunate consequences of disregarding the human faculty of memory , should we not attempt to put this faculty back into use in an intelligent and even an original way in catechesis , all the more since_the celebration or '' memorial '' of the great events of the history_of_salvation require a precise knowledge of them ? A certain memorization of the words of Jesus , of important Bible passages , of the Ten Commandments , of the formulas of profession of the faith , of the liturgical texts , of the essential prayers , of key doctrinal ideas , etc . , far_from_being opposed to the dignity of young Christians , or constituting an obstacle to personal dialogue_with_the Lord , -isaia- a real need , as the synod_fathers forcefully recalled . The blossoms , if we may call them that , of faith and piety do not grow in the desert places of a memory less catechesis . What -isaia- essential -isaia- that the texts that_are memorized must -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time be taken in and gradually understood in depth , in order to become a source of Christian life on the personal level and the community level . The plurality of methods in contemporary catechesis can be a sign of vitality and ingenuity . In any case , the method chosen must ultimately be referred to a law that_-isaia- fundamental for the whole of the Church s life : the law of fidelity to God and of fidelity to man in a single loving attitude . THE JOY OF FAITH IN A TROUBLED WORLD Affirming Christian Identity . We live in a difficult world in which_the anguish of seeing the best creations of man slip away from him and turn against him creates a climate of uncertainty . In this_world catechesis should help Christians to be , for their_own joy and the service of all , '' light '' and '' salt . '' Undoubtedly this demands_that catechesis should strengthen them in their identity and that it should continually separate itself from the surrounding atmosphere of hesitation , uncertainty and insipidity . Among the many difficulties , each of them a challenge for faith , I shall indicate a few in order to assist catechesis in overcoming them . A few years_ago , there_was much talk of the secularized world , the post Christian era . Fashion changes , but a profound reality remains . Christians today must be formed to live in a world_which largely ignores God or which , in religious matters , in place of an exacting and fraternal dialogue , stimulating for all , too_often flounders in a debasing indifferentism , if it does_not remain in a scornful attitude of '' suspicion '' in the name of the progress it has made in the field of scientific '' explanations . '' To '' hold on '' in this_world , to offer to all a '' dialogue of salvation '' in which each_person feels respected in his or her most basic dignity , the dignity of one_who_-isaia- seeking God , we need a catechesis which trains the young_people and adults of our communities to remain clear and consistent in their_faith , to affirm serenely their Christian and Catholic identity , to '' see him_who_-isaia- invisible '' and to adhere so firmly to the absoluteness of God that_they_can be witnesses to Him in a materialistic civilization that denies Him . With the Original Pedagogy of the Faith . The irreducible originality of Christian identity has for corollary and condition no less original a pedagogy of the faith . Among the many prestigious sciences of man that_are nowadays making immense advances , pedagogy -isaia- certainly one_of_the_most important . The attainments of the other sciences biology , psychology , sociology are providing it with valuable elements . The science of education and the art of teaching are continually being subjected to review , with_a_view to making them better adapted or more_effective , with varying degrees of success . There -isaia-_also a pedagogy of faith , and the good that it can do for catechesis cannot be overstated . In fact , it -isaia- natural that techniques perfected and tested for education in general should be adapted for the service of education in the faith . However , account must_always be taken of the absolute originality of faith . Pedagogy of faith_-isaia- not a question of transmitting human knowledge , even of the highest kind ; it -isaia-_a_question of communicating God s revelation in its entirety . Throughout sacred history , especially in the Gospel , God Himself used a pedagogy that_must continue to be a model for the pedagogy of faith . A technique -isaia- of value in catechesis only to the extent_that it serves the faith that_-isaia- to be transmitted and learned ; otherwise it -isaia- of no value . Language Suited to the Service of the Credo . A problem very close to the preceding one_-isaia- that of language . This -isaia- obviously a burning question today . It -isaia- paradoxical to see_that , while modern studies , for instance in the field of communication , semantics and symbology , attribute extraordinary importance to language , nevertheless language -isaia- being misused today for ideological mystification , for mass conformity in thought and for reducing man to the level of an object . All this_has extensive influence in the field of catechesis . For catechesis has a pressing obligation to speak a language suited to today s children and young_people in general and to many_other categories of people the language of students , intellectuals and scientists ; the language of the illiterate or of people of simple culture ; the language of the handicapped , and so on . Augustine encountered this_same problem and contributed to its solution for his own_time with_his wellknown work De Catechizandis Rudibus . In catechesis as in theology , there_-isaia- no doubt_that the question of language -isaia- of the first order . But there_-isaia- good_reason for recalling here that catechesis cannot admit any language that_would result in altering the substance of the content of the Creed , under any pretext whatever , even a pretended scientific one . Deceitful or beguiling language -isaia- no better . On the contrary , the supreme rule -isaia- that the great advances in the science of language must be capable of being placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of catechesis so as to enable it really to '' tell '' or '' communicate '' to the child , the adolescent , the young_people and adults of today the whole content of doctrine without distortion . Research and Certainty of Faith . A more subtle challenge occasionally comes_from_the very way of conceiving faith . Certain contemporary philosophical schools , which seem to be exercising a strong influence on some theological currents and , through them , on pastoral practice , like to emphasize that the fundamental human attitude -isaia- that of seeking the infinite , a seeking that never attains its object . In theology , this view of things will state very categorically that faith_-isaia- not certainty but questioning , not clarity but a leap in the dark . These currents of thought certainly have_the advantage of reminding us that_faith concerns things not_yet in our possession , since_they are hoped for ; that as yet we see only '' in a mirror dimly '' ; and that God dwells always in inaccessible light . They help us to make_the Christian faith not the attitude of one_who has_already arrived , but a journey forward as with Abraham . For all the more reason one_must avoid presenting as certain things_which are_not . However , we must_not fall_into the opposite extreme , as too_often happens . The Letter to the Hebrews says_that '' faith_-isaia- the assurance of things hoped for , the conviction of things not seen . '' Although we are_not in full possession , we do have an assurance and a conviction . When educating children , adolescents and young_people , let us not give_them too negative an idea of faith as if it were absolute non knowing , a kind of blindness , a world of darkness but let us show them that the humble yet courageous seeking of the believer , far from having its starting point in nothingness , in plain self deception , in fallible opinions or in uncertainty , -isaia- based on the Word of God who cannot deceive or be deceived , and -isaia- unceasingly built on the immovable rock of this Word . It -isaia- the search of the Magi under_the_guidance of a star , the search of which Pascal , taking up a phrase of St . Augustine , wrote so profoundly : '' You would_not be searching for me , if you had not found me . '' It -isaia-_also one of the aims of catechesis to give young catechumens the simple but solid certainties that_will help_them to seek to know_the Lord more and better . Catechesis and Theology . In this_context , it seems important to me that the connection_between catechesis and theology should be well understood . Obviously this connection -isaia- profound and vital for those_who understand_the irreplaceable mission of theology in the service of Faith . Thus it -isaia- no surprise that_every stirring in the field of theology also_has repercussions in that of catechesis . In this period immediately after_the Council , the Church -isaia- living through an important but hazardous time of theological research . The same must be said of hermeneutics with_respect to exegesis . Synod fathers from all continents dealt_with this_question in very frank terms : they spoke of the danger of an '' unstable balance '' passing from theology to catechesis and they stressed the need to do something about_this difficulty . Pope Paul VI himself had dealt_with the problem in no less frank terms in the introduction to his Solemn Profession of Faith and in the apostolic_exhortation marking the fifth anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council . This point must again be insisted on . Aware of the influence that_their research and their statements have on catechetical instruction , theologians and exegetes have a duty to take great care that people do not take for a certainty what on the contrary belongs to the area of questions of opinion or of discussion among experts . Catechists for their_part must_have the wisdom to pick from the field of theological research those points that_can provide light for their_own reflection and their teaching , drawing , like the theologians , from the true sources , in the light of the magisterium . They must refuse to trouble the minds of the children and young_people , -atti_degli_apostoli- this stage of their catechesis , with outlandish theories , useless questions and unproductive discussions , things_that St . Paul often condemned in his_pastoral letters . The most valuable gift that the Church can_offer to the bewildered and restless world of our_time -isaia- to form within it Christians who_are confirmed in what_-isaia- essential and who_are humbly joyful in their_faith . Catechesis will teach this to them , and it will itself be the first to benefit from it : '' The man_who wishes to understand himself thoroughly and not_just in accordance_with immediate , partial , often superficial , and even illusory standards and measures of his being must come to Christ with_his unrest and uncertainty , and even his weakness and sinfulness , his_life and death . He must , so to speak , enter_into Christ with all his_own self , he must appropriate Christ and assimilate the whole of the reality of the Incarnation and redemption in order to find himself . THE TASK CONCERNS US ALL Encouragement to All Responsible for Catechesis . Now , beloved brothers and sons_and_daughters , I would_like my words , which_are intended as a serious and heartfelt exhortation from me in my ministry as pastor of the universal Church , to set your hearts aflame , like the letters of St . Paul to his companions in the Gospel , Titus and Timothy , or like St . Augustine writing for the deacon Deogratias , when_the latter lost heart before his task as a catechist , a real little treatise on the joy of catechizing . Yes , I wish to sow courage , hope and enthusiasm abundantly in the hearts of all those many diverse people_who_are in charge of religious instruction and training for life in keeping_with_the Gospel . To begin with , I turn to my brother Bishops : The Second Vatican Council has_already explicitly reminded you of your task in the catechetical area , and the fathers of the fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod have_also strongly underlined it . Dearly beloved brothers , you_have here a special mission within your Churches : You are beyond all others the ones primarily responsible_for catechesis , the catechists par excellence . Together with the Pope , in the spirit of episcopal collegiality , you too have charge of catechesis throughout_the Church . Accept therefore what I say to you from my heart . I know_that your ministry as Bishops -isaia- growing daily more complex and overwhelming . A thousand duties call you : from the training of new priests to being actively present within_the lay communities , from the living , worthy celebration of the sacraments and acts of worship to concern_for human advancement and the defense of human_rights . But let_the concern to foster active and effective catechesis yield to no other care whatever in any_way . This concern will_lead you to transmit personally to your faithful the doctrine of life . But it should_also lead you to take on in your diocese , in accordance_with_the plans of the episcopal conference to which_you belong , the chief management of catechesis , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time surrounding yourselves with competent and trustworthy assistants . Your principal role will be to bring_about and maintain in your Churches a real passion for catechesis , a passion embodied in a pertinent and effective organization , putting into operation the necessary personnel , means and equipment , and also financial resources . You can be sure_that if catechesis -isaia- done well in your local Churches , everything else will be easier to do . And needless to say , although your zeal must sometimes impose upon you the thankless task of denouncing deviations and correcting errors , it will much_more often win for you the joy and consolation of seeing your Churches flourishing because catechesis -isaia- given in them as the Lord wishes . For your part , priests , here you_have a field in which_you are the immediate assistants of your Bishops . The Council has called you '' instructors in the faith '' ; there_-isaia- no better way_for you to be such instructors than by devoting your best efforts to the growth of your communities in the faith . Whether you_are in charge of a parish , or are chaplains to primary or secondary schools or universities , or have responsibility_for pastoral_activity -atti_degli_apostoli- any level , or are leaders of large or small communities , especially youth groups , the Church expects you to neglect nothing with_a_view to a well organized and well oriented catechetical effort . The deacons and other ministers that_you_may have_the good fortune to have with you_are your natural assistants in this . All believers have a right to catechesis ; all pastors have_the duty to provide it . I shall always ask civil leaders to respect the freedom of catechetical teaching ; but_with all my strength I beg you , ministers of Jesus Christ : Do not , for lack of zeal or because of some unfortunate preconceived idea , leave the faithful without catechesis . Let it not be said_that '' the children beg for food , but no one gives to them . '' Men and Women Religious . Many religious institutes for men_and_women came into being for the purpose of giving Christian education to children and young_people , especially_the most abandoned . Throughout history , men_and_women_religious have_been deeply committed to the Church s catechetical activity , doing particularly apposite and effective work . At a time when_it_-isaia- desired that the links between religious and pastors should be accentuated and consequently the active presence of religious communities and their members in the pastoral projects of the local Churches , I wholeheartedly exhort you , whose religious consecration should make you even_more readily available for the Church s service , to prepare as well as possible_for the task of catechesis according to the differing vocations of your institutes and the missions entrusted to you , and to carry this concern everywhere . Let the communities dedicate as much as possible of what ability and means they_have to the specific work of catechesis . I -amos- anxious to give thanks in the Church s name to all of you , lay teachers of catechesis in the parishes , the men and the still_more numerous women throughout_the_world who_are devoting yourselves to the religious education of many generations . Your work -isaia-_often lowly and hidden but_it_-isaia- carried_out with ardent and generous zeal , and it -isaia- an eminent form of the lay apostolate , a form that_-isaia- particularly important where for various reasons children and young_people do not receive suitable religious training in the home . How many of us have_received from people like you our_first notions of catechism and our preparation_for the sacrament of Penance , for our_first Communion and Confirmation ! The fourth general_assembly_of_the_synod did_not forget you . I join with it in encouraging you to continue your collaboration for the life of the Church . But the term '' catechists '' belongs above all to the catechists in mission lands . Born of families that are_already Christian or converted -atti_degli_apostoli- some time to Christianity and instructed by missionaries or by another catechist , they then consecrate their_lives , year after year , to catechizing children and adults in their_own country . Churches that_are flourishing today would_not have_been built up without them . I rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- the efforts made by the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples to improve more_and_more the training of these catechists . I gratefully recall_the memory of those_whom the Lord has_already called to Himself . I beg the intercession of those_whom my predecessors have raised to the glory of the altars . I wholeheartedly encourage those engaged in the work . I express the wish_that many_others may succeed them and that_they_may increase in numbers for a task so necessary_for the missions . I now wish to speak of the actual setting in which all these catechists normally work . I -amos- returning this_time , taking a more overall view , to the '' places '' for catechesis , some of which_have already_been mentioned in chapter VI : the parish , the family , the school , organizations . It -isaia- true_that catechesis can be given anywhere , but I wish to stress , in accordance_with_the desire of very many Bishops , that the parish community must continue to be the prime mover and pre eminent place_for catechesis . Admittedly , in many countries the parish has_been as it were shaken by the phenomenon of urbanization . Perhaps some have too easily accepted that the parish should be considered old fashioned , if not doomed to disappear , in favor of more pertinent and effective small communities . Whatever one may think , the parish -isaia- still a major point of reference for the Christian people , even_for the non practicing . Accordingly , realism and wisdom demand_that we continue along the path aiming to restore to the parish , as needed , more adequate structures and , above all a new impetus through the increasing integration into it of qualified , responsible and generous members . This being said and taking into_account_the necessary diversity of places for catechesis the parish as such , families taking in children and adolescents , chaplaincies for State schools , Catholic educational establishments , apostolic movements that give periods of catechesis , clubs open to youth in general , spiritual formation weekends , etc . , it -isaia- supremely important_that all these catechetical channels should really converge on the same confession of faith , on the same membership of the Church , and on commitments in society lived in the same Gospel spirit : '' one Lord , one faith , one baptism , one God and Father . '' That -isaia- why every big parish or every group of parishes with small numbers has the serious duty to train people completely dedicated to providing catechetical leadership priests , men_and_women_religious , and lay_people , to provide the equipment needed_for catechesis under all aspects , to increase and adapt the places for catechesis to the extent that_it_-isaia- possible and useful to do so , and to be watchful about the quality of the religious formation of the various groups and their integration into the ecclesial_community . In short , without monopolizing or enforcing uniformity , the parish remains , as I have_said , the pre eminent place_for catechesis . It must rediscover its vocation , which_-isaia- to be a fraternal and welcoming family home , where those_who_have been baptized and confirmed become aware of forming the People of God . In that home , the bread of good doctrine and the Eucharistic Bread are broken for them in abundance , in the setting of the one act of worship ; from that home they_are sent out day_by_day to their apostolic mission in all the centers of activity of the life of the world . The family s catechetical activity has a special character , which_-isaia- in a sense irreplaceable . This special character has_been rightly stressed by the Church , particularly by the Second Vatican Council . Education in the faith by parents , which_should begin from the children s tenderest age , -isaia-_already being given when_the members of a family help each_other to grow in faith through the witness of their Christian lives , a witness that -isaia-_often without words but_which perseveres throughout a day to day life lived in accordance_with_the Gospel . This catechesis -isaia- more incisive when , in the course of family events such as the reception of the sacraments , the celebration of great liturgical feasts , the birth of a child , a bereavement care -isaia- taken to explain in the home the Christian or religious content of these events . But that -isaia-_not_enough : Christian parents must strive to follow and repeat , within_the setting of family_life , the more methodical teaching received elsewhere . The fact that_these truths about the main questions of faith and Christian living are thus repeated within a family setting impregnated with love and respect will often make it possible to influence the children in a decisive way_for life . The parents themselves profit from the effort that_this demands of them , for in a catechetical dialogue of this_sort each_individual both receives and gives . Family catechesis therefore precedes , accompanies and enriches all other_forms of catechesis . Furthermore , in places_where anti religious legislation endeavors even to prevent education in the faith , and in places_where widespread unbelief or invasive secularism makes real religious growth practically impossible , '' the church of the home '' remains the one place_where children and young_people can receive an authentic catechesis . Thus there cannot be too great an effort on the part of Christian parents to prepare for_this ministry of being their_own children s catechists and to carry it out with tireless zeal . Encouragement must_also be given to the individuals or institutions that , through person to person contacts , through meetings , and through all kinds of pedagogical means , help parents to perform their task : The service they_are doing to catechesis -isaia- beyond price . Together with and in connection_with the family , the school provides catechesis with possibilities that_are not to be neglected . In the unfortunately decreasing number of countries in which_it_-isaia- possible to give education in the faith within_the school framework , the Church has the duty to do so as well as possible . This of course concerns first_and_foremost the Catholic school : it would no longer deserve this title if , no matter how_much it shone for its high level of teaching in non religious matters , there_were justification for reproaching it for negligence or deviation in strictly religious education . Let it not be said_that such education will_always be given implicitly and indirectly . The special character of the Catholic school , the underlying reason_for it , the reason_why Catholic parents should prefer it , -isaia- precisely_the quality of the religious instruction integrated into the education of the pupils . While Catholic establishments should respect freedom of conscience , that_-isaia- to say , avoid burdening consciences from without by exerting physical or moral pressure , especially in the case of the religious activity of adolescents , they still have a grave duty to offer a religious training suited to the often widely varying religious situations of the pupils . They also have a duty to make_them understand_that , although God s call to serve Him in spirit and truth , in accordance_with_the Commandments of God and the precepts of the Church , does_not apply constraint , it -isaia- nevertheless binding in conscience . But I -amos- also thinking of non confessional and public schools . I express the fervent wish_that , in response to a very clear right of the human_person and of the family , and out of respect_for everyone s religious_freedom , all Catholic pupils may be enabled to advance in their_spiritual formation with the aid of a religious instruction dependent on the Church , but_which , according to the circumstances of different countries , can be offered either by the school or in the setting of the school , or again within_the framework of an agreement with the public_authorities regarding school timetables , if catechesis takes_place only in the parish or in another pastoral center . In fact , even in places_where objective difficulties exist , it should be possible to arrange school timetables in such_a_way as to enable the Catholics to deepen their_faith and religious experience , with qualified teachers , whether priests or lay_people . Admittedly , apart_from the school , many_other elements of life help in influencing the mentality of the young , for instance , recreation , social background and work surroundings . But those_who study are_bound to bear the stamp of their studies , to be introduced to cultural or moral values within_the atmosphere of the establishment in which_they_are taught , and to be faced_with many ideas met with in school . It -isaia- important_for catechesis to take full account of this effect of the school on the pupils , if it -isaia- to keep in touch with the other elements of the pupil s knowledge and education ; thus_the Gospel will impregnate the mentality of the pupils in the field of their learning , and the harmonization of their culture will be achieved in the light_of_faith . Accordingly , I give encouragement to the priests , religious and lay people_who_are devoting themselves to sustaining these pupils faith . This -isaia- moreover an occasion for me to reaffirm my firm conviction_that to show respect_for the Catholic faith of the young to the extent of facilitating its education , its implantation , its consolidation , its free profession and practice would certainly be to the honor of any government , whatever be the system on which_it_-isaia- based or the ideology from which it draws its inspiration . Lastly , encouragement must_be_given to the lay associations , movements and groups , whether their aim -isaia- the practice of piety , the direct apostolate , charity and relief work , or a Christian presence in temporal matters . They will all accomplish their objectives better , and serve the Church better , if they give an important place in their internal organization and their method of action to the serious religious training of their members . In this_way every association of the faithful in the Church has by definition the duty to educate in the faith . This makes more evident the role given to the laity in catechesis today , always under the pastoral direction of their Bishops , as the propositions left by the synod stressed several times . We must be grateful to the Lord for_this contribution by the laity , but_it_-isaia- also a challenge to our responsibility as pastors , since these lay catechists must be carefully prepared_for what_-isaia- , if not a formally instituted ministry , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very least a function of great_importance in the Church . Their preparation calls on us to organize special centers and institutes , which_are to be given assiduous attention by the Bishops . This -isaia- a field in which diocesan , interdiocesan or national cooperation proves fertile and fruitful . Here also the material aid provided by the richer Churches to their poor sisters can show the greatest effectiveness , for_what better assistance can one Church give to another than to help it to grow as a Church with its_own strength ? I would_like to recall to all those_who_are working generously in the service of the Gospel , and to whom I have expressed here my lively encouragement , the instruction given by my venerated predecessor Paul VI : '' As evangelizers , we must offer . the image of people_who_are mature in faith and capable of finding a meeting point beyond_the real tensions , thanks to a shared , sincere and disinterested search_for truth . Yes , the destiny of evangelization_-isaia- certainly bound up with the witness of unity given by the Church . This -isaia- a source of responsibility and also of comfort . '' CONCLUSION The Holy Spirit , the Teacher Within . At the end of this apostolic_exhortation , the gaze of my heart turns to Him who_-isaia- the principle inspiring all catechetical work and all who do this_work the Spirit of the Father and of the Son , the Holy Spirit . In describing the mission that_this Spirit would_have in the Church , Christ used the significant words : '' He will teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I have_said to you . '' And He added : '' When the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth . he will declare to you the things_that_are to come . '' The Spirit -isaia- thus promised to the Church and to each Christian as a teacher within , who , in the secret of the conscience and the heart , makes one understand what one_has heard but was_not capable of grasping : '' Even now the Holy Spirit teaches the faithful , '' said St . Augustine in this_regard , '' in accordance_with each_one s spiritual capacity . And he sets their_hearts aflame with_greater desire according as each_one progresses in the charity that makes him love what he already knows and desire what he has yet to know . '' Furthermore , the Spirit s mission_-isaia- also to transform the disciples into witnesses to Christ : '' He will bear_witness to me ; and you also are witnesses . '' But this_-isaia-_not all . Paul , who on this_matter synthesizes a theology that_-isaia- latent throughout_the New Testament , it -isaia- the whole of one s '' being a Christian , '' the whole of the Christian life , the new_life of the children of God , that constitutes a life in accordance_with_the Spirit . Only the Spirit enables us to say to God : '' Abba , Father . '' Without the Spirit we cannot say : '' Jesus -isaia- Lord . '' From the Spirit come all the charisms that build up the Church , the community of Christians . In keeping_with this , St . Paul gives each disciple of Christ the instruction : '' Be filled_with_the Spirit . Augustine -isaia-_very explicit : '' Both our believing and our doing good are ours because of the choice of our will , and yet both are gifts from the Spirit of faith and charity . '' Catechesis , which_-isaia- growth in faith and the maturing of Christian life towards its fullness , -isaia- consequently a work of the Holy Spirit , a work that He alone_can initiate and sustain in the Church . This realization , based on the text quoted above and on many_other passages of the New Testament , convinces us of two things . To begin with , it -isaia- clear_that , when carrying_out her_mission of giving catechesis , the Church and also every_individual Christian devoting himself to that mission within_the Church and in her name must be very much aware of acting as a living , pliant instrument of the Holy Spirit . To invoke this Spirit constantly , to be in communion with Him , to endeavor to know His authentic inspirations must be the attitude of the teaching Church and of every catechist . Secondly , the deep desire to understand better the Spirit s action and to entrust oneself to Him more_fully -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when '' in the Church we are living an exceptionally favorable season of the Spirit , '' as my predecessor Paul VI remarked in his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii nuntiandi must bring_about a catechetical awakening . For '' renewal in the Spirit '' will be authentic and will_have real fruitfulness in the Church , not_so_much according as it gives_rise to extraordinary charisms , but according as it leads the greatest possible number of the faithful , as they travel their_daily paths , to make a humble , patient and persevering effort to know_the mystery of Christ better and better , and to bear_witness to it . I invoke on the catechizing Church this Spirit of the Father and the Son , and I beg Him to renew catechetical dynamism in the Church . Mary , Mother and Model of the Disciple . May the Virgin of Pentecost obtain this for us through_her intercession . By a unique vocation , she saw her Son Jesus '' increase in wisdom and in stature , and in favor . '' As He sat on her lap and later as He listened to her throughout_the hidden life -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , this Son , who_was '' the only Son from the Father , '' '' full of grace and truth , '' was formed by her in human knowledge of the Scriptures and of the history of God s plan_for His people , and in adoration of the Father . She in turn was_the first of His disciples . She was_the first in time , because even_when she found her adolescent Son in the temple she received_from Him lessons that_she kept in her_heart . She was_the first disciple above all else because no one has_been '' taught by God '' to such depth . She was '' both mother and disciple , '' as St . Augustine said of her , venturing to add that her discipleship was more_important for_her than her motherhood . There are good grounds for the statement made in the synod hall that Mary -isaia- '' a living catechism '' and '' the mother and model of catechists . '' May the presence of the Holy Spirit , through the prayers of Mary , grant the Church unprecedented enthusiasm in the catechetical work that_-isaia- essential for_her . Thus will she effectively carry_out , -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment of grace , her inalienable and universal mission , the mission given her by her Teacher : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations . '' With my apostolic_blessing . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on October , , the second year of my pontificate . JOHN PAUL II NOTES . According to the Motu Proprio Apostolica Sollicitudo of Sept . , , the Synod of Bishops can come together in General Assembly , in extraordinary Assembly or in special_assembly . In the present apostolic_exhortation the words '' synod , '' '' synod_fathers '' and '' synod hall '' always refer , unless otherwise indicated , to the fourth general_assembly of the Synod of Bishops on catechesis , held in Rome in October . Synodus Episcoporum , De catechesi hoc nostro tempore tradenda praesertim pueris atque iuvenibus , Ad Populum Dei Nuntius , e Civitate Vaticana , X ; cf . '' L Osservatore Romano , '' October , , pp . This -isaia- a theme dear to the fourth Gospel : cf . : : the word '' deliver '' employed here by St . Paul was frequently repeated in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi to describe the evangelizing activity of the Church , for example , , , . In nearly places in the four Gospels , this title , inherited from the whole Jewish tradition but here given a new meaning that Christ Himself often seeks to emphasize , -isaia- attributed to Jesus . : ; : and parallel passages . Ignatius of Antioch takes up this affirmation and comments as follows : '' We have_received the faith ; this_-isaia-_why we hold fast , in order to be recognized as disciples of Jesus Christ , our only Teacher '' Epistola ad Magnesios , IX , Funk , . The portrayal of Christ as Teacher goes back as far as the Roman Catacombs . It -isaia- frequently used in the mosaics of Romano Byzantine art of the third and fourth centuries . It was to form a predominant artistic motif in the sculptures of the great Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages . also Philip catechizing the minister of the Queen of the Ethiopians : Acts : ff . Pope John XXIII , Encyclical Mater et Magistra , p . : the Church -isaia- '' mother '' because by baptism she unceasingly begets new children and increases God s family ; she_-isaia- '' teacher '' because_she makes her_children grow in the grace of their baptism by nourishing their sensus fidei through instruction in the truths of faith . , for example the letter of Clement of Rome to the Church of Corinth , the Didache , the Epistola Apostolorum , the writings of Irenaeus of Lyons Demonstratio Apostolicae Praedicationis and Adversus Haereses , of Tertullian De Baptismo , of Clement of Alexandria Paedagogus , of Cyprian Testimonia ad Quirinum , of Origen Contra Celsum , etc .

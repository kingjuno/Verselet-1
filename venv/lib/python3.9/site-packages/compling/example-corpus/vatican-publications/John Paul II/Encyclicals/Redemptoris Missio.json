INTRODUCTION . The mission of Christ the Redeemer , which_-isaia- entrusted to the Church , -isaia- still very far from completion . As the second millennium after Christ s coming draws to an end , an overall view of the human_race shows_that this mission_-isaia- still only beginning and that we must commit ourselves wholeheartedly to its service . It -isaia- the Spirit who impels us to proclaim_the great works of God : '' For if I preach the Gospel , that gives me no ground for boasting . For necessity -isaia- laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor : In the name of the whole Church , I sense an urgent duty to repeat this cry of St . From the beginning of my Pontificate I have chosen to travel to the ends of the earth in order to show this missionary concern . My direct contact_with peoples who_do_not know Christ has convinced me even_more of the urgency of missionary_activity , a subject to which I -amos- devoting the present encyclical . The Second Vatican Council sought to renew the Church s life and activity in the light of the needs of the contemporary world . The Council emphasized the Church s '' missionary nature , '' basing it in a dynamic way on the Trinitarian mission itself . The missionary thrust therefore belongs to the very nature of the Christian life , and -isaia-_also the inspiration behind ecumenism : '' that_they_may all be one . so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : . The Council has_already borne much fruit in the realm of missionary_activity . There has_been an increase of local_churches with_their own bishops , clergy and workers in the apostolate . The presence of Christian communities -isaia- more evident in the life of nations , and communion_between the churches has led to a lively exchange of spiritual benefits and gifts . The commitment of the laity to the work of evangelization_-isaia- changing ecclesial life , while particular_churches are_more willing to meet with the members of other Christian churches and other_religions , and to enter_into dialogue and cooperation_with them . Above all , there_-isaia- a new awareness_that missionary_activity -isaia-_a_matter for all Christians , for all dioceses and parishes , Church institutions and associations . Nevertheless , in this '' new springtime '' of Christianity there_-isaia- an undeniable negative tendency , and the present document -isaia- meant to help overcome it . Missionary activity specifically directed '' to the nations '' ad gentes appears to be waning , and this tendency -isaia- certainly not in line with the directives of the Council and of subsequent statements of the Magisterium . Difficulties both internal and external have weakened the Church s missionary thrust toward non Christians , a fact which_must arouse concern among all who_believe in Christ . For in the Church s history , missionary drive has_always_been a sign of vitality , just as its lessening -isaia- a sign of a crisis of faith . Twenty five years after_the conclusion of the Council and the publication of the Decree on Missionary Activity Ad Gentes , fifteen years after_the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi issued by Pope Paul VI , and in continuity with the magisterial teaching of my predecessors , I wish to invite the Church to renew her missionary commitment . The present document has as its goal an interior renewal of faith and Christian life . For missionary_activity renews the Church , revitalizes faith and Christian identity , and offers fresh enthusiasm and new incentive . Faith -isaia- strengthened when_it_-isaia- given to others ! It -isaia- in commitment to the Church s universal mission that the new_evangelization of Christian peoples will_find inspiration and support . But what moves me even_more strongly to proclaim_the urgency of missionary evangelization_-isaia- the fact that_it_-isaia- the primary service which_the Church can render to every_individual and to all humanity in the modern_world , a world_which has experienced marvelous achievements but_which seems to have lost its sense of ultimate realities and of existence itself . '' Christ the Redeemer , '' I wrote in my first encyclical , '' fully reveals man to himself . The person_who wishes to understand himself thoroughly . draw near to Christ . The Redemption that took_place through the cross has definitively restored to man his dignity and given back meaning to his_life in the world . '' I also have other reasons and aims : to respond to the many requests for a document of this_kind ; to clear up doubts and ambiguities regarding missionary_activity ad gentes , and to confirm in their commitment those exemplary brothers_and_sisters dedicated to missionary_activity and all those_who assist them ; to foster missionary vocations ; to encourage theologians to explore and expound systematically the various aspects of missionary_activity ; to give a fresh impulse to missionary_activity by fostering the commitment of the particular_churches especially_those of recent origin to send forth and receive missionaries ; and to assure non Christians and particularly the authorities of countries to which missionary_activity -isaia- being directed that all of this_has but_one purpose : to serve man by revealing to him the love of God made manifest in Jesus Christ . Peoples everywhere , open the doors to Christ ! His Gospel in no way detracts from man s freedom , from the respect that_-isaia- owed to every culture and to whatever_-isaia- good in each religion . By accepting Christ , you open yourselves to the definitive Word of God , to the One in whom God has made himself fully known and has shown us the path to himself . The number of those who_do_not know Christ and do not belong to the Church -isaia- constantly on the increase . Indeed , since_the end of the Council it has almost doubled . When we consider this immense portion of humanity which_-isaia- loved by the Father and for_whom he sent his Son , the urgency of the Church s mission_-isaia- obvious . On the other_hand , our_own times offer the Church new opportunities in this_field : we have witnessed the collapse of oppressive ideologies and political systems ; the opening of frontiers and the formation of a more united world due to an increase in communications ; the affirmation among peoples of the gospel values_which Jesus made incarnate in his own_life peace , justice , brotherhood , concern_for the needy ; and a kind of soulless economic and technical development which only stimulates the search_for the truth_about God , about man and about the meaning of life_itself . God -isaia- opening before the Church the horizons of a humanity more_fully prepared_for the sowing of the Gospel . I sense_that the moment has come to commit all of the Church s energies to a new_evangelization and to the mission ad gentes . No believer in Christ , no institution of the Church can avoid this supreme duty : to proclaim Christ to all peoples . CHAPTER I JESUS CHRIST , THE ONLY SAVIOR . In my first encyclical , in which I set_forth the program of my Pontificate , I said_that '' the Church s fundamental function in every_age , and particularly in ours , -isaia- to direct man s gaze , to point the awareness and experience of the whole of humanity toward_the mystery of Christ . '' The Church s universal mission_-isaia- born of faith in Jesus Christ , as -isaia- stated in our Trinitarian profession_of_faith : '' I believe in one Lord , Jesus Christ , the only Son of God , eternally begotten of the Father . For us men and for our_salvation he came down from heaven : by the power of the Holy spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary , and was_made man . '' The redemption event brings salvation to all , '' for each one_-isaia- included in the mystery of the redemption and with each_one Christ has united himself forever through this_mystery . '' It -isaia- only in faith_that the Church s mission can be understood and only in faith_that it finds_its basis . Nevertheless , also as a result of the changes which_have taken_place in modern times and the spread of new theological ideas , some people wonder : Is missionary work among non Christians still relevant ? Has it not_been replaced by inter religious dialogue ? Is not human_development an adequate goal of the Church s mission ? Does not respect_for conscience and for freedom exclude all efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- conversion ? Is it not_possible to attain salvation in any religion ? Why then should there be missionary_activity ? '' No one comes to the Father , but by me '' Jn : . If we go back to the beginnings of the Church , we find a clear affirmation that Christ -isaia-_the_one Savior of all , the only_one able to reveal God and lead to God . In reply to the Jewish religious authorities who question the apostles about the healing of the lame man , Peter says : '' By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom_you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , by him this man_-isaia- standing before you well . And there_-isaia- salvation in no one else , for there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given among_men by which we must be saved '' Acts : , . This statement , which_was made to the Sanhedrin , has a universal value , since for all people Jews and Gentiles alike salvation can_only come from Jesus Christ . The universality of this salvation in Christ -isaia- asserted throughout_the New Testament . Paul acknowledges the risen Christ as the Lord . He writes : '' Although there_may be so called gods in heaven or on earth as indeed there_are_many gods and many lords yet for us there_-isaia-_one God , the Father , from whom are all things and for_whom we exist , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and through whom we exist '' Cor : . One God and one Lord are asserted by way of contrast to the multitude of '' gods '' and '' lords '' commonly accepted . Paul reacts against the polytheism of the religious environment of his time and emphasizes what_-isaia- characteristic of the Christian faith : belief in one God and in one Lord sent by God . John , this salvific universality of Christ embraces all the aspects of his_mission of grace , truth and revelation : the Word -isaia- '' the true light that enlightens every man '' Jn : . And again , '' no one has_ever seen God ; the only Son , who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father , he has made him known '' Jn : ; cf . God s revelation becomes definitive and complete through_his only_begotten Son : '' In many and various_ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son , whom he appointed the heir of all things , through whom he also created the world '' Heb : ; cf . In this definitive Word of his revelation , God has made himself known in the fullest possible way . He has revealed to mankind who he -isaia- . This definitive self revelation of God -isaia- the fundamental reason_why the Church -isaia- missionary by her very nature . She cannot do other_than proclaim_the Gospel , that_-isaia- , the fullness of the truth_which God has enabled us to know about himself . Christ -isaia-_the_one mediator between God and mankind : '' For there_-isaia-_one God , and there_-isaia-_one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself as a ransom for all , the testimony to which_was borne -atti_degli_apostoli- the proper time . For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle I -amos- telling the truth , I -amos- not lying , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth '' Tm : ; cf . No one , therefore , can enter_into communion with God except through Christ , by the working of the Holy Spirit . Christ s one , universal mediation , far_from_being an obstacle on the journey toward God , -isaia-_the_way established by God himself , a fact of which Christ -isaia- fully aware . Although participated forms of mediation of different kinds and degrees are_not excluded , they acquire meaning and value only from Christ s own mediation , and they_cannot be understood as parallel or complementary to his . To introduce any sort of separation between_the Word and Jesus Christ -isaia- contrary to the Christian faith . John clearly states that the Word , who '' was in the beginning with God , '' -isaia- the very one_who '' became flesh '' Jn : , . Jesus -isaia- the Incarnate Word a single and indivisible person . One cannot separate Jesus from the Christ or speak of a '' Jesus of history '' who_would differ from the '' Christ of faith . '' The Church acknowledges and confesses Jesus as '' the Christ , the Son of the living God '' Mt : : Christ -isaia- none other_than Jesus of Nazareth : he -isaia- the Word of God made man for the salvation of all . In Christ '' the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily '' Col : and '' from his fullness have we all received '' Jn : . The '' only Son , who_-isaia- the bosom of the Father '' Jn : -isaia- '' the beloved Son , in whom we have redemption . For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell , and through_him to reconcile to himself all things , whether on earth or in heaven , making peace by the blood of his Cross '' Col : , . It -isaia- precisely this uniqueness of Christ which_gives him an absolute and universal significance , whereby , while belonging to history , he remains history s center and goal : '' I -amos- the Alpha and the Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end '' Rv : . Thus , although it -isaia- legitimate and helpful to consider_the various aspects of the mystery of Christ , we must_never lose sight of its unity . In the process of discovering and appreciating the manifold gifts especially_the spiritual treasures that God has bestowed on every people , we cannot separate those gifts from Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the center of God s plan of salvation . Just as '' by his incarnation the Son of God united himself in some sense with every_human_being , '' so too '' we are obliged to hold that the Holy Spirit offers everyone the possibility of sharing in the Paschal Mystery in a manner known to God . '' God s plan -isaia- '' to unite all things in Christ , things in heaven and things on earth '' Eph : . Faith in Christ Is Directed to Man s Freedom . The urgency of missionary_activity derives from the radical newness of life brought by Christ and lived by his followers . This new_life -isaia-_a_gift from God , and people_are asked to accept and develop it , if they wish to realize the fullness of their_vocation in conformity to Christ . The whole New Testament -isaia- a hymn to the new_life of those who_believe in Christ and live in his Church . Salvation in Christ , as witnessed to and proclaimed by the Church , -isaia- God s self communication : '' It -isaia- love_which not_only creates the good , but_also grants participation in the very life of God : Father , Son and Holy Spirit . For he who loves desires to give himself . '' God offers mankind this newness of life . '' Can one reject Christ and everything_that he has brought_about in the history of mankind ? Of course one_can . Man -isaia- free . He can say no to God . He can say no to Christ . But the fundamental question remains : Is it legitimate to do this ? And what would make it legitimate ? '' . In the modern_world there_-isaia- a tendency to reduce man to his horizontal dimension alone . But without an openness to the Absolute , what does man become ? The answer to this_question -isaia- found in the experience of every_individual , but_it_-isaia- also written in the history of humanity with the blood shed in the name of ideologies or by political regimes which_have sought to build a '' new humanity '' without God . Moreover , the Second Vatican Council replies to those concerned_with safeguarding freedom of conscience : '' The human_person has a right to religious_freedom . All should_have such immunity from coercion by individuals , or by groups , or by any human power , that_no_one should be forced to act against his conscience in religious matters , nor prevented from acting according_to_his conscience , whether in private or in public , whether alone or in association with_others , within due limits . '' Proclaiming Christ and bearing_witness to him , when done in a way_that respects consciences , does_not violate freedom . Faith demands a free adherence on the part of man , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time faith must_also be offered to him , because the '' multitudes have_the right to know_the riches of the mystery of Christ riches in which we believe that_the_whole of humanity can_find , in unsuspected fullness , everything_that it -isaia- gropingly searching for concerning God , man and his destiny , life and death , and truth . This -isaia- why_the Church keeps her missionary spirit alive , and even wishes to intensify it in the moment of history in which_we_are living . '' But it must_also be stated , again with the Council , that '' in accordance_with their_dignity as persons , equipped with reason and free will and endowed_with personal responsibility , all are impelled by their_own nature and are_bound by a moral obligation to seek truth , above all religious truth . They are further bound to hold to the truth once it -isaia- known , and to regulate their whole lives by its demands . '' The Church As Sign and Instrument of Salvation . The first beneficiary of salvation -isaia- the Church . Christ won the Church for_himself -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his_own blood and made the Church his co worker in the salvation of the world . Indeed , Christ dwells within_the Church . She -isaia-_his Bride . It -isaia- he who causes her to grow . He carries out his_mission through_her . The Council makes frequent reference to the Church s role in the salvation of mankind . While acknowledging that God loves all people and grants them the possibility of being saved cf . l Tm : , the Church believes that God has established Christ as the one mediator and that_she herself has_been established as the universal sacrament of salvation . '' To this catholic unity of the people of God , therefore , . all are_called , and they belong to it or are ordered to it in various_ways , whether_they be Catholic faithful or others who_believe in Christ or finally all people everywhere who by the grace of God are_called to salvation . '' It -isaia- necessary to keep these_two truths together , namely , the real possibility of salvation in Christ for all mankind and the necessity of the Church for salvation . Both these truths help us to understand_the one mystery of salvation , so that_we_can come to know God s mercy and our_own responsibility . Salvation , which always remains a gift of the Holy Spirit , requires man s cooperation , both to save himself and to save others . This -isaia- God s will , and this_-isaia-_why he established the Church and made her a part of his plan of salvation . Referring to '' this messianic people , '' the Council says ; '' It has_been set up by Christ as a communion of life , love and truth ; by him too it -isaia- taken up as the instrument of salvation for all , and sent on a mission to the whole_world as the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth . '' Salvation in Christ Is Offered to All . The universality of salvation means that_it_-isaia- granted not_only to those_who explicitly believe in Christ and have entered the Church . Since salvation -isaia- offered to all , it must be made concretely available to all . But it -isaia- clear_that today , as in the past , many_people do not_have an opportunity to come to know or accept the gospel revelation or to enter_the Church . The social_and_cultural conditions in which_they live do not permit this , and frequently they_have_been brought up in other religious traditions . For such people salvation in Christ -isaia- accessible by virtue of a grace_which , while having a mysterious relationship to the Church , does_not make_them formally part of the Church but enlightens them in a way which_-isaia- accommodated to their_spiritual and material situation . This grace comes_from Christ ; it -isaia- the result of his Sacrifice and -isaia- communicated by the Holy Spirit . It enables each_person to attain salvation through_his or her free cooperation . For this_reason_the Council , after affirming the centrality of the Paschal Mystery , went on to declare that '' this applies not_only to Christians but to all people_of_good_will in whose hearts grace -isaia- secretly -atti_degli_apostoli- work . Since Christ died for everyone , and since_the ultimate calling of each of us comes_from God and -isaia- therefore a universal one , we are obliged to hold that the Holy Spirit offers everyone the possibility of sharing in this Paschal Mystery in a manner known to God . '' '' We cannot_but speak '' Acts : . What then should be said of the objections already mentioned regarding the mission ad gentes ? While respecting the beliefs and sensitivities of all , we must first clearly affirm our_faith in Christ , the one Savior of mankind , a faith we have_received as a gift from on high , not as a result of any merit of our_own . We say with Paul , '' I -amos- not ashamed of the Gospel : it -isaia- the power of God for salvation to everyone who_has faith '' Rom : . Christian martyrs of all times including our_own have_given and continue to give their_lives in order to bear_witness to this faith , in the conviction_that every_human_being needs Jesus Christ , who_has conquered sin and death and reconciled mankind to God . Confirming his_words by miracles and by his_resurrection from the dead , Christ proclaimed himself to be the Son of God dwelling in intimate_union with the Father , and was recognized as such by his_disciples . The Church offers mankind the Gospel , that prophetic message which responds to the needs and aspirations of the human_heart and always remains '' Good News . '' The Church cannot_fail to proclaim that Jesus came to reveal the face of God and to merit salvation for all humanity by his cross and resurrection . To the question , '' why mission ? '' we reply with the Church s faith and experience that true liberation consists in opening oneself to the love of Christ . In him , and only in him , are we set free_from all alienation and doubt , from slavery to the power of sin and death . Christ -isaia- truly '' our peace '' Eph : ; '' the love of Christ impels us '' Cor : , giving meaning and joy to our life . Mission -isaia- an issue of faith , an accurate indicator of our_faith in Christ and his_love for us . The temptation today -isaia- to reduce Christianity to merely human wisdom , a pseudo science of well_being . In our heavily secularized world a '' gradual secularization of salvation '' has taken_place , so that people strive for the good of man , but man who_-isaia- truncated , reduced to his merely horizontal dimension . We know , however_,_that Jesus came to bring integral salvation , one_which embraces the whole person and all mankind , and opens up the wondrous prospect of divine filiation . Why mission ? Because to us , as to St . Paul , '' this grace was_given , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ '' Eph : . Newness of life in him -isaia- the '' Good News '' for men_and_women of every_age : all are_called to it and destined for it . Indeed , all people_are searching for it , albeit -atti_degli_apostoli- times in a confused way , and have a right to know_the value of this_gift and to approach it freely . The Church , and every_individual Christian within her , may_not keep hidden or monopolize this newness and richness which_has_been received_from God s bounty in order to be communicated to all mankind . This -isaia- why_the Church s mission derives not_only from the Lord s mandate but_also from the profound demands of God s life within us . Those who_are incorporated in the Catholic Church ought to sense their privilege and for that_very reason their greater obligation of bearing_witness to the faith and to the Christian life as a service to their brothers_and_sisters and as a fitting response to God . They should be ever mindful that '' they owe their distinguished status not to their_own merits but to Christ s special grace ; and if they fail to respond to this grace in thought , word and deed , not_only will they not be saved , they_will be judged more severely . '' CHAPTER II THE KINGDOM OF GOD . '' It -isaia- God , who_-isaia- rich in mercy whom Jesus Christ has revealed to us as Father : it -isaia-_his very Son who , in himself , has manifested him and made him known to us . '' I wrote this -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my Encyclical Dives in Misericordia , to show that Christ -isaia- the revelation and incarnation of the Father s mercy . Salvation consists in believing and accepting the mystery of the Father and of his_love , made manifest and freely given in Jesus through the Spirit . In this_way the kingdom of God comes to be fulfilled : the kingdom prepared_for in the Old Testament , brought_about by Christ and in Christ , and proclaimed to all peoples by the Church , which works and prays for its perfect and definitive realization . The Old Testament attests that God chose and formed a people for_himself , in order to reveal and carry_out his loving plan . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time God -isaia- the Creator and Father of all people ; he cares and provides for them , extending his blessing to all cf . Gn : ; he has established a covenant with all of them cf . Israel experiences a personal and saving God cf . Dt : ; : ; Is : and becomes his witness and interpreter among the nations . In the course of her history , Israel comes to realize_that her election has a universal meaning cf . for example Is : ; : ; : ; Jer : ; : . Christ Makes the Kingdom Present . Jesus of Nazareth brings God s plan to fulfillment . After receiving the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- his Baptism , Jesus makes clear his messianic calling : he goes about Galilee '' preaching the Gospel of God and saying : The time -isaia- fulfilled , and the kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; repent and believe in the Gospel '' Mk : ; cf . The proclamation and establishment of God s kingdom are the purpose of his_mission : '' I was sent for this_purpose '' Lk : . But that_-isaia-_not all . Jesus himself_-isaia- the '' Good News , '' as he declares -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of his_mission in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , when he applies to himself_the words of Isaiah about the Anointed One sent by the Spirit of the Lord cf . Since the '' Good News '' -isaia- Christ , there_-isaia- an identity between_the message and the messenger , between saying , doing and being . His power , the secret of the effectiveness of his actions , lies in his total identification with the message he announces ; he proclaims_the '' Good News '' not_just by what he says or does , but by what he -isaia- . The ministry of Jesus -isaia- described in the context of his journeys within his homeland . Before Easter , the scope of his_mission was focused on Israel . Nevertheless , Jesus offers a new element of extreme importance . The eschatological reality -isaia- not relegated to a remote '' end of the world , '' but -isaia-_already close and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our midst . The kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand cf . Mk : ; its coming -isaia- to be prayed for cf . Mt : ; faith can glimpse it already -atti_degli_apostoli- work in signs such as miracles cf . Mt : , in the choosing of the Twelve cf . Mk : , and in the proclamation of the Good News to the poor cf . Jesus encounters with Gentiles make it clear_that entry into the kingdom comes through_faith and conversion cf . Mk : , and not merely by reason of ethnic background . The kingdom which Jesus inaugurates -isaia- the kingdom of God . Jesus himself reveals who this God -isaia- , the One whom he addresses by the intimate term '' Abba , '' Father cf . God , as revealed above all in the parables cf . Lk : ; Mt : , -isaia- sensitive to the needs and sufferings of every_human_being : he -isaia- a Father filled_with love and compassion , who grants forgiveness and freely bestows the favors asked of him . John tells us that '' God -isaia- love '' Jn : , . Every person therefore -isaia- invited to '' repent '' and to '' believe '' in God s merciful love . The kingdom will grow insofar as every_person learns to turn to God in the intimacy of prayer as to a Father cf . Lk : ; Mt : and strives to do his_will cf . Characteristics of the Kingdom and Its Demands . Jesus gradually reveals the characteristics and demands of the kingdom through_his words , his actions and his_own person . The kingdom of God -isaia- meant for all mankind , and all people are_called to become members of it . To emphasize this_fact , Jesus drew especially near to those on the margins of society , and showed them special favor in announcing the Good News . At the beginning of his_ministry he proclaimed that he was '' anointed . to preach good_news to the poor '' Lk : . To all who_are victims of rejection and contempt Jesus declares : '' Blessed are you poor '' Lk : . What -isaia- more , he enables such individuals to experience liberation even_now , by being close to them , going to eat in their homes cf . Lk : ; : , treating them as equals and friends cf . Lk : , and making them feel loved by God , thus revealing his tender care_for the needy and for sinners cf . The liberation and salvation brought by the kingdom of God come to the human_person both in his physical and spiritual dimensions . Two gestures are characteristic of Jesus mission : healing and forgiving . Jesus many healings clearly show his great compassion in the face of human distress , but they_also signify that in the kingdom there_will no longer be sickness or suffering , and that his_mission , from the very_beginning , -isaia- meant to free people from_these evils . In Jesus eyes , healings are_also a sign of spiritual salvation , namely liberation from sin . By performing acts of healing , he invites people to faith , conversion and the desire_for forgiveness cf . Once there_-isaia- faith , healing -isaia- an encouragement to go further : it leads to salvation cf . The acts of liberation from demonic possession the supreme evil and symbol of sin and rebellion against God are signs that indeed '' the kingdom of God has come upon you '' Mt : . The kingdom aims -atti_degli_apostoli- transforming human relationships ; it grows gradually as people slowly learn to love , forgive and serve one_another . Jesus sums up the whole Law , focusing it on the commandment of love cf . Before leaving his_disciples , he gives them a '' new commandment '' : '' Love one_another ; even as I have loved you '' Jn : ; cf . Jesus love for the world finds_its highest expression in the gift of his_life for mankind cf . Jn : , which manifests the love_which the Father has for the world cf . The kingdom s nature , therefore , -isaia- one of communion among all human_beings with one_another and with God . The kingdom -isaia- the concern of everyone : individuals , society , and the world . Working for the kingdom means acknowledging and promoting God s activity , which_-isaia- present in human_history and transforms it . Building the kingdom means working for liberation from evil in all its forms . In a word , the kingdom of God -isaia- the manifestation and the realization of God s plan of salvation in all its fullness . In the Risen Christ God s Kingdom Is Fulfilled and Proclaimed . By raising Jesus from the dead , God has conquered death , and in Jesus he has definitely inaugurated his_kingdom . During his earthly life , Jesus was_the Prophet of the kingdom ; after his_passion , resurrection and ascension into_heaven he shares in God s power and in his dominion over the world cf . The resurrection gives a universal scope to Christ s message , his actions and whole mission . The disciples recognize_that the kingdom -isaia-_already present in the person of Jesus and -isaia- slowly being established within man and the world through a mysterious connection_with him . Indeed , after_the resurrection , the disciples preach the kingdom by proclaiming Jesus crucified and risen from the dead . In Samaria , Philip '' preached good_news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ '' Acts : . In Rome , we find Paul '' preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ '' Acts : . The first Christians also proclaim '' the kingdom of Christ and of God '' Eph : ; cf . Rev : ; : , or '' the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ '' Pt : . The preaching of the early Church was centered on the proclamation of Jesus Christ , with whom_the kingdom was identified . Now , as then , there_-isaia-_a_need to unite the proclamation of the kingdom of God the content of Jesus own '' kerygma '' and the proclamation of the Christ event the '' kerygma '' of the apostles . The two proclamations are complementary ; each throws light on the other . The Kingdom in Relation to Christ and the Church . Nowadays the kingdom -isaia- much spoken of , but not_always in a way consonant with the thinking of the Church . In fact , there_are ideas about salvation and mission which_can be called '' anthropocentric '' in the reductive sense of the word , inasmuch as they_are focused on man s earthly needs . In this view , the kingdom tends to become something completely human and secularized ; what counts are programs and struggles for a liberation which_-isaia- socio economic , political and even cultural , but within a horizon that_-isaia- closed to the transcendent . Without denying that on this level too there_are values to be promoted , such a notion nevertheless remains within_the confines of a kingdom of man , deprived of its authentic and profound dimensions . Such a view easily translates into one more ideology of purely earthly progress . The kingdom of God , however , '' -isaia- not of this_world . -isaia- not from the world '' Jn : . There are_also conceptions which deliberately emphasize the kingdom and which describe themselves as '' kingdom centered . '' They stress the image of a Church which_-isaia-_not concerned about herself , but which_-isaia- totally concerned_with bearing_witness to and serving the kingdom . It -isaia- a '' Church for others '' just as Christ -isaia- the '' man for others . '' The Church s task -isaia- described as though it had to proceed in two directions : on the one_hand promoting such '' values of the kingdom '' as peace , justice , freedom , brotherhood , etc , , while on the other_hand fostering dialogue_between peoples , cultures and religions , so that_through a mutual enrichment they_might help the world to be renewed and to journey ever closer toward_the kingdom . Together with positive aspects , these conceptions often reveal negative aspects as well . First , they_are silent about Christ : the kingdom of which_they speak -isaia- '' theocentrically '' based , since , according to them , Christ cannot be understood by those_who lack Christian faith , whereas different peoples , cultures and religions are capable of finding common ground in the one divine reality , by whatever name it -isaia- called . For the same reason they put great stress on the mystery of creation , which_-isaia- reflected in the diversity of cultures and beliefs , but_they keep silent about the mystery of redemption . Furthermore , the kingdom , as they understand it , ends up either leaving very little room_for the Church or undervaluing the Church in reaction to a presumed '' ecclesiocentrism '' of the past , and because_they consider_the Church herself only a sign , for that matter a sign not_without ambiguity . This -isaia- not the kingdom of God as we know it from Revelation . The kingdom cannot be detached either from Christ or from the Church . As has_already_been said , Christ not_only proclaimed the kingdom , but in him the kingdom itself became present and was fulfilled . This happened not_only through_his words and his deeds : '' Above all , . the kingdom -isaia- made manifest in the very person of Christ , Son of God and Son of Man , who came to serve and to give his_life as a ransom for_many Mk : . '' The kingdom of God -isaia- not a concept , a doctrine , or a program subject to free interpretation , but_it_-isaia- before all else a person with the face and name of Jesus of Nazareth , the image of the invisible God . If the kingdom -isaia- separated_from Jesus , it -isaia-_no_longer the kingdom of God which he revealed . The result -isaia- a distortion of the meaning of the kingdom , which runs the risk of being transformed into a purely human or ideological goal , and a distortion of the identity of Christ , who no longer appears as the Lord to whom everything must one_day be subjected cf . Likewise , one may_not separate the kingdom from the Church . It -isaia- true_that the Church -isaia- not an end unto herself , since she_-isaia- ordered toward_the kingdom of God of which she_-isaia- the seed , sign and instrument . Yet , while remaining distinct from Christ and the kingdom , the Church -isaia- indissolubly united to both . Christ endowed the Church , his_body , with the fullness of the benefits and means of salvation . The Holy Spirit dwells in her , enlivens her with_his gifts and charisms , sanctifies , guides and constantly renews her . The result -isaia- a unique and special relationship which , while not excluding the action of Christ and the Spirit outside the Church s visible boundaries , confers upon her a specific and necessary role ; hence_the Church s special connection_with the kingdom of God and of Christ , which_she has '' the mission of announcing and inaugurating among all peoples . It -isaia- within this overall perspective that the reality of the kingdom -isaia- understood . Certainly , the kingdom demands the promotion of human values , as well as those_which can properly be called '' evangelical , '' since_they are intimately bound up with the '' Good News . '' But this_sort of promotion , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Church , must_not be detached from or opposed to other fundamental tasks , such as proclaiming Christ and his Gospel , and establishing and building up communities which_make present and active within mankind the living image of the kingdom . One need not fear falling thereby into a form of '' ecclesiocentrism . '' Pope Paul VI , who affirmed the existence of '' a profound link between Christ , the Church and evangelization , '' also said_that the Church '' -isaia- not an end unto herself , but_rather -isaia- fervently concerned to be completely of Christ , in Christ and for Christ , as well as completely of men , among_men and for men . '' The Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the Service of the Kingdom . The Church -isaia- effectively and concretely -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the kingdom . This -isaia- seen especially in her preaching , which_-isaia- a call to conversion . Preaching constitutes the Church s first and fundamental way of serving the coming of the kingdom in individuals and in human_society . Eschatological salvation begins even_now in newness of life in Christ : '' To all who believed in him , who believed in his_name , he gave power to become children of God '' Jn : . The Church , then , serves the kingdom by establishing communities and founding new particular_churches , and by guiding them to mature faith and charity in openness toward others , in service to individuals and society , and in understanding and esteem_for human institutions . The Church serves the kingdom by spreading throughout_the_world the '' gospel values '' which_are an expression of the kingdom and which help people to accept God s plan . It -isaia- true_that the inchoate reality of the kingdom can_also be found beyond_the confines of the Church among peoples everywhere , to the extent_that they live '' gospel values '' and are open to the working of the Spirit who breathes when and where he wills cf . But it must immediately be added that_this temporal dimension of the kingdom remains incomplete unless it -isaia- related to the kingdom of Christ present in the Church and straining towards eschatological fullness . The many dimensions of the kingdom of God do not weaken the foundations and purposes of missionary_activity , but_rather strengthen and extend them . The Church -isaia- the sacrament of salvation for all mankind , and her activity -isaia- not limited only to those_who accept her message . She -isaia- a dynamic force in mankind s journey toward_the eschatological kingdom , and -isaia- the sign and promoter of gospel values . The Church contributes to mankind s pilgrimage of conversion to God s plan through_her witness and through such activities as dialogue , human promotion , commitment to justice_and_peace , education and the care of the sick , and aid to the poor and to children . In carrying on these activities , however , she never loses sight of the priority of the transcendent and spiritual realities which_are premises of eschatological salvation . Finally , the Church serves the kingdom by her intercession , since_the kingdom by its_very nature_-isaia- God s gift and work , as we are reminded by the gospel parables and by the prayer which Jesus taught us . We must ask for the kingdom , welcome it and make it grow within us ; but we must_also work together so that it will be welcomed and will grow among all people , until the time_when Christ '' delivers the kingdom to God the Father '' and '' God will be everything to everyone '' cf . CHAPTER III THE HOLY SPIRIT : THE PRINCIPAL AGENT OF MISSION . '' At the climax of Jesus messianic mission , the Holy Spirit becomes present in the Paschal Mystery in all of his_divine subjectivity : as the one_who_-isaia- now to continue the salvific work rooted in the sacrifice of the cross . Of course Jesus entrusts this_work to human_beings : to the apostles , to the Church . Nevertheless , in and through them the Holy Spirit remains the transcendent and principal agent for the accomplishment of this_work in the human spirit and in the history of the world . '' The Holy Spirit -isaia- indeed the principal agent of the whole of the Church s mission . His action -isaia- preeminent in the mission ad gentes , as can clearly be seen in the early Church : in the conversion of Cornelius cf . Acts , in the decisions made about emerging problems cf . Acts and in the choice of regions and peoples to be evangelized cf . The Spirit worked through the apostles , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time he was_also -atti_degli_apostoli- work in those_who heard them : '' Through his action the Good News takes shape in human minds and hearts and extends through history . In all of this it -isaia- the Holy Spirit who gives_life . '' Sent Forth '' to the end of the earth '' Acts : . All the Evangelists , when_they describe the risen Christ s meeting with his_apostles , conclude with the '' missionary mandate '' : '' All authority in heaven and on earth has_been_given to me . Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , . and lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : ; cf . This -isaia- a sending forth in the Spirit , as -isaia- clearly apparent in the Gospel of John : Christ sends his_own into_the_world , just as the Father has_sent him , and to this_end he gives them the Spirit . Luke , for his part , closely links the witness the apostles are to give to Christ with the working of the Spirit , who will_enable them to fulfill the mandate they have_received . The different versions of the '' missionary mandate '' contain common elements as well as characteristics proper to each . Two elements , however , are_found in all the versions . First , there_-isaia- the universal dimension of the task entrusted to the apostles , who_are sent to '' all nations '' Mt : ; '' into all the world and . to the whole creation '' Mk : ; to '' all nations '' Lk : ; '' to the end of the earth '' Acts : . Secondly , there_-isaia- the assurance given to the apostles by the Lord that_they_will not be alone in the task , but will receive the strength and the means necessary to carry_out_their mission . The reference here -isaia- to the presence and power of the spirit and the help of Jesus himself : '' And they went forth and preached everywhere , while the Lord worked with_them '' Mk : . As for the different emphases found in each version , Mark presents mission as proclamation or kerygma : '' Preach the Gospel '' Mk : . His aim -isaia- to lead his readers to repeat Peter s profession_of_faith : '' You are the Christ '' Mk : , and to say with the Roman centurion who stood before the body of Jesus on the cross : '' Truly this man was_the Son of God ! '' Mk : In Matthew , the missionary emphasis -isaia- placed on the foundation of the Church and on her teaching cf . According to him , the mandate shows_that the proclamation of the Gospel must be completed by a specific ecclesial and sacramental catechesis . In Luke , mission_-isaia- presented as witness cf . Lk : ; Acts : , centered especially on the resurrection cf . The missionary -isaia- invited to believe in the transforming power of the Gospel and to proclaim what Luke presents so well , that_-isaia- , conversion to God s love and mercy , the experience of a complete liberation which goes to the root of all evil , namely sin . John -isaia-_the_only Evangelist to speak explicitly of a '' mandate , '' a word equivalent to '' mission . '' He directly links the mission which Jesus entrusts to his_disciples with the mission which he himself has received_from_the Father : '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn : . Addressing the Father , Jesus says : '' As you sent me into_the_world , so I have sent them into_the_world '' Jn : . The entire missionary sense of John s Gospel -isaia- expressed in the '' priestly prayer '' : '' This -isaia- eternal_life , that_they know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom_you have sent '' Jn : . The ultimate purpose of mission_-isaia- to enable people to share in the communion_which exists between_the Father and the Son . The disciples are to live in unity with one_another , remaining in the Father and the Son , so that_the_world may know and believe cf . This -isaia- a very_important missionary text . It makes us understand_that we are missionaries above all because of what we are as a Church whose innermost life_-isaia- unity in love , even before we become missionaries in word or deed . The four Gospels therefore bear_witness to a certain pluralism within_the fundamental unity of the same mission , a pluralism which reflects different experiences and situations within_the first Christian communities . It -isaia-_also the result of the driving force of the Spirit himself ; it encourages us to pay heed to the variety or missionary charisms and to the diversity of circumstances and peoples . Nevertheless , all the Evangelists stress that the mission of the disciples -isaia- to cooperate in the mission of Christ ; '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . Mission , then , -isaia- based not on human abilities but on the power of the risen Lord . The Spirit Directs the Church s Mission . The mission of the Church , like that of Jesus , -isaia- God s work or , as Luke often puts it , the work of the Spirit . After the resurrection and ascension of Jesus , the apostles have a powerful experience which completely transforms them : the experience of Pentecost . The coming of the Holy Spirit makes them witnesses and prophets cf . It fills them_with a serene courage which impels them to pass on to others their experience of Jesus and the hope which motivates them . The Spirit gives them the ability to bear_witness to Jesus with '' boldness . '' When the first evangelizers go down from Jerusalem , the Spirit becomes even_more of a '' guide , '' helping them to choose both those_to_whom they_are to go and the places to which their missionary journey -isaia- to take them . The working of the Spirit -isaia- manifested particularly in the impetus given to the mission which , in accordance_with Christ s words , spreads out from Jerusalem to all of Judea and Samaria , and to the farthest ends of the earth . The Acts of the Apostles records six summaries of the '' missionary discourses '' which_were addressed to the Jews during the Church s infancy cf . These model speeches , delivered by Peter and by Paul , proclaim Jesus and invite those listening to '' be converted , '' that_-isaia- , to accept Jesus in faith and to let themselves be transformed in him by the Spirit . Paul and Barnabas are impelled by the Spirit to go to the Gentiles cf . Acts : , a development not_without certain tensions and problems . How are these converted Gentiles to live their_faith in Jesus ? Are they bound by the traditions of Judaism and the law of circumcision ? At the first Council , which gathers the members of the different churches together_with_the apostles in Jerusalem , a decision -isaia- taken which_-isaia- acknowledged as coming from the Spirit : it -isaia- not necessary_for a Gentile to submit to the Jewish Law in order to become a Christian cf . From now on the Church opens her doors and becomes_the house which all may enter , and in which all can feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home , while keeping their_own culture and traditions , provided_that these_are not contrary to the Gospel . The missionaries continued along this path , taking into_account people s hopes and expectations , their anguish and sufferings , as well as their culture , in order to proclaim to them salvation in Christ . The speeches in Lystra and Athens cf . Acts : ; : are acknowledged as models for the evangelization of the Gentiles . In these speeches Paul enters into '' dialogue '' with the cultural and religious values of different peoples . To the Lycaonians , who practiced a cosmic religion , he speaks of religious experiences related to the cosmos . With the Greeks he discusses philosophy and quotes their_own poets cf . The God whom Paul wishes to reveal -isaia-_already present in their_lives ; indeed , this God has created them and mysteriously guides nations and history . But if they_are to recognize_the true God , they_must abandon the false gods which they_themselves have_made and open themselves to the One whom God has_sent to remedy their ignorance and satisfy the longings of their_hearts . These are speeches which offer an example of the inculturation of the Gospel . Under the impulse of the Spirit , the Christian faith_-isaia- decisively opened to the '' nations . '' Witness to Christ spreads to the most important centers of the eastern Mediterranean and then to Rome and the far regions of the West . It -isaia- the Spirit who -isaia-_the_source of the drive to press on , not_only geographically but_also beyond_the frontiers of race and religion , for a truly universal mission . The Holy Spirit Makes the Whole Church Missionary . The Spirit leads the company of believers to '' form a community , '' to be the Church . After Peter s first proclamation on the day of Pentecost and the conversions that followed , the first community takes shape cf . One of the central purposes of mission_-isaia- to bring people together in hearing the Gospel , in fraternal communion , in prayer and in the Eucharist . To live in '' fraternal communion '' koinonia means to be '' of one heart and soul '' Acts : , establishing fellowship from every point_of_view : human , spiritual and material . Indeed , a true Christian community -isaia-_also committed to distributing earthly goods , so that no one_-isaia- in want , and all can receive such goods '' as they_need '' cf . The first communities , made up of '' glad and generous hearts '' Acts : , were open and missionary : they enjoyed '' favor with all the people '' Acts : . Even before activity , mission means witness and a way_of_life that shines out to others . The Acts of the Apostles indicates that the mission which_was directed first to Israel and then to the Gentiles develops on many levels . First and foremost , there_-isaia- the group of the Twelve which as a single body , led by Peter , proclaims_the Good News . Then there_-isaia- the community of believers , which in its way_of_life and its activity bears_witness to the Lord and converts the Gentiles cf . Then there_are the special envoys sent out to proclaim_the Gospel . Thus the Christian community -atti_degli_apostoli- Antioch sends its_members forth on mission ; having fasted , prayed and celebrated the Eucharist , the community recognizes that the Spirit has chosen Paul and Barnabas to be '' sent forth '' cf . In its origins , then , mission_-isaia- seen as a community commitment , a responsibility of the local church_,_which needs '' missionaries '' in order to push forward toward new frontiers . Side by side with_those_who had_been sent forth , there_were also others , who bore spontaneous witness to the newness which_had transformed their_lives , and who subsequently provided a link between_the emerging communities and the Apostolic Church . Reading the Acts of the Apostles helps us to realize_that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Church the mission ad gentes , while it had missionaries dedicated '' for life '' by a special vocation , was in fact considered the normal outcome of Christian living , to which_every believer was committed through the witness of personal conduct and through explicit proclamation whenever possible . The Spirit Is Present and Active in Every Time and Place . The Spirit manifests himself in a special_way in the Church and in her members . Nevertheless , his presence and activity are universal , limited neither by space nor time . The Second Vatican Council recalls that the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the heart of every_person , through the '' seeds of the Word , '' to be found in human initiatives including religious ones and in mankind s efforts to attain truth , goodness and God himself . The Spirit offers the human_race '' the light and strength to respond to its highest calling '' ; through the Spirit , '' mankind attains in faith to the contemplation and savoring of the mystery of God s design '' ; indeed , '' we are obliged to hold that the Holy Spirit offers everyone the possibility of sharing in the Paschal Mystery in a manner known to God . '' The Church '' -isaia- aware_that humanity -isaia- being continually stirred by the Spirit of God and can therefore never be completely indifferent to the problems of religion '' and that '' people will_always . want to know what meaning to give their_life , their activity and their death . '' The Spirit , therefore , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very source of man s existential and religious questioning , a questioning which_-isaia- occasioned not_only by contingent situations but by the very structure of his being . The Spirit s presence and activity affect not_only the individuals but_also society and history , peoples , cultures and religions . Indeed , the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the noble ideals and undertakings which benefit humanity on its journey through history : '' The Spirit of God with marvelous foresight directs the course of the ages and renews the face of the earth . '' The risen Christ '' -isaia-_now -atti_degli_apostoli- work in human hearts through the strength of his Spirit , not_only instilling a desire_for the world to come but_also thereby animating , purifying and reinforcing the noble aspirations which drive the human_family to make its life one that_-isaia- more_human and to direct the whole earth to this_end . '' Again , it -isaia- the Spirit who sows the '' seeds of the Word '' present in various customs and cultures , preparing them_for full maturity in Christ . Thus the Spirit , who '' blows where he wills '' cf . Jn : , who '' was already -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the world before Christ was glorified , '' and who '' has filled the world , . holds all things together and knows what_-isaia- said '' Wis : , leads us to broaden our vision in order to ponder his activity in every time_and_place . I have repeatedly called this_fact to mind , and it has guided me in my meetings with a wide variety of peoples . The Church s relationship_with other_religions -isaia- dictated by a twofold respect : '' Respect for_man in his quest for answers to the deepest questions of his_life , and respect_for the action of the Spirit in man . '' Excluding any mistaken interpretation , the interreligious meeting held in Assisi was meant to confirm my conviction_that '' every authentic prayer_-isaia- prompted by the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- mysteriously present in every_human heart . '' This -isaia-_the_same Spirit who_was -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Incarnation and in the life , death_and_resurrection of Jesus , and who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church . He -isaia- therefore not an alternative to Christ , nor_does he fill a sort of void which_-isaia- sometimes suggested as existing between Christ and the Logos . Whatever the Spirit brings about in human hearts and in the history of peoples , in cultures and religions serves as a preparation_for the Gospel and can_only be understood in reference to Christ , the Word who took flesh by the power of the Spirit '' so that as perfectly human he would save all human_beings and sum up all things . '' Moreover , the universal activity of the Spirit -isaia- not to be separated_from his particular activity within_the body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church . Indeed , it -isaia- always the Spirit who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work , both when he gives_life to the Church and impels her to proclaim Christ , and when he implants and develops his gifts in all individuals and peoples , guiding the Church to discover these gifts , to foster them and to receive them through dialogue . Every form of the Spirit s presence -isaia- to be welcomed with_respect and gratitude , but the discernment of this presence -isaia- the responsibility of the Church , to which Christ gave_his Spirit in order to guide her into all the truth cf . Missionary Activity Is Only Beginning . Our own_time , with humanity on the move and in continual search , demands a resurgence of the Church s missionary_activity . The horizons and possibilities for mission are growing ever wider , and we Christians are_called to an apostolic courage based upon trust in the Spirit . He -isaia- the principal agent of mission ! The history of humanity has known many major turning points which_have encouraged missionary outreach , and the Church , guided by the Spirit , has_always responded to them_with generosity and farsightedness . Results have_not been lacking . Not long ago we celebrated the millennium of the evangelization of Rus and the Slav peoples , and we are_now preparing to celebrate the five hundredth anniversary of the evangelization of the Americas . Similarly , there have_been recent commemorations of the centenaries of the first missions in various countries of Asia , Africa and Oceania . Today the Church must face other challenges and push forward to new frontiers , both in the initial mission ad gentes and in the new_evangelization of those peoples who have_already heard Christ proclaimed . Today all Christians , the particular_churches and the universal Church , are_called to have_the same courage that inspired the missionaries of the past , and the same readiness to listen to the voice of the Spirit . CHAPTER IV THE VAST HORIZONS OF THE MISSION AD GENTES . The Lord Jesus sent his_apostles to every_person , people and place on earth . In the apostles , the Church received a universal mission one_which knows no boundaries which involves the communication of salvation in its integrity according to that fullness of life_which Christ came to bring cf . The Church was '' sent by Christ to reveal and communicate the love of God to all people and nations . '' This mission_-isaia- one and undivided , having one origin and one final purpose ; but within it , there_are different tasks and kinds of activity . First , there_-isaia- the missionary_activity which we call mission ad gentes , in reference to the opening words of the Council s decree on this_subject . This -isaia- one of the Church s fundamental activities : it -isaia- essential and never ending . The Church , in fact , '' cannot withdraw from her permanent mission of bringing the Gospel to the multitudes the millions and millions of men_and_women_who as yet do not_know Christ the Redeemer of humanity . In a specific way this_-isaia- the missionary work_which Jesus entrusted and still entrusts each_day to his Church . '' A Complex and Ever Changing Religious Picture . Today we face a religious situation which_-isaia- extremely varied and changing . Peoples are on the move ; social and religious realities which_were once clear and well defined are today increasingly complex . We need only think of certain phenomena such as urbanization , mass migration , the flood of refugees , the de Christianization of countries with ancient Christian traditions , the increasing influence of the Gospel and its values in overwhelmingly non Christian countries , and the proliferation of messianic cults and religious sects . Religious and social upheaval makes it difficult to apply in practice certain ecclesial distinctions and categories to which_we_have become accustomed . Even before the Council it was said_that some Christian cities and countries had become '' mission territories '' ; the situation has certainly not improved in the years since then . On the other_hand , missionary work has_been very fruitful throughout_the_world , so that_there are_now well established churches , sometimes so sound and mature that_they_are able to provide_for the needs of their_own communities and even send personnel to evangelize in other_churches and territories . This -isaia- in contrast to some traditionally Christian areas which_are in need of re evangelization . As a result , some are questioning whether it -isaia- still appropriate to speak of specific missionary_activity or specifically '' missionary '' areas , or whether we should speak instead of a single missionary situation , with one single mission , the same everywhere . The difficulty of relating this complex and changing reality to the mandate of evangelization_-isaia- apparent in the '' language of mission . '' For example , there_-isaia- a certain hesitation to use the terms '' mission '' and '' missionaries , '' which_are considered obsolete and as having negative historical connotations . People prefer to use instead the noun '' mission '' in the singular and the adjective '' missionary '' to describe all the Church s activities . This uneasiness denotes a real change , one_which has certain positive aspects . The so called return or '' repatriation '' of the missions into the Church s mission , the insertion of missiology into ecclesiology , and the integration of both areas into the Trinitarian plan of salvation , have_given a fresh impetus to missionary_activity itself , which_-isaia-_not considered a marginal task for the Church but_-isaia- situated -atti_degli_apostoli- the center of her_life , as a fundamental commitment of the whole People of God . Nevertheless , care must_be_taken to avoid the risk of putting very different situations on the same level and of reducing , or even eliminating , the Church s mission and missionaries ad gentes . To say that_the_whole Church -isaia- missionary does_not preclude the existencec of a specific mission ad gentes , just as saying that all Catholics must be missionaries not_only does_not exclude , but actually requires that_there be persons_who have a specific vocation to be '' life long missionaries ad gentes . '' Mission Ad Gentes Retains Its Value . The fact that_there_-isaia- a diversity of activities in the Church s one mission_-isaia- not intrinsic to that mission , but arises from the variety of circumstances in which that mission_-isaia- carried_out . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- today_s_world from the viewppoint of evangelization , we can distinguish three situations . First , there_-isaia- the situation which_the Church s missionary_activity addresses : peoples , groups , and socio cultural contexts in which Christ and his Gospel are_not known , or which lack Christian communities sufficiently mature to be able to incarnate the faith in their_own environment and proclaim it to other groups . This -isaia- mission ad gentes in the proper sense of the term . Secondly , there_are Christian communities with adequate and solid ecclesial structures . They are fervent in their_faith and in Christian living . They bear_witness to the Gospel in their surroundings and have a sense of commitment to the universal mission . In these communities the Church carries out her activity and pastoral_care . Thirdly , there_-isaia- an intermediate situation , particularly in countries with ancient Christian roots , and occasionally in the younger Churches as well , where entire groups of the baptized have lost a living sense of the faith , or even no longer consider themselves members of the Church , and live a life far removed from Christ and his Gospel . In this case what_-isaia- needed -isaia- a '' new_evangelization '' or a '' re evangelization . Missionary activity proper , namely the mission ad gentes , -isaia-_directed to '' peoples or groups who_do_not yet believe in Christ , '' '' who_are far from Christ , '' in whom_the Church '' has not_yet taken root '' and whose culture has not_yet been influenced by the Gospel . It -isaia- distinct from other ecclesial activities inasmuch as it -isaia- addressed to groups and settings which_are non Christian because the preaching of the Gospel and the presence of the Church are either absent or insufficient . It can thus be characterized as the work of proclaiming Christ and his Gospel , building up the local Church and promoting the values of the kingdom . The specific nature of this_mission ad gentes consists in its being addressed to '' non Christians . '' It -isaia- therefore necessary to ensure_that this specifically '' missionary work that Jesus entrusted and still entrusts each_day to his Church '' does_not become an indistinguishable part of the overall mission of the whole People of God and as a result become neglected or forgotten . On the other_hand , the boundaries between pastoral_care of the faithful , new_evangelization and specific missionary_activity are_not clearly definable , and it -isaia- unthinkable to create barriers between_them or to put them_into watertight compartments . Nevertheless , there_must be no lessening of the impetus to preach the Gospel and to establish new churches among peoples or communities where they_do_not yet exist , for_this -isaia-_the_first task of the Church , which_has_been sent forth to all peoples and to the very ends of the earth . Without the mission ad gentes , the Church s very missionary dimension would be deprived of its essential meaning and of the very activity that exemplifies it . Also to be noted -isaia- the real and growing interdependence which exists between these various saving activities of the Church . Each of them influences , stimulates and assists the others . The missionary thrust fosters exchanges between_the churches and directs them toward_the larger world , with positive influences in every direction . The churches in traditionally Christian countries , for example , involved as they_are in the challenging task of new_evangelization , are coming to understand more_clearly that they_cannot be missionaries to non Christians in other countries and continents unless they_are seriously concerned about the non Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Hence missionary_activity ad intra -isaia- a credible sign and a stimulus for missionary_activity ad extra , and vice versa . To All Peoples , In Spite of Difficulties . The mission ad gentes faces an enormous task , which_-isaia- in no way disappearing . Indeed , both from the numerical standpoint of demographic increase and from the socio cultural standpoint of the appearance of new relationships , contacts and changing situations the mission seems destined to have ever wider horizons . The task of proclaiming Jesus Christ to all peoples appears to be immense and out of all proportion to the Church s human resources . The difficulties seem insurmountable and could easily lead to discouragement , if it were a question of a merely human enterprise . In certain countries missionaries are refused entry . In others , not_only -isaia- evangelization forbidden but conversion as well , and even Christian worship . Elsewhere the obstacles are of a cultural nature : passing on the Gospel message seems irrelevant or incomprehensible , and conversion -isaia- seen as a rejection of one_s_own people and culture . Nor are difficulties lacking within_the People of God ; indeed these difficulties are the most painful of all . As the first of these difficulties Pope Paul VI pointed to '' the lack of fervor which_-isaia- all the more_serious because it comes_from within . It -isaia- manifested in fatigue , disenchantment , compromise , lack of interest and above all lack of joy and hope . '' Other great obstacles to the Church s missionary work include past and present divisions among Christians , dechristianization within Christian countries , the decrease of vocations to the apostolate , and the counterwitness of believers and Christian communities failing to follow_the model of Christ in their_lives . But one_of_the_most serious reasons for the lack of interest in the missionary task -isaia- a widespread indifferentism , which , sad to say , -isaia- found also among Christians . It -isaia- based on incorrect theological perspectives and -isaia- characterized by a religious relativism which_leads to the belief that '' one religion_-isaia- as good as another . '' We can add , using the words of Pope Paul VI , that_there are_also certain '' excuses which_would impede evangelization . The most insidious of these excuses are certainly the ones which people claim to find support for in such and such a teaching of the Council . '' In this_regard , I earnestly ask theologians and professional Christian journalists to intensify the service they render to the Church s mission in order to discover the deep meaning of their_work , along the sure path of '' thinking with the Church '' sentire cum Ecclesia . Internal and external difficulties must_not make us pessimistic or inactive . What counts , here as in every area of Christian life , -isaia- the confidence that comes_from faith , from the certainty that_it_-isaia- not we who_are the principal agents of the Church s mission , but Jesus Christ and his Spirit . We are only co workers , and when we have_done all that_we_can , we must say : '' We are unworthy servants ; we have only done what_was our_duty '' Lk : . Parameters of the Church s Mission Ad Gentes . By virtue of Christ s universal mandate , the mission ad gentes knows no boundaries . Still , it -isaia- possible to determine certain parameters within which that mission_-isaia- exercised , in order to gain a real grasp of the situation . Missionary activity has normally been defined in terms of specific territories . The Second Vatican Council acknowledged the territorial dimension of the mission ad gentes , a dimension which even today remains important_for determining responsibilities , competencies and the geographical limits of missionary_activity . Certainly , a universal mission implies a universal perspective . Indeed , the Church refuses to allow her missionary presence to be hindered by geographical boundaries or political barriers . But it -isaia-_also true_that missionary_activity ad gentes , being different from the pastoral_care of the faithful and the new_evangelization of the non practicing , -isaia- exercised within well defined territories and groups of people . The growth in the number of new churches in recent_times should_not deceive us . Within the territories entrusted to these churches particularly in Asia , but_also in Africa , Latin America and Oceania there remain vast regions still to be evangelized . In many nations entire peoples and cultural areas of great_importance have_not yet been reached by the proclamation of the Gospel and the presence of the local church . Even in traditionally Christian countries there_are regions that_are under the special structures of the mission ad gentes , with groups and areas not_yet evangelized . Thus , in these countries too there_-isaia-_a_need not_only_for a new_evangelization , but_also , in some cases , for an initial evangelization . Situations are_not , however , the same everywhere . While acknowledging that statements about the missionary responsibility of the Church are_not credible unless they_are backed up by a serious commitment to a new_evangelization in the traditionally Christian countries , it does_not seem justified to regard as identical the situation of a people which has_never known Jesus Christ and that of a people which_has known him , accepted him and then rejected him , while continuing to live in a culture which in large part has absorbed gospel principles and values . These are two basically different situations with_regard to the faith . Thus the criterion of geography , although somewhat imprecise and always provisional , -isaia- still a valid indicator of the frontiers toward which missionary_activity must be directed . There are countries and geographical and cultural areas which lack indigenous Christian communities . In other places , these communities are so small as not to be a clear sign of a Christian presence ; or they lack the dynamism to evangelize their societies , or belong to a minority population not integrated into the dominant culture of the nation . Particularly in Asia , toward which_the Church s mission ad gentes ought to be chiefly directed , Christians are a small minority , even_though sometimes there_are significant numbers of converts and outstanding examples of Christian presence . b New worlds and new social phenomena . The rapid and profound transformations which characterize today_s_world , especially in the southern hemisphere , are having a powerful effect on the overall missionary picture . Where before there_were stable human and social situations , today everything -isaia- in flux . One thinks , for example , of urbanization and the massive growth of cities , especially where demographic pressure -isaia- greatest . In not_a_few countries , over half the population already lives in a few '' megalopolises , '' where human problems are_often aggravated by the feeling of anonymity experienced by masses of people . In the modern age , missionary_activity has_been carried_out especially in isolated regions which_are far from centers of civilization and which_are hard to penetrate because of difficulties of communication , language or climate . Today the image of mission ad gentes -isaia- perhaps changing : efforts should be concentrated on the big cities , where new customs and styles of living arise together_with new_forms of culture and communication , which then influence the wider population . It -isaia- true_that the '' option for the neediest '' means that_we_should not overlook the most abandoned and isolated human groups , but_it_-isaia- also true_that individual or small groups cannot be evangelized if we neglect the centers where a new humanity , so to speak , -isaia- emerging , and where new models of development are taking shape . The future of the younger nations -isaia- being shaped in the cities . Speaking of the future , we cannot forget the young , who in many countries comprise more_than half the population . How do we bring_the message of Christ to non Christian young_people who represent the future of entire continents ? Clearly , the ordinary means of pastoral_work are_not sufficient : what_are needed are associations , institutions , special centers and groups , and cultural and social initiatives for young_people . This -isaia- a field where modern ecclesial movements have ample room_for involvement . Among the great changes taking place in the contemporary world , migration has produced a new phenomenon : non Christians are becoming very numerous in traditionally Christian countries , creating fresh opportunities_for contacts and cultural exchanges , and calling the Church to hospitality , dialogue , assistance and , in a word , fraternity . Among migrants , refugees occupy a very_special place and deserve the greatest attention . Today there_are_many millions of refugees in the world and their number -isaia- constantly increasing . They have fled from conditions of political oppression and inhuman misery , from famine and drought of catastrophic proportions . The Church must make_them part of her overall apostolic concern . Finally , we may mention the situations of poverty often on an intolerable scale which_have_been created in not_a_few countries , and which are_often the cause of mass migration . The community of believers in Christ -isaia- challenged by these inhuman situations : the proclamation of Christ and the kingdom of God must become the means_for restoring the human_dignity of these_people . c Cultural sectors : the modern equivalents of the Areopagus . After preaching in a number of places , St . Paul arrived in Athens , where he went to the Areopagus and proclaimed the Gospel in language appropriate to and understandable in those surroundings cf . At that_time the Areopagus represented the cultural center of the learned people of Athens , and today it can be taken as a symbol of the new sectors in which_the Gospel must be proclaimed . The first Areopagus of the modern age -isaia- the world of communications , which_-isaia- unifying humanity and turning it into what_-isaia- known as a '' global village . '' The means of social communication have_become so important as to be for_many the chief means of information and education , of guidance and inspiration in their behavior as individuals , families and within society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . In particular , the younger generation -isaia- growing up in a world conditioned by the mass_media . To some degree perhaps this Areopagus has_been neglected . Generally , preference has_been_given to other means of preaching the Gospel and of Christian education , while the mass_media are left to the initiative of individuals or small groups and enter_into pastoral planning only in a secondary way . Involvement in the mass_media , however , -isaia- not meant merely to strengthen the preaching of the Gospel . There -isaia- a deeper reality involved here : since_the very evangelization of modern culture depends to a great extent on the influence of the media , it -isaia-_not_enough to use the media simply to spread the Christian message and the Church s authentic teaching . It -isaia-_also necessary to integrate that message into the '' new culture '' created by modern communications . This -isaia- a complex issue , since_the '' new culture '' originates not_just from whatever content -isaia- eventually expressed , but_from the very_fact that_there exist new ways of communicating , with new languages , new techniques and a new psychology . Pope Paul VI said_that '' the split between_the Gospel and culture -isaia- undoubtedly the tragedy of our_time , '' and the field of communications fully confirms this judgment . There are_many other_forms of the '' Areopagus '' in the modern_world toward which_the Church s missionary_activity ought to be directed ; for example , commitment to peace , development and the liberation of peoples ; the rights of individuals and peoples , especially_those of minorities ; the advancement of women and children ; safeguarding the created world . These too are areas which need to be illuminated with the light of the Gospel . We must_also mention the immense '' Areopagus '' of culture , scientific_research , and international relations which promote dialogue and open up new possibilities . We would do well to be attentive to these modern areas of activity and to be involved in them . People sense that_they_are , as it were , traveling together across life s sea , and that they_are_called to ever_greater unity and solidarity . Solutions to pressing problems must be studied , discussed and worked out with the involvement of all . That -isaia- why international organizations and meetings are proving increasingly important in many sectors of human_life , from culture to politics , from the economy to research . Christians who_live and work in this international sphere must_always remember their_duty to bear_witness to the Gospel . Our times are both momentous and fascinating . While on the one_hand people seem to be pursuing material prosperity and to be sinking ever deeper into consumerism and materialism , on the other_hand we are witnessing a desperate search_for meaning , the need_for an inner life , and a desire to learn new_forms and methods of meditation and prayer . Not only in cultures with strong religious elements , but_also in secularized societies , the spiritual dimension of life_-isaia- being sought after as an antidote to dehumanization . This phenomenon the so called '' religious revival '' -isaia- not_without ambiguity , but it also represents an opportunity . The Church has an immense spiritual patrimony to offer humankind , a heritage in Christ , who called himself '' the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn : : it -isaia- the Christian path to meeting God , to prayer , to asceticism , and to the search_for life s meaning . Here too there_-isaia- an '' Areopagus '' to be evangelized . Fidelity to Christ and the Promotion of Human Freedom . All forms of missionary_activity are marked by an awareness_that one_-isaia- furthering human_freedom by proclaiming Jesus Christ . The Church must be faithful to Christ , whose body she_-isaia- , and whose mission she continues . She must necessarily '' go the same road that Christ went namely a road of poverty , obedience , service and self sacrifice even unto death , from which he emerged a victor through his_resurrection . '' The Church -isaia- thus obliged to do everything possible to carry_out her_mission in the world and to reach all peoples . And she_has the right to do this , a right given her by God for the accomplishment of his plan . Religious freedom , which_-isaia- still -atti_degli_apostoli- times limited or restricted , remains the premise and guarantee of all the freedoms that ensure the common_good of individuals and peoples . It -isaia- to be hoped that authentic religious_freedom will be granted to all people everywhere . The Church strives for_this in all countries , especially in those with a Catholic majority , where she_has greater influence . But it -isaia- not a question of the religion of the majority or the minority , but of an inalienable right of each_and_every human_person . the Church addresses people_with full respect_for their freedom . Her mission does_not restrict freedom but_rather promotes it . The Church proposes ; she imposes nothing . She respects individuals and cultures , and she honors the sanctuary of conscience . To those_who for various reasons oppose missionary_activity , the Church repeats : Open the doors to Christ ! Here I wish to address all the particular_churches , both young and old . The world_-isaia- steadily growing more united , and the gospel spirit must lead us to overcome cultural and nationalistic barriers , avoiding all isolationism . Pope Benedict XV already cautioned the missionaries of his time lest they '' forget their_proper dignity and think more of their earthly homeland than of their heavenly one . '' This same advice -isaia- valid today for the particular_churches : Open the doors to missionaries , for '' each_individual church_that would voluntarily cut itself off from the universal Church would lose its relationship to God s plan and would be impoverished in its ecclesial mission . '' Directing Attention Toward the South and the East . Today missionary_activity still represents the greatest challenge for the Church . As the end of the second millennium of the redemption draws near , it -isaia- clear_that the peoples who have_not yet received an initial proclamation of Christ constitute the majority of mankind . The results of missionary_activity in modern times are certainly positive . The Church has_been established on every continent ; indeed today the majority of believers and particular_churches -isaia- to be found no longer in Europe but on the continents which missionaries have opened up to the faith . The fact remains however that the '' ends of the earth '' to which_the Gospel must be brought are growing ever_more distant . Tertullian s saying , that the Gospel has_been proclaimed to all the earth and to all peoples , -isaia- still very far_from_being a reality . The mission ad gentes -isaia- still in its infancy . New peoples appear on the world scene , and they too have a right to receive the proclamation of salvation . Population growth in non Christian countries of the South and the East -isaia- constantly increasing the number of people_who remain unaware of Christ s redemption . We need therefore to direct our attention toward those geographical areas and cultural settings which still remain uninfluenced by the Gospel . All who_believe in Christ should feel , as an integral part of their_faith , an apostolic concern to pass on to others its light and joy . This concern must become , as it were , a hunger and thirst to make_the Lord known , given the vastness of the non Christian world . CHAPTER V THE PATHS OF MISSION . '' Missionary activity -isaia- nothing other and nothing less_than the manifestation or epiphany of God s plan and its fulfillment in the world and in history ; in this history God , by means of missions , clearly accomplishes the history_of_salvation . '' What paths does the Church follow in order to achieve this goal ? Mission -isaia- a single but complex reality , and it develops in a variety of ways . Among these ways , some have particular importance in the present situation of the Church and the world . The First Form of Evangelization Is Witness . People today put more trust in witnesses than in teachers , in experience than in teaching , and in life and action than in theories . The witness of a Christian life -isaia-_the_first and irreplaceable form of mission : Christ , whose mission we continue , -isaia- the '' witness '' par excellence Rv : ; : and the model of all Christian witness . The Holy Spirit accompanies the Church along her way and associates her with the witness he gives to Christ cf . The first form of witness -isaia- the very life of the missionary , of the Christian family , and of the ecclesial_community , which reveal a new_way of living . The missionary who , despite all his or her human limitations and defects , lives a simple life , taking Christ as the model , -isaia- a sign of God and of transcendent realities . But everyone in the Church , striving to imitate the Divine Master , can and must bear this_kind of witness ; in many cases it -isaia-_the_only possible way of being a missionary . The evangelical witness which_the world finds most appealing -isaia- that of concern_for people , and of charity toward_the poor , the weak and those who_suffer . The complete generosity underlying this attitude and these actions stands in marked contrast to human selfishness . It raises precise questions which lead to God and to the Gospel . A commitment to peace , justice , human_rights and human promotion -isaia-_also a witness to the Gospel when_it_-isaia- a sign of concern_for persons and -isaia-_directed toward integral human_development . Christians and Christian communities are_very much a part of the life of their_respective nations and can be a sign of the Gospel in their fidelity to their native land , people and national culture , while always preserving the freedom brought by Christ . Christianity -isaia- open to universal brotherhood , for all men_and_women are sons_and_daughters of the same Father and brothers_and_sisters in Christ . The Church -isaia- called to bear_witness to Christ by taking courageous and prophetic stands in the face of the corruption of political or economic power ; by not seeking her_own glory and material wealth ; by using her resources to serve the poorest of the poor and by imitating Christ s own simplicity of life . The Church and her missionaries must_also bear the witness of humility , above all with_regard to themselves a humility which allows them to make a personal and communal examination of conscience in order to correct in their behavior whatever_-isaia- contrary to the Gospel and disfigures the face of Christ . The Initial Proclamation of Christ the Savior . Proclamation -isaia- the permanent priority of mission . The Church cannot elude Christ s explicit mandate , nor deprive men_and_women of the '' Good News '' about their being loved and saved by God . '' Evangelization will_always contain as the foundation , center and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the summit of its dynamism a clear proclamation that , in Jesus Christ . salvation -isaia- offered to all people , as a gift of God s grace and mercy . '' All forms of missionary_activity are directed to this proclamation , which reveals and gives access to the mystery hidden for ages and made_known in Christ cf . Eph : ; Col : , the mystery which lies -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Church s mission and life , as the hinge on which all evangelization turns . In the complex reality of mission , initial proclamation has a central and irreplaceable role , since it introduces man '' into the mystery of the love of God , who invites him to enter_into a personal relationship_with himself in Christ '' and opens the way to conversion . Faith -isaia- born of preaching , and every ecclesial_community draws its origin and life from the personal response of each believer to that preaching . Just as the whole economy of salvation has its center in Christ , so too all missionary_activity -isaia-_directed to the proclamation of his mystery . The subject of proclamation -isaia- Christ who_was crucified , died and -isaia- risen : through_him -isaia- accomplished our full and authentic liberation from evil , sin and death ; through_him God bestows '' new_life '' that_-isaia- divine and eternal . This -isaia- the '' Good News '' which changes man and his history , and which all peoples have a right to hear . This proclamation -isaia- to be made within_the context of the lives of the individuals and peoples who receive it . It -isaia- to be made with an attitude of love and esteem toward those_who hear it , in language which_-isaia- practical and adapted to the situation . In this proclamation the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work and establishes a communion_between the missionary and his hearers , a communion_which -isaia- possible inasmuch as both enter_into communion with God the Father through Christ . Proclamation , because_it_-isaia- made in union with the entire ecclesial_community , -isaia- never a merely personal act . The missionary -isaia- present and carries out his_work by virtue of a mandate he has_received ; even if he finds himself alone , he remains joined by invisible but profound bonds to the evangelizing activity of the whole Church . Sooner or later , his hearers come to recognize in him the community which sent him and which supports him . Proclamation -isaia- inspired by faith_,_which gives_rise to enthusiasm and fervor in the missionary . As already mentioned , the Acts of the Apostles uses the word parrhesia to describe this attitude , a word which means to speak frankly and with courage . This term -isaia- found also in St . Paul : '' We had courage in our God to declare to you the Gospel of God in the face of great opposition '' Th : ; '' Pray . also_for me , that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim_the mystery of the Gospel for_which I -amos- an ambassador in chains ; that I may declare it boldly , as I ought to speak '' Eph : . In proclaiming Christ to non Christians , the missionary -isaia- convinced_that , through the working of the Spirit , there already exists in individuals and peoples an expectation , even if an unconscious one , of knowing the truth_about God , about man , and about how we are to be set free_from sin and death . The missionary s enthusiasm in proclaiming Christ comes_from_the conviction_that he -isaia- responding to that expectation , and so he does_not become discouraged or cease his witness even_when he -isaia- called to manifest his faith in an environment that_-isaia- hostile or indifferent . He knows that the Spirit of the Father -isaia- speaking through_him cf . Mt : ; Lk : and he can say with the apostles : '' We are witnesses to these_things , and so -isaia- the Holy Spirit '' Acts : . He knows that_he_-isaia- not proclaiming a human truth , but the '' word of God , '' which_has an intrinsic and mysterious power of its_own cf . The supreme test -isaia- the giving of one s life , to the point of accepting death in order to bear_witness to one s faith in Jesus Christ . Throughout Christian history , martyrs , that_-isaia- , '' witnesses , '' have always_been numerous and indispensable to the spread of the Gospel . In our_own age , there_are_many : bishops_,_priests , men_and_women_religious , lay_people often unknown heroes who give their_lives to bear_witness to the faith . They are par excellence the heralds and witnesses of the faith . Conversion and Baptism . The proclamation of the Word of God has Christian conversion as its aim : a complete and sincere adherence to Christ and his Gospel through_faith . Conversion -isaia-_a_gift of God , a work of the Blessed Trinity . It -isaia- the Spirit who opens people s hearts so that_they_can believe in Christ and '' confess him '' cf . Cor : ; of those_who draw near to him through_faith Jesus says : '' No one_can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him '' Jn : . From the outset , conversion -isaia- expressed in faith which_-isaia- total and radical , and which neither limits nor hinders God s gift . At the same_time , it gives_rise to a dynamic and lifelong process which demands a continual turning away from '' life according to the flesh '' to '' life according to the Spirit '' cf . Conversion means accepting , by a personal decision , the saving sovereignty of Christ and becoming his disciple . The Church calls all people to this conversion , following_the_example of John the Baptist , who prepared the way_for Christ by '' preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins '' Mk : , as well as the example of Christ himself , who '' after John was arrested , . came into Galilee preaching the Gospel of God and saying : The time -isaia- fulfilled , and the kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; repent and believe in the Gospel '' Mk : . Nowadays the call to conversion which missionaries address to non Christians -isaia- put into question or passed over in silence . It -isaia- seen as an act of '' proselytizing '' ; it -isaia- claimed that_it_-isaia- enough to help people to become more_human or more faithful to their_own religion , that_it_-isaia- enough to build communities capable of working for_justice , freedom , peace and solidarity . What -isaia- overlooked -isaia- that every_person has the right to hear_the '' Good News '' of the God who reveals and gives himself in Christ , so that_each one_can live out in its fullness his or her proper calling . This lofty reality -isaia- expressed in the words of Jesus to the Samaritan woman : '' If you knew the gift of God , '' and in the unconscious but ardent desire of the woman : '' Sir , give me this water , that I may_not thirst '' Jn : , . The apostles , prompted by the Spirit , invited all to change their_lives , to be converted and to be baptized . Immediately after_the event of Pentecost , Peter spoke convincingly to the crowd : '' When they heard this , they_were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles , Brethren , what shall we do ? And Peter said to them , Repent , and be baptized every_one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins ; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit '' Acts : . That very day some three thousand persons were baptized . And again , after_the healing of the lame man , Peter spoke to the crowd and repeated : '' Repent therefore , and turn again , that_your sins may be blotted out ! '' Acts : Conversion to Christ -isaia- joined to Baptism not only_because of the Church s practice , but_also by the will of Christ himself , who sent the apostles to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them cf . Conversion -isaia-_also joined to Baptism because of the intrinsic need to receive the fullness of new_life in Christ . As Jesus says to Nicodemus : '' Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one_-isaia- born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter_the kingdom of God '' Jn : . In Baptism , in fact , we are born anew to the life of God s children , united to Jesus Christ and anointed in the Holy Spirit . Baptism -isaia- not_simply a seal of conversion , and a kind of external sign indicating conversion and attesting to it . Rather , it -isaia- the sacrament which signifies and effects rebirth from the Spirit , establishes real and unbreakable bonds with the Blessed Trinity , and makes us members of the Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church . All this needs to be said , since not_a_few people , precisely in those areas involved in the mission ad gentes , tend to separate conversion to Christ from Baptism , regarding Baptism as unnecessary . It -isaia- true_that in some places sociological considerations associated_with Baptism obscure its genuine meaning as an act of faith . This -isaia- due to a variety of historical and cultural factors which_must be removed where_they still exist , so that the sacrament of spiritual rebirth can be seen for_what it truly -isaia- . Local ecclesial_communities must devote_themselves to this_task . It -isaia-_also true that_many profess an interior commitment to Christ and his message yet do not wish to be committed sacramentally , since , owing to prejudice or because of the failings of Christians , they find it difficult to grasp the true nature of the Church as a mystery of faith and love . I wish to encourage such people to be fully open to Christ , and to remind them that , if they feel drawn to Christ , it was he himself who desired that the Church should be the '' place '' where they_would in fact find him . At the same_time , I invite the Christian faithful , both individually and as communities , to bear authentic witness to Christ through the new_life they have_received . Certainly , every convert -isaia-_a_gift to the Church and represents a serious responsibility_for her , not only_because converts have to be prepared_for Baptism through the catechumenate and then be guided by religious instruction , but also_because especially in the case of adults such converts bring with_them a kind of new energy , an enthusiasm for the faith , and a desire to see the Gospel lived out in the Church . They would be greatly disappointed if , having entered the ecclesial_community , they_were to find a life lacking fervor and without signs of renewal ! We cannot preach conversion unless we ourselves are converted anew every_day . Forming Local Churches . Conversion and Baptism give entry into a Church already in existence or require the establishment of new communities which confess Jesus as Savior and Lord . This -isaia-_part of God s plan , for it pleases him '' to call human_beings to share in his own_life not merely as individuals , without_any unifying bond between_them , but_rather to make_them into a people in which his_children , who had_been widely scattered , might be gathered together in unity . '' The mission ad gentes has this objective : to found Christian communities and develop churches to their full maturity . This -isaia- a central and determining goal of missionary_activity , so much so that the mission_-isaia- not completed until it succeeds in building a new particular_church which functions normally in its local setting The Decree Ad Gentes deals with this_subject -atti_degli_apostoli- length , and since_the Council , a line of theological reflection has developed which emphasizes that_the_whole mystery of the Church -isaia- contained in each particular_church , provided it does_not isolate itself but remains in communion with the universal Church and becomes missionary in its_own turn . Here we are speaking of a great and lengthy process , in which_it_-isaia- hard to identify the precise stage -atti_degli_apostoli- which missionary_activity properly so called comes to an end and -isaia- replaced by pastoral_activity . Even so , certain points must remain clear . It -isaia- necessary first_and_foremost to strive to establish Christian communities everywhere , communities which_are '' a sign of the presence of God in the world '' and which grow until they become churches . Notwithstanding the high number of dioceses , there are_still very large areas where_there are no local_churches or where their number -isaia- insufficient in relation to the vastness of the territory and the density of the population . There -isaia- still much to be done in implanting and developing the Church . This phase of ecclesial history , called the plantatio Ecclesiae , has not reached its end ; indeed , for much of the human_race it has yet to begin . Responsibility for this_task belongs to the universal Church and to the particular_churches , to the whole_people of God and to all its missionary forces . Every church , even one made up of recent converts , -isaia- missionary by its_very nature , and -isaia- both evangelized and evangelizing . Faith must_always be presented as a gift of God to be lived out in community families , parishes , associations , and to be extended to others through witness in word and deed . The evangelizing activity of the Christian community , first in its_own locality , and then elsewhere as part of the Church s universal mission , -isaia- the clearest sign of a mature faith . A radical conversion in thinking -isaia- required in order to become missionary , and this holds true both_for individuals and entire communities . The Lord -isaia- always calling us to come out of ourselves and to share with_others the goods we possess , starting with the most_precious gift of all our_faith . The effectiveness of the Church s organizations , movements , parishes and apostolic works must be measured in the light of this missionary imperative . Only by becoming missionary will the Christian community be able to overcome its internal divisions and tensions , and rediscover its unity and its strength of faith . Missionary personnel coming from other_churches and countries must work in communion with_their local counterparts for the development of the Christian community . In particular , it falls to missionary personnel in accordance_with_the directives of the bishops and in cooperation_with those responsible -atti_degli_apostoli- the local level to foster the spread of the faith and the expansion of the Church in non Christian environments and among non Christian groups , and to encourage a missionary sense within_the particular_churches , so that pastoral concern will_always be combined with concern_for the mission ad gentes . In this_way , every church_will make its_own the solicitude of Christ the Good Shepherd , who fully devotes himself to his flock , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time -isaia- mindful of the '' other sheep , that_are not of this fold . This solicitude will serve as a motivation and stimulus for a renewed commitment to ecumenism . The relationship_between ecumenical activity and missionary_activity makes it necessary to consider two closely associated factors . On the one_hand , we must recognize_that '' the division among Christians damages the holy work of preaching the Gospel to every_creature and -isaia- a barrier for_many in their approach to the faith . '' The fact_that the Good News of reconciliation -isaia- preached by Christians who_are divided among_themselves weakens their witness . It -isaia- thus urgent to work_for the unity of Christians , so that missionary_activity can be more_effective . At the same_time we must_not forget_that efforts toward unity are themselves a sign of the work of reconciliation which God -isaia- bringing_about in our midst . On the other_hand , it -isaia- true that_some kind of communion , though imperfect , exists among all those_who_have received Baptism in Christ . On this basis the Council established the principle that '' while all appearance of indifferentism and confusion -isaia- ruled out , as well as any appearance of unhealthy rivalry , Catholics should collaborate in a spirit of fellowship with_their separated brothers_and_sisters in accordance_with_the norms of the Decree on Ecumenism : by a common profession_of_faith in God and in Jesus Christ before the nations to the extent that_this_-isaia- possible and by their cooperation in social and technical as well as in cultural and religious matters . '' Ecumenical activity and harmonious witness to Jesus Christ by Christians who belong to different churches_and_ecclesial_communities has_already borne abundant fruit . But it -isaia- ever_more urgent that_they work and bear_witness together -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time when Christian and para Christian sects are sowing confusion by their activity . The expansion of these sects represents a threat for the Catholic Church and for all the ecclesial_communities with_which she_-isaia- engaged in dialogue . Wherever possible , and in the light of local circumstances , the response of Christians can itself be an ecumenical one . '' Ecclesial Basic Communities '' As a Force for Evangelization . A rapidly growing phenomenon in the young churches one sometimes fostered by the bishops and their Conferences as a pastoral priority -isaia- that of '' ecclesial basic communities '' also known by other names which_are proving to be good centers for Christian formation and missionary outreach . These are groups of Christians who , -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the family or in a similarly restricted setting , come together for prayer , Scripture reading , catechesis , and discussion on human and ecclesial problems with_a_view to a common commitment . These communities are a sign of vitality within_the Church , an instrument of formation and evangelization , and a solid starting point for a new society based on a '' civilization of love . '' These communities decentralize and organize the parish community , to which_they always remain united . They take root in less privileged and rural areas , and become a leaven of Christian life , of care_for the poor and neglected , and of commitment to the transformation of society . Within them , the individual Christian experiences community and therefore senses that he or she_-isaia- playing an active role and -isaia- encouraged to share in the common task . Thus , these communities become a means of evangelization and of the initial proclamation of the Gospel , and a source of new ministries . At the same_time , by being imbued_with Christ s love , they_also show how divisions , tribalism and racism can be overcome . Every community , if it -isaia- to be Christian , must be founded on Christ and live in him , as it listens to the word of God , focuses its prayer on the Eucharist , lives in a communion marked by oneness of heart and soul , and shares according to the needs of its_members cf . As Pope Paul VI recalled , every community must live in union with the particular and the universal Church , in heartfelt communion with the Church s pastors and the Magisterium , with a commitment to missionary outreach and without yielding to isolationism or ideological exploitation . And the Synod of Bishops stated : '' Because the Church -isaia- communion , the new basic communities , if they truly live in unity with the Church , are a true expression of communion and a means_for the construction of a more profound communion . They are thus cause for great hope_for the life of the Church . '' Incarnating the Gospel in Peoples Culture . As she carries out missionary_activity among the nations , the Church encounters different_cultures and becomes involved in the process of inculturation . The need for_such involvement has marked the Church s pilgrimage throughout her history , but today it -isaia- particularly urgent . The process of the Church s insertion into peoples cultures -isaia- a lengthy one . It -isaia- not a matter of purely external adaptation , for inculturation '' means the intimate transformation of authentic cultural values through_their integration in Christianity and the insertion of Christianity in the various human cultures . '' The process -isaia- thus a profound and all embracing one , which involves the Christian message and also the Church s reflection and practice . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- a difficult process , for it must in no way compromise the distinctiveness and integrity of the Christian faith . Through inculturation the Church makes_the Gospel incarnate in different_cultures and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time introduces peoples , together_with their cultures , into her_own community . She transmits to them her_own values , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time taking the good elements that already exist in them and renewing them_from within . Through inculturation the Church , for_her part , becomes a more intelligible sign of what she_-isaia- , and a more_effective instrument of mission . Thanks to this action within_the local_churches , the universal Church herself -isaia- enriched with forms of expression and values in the various sectors of Christian life , such as evangelization , worship , theology and charitable works . She comes to know and to express better the mystery of Christ , all the while being motivated to continual renewal . During my pastoral visits to the young churches I have repeatedly dealt_with these themes , which_are present in the Council and the subsequent Magisterium . Inculturation -isaia- a slow journey which accompanies the whole of missionary life . It involves those working in the Church s mission ad gentes , the Christian communities as they develop , and the bishops , who have_the task of providing discernment and encouragement for its implementation . Missionaries , who come from other_churches and countries , must immerse themselves in the cultural milieu of those_to_whom they_are sent , moving beyond their_own cultural limitations . Hence they_must learn the language of the place in which_they work , become familiar with the most important expressions of the local culture , and discover its values through direct experience . Only if they_have this_kind of awareness will they be able to bring to people the knowledge of the hidden mystery cf . Rom : ; Eph : in a credible and fruitful way . It -isaia- not of course a matter of missionaries renouncing their_own cultural identity , but of understanding , appreciating , fostering and evangelizing the culture of the environment in which_they_are working , and therefore of equipping themselves to communicate effectively with it , adopting a manner of living which_-isaia- a sign of gospel witness and of solidarity with the people . Developing ecclesial_communities , inspired by the Gospel , will gradually be able to express their Christian experience in original ways and forms that_are consonant with_their own cultural traditions , provided_that those traditions are in harmony_with_the objective requirements of the faith itself . To this_end , especially in the more delicate areas of inculturation , particular_churches of the same region should work in communion with each_other and with the whole Church , convinced_that only through attention both to the universal Church and to the particular_churches will they be capable of translating the treasure of faith into a legitimate variety of expressions . Groups which_have_been evangelized will thus provide the elements for a '' translation '' of the gospel_message , keeping in mind the positive elements acquired down_the_centuries from Christianity s contact_with different_cultures and not forgetting the dangers of alterations which_have sometimes occurred . In this_regard , certain guidelines remain basic . Properly applied , inculturation must be guided by two principles : '' compatibility with the gospel and communion with the universal Church . '' Bishops , as guardians of the '' deposit of faith , '' will take_care to ensure fidelity and , in particular , to provide discernment , for_which a deeply balanced approach -isaia- required . In fact there_-isaia- a risk of passing uncritically from a form of alienation from culture to an overestimation of culture . Since culture -isaia- a human creation and -isaia- therefore marked by sin , it too needs to be '' healed , ennobled and perfected . '' This kind of process needs to take_place gradually , in such_a_way_that it really -isaia- an expression of the community s Christian experience . As Pope Paul VI said in Kampala : '' It will require an incubation of the Christian mystery in the genius of your_people in order_that its native voice , more_clearly and frankly , may then be raised harmoniously in the chorus of other voices in the universal Church . '' In effect , inculturation must involve the whole_people of God , and not_just a few experts , since_the people reflect the authentic sensus fidei which must_never be lost sight of Inculturation needs to be guided and encouraged , but_not forced , lest it give rise to negative reactions among Christians . It must be an expression of the community s life , one which_must mature within_the community itself , and not be exclusively the result of erudite research . The safeguarding of traditional values -isaia- the work of a mature faith . Dialogue with Our Brothers and Sisters of Other Religions . Inter religious dialogue -isaia- a part of the Church s evangelizing mission . Understood as a method and means of mutual knowledge and enrichment , dialogue -isaia- not in opposition to the mission ad gentes ; indeed , it has special links with_that mission and -isaia- one of its expressions . This mission , in fact , -isaia- addressed to those who_do_not know Christ and his Gospel , and who belong for the most part to other_religions . In Christ , God calls all peoples to himself and he wishes to share_with them the fullness of his revelation and love . He does_not fail to make himself present in many_ways , not_only to individuals but_also to entire peoples through their_spiritual riches , of which their religions are the main and essential expression , even_when they contain '' gaps , insufficiencies and errors . '' All of this has_been_given ample emphasis by the Council and the subsequent Magisterium , without detracting in any_way from the fact_that salvation comes_from Christ and that dialogue does_not dispense from evangelization . In the light of the economy of salvation , the Church sees no conflict between proclaiming Christ and engaging in interreligious dialogue . Instead , she feels the need to link the two in the context of her_mission ad gentes . These two elements must maintain both their intimate connection and their distinctiveness ; therefore they_should not be confused , manipulated or regarded as identical , as though_they were interchangeable . I recently wrote to the bishops of Asia : '' Although the Church gladly acknowledges whatever_-isaia- true and holy in the religious traditions of Buddhism , Hinduism and Islam as a reflection of that truth_which enlightens all people , this_does_not lessen her duty and resolve to proclaim without fail Jesus Christ who -isaia-_the_way , and the truth and the life . The fact_that the followers of other_religions can receive God s grace and be saved by Christ apart_from the ordinary means which_he_has established does_not thereby cancel the call to faith and baptism which God wills for all people . '' Indeed Christ himself '' while expressly insisting on the need_for faith and baptism , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time confirmed the need_for the Church , into which people enter through Baptism as through a door . '' Dialogue should be conducted and implemented with the conviction_that the Church -isaia- the ordinary means of salvation and that_she alone possesses the fullness of the means of salvation . Dialogue does_not originate from tactical concerns or self interest , but_-isaia- an activity with its_own guiding principles , requirements and dignity . It -isaia- demanded by deep respect_for everything_that has_been brought_about in human_beings by the Spirit who blows where he wills . Through dialogue , the Church seeks to uncover the '' seeds of the Word , '' a '' ray of that truth_which enlightens all men '' ; these are_found in individuals and in the religious traditions of mankind . Dialogue -isaia- based on hope and love , and will bear_fruit in the Spirit . Other religions constitute a positive challenge for the Church : they stimulate her both to discover and acknowledge_the signs of Christ s presence and of the working of the Spirit , as well as to examine more_deeply her_own identity and to bear_witness to the fullness of Revelation which_she has_received for the good of all . This gives_rise to the spirit_which must enliven dialogue in the context of mission . Those engaged in this dialogue must be consistent with_their own religious traditions and convictions , and be open to understanding those of the other party without pretense or close mindedness , but_with truth , humility and frankness , knowing that dialogue can enrich each side . There must be no abandonment of principles nor false irenicism , but instead a witness given and received for mutual advancement on the road of religious inquiry and experience , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for the elimination of prejudice , intolerance and misunderstandings . Dialogue leads to inner purification and conversion which , if pursued with docility to the Holy Spirit , will be spiritually fruitful . A vast field lies open to dialogue , which_can assume many forms and expressions : from exchanges between experts in religious traditions or official representatives of those traditions to cooperation for integral development and the safeguarding of religious values ; and from a sharing of their_respective spiritual experiences to the so called '' dialogue of life , '' through_which believers of different religions bear_witness before each_other in daily_life to their_own human and spiritual values , and help each_other to live according to those values in order to build a more just and fraternal society . Each member of the faithful and all Christian communities are_called to practice dialogue , although not_always to the same degree or in the same_way . The contribution of the laity -isaia- indispensable in this area , for they '' can favor the relations which ought to be established with the followers of various religions through_their example in the situations in which_they live and in their activities . '' Some of them also will_be_able to make a contribution through research and study . I -amos- well aware_that many missionaries and Christian communities find in the difficult and often misunderstood path of dialogue their only way of bearing sincere witness to Christ and offering generous service to others . I wish to encourage them to persevere with_faith and love , even in places_where their_efforts are_not well received . Dialogue -isaia- a path toward_the kingdom and will certainly bear_fruit , even if the times and seasons are known only to the Father cf . Promoting Development by Forming Consciences . The mission ad gentes -isaia- still being carried_out today , for the most part in the southern regions of the world , where action on behalf of integral development and liberation from all forms of oppression -isaia- most urgently needed . The Church has_always_been able to generate among the peoples she evangelizes a drive toward progress . Today , more_than in the past , missionaries are_being recognized as promoters of development by governments and international experts who_are impressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the remarkable results achieved with scanty means . In the Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , I stated_that '' the Church does_not have technical solutions to offer for the problem of underdevelopment as such , '' but '' offers her first contribution to the solution of the urgent problem of development when_she proclaims_the truth_about Christ , about herself and about man , applying this_truth to a concrete situation . '' The Conference of Latin American Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- Puebla stated_that '' the best service we can_offer to our brother -isaia- evangelization , which helps him to live and act as a son of God , sets him free_from injustices and assists his overall development . '' It -isaia- not the Church s mission to work directly on the economic . technical or political levels , or to contribute materially to development . Rather , her_mission consists essentially in offering people an opportunity not to '' have more '' but to '' be more . '' by awakening their consciences through the Gospel . '' Authentic human_development must be rooted in an ever deeper evangelization . '' The Church and her missionaries also promote development through schools , hospitals , printing presses , universities and experimental farms . But a people s development does_not derive primarily from money , material assistance or technological means , but_from the formation of consciences and the gradual maturing of ways of thinking and patterns of behavior . Man -isaia- the principal agent of development , not money or technology . The Church forms consciences by revealing to peoples the God whom_they seek and do not_yet know , the grandeur of man created in God s image and loved by him , the equality of all men_and_women as God s sons_and_daughters , the mastery of man over nature created by God and placed -atti_degli_apostoli- man s service , and the obligation to work_for the development of the whole person and of all mankind . Through the gospel_message , the Church offers a force for liberation which promotes development precisely_because it leads to conversion of heart and of ways of thinking , fosters the recognition of each_person s dignity , encourages solidarity , commitment and service of one s neighbor , and gives everyone a place in God s plan , which_-isaia- the building of his_kingdom of peace and justice , beginning already in this_life . This -isaia- the biblical perspective of the '' new heavens and a new earth '' cf . Is : ; Pt : ; Rv : , which_has_been the stimulus and goal for mankind s advancement in history . Man s development derives from God , and from the model of Jesus God and man and must lead back to God . That -isaia- why there_-isaia- a close connection_between the proclamation of the Gospel and human promotion . The contribution of the Church and of evangelization to the development of peoples concerns not_only the struggle against material poverty and underdevelopment in the South of the world , but_also concerns the North , which_-isaia- prone to a moral and spiritual poverty caused by '' overdevelopment . '' A certain way of thinking , uninfluenced by a religious outlook and widespread in some parts of today_s_world , -isaia- based on the idea that increasing wealth and the promotion of economic and technical growth -isaia- enough for people to develop on the human level . But a soulless development cannot suffice for human_beings , and an excess of affluence -isaia- as harmful as excessive poverty . This -isaia- a '' development model '' which_the North has constructed and -isaia-_now spreading to the South , where a sense of religion as well as human values are in danger of being overwhelmed by a wave of consumerism . '' Fight hunger by changing your lifestyle '' -isaia- a motto which_has appeared in Church circles and which shows the people of the rich nations how to become brothers_and_sisters of the poor . We need to turn to a more austere way_of_life which_will favor a new model of development that gives attention to ethical and religious values . To the poor , missionary_activity brings light and an impulse toward true development , while a new_evangelization ought to create among the wealthy a realization that the time has arrived for them to become true brothers_and_sisters of the poor through the conversion of all to an '' integral development '' open to the Absolute . Charity : Source and Criterion of Mission . As I said during my pastoral visit to Brazil : '' The Church all over the world wishes to be the Church of the poor . she wishes to draw out all the truth contained in the Beatitudes of Christ , and especially in the first one : Blessed are the poor in spirit . She wishes to teach this_truth and she wishes to put it into_practice , just as Jesus came to do and to teach . '' The young churches , which for the most part are to be found among peoples suffering from widespread poverty , often give voice to this concern as an integral part of their_mission . The Conference of Latin American Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- Puebla , after recalling the example of Jesus , wrote that '' the poor deserve preferential attention , whatever their moral or personal situation . They have been_made in the image_and_likeness of God to be his_children , but_this image has_been obscured and even violated . For this_reason , God has become their defender and loves them . It follows_that the poor are those_to_whom the mission_-isaia- first addressed , and their evangelization_-isaia- par excellence the sign and proof of the mission of Jesus . '' In fidelity to the spirit of the Beatitudes , the Church -isaia- called to be on the side of those_who_are poor and oppressed in any_way . I therefore exhort the disciples of Christ and all Christian communities from families to dioceses , from parishes to religious institutes to carry_out a sincere review of their_lives regarding their solidarity with the poor . At the same_time , I express gratitude to the missionaries who , by their loving presence and humble service to people , are working for the integral development of individuals and of society through schools , health_care centers , leprosaria , homes for the handicapped and the elderly , projects for the promotion of women and other similar apostolates . I thank the priests , religious brothers_and_sisters , and members of the laity for their dedication , and I also encourage the volunteers from non governmental organizations who in ever_increasing numbers are devoting themselves to works of charity and human promotion . It -isaia-_in_fact these '' works of charity '' that reveal the soul of all missionary_activity : love , which_has_been and remains the driving force of mission , and -isaia-_also '' the sole criterion for judging what_-isaia- to be done or not done , changed or not changed . It -isaia- the principle which_must direct every action , and end to which that action must be directed . When we act with_a_view to charity , or are inspired by charity , nothing_-isaia- unseemly and everything -isaia- good . '' CHAPTER VI LEADERS AND WORKERS IN THE MISSIONARY APOSTOLATE . Without witnesses there_can be no witness , just as without missionaries there_can be no missionary_activity . Jesus chooses and sends people forth to be his witnesses and apostles , so that_they_may share in his_mission and continue in his saving work : '' You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth '' Acts : . The Twelve are the first to work in the Church s universal mission . They constitute a '' collegial subject '' of that mission , having_been chosen by Jesus to be with_him and to be sent forth '' to the lost sheep of the house of Israel '' Mt : . This collegiality does_not prevent certain figures from assuming prominence within_the group , such as James , John and above all Peter , who_-isaia- so prominent as to justify the expression : '' Peter and the other Apostles '' Acts : , . It was thanks to Peter that the horizons of the Church s universal mission were expanded , and the way was prepared_for the outstanding missionary work of Paul , who by God s will was called and sent forth to the nations cf . In the early Church s missionary expansion , we find alongside the apostles , other lesser figures who should_not be overlooked . These include individuals , groups and communities . A typical example -isaia- the local church -atti_degli_apostoli- Antioch which , after being evangelized , becomes an evangelizing community which sends missionaries to others cf . The early Church experiences her_mission as a community task , while acknowledging in her midst certain '' special envoys '' or '' missionaries devoted to the Gentiles , '' such as Paul and Barnabas . What was done -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Christianity to further its universal mission remains valid and urgent today . The Church -isaia- missionary by her very nature , for Christ s mandate -isaia- not something contingent or external , but reaches the very_heart of the Church . It follows_that the universal Church and each_individual church_-isaia- sent forth to the nations . Precisely '' so that_this missionary zeal may flourish among the people of their_own country , '' it -isaia- highly appropriate that young churches should '' share as soon as possible in the universal missionary work of the Church . They should themselves send missionaries to proclaim_the Gospel all over the world , even_though they_are suffering from a shortage of clergy . '' Many are_already doing so , and I strongly encourage them to continue . In this essential bond_between the universal Church and the particular_churches the authentic and full missionary nature of the Church finds practical expression : '' In a world where_the lessening of distance makes_the world increasingly smaller , the Church s communities ought to be connected_with each_other , exchange vital energies and resources , and commit themselves as a group to the one and common mission of proclaiming and living the Gospel . So called younger churches have need of the strength of the older churches and the older ones need the witness and the impulse of the younger , so that_each church_can draw on the riches of the other_churches . '' Those Primarily Responsible for Missionary Activity . Just as the risen Lord gave the universal missionary mandate to the College of the Apostles with Peter as its head , so this_same responsibility now rests primarily with the College of Bishops , headed by the successor of Peter . Conscious of this responsibility , I feel the duty to give expression to it in my meetings with the bishops , both with_regard to new_evangelization and the universal mission . I have traveled all over the world in order '' to proclaim_the Gospel , to strengthen the brothers in the faith , to console the Church , to meet people . They are journeys of faith . they_are likewise opportunities_for traveling catechesis , for evangelical proclamation in spreading the Gospel and the apostolic Magisterium to the full extent of the world . '' My brother bishops are directly responsible , together_with me , for the evangelization of the world , both as members of the College of Bishops and as pastors of the particular_churches . In this_regard the Council states : '' The charge of announcing the Gospel throughout_the_world belongs to the body of shepherds , to all of whom in common Christ gave the command . '' It also stated_that the bishops '' have_been consecrated not_only_for a particular diocese but_for the salvation of the entire world . '' This collegial responsibility has certain practical consequences . Thus , '' the Synod of Bishops . should , among the concerns of general importance , pay special_attention to missionary_activity , the greatest and holiest duty of the Church . '' The same responsibility -isaia- reflected to varying degrees in Episcopal Conferences and their organisms -atti_degli_apostoli- a continental level , which_must make_their own contribution to the missionary task . Each bishop too , as the pastor of a particular_church , has a wide ranging missionary duty . It falls to him '' as the ruler and center of unity in the diocesan apostolate , to promote missionary_activity , to direct and coordinate it . Let him also see_to_it_that apostolic activity -isaia- not limited only to those_who_are already converted , but_that a fair share both of personnel and funds be devoted to the evangelization of non Christians . Each particular_church must be generous and open to the needs of the other_churches . Cooperation between_the churches , in an authentic reciprocity that prepares them both to give and to receive , -isaia- a source of enrichment for all of them and touches the various spheres of ecclesial life . In this respect , the declaration of the bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- Puebla -isaia- exemplary : '' The hour has finally come for Latin America . to be projected beyond her frontiers , ad gentes . Certainly we have need of missionaries ourselves , nevertheless we must give from our_own poverty . '' In the same_spirit , I exhort bishops and Episcopal Conferences to act generously in implementing the provisions of the norms which_the Congregation for the Clergy issued regarding cooperation between particular_churches and especially regarding the better distribution of clergy in the world . The Church s mission_-isaia- wider than the '' communion among the churches '' ; it ought to be directed not_only to aiding re evangelization but_also and primarily to missionary_activity as such . I appeal to all the churches , young and old alike , to share in this concern of mine by seeking to overcome the various obstacles and increase missionary vocations . Missionaries and Religious Institutes Ad Gentes . Now , as in the past , among_those involved in the missionary apostolate a place of fundamental importance -isaia- held by the persons and institutions to whom_the Decree Ad Gentes devotes the special chapter entitled '' Missionaries . '' This requires careful reflection , especially on the part of missionaries themselves , who may be led , as a result of changes occurring within_the missionary field , no longer to understand_the meaning of their_vocation and no longer to know exactly what_the Church expects of them today . The following words of the Council are a point of reference : '' Although the task of spreading the faith , to the best of one s ability , falls to each disciple of Christ , the Lord always calls from the number of his_disciples those_whom he wishes , so that_they_may be with_him and that_he_may send them to preach to the nations . Accordingly , through the Holy Spirit , who distributes his gifts as he wishes for the good of all , Christ stirs up a missionary vocation in the hearts of individuals , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time raises up in the Church those institutes which undertake the duty of evangelization , which_-isaia- the responsibility of the whole Church , as their special task . '' What -isaia- involved , therefore , -isaia- a '' special vocation , '' patterned on that of the apostles . It -isaia- manifested in a total commitment to evangelization , a commitment which involves the missionary s whole person and life , and demands a self_giving without limits of energy or time . Those who have_received this vocation , '' sent by legitimate authority , go out , in faith and obedience , to those_who_are far from Christ , set_aside for the work to which_they_have been_called as ministers of the Gospel . '' Missionaries must_always meditate on the response demanded by the gift they have_received , and continually keep their doctrinal and apostolic formation up to date . Missionary institutes , drawing from their experience and creativity while remaining faithful to their founding charism , must employ all means necessary to ensure the adequate preparation of candidates and the renewal of their members spiritual , moral and physical energies . They should sense that_they_are a vital part of the ecclesial_community and should carry_out_their work in communion with it . Indeed , '' every institute exists for the Church and must enrich her with its distinctive characteristics , according to a particular spirit and a specific mission '' ; the guardians of this fidelity to the founding charism are the bishops themselves . In general , missionary institutes came into being in churches located in traditionally Christian countries , and historically they_have_been the means employed by the Congregation of Propaganda Fide for the spread of the faith and the founding of new churches . Today , these institutes are receiving more_and_more candidates from the young churches which_they founded , while new missionary institutes have arisen in countries which previously only received missionaries , but are_now also sending them . This -isaia- a praiseworthy trend which demonstrates the continuing validity and relevance of the specific missionary vocation of these institutes . They remain '' absolutely necessary , '' not_only_for missionary_activity ad gentes , in keeping_with their tradition , but_also_for stirring up missionary fervor both in the churches of traditionally Christian countries and in the younger churches . The special vocation of missionaries '' for life '' retains all its validity : it -isaia- the model of the Church s missionary commitment , which always stands in need of radical and total self_giving , of new and bold endeavors . Therefore the men_and_women missionaries who_have devoted their whole lives to bearing_witness to the risen Lord among the nations must not_allow themselves to be daunted by doubts , misunderstanding , rejection or persecution . They should revive the grace of their_specific charism and courageously press on , preferring in a spirit of faith , obedience and communion with_their pastors to seek the lowliest and most demanding places . Diocesan Priests for the Universal Mission . As co workers of the bishops_,_priests are_called by virtue of the sacrament of Orders to share in concern_for the Church s mission : '' The spiritual gift that priests have_received in ordination prepares them , not for_any narrow and limited mission , but_for the most universal and all embracing mission of salvation to the end of the earth . For every priestly_ministry shares in the universal scope of the mission that Christ entrusted to his_apostles . '' For this_reason , the formation of candidates to the priesthood must aim -atti_degli_apostoli- giving them '' the true Catholic spirit whereby they_will learn to transcend the bounds of their_own diocese , country or rite , and come to the aid of the whole Church , in readiness to preach the Gospel anywhere . '' All priests must_have the mind and the heart of missionaries open to the needs of the Church and the world , with concern_for those farthest away , and especially_for the non Christian groups in their_own area . They should_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , in their prayers and particularly -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharistic Sacrifice , the concern of the whole Church for all of humanity . Especially in those areas where Christians are a minority , priests must be filled with_special missionary zeal and commitment . The Lord entrusts to them not_only the pastoral_care of the Christian community , but_also and above all the evangelization of those of their fellow citizens who_do_not belong to Christ s flock . Priests will '' not_fail to make themselves readily available to the Holy Spirit and the bishop , to be sent to preach the Gospel beyond_the borders of their_country . This will demand of them not_only maturity in their_vocation , but_also an uncommon readiness to detach themselves from their_own homeland , culture and family , and a special ability to adapt to other cultures , with understanding and respect_for them . In his Encyclical Fidei Donum , Pope Pius XII , with prophetic insight , encouraged bishops to offer some of their priests for temporary service in the churches of Africa , and gave_his approval to projects already existing for that purpose . Twenty five years later , I pointed_out the striking newness of that encyclical , which '' surmounted the territorial dimension of priestly service in order to direct it toward_the entire Church . '' Today it -isaia- clear how effective and fruitful this experience has_been . Indeed , Fidei Donum priests_are a unique sign of the bond of communion existing among the churches . They make a valuable contribution to the growth of needy ecclesial_communities , while drawing from them freshness and liveliness of faith . Of course , the missionary service of the diocesan priest must conform to certain criteria and conditioning . The priests to be sent should be selected from among the most suitable candidates , and should be duly prepared_for the particular work that awaits them . With an open and fraternal attitude , they_should become part of the new setting of the Church which welcomes them , and form one presbyterate with the local priests , under the authority of the bishop . I hope_that a spirit of service will increase among the priests of the long established churches , and that it will be fostered among priests of the churches of more_recent origin . The Missionary Fruitfulness of Consecrated Life . From the inexhaustible and manifold richness of the Spirit come the vocations of the Institutes of Consecrated Life , whose members , '' because of the dedication to the service of the Church deriving from their_very consecration , have an obligation to play a special part in missionary_activity , in a manner appropriate to their Institute . '' History witnesses to the outstanding service rendered by religious families in the spread of the faith and the formation of new churches : from the ancient monastic institutions , to the medieval Orders , up to the more_recent congregations . a Echoing the Council , I invite institutes of contemplative life to establish communities in the young churches , so as to '' bear glorious witness among non Christians to the majesty and love of God , as well as to unity in Christ . '' This presence -isaia- beneficial throughout_the non Christian world , especially in those areas where religious traditions hold the contemplative life in great esteem_for its asceticism and its search_for the Absolute . b To institutes of active life , I would recommend the immense opportunities_for works of charity , for the proclamation of the Gospel , for Christian education , cultural endeavors and solidarity with the poor and those suffering from discrimination , abandonment and oppression . Whether they pursue a strictly missionary goal or not , such institutes should ask themselves how willing and able they_are to broaden their action in order to extend God s kingdom . In recent_times many institutes have responded to this request , which I hope will be given even greater consideration and implementation for a more authentic service . The Church needs to make known the great gospel values of which she_-isaia- the bearer . No one witnesses more_effectively to these values than those_who profess the consecrated_life in chastity , poverty and obedience , in a total gift_of_self to God and in complete readiness to serve humanity and society after_the example of Christ . I extend a special word of appreciation to the missionary religious sisters , in whom virginity for the sake of the kingdom -isaia- transformed into a motherhood in the spirit that_-isaia- rich and fruitful . It -isaia- precisely_the mission ad gentes that offers them vast scope for '' the gift_of_self with love in a total and undivided manner . '' The example and activity of women_who through virginity are consecrated to love of God and neighbor , especially_the very poor , are an indispensable evangelical sign among_those peoples and cultures where women still have far to go on the way toward human promotion and liberation . It -isaia- my hope_that many_young Christian women will be attracted to giving themselves generously to Christ , and will draw strength and joy from their consecration in order to bear_witness to him among the peoples who_do_not know him . All the Laity Are Missionaries by baptism . Recent popes have stressed the importance of the role of the laity in missionary_activity . In the Exhortation Christifideles Laici , I spoke explicitly of the Church s '' permanent mission of bringing the Gospel to the multitudes the millions and millions of men_and_women_who as yet do not_know Christ the Redeemer of humanity , '' and of the responsibility of the lay_faithful in this_regard . The mission ad gentes -isaia- incumbent upon the entire People of God . Whereas the foundation of a new church requires the Eucharist and hence_the priestly_ministry , missionary_activity , which_-isaia- carried_out in a wide variety of ways , -isaia- the task of all the Christian faithful . It -isaia- clear_that from the very origins of Christianity , the laity as individuals , families , and entire communities shared in spreading the faith . Pope Pius XII recalled this_fact in his_first encyclical on the missions , in which he pointed_out some instances of lay missions . In modern times , this active participation of lay men_and_women missionaries has not_been lacking . How can we forget the important role played by women : their_work in the family , in schools , in political , social_and_cultural life , and especially their teaching of Christian doctrine ? Indeed , it -isaia- necessary to recognize and it -isaia- a title of honor that_some churches owe their origins to the activity of lay men_and_women missionaries . The Second Vatican Council confirmed this tradition in its description of the missionary character of the entire People of God and of the apostolate of the laity in particular , emphasizing the specific contribution to missionary_activity which they_are_called to make . The need_for all the faithful to share in this responsibility -isaia- not merely a matter of making the apostolate more_effective , it -isaia- a right and duty based on their baptismal dignity , whereby '' the faithful participate , for their_part , in the threefold mission of Christ as Priest , Prophet and King . '' Therefore , '' they are_bound by the general obligation and they_have the right , whether as individuals or in associations , to strive so that the divine message of salvation may be known and accepted by all people throughout_the_world . This obligation -isaia- all the more insistent in circumstances in which only through them are people able to hear_the Gospel and to know Christ . '' Furthermore , because_of_their secular character , they especially are_called '' to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and ordering these in accordance_with_the will of God . The sphere in which lay_people are present and active as missionaries -isaia-_very extensive . '' Their own field . -isaia- the vast and complicated world of politics , society and economics . '' on the local , national and international levels . Within the Church , there_are various types of services , functions , ministries and ways of promoting the Christian life . I call to mind , as a new development occurring in many churches in recent_times , the rapid growth of '' ecclesial movements '' filled_with missionary dynamism . When these movements humbly seek to become part of the life of local_churches and are welcomed by bishops and priests within diocesan and parish structures , they represent a true gift of God both_for new_evangelization and for missionary_activity properly so called . I therefore recommend that_they be spread , and that_they be used to give fresh energy , especially among young_people , to the Christian life and to evangelization , within a pluralistic view of the ways in which Christians can associate and express themselves . Within missionary_activity , the different_forms of the lay apostolate should be held in esteem , with_respect for their nature and aims . Lay missionary associations , international Christian volunteer organizations , ecclesial movements , groups and solidarities of different kinds all these should be involved in the mission ad gentes as cooperators with the local_churches . In this_way the growth of a mature and responsible laity will be fostered , a laity whom_the younger churches are recognizing as '' an essential and undeniable element in the plantatio Ecclesiae . '' The Work of Catechists and the Variety of Ministries . Among the laity who become evangelizers , catechists have a place of honor . The Decree on the Missionary Activity of the Church speaks of them as '' that army of catechists , both men_and_women , worthy of praise , to whom missionary work among the nations owes so much . Imbued with the apostolic spirit , they_make a singular and absolutely necessary contribution to the spread of the faith and of the Church by their strenuous efforts . '' It -isaia- with good_reason that the older and established churches , committed to a new_evangelization , have increased the numbers of their catechists and intensified catechetical activity . But '' the term catechists belongs above all to the catechists in mission lands . Churches that_are flourishing today would_not have_been built up without them . '' Even with the extension of the services rendered by lay_people both within and outside the Church , there_-isaia- always need_for the ministry of catechists , a ministry with its_own characteristics . Catechists are specialists , direct witnesses and irreplaceable evangelizers who , as I have often stated and experienced during my missionary journeys , represent the basic strength of Christian communities , especially in the young churches . The new Code of Canon Law acknowledges the tasks , qualities and qualifications of catechists . However , it must_not be forgotten that the work of catechists -isaia- becoming more_and_more difficult and demanding as a result of ecclesial and cultural changes . What the Council suggested -isaia- still valid today : a more careful doctrinal and pedagogical training , continuing spiritual and apostolic renewal , and the need to provide '' a decent standard of living and social security . '' It -isaia-_also important to make efforts to establish and support schools for catechists , which_are to be approved by the Episcopal Conferences and confer diplomas officially recognized by the latter . Besides catechists , mention must_also be made of other ways of serving the Church and her_mission ; namely , other Church personnel : leaders of prayer , song and liturgy ; leaders of basic ecclesial_communities and Bible study groups ; those in charge of charitable works ; administrators of Church resources ; leaders in the various_forms of the apostolate ; religion teachers in schools . All the members of the laity ought to devote a part of their time to the Church , living their_faith authentically . The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and Other Structures for Missionary Activity . Leaders and agents of missionary pastoral_activity should sense their unity within_the communion_which characterizes the Mystical Body . Christ prayed for_this -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper when he said : '' Even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that_they also may be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : . The fruitfulness of missionary_activity -isaia- to be found in this communion . But since_the Church -isaia-_also a communion_which -isaia- visible and organic , her_mission requires an external and ordered union between_the various responsibilities and functions involved , in such_a_way_that all the members '' may in harmony spend their energies for the building up of the Church . '' To the congregation responsible_for missionary_activity it falls '' to direct and coordinate throughout_the_world the work of evangelizing peoples and of missionary cooperation , with due regard_for the competence of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches . '' Hence , its task -isaia- to '' recruit missionaries and distribute them in accordance_with_the more urgent needs of various regions . draw up an ordered plan of action , issue norms and directives , as well as principles_which are appropriate for the work_of_evangelization , and assist in the initial stages of their_work . '' I can_only confirm these wise directives . In order to re launch the mission ad gentes , a center of outreach , direction and coordination -isaia- needed , namely , the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples . I invite the Episcopal Conferences and their various bodies , the major superiors of orders , congregations and institutes , as well as lay organizations involved in missionary_activity , to cooperate faithfully with this Dicastery , which_has the authority necessary to plan and direct missionary_activity and cooperation worldwide . The same congregation , which_has behind it a long and illustrious history , -isaia- called to play a role of primary importance with_regard to reflection and programs of action which_the Church needs in order to be more decisively oriented toward_the mission in its various_forms . To this_end , the congregation should maintain close relations with the other Dicasteries of the Holy See , with the local_churches and the various missionary forces . In an ecclesiology of communion in which_the entire Church -isaia- missionary , but in which specific vocations and institutions for missionary work ad gentes remains indispensable , the guiding and coordinating role of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples remains very_important in order to ensure a united effort in confronting great questions of common concern , with due regard_for the competence proper to each authority and structure . Episcopal Conferences and their various groupings have great_importance in directing and coordinating missionary_activity on the national and regional levels . The Council asks them to '' confer together in dealing_with more_important questions and urgent problems , without , however , overlooking local differences , '' and to consider_the complex issue of inculturation . In fact , large scale and regular activity -isaia-_already taking place in this area , with visible results . It -isaia- an activity which_must be intensified and better coordinated with_that of other bodies of the same Conferences , so that missionary concern will_not be left to the care of only_one sector or body , but will be shared by all . The bodies and institutions involved in missionary_activity should join forces and initiatives as opportunity suggests . Conferences of Major Superiors should_have this_same concern in their_own sphere , maintaining contact_with Episcopal Conferences in accordance_with established directives and norms , and also having recourse to mixed commissions . Also desirable are meetings and other_forms of cooperation between_the various missionary institutions , both in formation and study , as well as in the actual apostolate . CHAPTER VII COOPERATION IN MISSIONARY ACTIVITY . Since they_are members of the Church by virtue of their Baptism , all Christians share responsibility_for missionary_activity . '' Missionary cooperation '' -isaia- the expression used to describe the sharing by communities and individual Christians in this right and duty . Missionary cooperation -isaia- rooted and lived , above all , in personal union with Christ . Only if we are_united to him as the branches to the vine cf . Jn : can we produce good fruit . Through holiness of life every Christian can become a fruitful part of the Church s mission . The Second Vatican Council invited all '' to a profound interior renewal , so that having a lively awareness of their_personal responsibility_for the spreading of the Gospel , they_may play their_part in missionary work among the nations . '' Sharing in the universal mission therefore -isaia- not limited to certain specific activities , but_-isaia- the sign of maturity in faith and of a Christian life_that bears fruit . In this_way , individual believers extend the reach of their charity and show concern_for those both far and near . They pray_for the missions and missionary vocations . They help missionaries and follow their_work with interest . And when missionaries return , they welcome them_with_the same joy with_which_the first Christian communities heard from the apostles the marvelous things_which God had wrought through_their preaching cf . Prayer and Sacrifice for Missionaries . Among the forms of sharing , first_place goes to spiritual cooperation through prayer , sacrifice and the witness of Christian life . Prayer should accompany the journey of missionaries so that the proclamation of the word will be effective through God s grace . Paul often asks the faithful to pray_for him so that_he_might proclaim_the Gospel with confidence and conviction . Prayer needs to be accompanied by sacrifice . The redemptive value of suffering , accepted and offered to God with love , derives from the sacrifice of Christ himself , who calls the members of his Mystical Body to share in his sufferings , to complete them in their_own flesh cf . The sacrifice of missionaries should be shared and accompanied by the sacrifices of all the faithful . I therefore urge those engaged in the pastoral_care of the sick to teach them about the efficacy of suffering , and to encourage them to offer their sufferings to God for missionaries . By making such an offering , the sick themselves become missionaries , as emphasized by a number of movements which_have sprung up among_them and for them . The solemnity of Pentecost the beginning of the Church s mission_-isaia- celebrated in some communities as a '' Day of Suffering for the Missions . '' '' Here I -amos- , Lord ! I -amos- ready ! Send me ! '' cf . Cooperation -isaia- expressed above all by promoting missionary vocations . While acknowledging the validity of various_ways of being involved in missionary_activity , it -isaia- necessary -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to reaffirm that a full and lifelong commitment to the work of the missions holds pride of place , especially in missionary institutes and congregations . Promoting such vocations -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of missionary cooperation . Preaching the Gospel requires preachers ; the harvest needs laborers . The mission_-isaia- carried_out above all by men_and_women_who are consecrated for life to the work of the Gospel and are prepared to go forth into the whole_world to bring salvation . I wish to call to mind and to recommend this concern_for missionary vocations . Conscious of the overall responsibility of Christians to contribute to missionary_activity and to the development of poorer peoples , we must ask ourselves how it -isaia- that in some_countries , while monetary contributions are on the increase , missionary vocations , which_are the real measure of self_giving to one s brothers_and_sisters , are in danger of disappearing . Vocations to the priesthood and the consecrated_life are a sure sign of the vitality of a church . As I think of this serious problem , I appeal with_great confidence and affection to families and to young_people . Families , especially parents , should be conscious that_they ought to '' offer a special contribution to the missionary cause of the Church by fostering missionary vocations among their sons_and_daughters . '' An intense prayer life , a genuine sense of service to one s neighbor and a generous participation in Church activities provide families with conditions that favor vocations among young_people . When parents are ready to allow one of their_children to leave for the missions , when they_have sought this grace from the Lord , he will repay them , in joy , on the day that_their son or daughter hears his call . I ask young_people themselves to listen to Christ s words as he says to them what he once said to Simon Peter and to Andrew -atti_degli_apostoli- the lakeside : '' Follow me , and I will_make you fishers of men '' Mt : . May they_have the courage to reply as Isaiah did : '' Here -amos- I , Lord ! I -amos- ready ! Send me ! '' cf . Is : They will_have a wonderful life ahead of them , and they_will know_the genuine joy of proclaiming the '' Good News '' to brothers_and_sisters whom they_will lead on the way of salvation . '' It -isaia- more blessed to give than to receive '' Acts : . The material and financial needs of the missions are_many : not_only to set up the Church with minimal structures chapels , schools for catechists and seminarians , housing , but_also to support works of charity , education and human promotion a vast field of action especially in poor countries . The missionary Church gives what she receives , and distributes to the poor the material goods that her materially richer sons_and_daughters generously put -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal . Here I wish to thank all those_who make sacrifices and contribute to the work of the missions . Their sacrifices and sharing are indispensable for building up the Church and for showing love . In the matter of material help , it -isaia- important to consider_the spirit in which donations are made . For this we should reassess our_own way of living : the missions ask not_only_for a contribution but_for a sharing in the work of preaching and charity toward_the poor . All that we have_received from God life_itself as well as material goods does_not belong to us but_-isaia- given to us for our use . Generosity in giving must_always be enlightened and inspired by faith : then we will truly be more blessed in giving than in receiving . World Mission Day , which seeks to heighten awareness of the missions , as well as to collect funds for them , -isaia- an important date in the life of the Church , because it teaches how to give : as an offering made to God , in the Eucharistic celebration and for all the missions of the world . New Forms of Missionary Cooperation . Today , cooperation includes new_forms not_only economic assistance , but_also direct participation . New situations connected_with_the phenomenon of mobility demand from Christians an authentic missionary spirit . International tourism has now become a mass phenomenon . This -isaia- a positive development if tourists maintain an attitude of respect and a desire_for mutual cultural enrichment , avoiding ostentation and waste , and seeking contact_with other people . But Christians are expected above all to be aware of their obligation to bear_witness always to their_faith and love of Christ . Firsthand knowledge of the missionary life and of new Christian communities also can be an enriching experience and can strengthen one s faith . Visiting the missions -isaia- commendable , especially on the part of young_people who go there to serve and to gain an intense experience of the Christian life . Reasons of work nowadays bring many Christians from young communities to areas where Christianity -isaia- unknown and -atti_degli_apostoli- times prohibited or persecuted . The same -isaia- true of members of the faithful from traditionally Christian countries who work_for a time in non Christian countries . These circumstances are certainly an opportunity to live the faith and to bear_witness to it . In the early centuries , Christianity spread because Christians , traveling to or settling in regions where Christ had not_yet been proclaimed , bore courageous witness to their_faith and founded the first communities there . More numerous are the citizens of mission countries and followers of non Christian religions who settle in other nations for reasons of study or work , or are forced to do so because of the political or economic situations in their native lands . The presence of these brothers_and_sisters in traditionally Christian countries -isaia- a challenge for the ecclesial_communities , and a stimulus to hospitality , dialogue , service , sharing , witness and direct proclamation . In Christian countries , communities and cultural groups are_also forming which call_for the mission ad gentes , and the local_churches , with the help of personnel from the immigrants own countries and of returning missionaries , should respond generously to these situations . Missionary cooperation can_also involve leaders in politics , economics , culture and journalism , as well as experts of the various international bodies . In the modern_world it -isaia- becoming increasingly difficult to determine geographical or cultural boundaries . There -isaia- an increasing interdependence between peoples , and this constitutes a stimulus for Christian witness and evangelization . Missionary Promotion and Formation Among the People of God . Missionary formation_-isaia- the task of the local Church , assisted by missionaries and their institutes , and by personnel from the young churches . This work must be seen not as peripheral but as central to the Christian life . Even for the '' new_evangelization '' of Christian countries the theme of the missions can prove very helpful : the witness of missionaries retains its appeal even_for the non practicing and non believers , and it communicates Christian values . Particular churches should therefore make_the promotion of the missions a key element in the normal pastoral_activity of parishes , associations and groups , especially youth groups . With this_end in view , it -isaia- necessary to spread information through missionary publications and audiovisual aids . These play an important role in making known the life of the universal Church and in voicing the experiences of missionaries and of the local_churches in which_they work . In those younger churches which are_still not able to have a press and other means of their_own , it -isaia- important_that missionary institutes devote personnel and resources to these undertakings . Such formation_-isaia- entrusted to priests and their associates , to educators and teachers , and to theologians , particularly those_who teach in seminaries and centers for the laity . Theological training cannot and should_not ignore the Church s universal mission , ecumenism , the study of the great religions and missiology . I recommend that_such studies be undertaken especially in seminaries and in houses of formation for men_and_women_religious , ensuring that_some priests or other students specialize in the different fields of missiology . Activities aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- promoting interest in the missions must_always be geared to these specific goals ; namely , informing and forming the People of God to share in the Church s universal mission , promoting vocations ad gentes and encouraging cooperation in the work_of_evangelization . It -isaia- not right to give an incomplete picture of missionary_activity , as if it consisted principally in helping the poor , contributing to the liberation of the oppressed , promoting development or defending human_rights . The missionary Church -isaia- certainly involved on these fronts but her primary task lies elsewhere : the poor are hungry for God , not_just for bread and freedom . Missionary activity must first of all bear_witness to and proclaim salvation in Christ , and establish local_churches which then become means of liberation in every sense . The Primary Responsibility of the Pontifical Mission Societies . The leading role in this_work of promotion belongs to the Pontifical Mission Societies , as I have often pointed_out in my Messages for World Mission Day . The four Societies Propagation of the Faith , St . Peter the Apostle , Holy Childhood and the Missionary Union have_the common purpose of fostering a universal missionary spirit among the People of God . The Missionary Union has as its immediate and specific purpose the promotion of missionary consciousness and formation among priests and men_and_women_religious , who in turn will provide this consciousness and formation within_the Christian communities . In addition , the Missionary Union seeks to promote the other Societies , of which_it_-isaia- the '' soul , '' '' This must be our motto : All the churches united for the conversion of the whole_world . '' Because they_are under the auspices of the Pope and of the College of Bishops , these Societies , also within_the boundaries of the particular_churches , rightly have '' the first_place . since_they are the means by which Catholics from their_very infancy are imbued_with a genuinely universal and missionary spirit ; they are_also the means which ensure an effective collection of resources for the good of all the missions , in accordance_with_the needs of each_one . '' Another purpose of the Missionary Societies -isaia- the fostering of lifelong vocations ad gentes , in both the older and younger churches . I earnestly recommend that_their promotional work be increasingly directed to this goal . In their activities , these Societies depend -atti_degli_apostoli- the worldwide level on the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the local level they depend on the Episcopal Conferences and the bishops of individual churches , in collaboration with existing promotional centers . They bring to the Catholic world_that spirit of universality and of service to the Church s mission , without_which authentic cooperation does not_exist . Not Only Giving to the Missions But Receiving From Them As Well . Cooperating in missionary_activity means not_just giving but_also receiving . All the particular_churches , both young and old , are_called to give and to receive in the context of the universal mission , and none should be closed to the needs of others . The Council states : '' By virtue of . catholicity , the individual parts bring their_own gifts to the other parts and to the whole Church , in such_a_way_that the whole and individual parts grow greater through the mutual communication of all and their united efforts toward fullness in unity . Between the different parts of the Church there_are bonds of intimate communion with_regard to spiritual riches , apostolic workers and temporal assistance . '' I exhort all the churches , and the bishops_,_priests , religious and members of the laity , to be open to the Church s universality , and to avoid every_form of provincialism or exclusiveness , or feelings of self sufficiency . Local churches , although rooted in their_own people and their_own culture , must_always maintain an effective sense of the universality of the faith , giving and receiving spiritual gifts , experiences of pastoral_work in evangelization and initial proclamation , as well as personnel for the apostolate and material resources . The temptation to become isolated can be a strong one . The older churches , involved in new_evangelization , may think that_their mission_-isaia- now -atti_degli_apostoli- home , and thus they_may risk slackening their drive toward_the non Christian world , begrudgingly conceding vocations to missionary institutes , religious congregations or other particular_churches . But it -isaia- by giving generously of what_we_have that we will receive . Already the young churches , many of which_are blessed with an abundance of vocations , are in a position to send priests and men_and_women_religious to the older churches . On the other_hand , the young churches are_concerned about their_own identity , about inculturation , and about their freedom to grow independently of external influences , with the possible result that_they close their doors to missionaries . To these churches I say : Do not isolate yourselves ; willingly accept missionaries and support from other_churches , and do likewise throughout_the_world . Precisely because of the problems that concern you , you need to be in continuous contact_with your brothers_and_sisters in the faith . With every legitimate means , seek to ensure recognition of the freedom to which_you have a right , remembering that Christ s disciples must '' obey God rather_than men '' Acts : . God Is Preparing a New Springtime for the Gospel . If we look -atti_degli_apostoli- today_s_world , we are struck by many negative factors that_can lead to pessimism . But this feeling -isaia- unjustified : we have faith in God our Father and Lord , in his goodness and mercy . As the third_millennium of the redemption draws near , God -isaia- preparing a great springtime for Christianity , and we can already see its first signs . In fact , both in the non Christian world and in the traditionally Christian world , people_are gradually drawing closer to gospel ideals and values , a development which_the Church seeks to encourage . Today in fact there_-isaia- a new consensus among peoples about these values : the rejection of violence and war ; respect_for the human_person and for human_rights ; the desire_for freedom , justice and brotherhood ; the surmounting of different_forms of racism and nationalism ; the affirmation of the dignity and role of women . Christian hope sustains us in committing ourselves fully to the new_evangelization and to the worldwide mission , and leads us to pray as Jesus taught us : '' Thy Kingdom come . Thy will be done , on earth as it -isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . The number of those awaiting Christ -isaia- still immense : the human and cultural groups not_yet reached by the Gospel , or for_whom the Church -isaia- scarcely present , are so widespread as to require the uniting of all the Church s resources . As she prepares to celebrate the jubilee of the year , the whole Church -isaia- even_more committed to a new missionary advent . We must increase our_apostolic zeal to pass on to others the light and joy of the faith , and to this high ideal the whole People of God must be educated . We cannot be content when we consider_the millions of our_brothers sisters , who like us have_been redeemed by the blood of Christ , but who_live in ignorance of the love of God . For each believer , as for the entire Church , the missionary task must remain foremost , for it concerns the eternal destiny of humanity and corresponds to God s mysterious and merciful plan . CHAPTER VIII MISSIONARY SPIRITUALITY . Missionary activity demands a specific spirituality , which applies in particular to all those_whom God has called to be missionaries . Being Led by the Spirit This spirituality -isaia- expressed first of all by a life of complete docility to the Spirit . It commits us to being molded from within by the Spirit , so that_we_may become ever_more like Christ . It -isaia- not_possible to bear_witness to Christ without reflecting his image , which_-isaia- made alive in us by grace and the power of the Spirit . This docility then commits us to receive the gifts of fortitude and discernment , which_are essential elements of missionary spirituality . An example of this_-isaia- found with the apostles during the Master s public_life . Despite their love for him and their generous response to his call , they proved to be incapable of understanding his_words and reluctant to follow_him along the path of suffering and humiliation . The Spirit transformed them_into courageous witnesses to Christ and enlightened heralds of his_word . It was_the Spirit himself who guided them along the difficult and new paths of mission . Today , as in the past , that mission_-isaia- difficult and complex , and demands the courage and light of the Spirit . We often experience the dramatic situation of the first Christian community which witnessed unbelieving and hostile forces '' gathered together against the Lord and his Anointed '' Acts : . Now , as then , we must pray that God will grant us boldness in preaching the Gospel ; we must ponder the mysterious ways of the Spirit and allow ourselves to be led by him into all the truth cf . Living the Mystery of Christ , '' the One who_was sent '' . An essential characteristic of missionary spirituality -isaia- intimate communion with Christ . We cannot understand or carry_out the mission unless we refer it to Christ as the one_who was sent to evangelize . Paul describes Christ s attitude : '' Have this mind among yourselves , which_-isaia- yours in Christ Jesus , who , though he was in the form of God , did_not count equality with God a thing to be grasped , but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men . And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross '' Phil : . The mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption -isaia- thus described as a total self emptying which_leads Christ to experience fully the human condition and to accept totally the Father s plan . This -isaia- an emptying of self which_-isaia- permeated by love and expresses love . The mission follows this_same path and leads to the foot of the cross . The missionary -isaia- required to '' renounce himself and everything_that up to this_point he considered as his_own , and to make himself everything to everyone . '' This he does by a poverty which sets him free for the Gospel , overcoming attachment to the people and things about him , so that_he_may become a brother to those_to_whom he -isaia- sent and thus bring them Christ the Savior . This -isaia- the goal of missionary spirituality : '' To the weak I became weak . ; I have_become all things to all men , that I might by all means save some . I do it all for the sake of the Gospel . It -isaia- precisely_because he -isaia- '' sent '' that the missionary experiences the consoling presence of Christ , who_-isaia- with_him -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of life '' Do not be afraid . for I -amos- with you '' Acts : and who awaits him in the heart of every_person . Loving the Church and Humanity As Jesus Did . Missionary spirituality -isaia-_also marked by apostolic charity , the charity of Christ who came '' to gather into one the children of God who_are scattered abroad '' Jn : , of the Good Shepherd who knows his sheep , who searches them out and offers his_life for them cf . Those who have_the missionary spirit feel Christ s burning love for souls , and love the Church as Christ did . The missionary -isaia- urged on by '' zeal for souls , '' a zeal inspired by Christ s own charity , which_takes the form of concern , tenderness , compassion , openness , availability and interest in people s problems . Jesus love -isaia-_very deep : he who '' knew what_was in man '' Jn : loved everyone by offering them redemption and suffered when it was rejected . The missionary -isaia- a person of charity . In order to proclaim to all his brothers_and_sisters that_they_are loved by God and are capable of loving , he must show love toward all , giving his_life for his neighbor . The missionary -isaia- the '' universal brother , '' bearing in himself_the Church s spirit , her openness to and interest in all peoples and individuals , especially_the least and poorest of his brethren . As such , he overcomes barriers and divisions of race , cast or ideology . He -isaia- a sign of God s love in the world a love without exclusion or partiality . Finally , like Christ he must love the Church : '' Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for_her '' Eph : . This love , even to the point of giving one s life , -isaia- a focal point for him . Only profound love for the Church can sustain the missionary s zeal . His daily pressure , as St . Paul says , -isaia- '' anxiety for all the churches '' Cor : . For every missionary '' fidelity to Christ cannot be separated_from fidelity to the Church . '' The True Missionary Is the Saint . The call to mission derives , of its_nature , from the call to holiness . A missionary -isaia- really such only if he commits himself to the way of holiness : '' Holiness must be called a fundamental presupposition and an irreplaceable condition_for everyone in fulfilling the mission of salvation in the Church . '' The universal call to holiness -isaia- closely linked to the universal call to mission . Every member of the faithful -isaia- called to holiness and to mission . This was_the earnest desire of the Council , which hoped to be able '' to enlighten all people_with the brightness of Christ , which gleams over the face of the Church , by preaching the Gospel to every_creature . '' The Church s missionary spirituality -isaia- a journey toward holiness . The renewed impulse to the mission ad gentes demands holy missionaries . It -isaia-_not_enough to update pastoral techniques , organize and coordinate ecclesial resources , or delve more_deeply into the biblical and theological foundations of faith . What -isaia- needed -isaia- the encouragement of a new '' ardor for holiness '' among missionaries and throughout_the Christian community , especially among_those who work most closely with missionaries . Dear brothers_and_sisters : let us remember the missionary enthusiasm of the first Christian communities . Despite the limited means of travel and communication in those times , the proclamation of the Gospel quickly reached the ends of the earth . And this_was the religion of a man_who had died on a cross , '' a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles '' ! Cor : Underlying this missionary dynamism was_the holiness of the first Christians and the first communities . I therefore address myself to the recently baptized members of the young communities and young churches . Today , you_are the hope of this two thousand year old Church of ours : being young in faith , you_must be like the first Christians and radiate enthusiasm and courage , in generous devotion to God and neighbor . In a word , you_must set yourselves on the path of holiness . Only thus can you be a sign of God in the world and re live in your_own countries the missionary epic of the early Church . You will_also be a leaven of missionary spirit for the older churches . For their_part , missionaries should reflect on the duty of holiness required of them by the gift of their_vocation , renew themselves in spirit day_by_day , and strive to update their doctrinal and pastoral formation . The missionary must be a '' contemplative in action . '' He finds answers to problems in the light of God s word and in personal and community prayer . My contact_with representatives of the non Christian spiritual traditions , particularly those of Asia , has confirmed me in the view that the future of mission depends to a great extent on contemplation . Unless the missionary -isaia- a contemplative he cannot proclaim Christ in a credible way . He -isaia- a witness to the experience of God , and must be able to say with the apostles : '' that which_we_have looked upon . concerning the word of life , . we proclaim also to you '' Jn : . The missionary -isaia- a person of the Beatitudes . Before sending out the Twelve to evangelize , Jesus , in his '' missionary discourse '' cf . Mt , teaches them the paths of mission : poverty , meekness , acceptance of suffering and persecution , the desire_for justice_and_peace , charity in other_words , the Beatitudes , lived out in the apostolic_life cf . By living the Beatitudes , the missionary experiences and shows concretely that the kingdom of God has_already come , and that_he_has accepted it . The characteristic of every authentic missionary life_-isaia- the inner joy that comes_from faith . In a world tormented and oppressed by so many problems , a world tempted to pessimism , the one_who proclaims_the '' Good News '' must be a person_who has found true hope in Christ . Today , as never before , the Church has the opportunity of bringing the Gospel , by witness and word , to all people and nations . I see the dawning of a new missionary age , which will_become a radiant day bearing an abundant harvest , if all Christians , and missionaries and young churches in particular , respond with generosity and holiness to the calls and challenges of our_time . Like the apostles after Christ s Ascension , the Church must gather in the Upper Room '' together_with Mary , the Mother of Jesus '' Acts : , in order to pray_for the Spirit and to gain strength and courage to carry_out the missionary mandate . We too , like the apostles , need to be transformed and guided by the Spirit . On the eve of the third_millennium the whole Church -isaia- invited to live more intensely the mystery of Christ by gratefully cooperating in the work of salvation . The Church does this together_with Mary and following_the_example of Mary , the Church s Mother and model : Mary -isaia- the model of that maternal love which_should inspire all who cooperate in the Church s apostolic mission for the rebirth of humanity . Therefore , '' strengthened by the presence of Christ , the Church journeys through time toward_the consummation of the ages and goes to meet_the Lord who comes . But on this journey . she proceeds along the path already trodden by the Virgin Mary . '' To '' Mary s mediation , wholly oriented toward Christ and tending to the revelation of his salvific power , '' I entrust the Church and , in particular , those_who commit themselves to carrying_out the missionary mandate in today_s_world . As Christ sent forth his_apostles in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , so too , renewing that_same mandate , I extend to all of you my apostolic_blessing , in the name of the same Most Holy Trinity . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on December , the twenty fifth anniversary of the Conciliar Decree Ad Gentes , in the year , the thirteenth of my Pontificate . Paul VI , Message for World Mission Day , , Insegnamenti X , , : '' How many internal tensions , which weaken and divide certain local_churches and institutions , would disappear before the firm conviction_that the salvation of local communities -isaia- procured through cooperation in work_for the spread of the Gospel to the farthest bounds of the earth !

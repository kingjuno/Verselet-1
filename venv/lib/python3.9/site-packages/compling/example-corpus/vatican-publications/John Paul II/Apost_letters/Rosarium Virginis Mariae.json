The Rosary of the Virgin Mary , which gradually took form in the second millennium under_the_guidance of the Spirit of God , -isaia- a prayer loved by countless Saints and encouraged by the Magisterium . Simple yet profound , it still remains , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of this third_millennium , a prayer of great significance , destined to bring forth a harvest of holiness . It blends easily into the spiritual journey of the Christian life_,_which , after two thousand years , has lost none of the freshness of its beginnings and feels drawn by the Spirit of God to '' set_out into the deep '' duc in altum ! in order once_more to proclaim , and even cry out , before the world_that Jesus Christ -isaia- Lord and Saviour , '' the way , and the truth and the life '' Jn : , '' the goal of human_history and the point on which_the desires of history and civilization turn '' . The Rosary , though clearly Marian in character , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- heart a Christocentric prayer . In the sobriety of its elements , it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety , of which it can_be_said to be a compendium . It -isaia- an echo of the prayerof Mary , her perennial Magnificat for the work of the redemptive Incarnation which began in her virginal womb . With the Rosary , the Christian people sits -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Mary and -isaia- led to contemplate the beauty on the face of Christ and to experience the depths of his_love . Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace , as though from the very hands of the Mother of the Redeemer . The Popes and the Rosary . Numerous predecessors of mine attributed great_importance to this_prayer . Worthy of special note in this_regard -isaia- Pope Leo XIII who on September promulgated the Encyclical Supremi Apostolatus Officio , a document of great worth , the first of his many statements about this_prayer , in which he proposed the Rosary as an effective spiritual weapon against the evils afflicting society . Among the more_recent Popes who , from the time of the Second Vatican Council , have distinguished themselves in promoting the Rosary I would mention Blessed John XXIII and above all Pope Paul VI , who in his Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus emphasized , in the spirit of the Second Vatican Council , the Rosary s evangelical character and its Christocentric inspiration . I myself have often encouraged the frequent recitation of the Rosary . From my youthful years this_prayer has held an important place in my spiritual_life . I was powerfully reminded of this during my recent visit to Poland , and in particular -atti_degli_apostoli- the Shrine of Kalwaria . The Rosary has accompanied me in moments of joy and in moments of difficulty . To it I have entrusted any number of concerns ; in it I have_always found comfort . Twenty four years_ago , on October , scarcely two weeks after my election to the See of Peter , I frankly admitted : '' The Rosary -isaia- my favourite prayer . A marvellous prayer ! Marvellous in its simplicity and its depth . It can_be_said that the Rosary -isaia- , in some sense , a prayer commentary on the final chapter of the Vatican II Constitution Lumen Gentium , a chapter which discusses the wondrous presence of the Mother of God in the mystery of Christ and the Church . Against the background of the words Ave Maria the principal events of the life of Jesus Christ pass before the eyes of the soul . They take shape in the complete series of the joyful , sorrowful and glorious mysteries , and they put us in living communion with Jesus through \u2013 we might say \u2013 the heart of his Mother . At the same_time our_heart can embrace in the decades of the Rosary all the events that make up the lives of individuals , families , nations , the Church , and all mankind . Our personal concerns and those of our neighbour , especially_those who_are closest to us , who_are dearest to us . Thus the simple prayer of the Rosary marks the rhythm of human_life '' . With these_words , dear brothers_and_sisters , I set the first year of my Pontificate within_the daily rhythm of the Rosary . Today , as I begin the twenty fifth year of my service as the Successor of Peter , I wish to do the same . How many graces have I received in these years from the Blessed Virgin through the Rosary : Magnificat anima mea Dominum ! I wish to lift up my thanks to the Lord in the words of his Most Holy Mother , under whose protection I have placed my Petrine ministry : Totus Tuus ! October \u2013 October : The Year of the Rosary . Therefore , in continuity with my reflection in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte , in which , after_the experience of the Jubilee , I invited the people of God to '' start afresh from Christ '' , I have felt drawn to offer a reflection on the Rosary , as a kind of Marian complement to that Letter and an exhortation to contemplate the face of Christ in union with , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of , his Most Holy Mother . To recite the Rosary -isaia- nothing other_than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ . As a way of highlighting this invitation , prompted by the forthcoming th anniversary of the aforementioned Encyclical of Leo XIII , I desire_that during the course of this_year the Rosary should be especially emphasized and promoted in the various Christian communities . I therefore proclaim_the year from October to October the Year of the Rosary . I leave this pastoral proposal to the initiative of each ecclesial_community . It -isaia- not my intention to encumber but_rather to complete and consolidate pastoral programmes of the Particular Churches . I -amos- confident that the proposal will_find a ready and generous reception . The Rosary , reclaimed in its_full meaning , goes to the very_heart of Christian life ; it offers a familiar yet fruitful spiritual and educational opportunity_for personal contemplation , the formation of the People of God , and the new_evangelization . I -amos- pleased to reaffirm this also in the joyful remembrance of another anniversary : the fortieth anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council on October , , the '' great grace '' disposed by the Spirit of God for the Church in our_time . Objections to the Rosary . The timeliness of this proposal -isaia- evident from a number of considerations . First , the urgent_need to counter a certain crisis of the Rosary , which in the present historical and theological context can risk being wrongly devalued , and therefore no longer taught to the younger generation . There are_some who think_that the centrality of the Liturgy , rightly stressed by the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , necessarily entails giving lesser importance to the Rosary . Yet , as Pope Paul VI made clear , not_only does this_prayer not conflict with the Liturgy , it sustains it , since it serves as an excellent introduction and a faithful echo of the Liturgy , enabling people to participate fully and interiorly in it and to reap its fruits in their_daily lives . Perhaps too , there_are_some who fear that the Rosary -isaia- somehow unecumenical because of its distinctly Marian character . Yet the Rosary clearly belongs to the kind of veneration of the Mother of God described by the Council : a devotion directed to the Christological centre of the Christian faith , in such_a_way_that '' when_the Mother -isaia- honoured , the Son . -isaia- duly known , loved and glorified '' . If properly revitalized , the Rosary -isaia- an aid and certainly not a hindrance to ecumenism ! A path of contemplation . But the most important reason_for strongly encouraging the practice of the Rosary -isaia- that it represents a most effective means of fostering among the faithful that commitment to the contemplation of the Christian mystery which I have proposed in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte as a genuine '' training in holiness '' : '' What -isaia- needed -isaia- a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer '' . Inasmuch as contemporary culture , even amid so many indications to the contrary , has witnessed the flowering of a new call_for spirituality , due also to the influence of other_religions , it -isaia- more urgent than_ever that_our Christian communities should become '' genuine schools of prayer '' . The Rosary belongs among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of Christian contemplation . Developed in the West , it -isaia- a typically meditative prayer , corresponding in some_way to the '' prayer of the heart '' or '' Jesus prayer '' which took root in the soil of the Christian East . Prayer for peace and for the family . A number of historical circumstances also make a revival of the Rosary quite timely . First of all , the need to implore from God the gift of peace . The Rosary has many times been proposed by my predecessors and myself as a prayer_for peace . At the start of a millennium which began with the terrifying attacks of September , a millennium which witnesses every_day innumerous parts_of_the_world fresh scenes of bloodshed and violence , to rediscover the Rosary means to immerse oneself in contemplation of the mystery of Christ who '' is our peace '' , since he made '' the two of us one , and broke down the dividing wall of hostility '' Eph : . Consequently , one_cannot recite the Rosary without feeling caught up in a clear commitment to advancing peace , especially in the land of Jesus , still so sorely afflicted and so close to the heart of every Christian . A similar need_for commitment and prayer arises in relation to another critical contemporary issue : the family , the primary cell of society , increasingly menaced by forces of disintegration on both the ideological and practical planes , so as to make us fear for the future of this fundamental and indispensable institution and , with it , for the future of society as a whole . The revival of the Rosary in Christian families , within_the context of a broader pastoral_ministry to the family , will be an effective aid to countering the devastating effects of this crisis typical of our_age . '' Behold , your Mother ! '' Jn : . Many signs indicate that still today the Blessed Virgin desires to exercise through_this same prayer that maternal concern to which_the dying Redeemer entrusted , in the person of the beloved disciple , all the sons_and_daughters of the Church : '' Woman , behold your son ! '' Jn : . Well known are the occasions in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries on which_the Mother of Christ made her presence felt and her voice heard , in order to exhort the People of God to this form of contemplative prayer . I would mention in particular , on account of their great influence on the lives of Christians and the authoritative recognition they_have received_from_the Church , the apparitions of Lourdes and of Fatima ; these shrines continue to be visited by great numbers of pilgrims seeking comfort and hope . Following the witnesses . It would be impossible to name all the many Saints who discovered in the Rosary a genuine path to growth in holiness . We need but mention Saint Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort , the author of an excellent work on the Rosary , and , closer to ourselves , Padre Pio of Pietrelcina , whom I recently had the joy of canonizing . As a true apostle of the Rosary , Blessed Bartolo Longo had a special charism . His path to holiness rested on an inspiration heard in the depths of his_heart : '' Whoever spreads the Rosary -isaia- saved ! '' . As a result , he felt called to build a Church dedicated to Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in Pompei , against the background of the ruins of the ancient city , which scarcely heard the proclamation of Christ before being buried in A . during an eruption of Mount Vesuvius , only to emerge centuries later from its ashes as a witness to the lights and shadows of classical civilization . By his whole_life s work and especially by the practice of the '' Fifteen Saturdays '' , Bartolo Longo promoted the Christocentric and contemplative heart of the Rosary , and received great encouragement and support from Leo XIII , the '' Pope of the Rosary '' . CHAPTER I CONTEMPLATING CHRIST WITH MARY A face radiant as the sun . '' And he was transfigured before them , and his face shone like the sun '' Mt : . The Gospel scene of Christ s transfiguration , in which_the three Apostles Peter , James and John appear entranced by the beauty of the Redeemer , can be seen as an icon of Christian contemplation . To look upon the face of Christ , to recognize its mystery amid the daily events and the sufferings of his human_life , and then to grasp the divine splendour definitively revealed in the Risen Lord , seated in glory -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father : this_-isaia- the task of every follower of Christ and therefore the task of each_one of us . In contemplating Christ s face we become open to receiving the mystery of Trinitarian life , experiencing ever anew the love of the Father and delighting in the joy of the Holy Spirit . Saint Paul s words can then be applied to us : '' Beholding the glory of the Lord , we are_being changed into_his likeness , from one degree of glory to another ; for_this comes_from_the Lord who_-isaia- the Spirit '' Cor : . Mary , model of contemplation . The contemplation of Christ has an incomparable model in Mary . In a unique way the face of the Son belongs to Mary . It was in her womb that Christ was formed , receiving from her a human resemblance which points to an even greater spiritual closeness . No one has_ever devoted himself to the contemplation of the face of Christ as faithfully as Mary . The eyes of her_heart already turned to him -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation , when_she conceived him by the power of the Holy Spirit . In the months that followed she began to sense his presence and to picture his features . When -atti_degli_apostoli- last she gave birth to him in Bethlehem , her eyes were able to gaze tenderly on the face of her Son , as she '' wrapped him in swaddling cloths , and laid him in a manger '' Lk : . Thereafter Mary s gaze , ever filled_with adoration and wonder , would never leave him . At times it would be a questioning look , as in the episode of the finding in the Temple : '' Son , why have you treated us so ? '' Lk : ; it would always be a penetrating gaze , one capable of deeply understanding Jesus , even to the point of perceiving his hidden feelings and anticipating his decisions , as -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana cf . At other times it would be a look of sorrow , especially beneath the Cross , where her vision would still be that of a mother giving birth , for Mary not_only shared the passion and death of her Son , she also received_the new son given to her in the beloved disciple cf . On the morning of Easter hers would be a gaze radiant with the joy of the Resurrection , and finally , on the day of Pentecost , a gaze afire with the outpouring of the Spirit cf . Mary lived with_her eyes fixed on Christ , treasuring his every word : '' She kept all these_things , pondering them in her_heart '' Lk : ; cf . The memories of Jesus , impressed upon her_heart , were always with_her , leading her to reflect on the various moments of her_life -atti_degli_apostoli- her Son s side . In a way those memories were to be the '' rosary '' which_she recited uninterruptedly throughout her earthly life . Even now , amid the joyful songs of the heavenly Jerusalem , the reasons for_her thanksgiving and praise remain unchanged . They inspire her_maternal concern_for the pilgrim Church , in which_she continues to relate her personal account of the Gospel . Mary constantly sets before the faithful the '' mysteries '' of her Son , with the desire_that the contemplation of those mysteries will release all their saving power . In the recitation of the Rosary , the Christian community enters into contact_with_the memories and the contemplative gaze of Mary . The Rosary , a contemplative prayer . The Rosary , precisely_because it starts with Mary s own experience , -isaia- an exquisitely contemplative prayer . Without this contemplative dimension , it would lose its meaning , as Pope Paul VI clearly pointed_out : '' Without contemplation , the Rosary -isaia- a body without a soul , and its recitation runs the risk of becoming a mechanical repetition of formulas , in violation of the admonition of Christ : In praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do ; for they think they_will be heard for their many words Mt : . By its_nature the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering pace , helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord s life as seen through the eyes of her who_was closest to the Lord . In this_way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are disclosed '' . It -isaia- worth pausing to consider this profound insight of Paul VI , in order to bring out certain aspects of the Rosary which show that_it_-isaia- really a form of Christocentric contemplation . Remembering Christ with Mary . Mary s contemplation -isaia- above all a remembering . We need to understand this word in the biblical sense of remembrance zakar as a making present of the works brought_about by God in the history_of_salvation . The Bible -isaia- an account of saving events culminating in Christ himself . These events not_only belong to '' yesterday '' ; they are_also part of the '' today '' of salvation . This making present comes about above all in the Liturgy : what God accomplished centuries ago did not_only affect the direct witnesses of those events ; it continues to affect people in every_age with its gift of grace . To some extent this -isaia-_also true of every_other devout approach to those events : to '' remember '' them in a spirit of faith and love_-isaia- to be open to the grace_which Christ won for us by the mysteries of his_life , death_and_resurrection . Consequently , while it must be reaffirmed with the Second Vatican Council that the Liturgy , as the exercise of the priestly office of Christ and an act of public worship , -isaia- '' the summit to which_the activity of the Church -isaia-_directed and the font from which all its power flows '' , it -isaia-_also necessary to recall that the spiritual_life '' is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy . Christians , while they_are_called to prayer in common , must_also go to their_own rooms to pray to their Father in secret cf . Mt : ; indeed , according to the teaching of the Apostle , they_must pray without ceasing cf . The Rosary , in its_own particular_way , -isaia-_part of this varied panorama of '' ceaseless '' prayer . If the Liturgy , as the activity of Christ and the Church , -isaia- a saving action par excellence , the Rosary too , as a '' meditation '' with Mary on Christ , -isaia- a salutary contemplation . By immersing us in the mysteries of the Redeemer s life , it ensures that_what he has done and what_the liturgy makes present -isaia- profoundly assimilated and shapes our existence . Learning Christ from Mary . Christ -isaia- the supreme Teacher , the revealer and the one revealed . It -isaia- not_just a question of learning what he taught but of '' learning him '' . In this_regard could we have any better teacher than Mary ? From the divine standpoint , the Spirit -isaia- the interior teacher who leads us to the full truth of Christ cf . But among creatures no one knows Christ better_than Mary ; no one_can introduce us to a profound knowledge of his mystery better_than his Mother . The first of the '' signs '' worked by Jesus \u2013 the changing of water into wine -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage in Cana \u2013 clearly presents Mary in the guise of a teacher , as she urges the servants to do what Jesus commands cf . We can imagine that_she would_have done likewise for the disciples after Jesus Ascension , when_she joined them in awaiting the Holy Spirit and supported them in their first mission . Contemplating the scenes of the Rosary in union with Mary -isaia- a means of learning from her to '' read '' Christ , to discover his secrets and to understand his message . This school of Mary -isaia- all the more_effective if we consider that_she teaches by obtaining for us in abundance the gifts of the Holy Spirit , even as she offers us the incomparable example of her_own '' pilgrimage of faith '' . As we contemplate each mystery of her Son s life , she invites us to do as she did -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation : to ask humbly the questions which open us to the light , in order to end with the obedience of faith : '' Behold I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; be it done to me according to your word '' Lk : . Being conformed to Christ with Mary . Christian spirituality -isaia- distinguished by the disciple s commitment to become conformed ever more_fully to his Master cf . The outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Baptism grafts the believer like a branch onto the vine which_-isaia- Christ cf . Jn : and makes him a member of Christ s mystical Body cf . This initial unity , however , calls for a growing assimilation which_will increasingly shape the conduct of the disciple in accordance_with_the '' mind '' of Christ : '' Have this mind among yourselves , which_was in Christ Jesus '' Phil : . In the words of the Apostle , we are_called '' to put on the Lord Jesus Christ '' cf . In the spiritual journey of the Rosary , based on the constant contemplation \u2013 in Mary s company \u2013 of the face of Christ , this demanding ideal of being conformed to him -isaia- pursued through an association which_could be described in terms of friendship . We are thereby enabled to enter naturally into Christ s life and as it were to share his deepest feelings . In this_regard Blessed Bartolo Longo has written : '' Just as two friends , frequently in each_other s company , tend to develop similar habits , so too , by holding familiar converse with Jesus and the Blessed Virgin , by meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary and by living the same life in Holy Communion , we can become , to the extent of our lowliness , similar to them and can learn from_these supreme models a life of humility , poverty , hiddenness , patience and perfection '' . In this_process of being conformed to Christ in the Rosary , we entrust ourselves in a special_way to the maternal care of the Blessed Virgin . She who_-isaia- both the Mother of Christ and a member of the Church , indeed her '' pre eminent and altogether singular member '' , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the '' Mother of the Church '' . As such , she continually brings to birth children for the mystical Body of her Son . She does so through_her intercession , imploring upon them the inexhaustible outpouring of the Spirit . Mary -isaia- the perfect icon of the motherhood of the Church . The Rosary mystically transports us to Mary s side as she_-isaia- busy watching over the human growth of Christ in the home of Nazareth . This enables her to train us and to mold us with the same care , until Christ -isaia- '' fully formed '' in us cf . This role of Mary , totally grounded in that of Christ and radically subordinated to it , '' in no way obscures or diminishes the unique mediation of Christ , but_rather shows its power '' . This -isaia- the luminous principle expressed by the Second Vatican Council which I have so powerfully experienced in my own_life and have_made the basis of my episcopal motto : Totus Tuus . The motto -isaia- of course inspired by the teaching of Saint Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort , who explained in the following words Mary s role in the process of our configuration to Christ : '' Our entire perfection consists in being conformed , united and consecrated to Jesus Christ . Hence the most perfect of all devotions -isaia- undoubtedly that_which conforms , unites and consecrates us most perfectly to Jesus Christ . Now , since Mary -isaia- of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ , it follows_that among all devotions that_which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord -isaia- devotion to Mary , his Holy Mother , and that the more a soul -isaia- consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus Christ '' . Never as in the Rosary do the life of Jesus and that of Mary appear so deeply joined . Mary lives only in Christ and for Christ ! Praying to Christ with Mary . Jesus invited us to turn to God with insistence and the confidence that we will be heard : '' Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will_find ; knock , and it will be opened to you '' Mt : . The basis for this_power of prayer_-isaia- the goodness of the Father , but_also the mediation of Christ himself cf . Jn : and the working of the Holy Spirit who '' intercedes for us '' according to the will of God cf . For '' we do not know_how to pray as we ought '' Rom : , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times we are_not heard '' because we ask wrongly '' cf . In support of the prayer which Christ and the Spirit cause to rise in our_hearts , Mary intervenes with her_maternal intercession . '' The prayer of the Church -isaia- sustained by the prayer of Mary '' . If Jesus , the one Mediator , -isaia- the Way of our prayer , then Mary , his purest and most transparent reflection , shows us the Way . '' Beginning with Mary s unique cooperation_with the working of the Holy Spirit , the Churches developed their prayer to the Holy Mother of God , centering it on the person of Christ manifested in his mysteries '' . At the wedding of Cana the Gospel clearly shows the power of Mary s intercession as she makes known to Jesus the needs of others : '' They have no wine '' Jn : . The Rosary -isaia- both meditation and supplication . Insistent prayer to the Mother of God -isaia- based on confidence that her_maternal intercession can obtain all things from the heart of her Son . She -isaia- '' all powerful by grace '' , to use the bold expression , which needs to be properly understood , of Blessed Bartolo Longo in his Supplication to Our Lady . This -isaia- a conviction which , beginning with the Gospel , has grown ever_more firm in the experience of the Christian people . The supreme poet Dante expresses it marvellously in the lines sung by Saint Bernard : '' Lady , thou art so great and so powerful , that whoever desires grace yet does_not turn to thee , would_have his desire fly without wings '' . When in the Rosary we plead with Mary , the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit cf . Lk : , she intercedes for us before the Father who filled her with grace and before the Son born of her womb , praying with us and for us . Proclaiming Christ with Mary . The Rosary -isaia-_also a path of proclamation and increasing knowledge , in which_the mystery of Christ -isaia- presented again_and_again -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels of the Christian experience . Its form -isaia- that of a prayerful and contemplative presentation , capable of forming Christians according to the heart of Christ . When the recitation of the Rosary combines all the elements needed_for an effective meditation , especially in its communal celebration in parishes and shrines , it can present a significant catechetical opportunity which pastors should use to advantage . In this_way too Our Lady of the Rosary continues her work of proclaiming Christ . The history of the Rosary shows how this_prayer was used in particular by the Dominicans -atti_degli_apostoli- a difficult time for the Church due to the spread of heresy . Today we are facing new challenges . Why should we not once_more have_recourse to the Rosary , with the same faith as those_who_have gone before us ? The Rosary retains all its power and continues to be a valuable pastoral resource for_every good evangelizer . CHAPTER II MYSTERIES OF CHRIST \u2013 MYSTERIES OF HIS MOTHER The Rosary , '' a compendium of the Gospel '' . The only way to approach the contemplation of Christ s face -isaia- by listening in the Spirit to the Father s voice , since '' no one knows the Son except the Father '' Mt : . In the region of Caesarea Philippi , Jesus responded to Peter s confession of faith by indicating the source of that clear intuition of his identity : '' Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . What -isaia- needed , then , -isaia- a revelation from above . In order to receive that revelation , attentive listening -isaia- indispensable : '' Only the experience of silence and prayer offers the proper setting for the growth and development of a true , faithful and consistent knowledge of that mystery '' . The Rosary -isaia- one of the traditional paths of Christian prayer directed to the contemplation of Christ s face . Pope Paul VI described it in these_words : '' As a Gospel prayer , centred on the mystery of the redemptive Incarnation , the Rosary -isaia- a prayer with a clearly Christological orientation . Its most characteristic element , in fact , the litany like succession of Hail Marys , becomes in itself an unceasing praise of Christ , who_-isaia- the ultimate object both of the Angel s announcement and of the greeting of the Mother of John the Baptist : Blessed -isaia- the fruit of your womb Lk : . We would go further and say that the succession of Hail Marys constitutes the warp on which_-isaia- woven the contemplation of the mysteries . The Jesus that_each Hail Mary recalls -isaia-_the_same Jesus whom_the succession of mysteries proposes to us now as the Son of God , now as the Son of the Virgin '' . A proposed addition to the traditional pattern . Of the many mysteries of Christ s life , only a few are indicated by the Rosary in the form that_has become generally established with the seal of the Church s approval . The selection was determined by the origin of the prayer , which_was based on the number , the number of the Psalms in the Psalter . I believe , however_,_that to bring out fully the Christological depth of the Rosary it would be suitable to make an addition to the traditional pattern which , while left to the freedom of individuals and communities , could broaden it to include the mysteries of Christ s public ministry between his Baptism and his Passion . In the course of those mysteries we contemplate important aspects of the person of Christ as the definitive revelation of God . Declared the beloved Son of the Father -atti_degli_apostoli- the Baptism in the Jordan , Christ -isaia-_the_one who announces the coming of the Kingdom , bears_witness to it in his works and proclaims its demands . It -isaia- during the years of his public ministry that the mystery of Christ -isaia- most evidently a mystery of light : '' While I -amos- in the world , I -amos- the light_of_the_world '' Jn : . Consequently , for the Rosary to become more_fully a '' compendium of the Gospel '' , it -isaia- fitting to add , following reflection on the Incarnation and the hidden life of Christ the joyful mysteries and before focusing on the sufferings of his Passion the sorrowful mysteries and the triumph of his Resurrection the glorious mysteries , a meditation on certain particularly significant moments in his public ministry the mysteries of light . This addition of these new mysteries , without prejudice to any essential aspect of the prayer s traditional format , -isaia- meant to give it fresh life and to enkindle renewed interest in the Rosary s place within Christian spirituality as a true doorway to the depths of the Heart of Christ , ocean of joy and of light , of suffering and of glory . The Joyful Mysteries . The first five decades , the '' joyful mysteries '' , are marked by the joy radiating from the event of the Incarnation . This -isaia- clear from the very first mystery , the Annunciation , where Gabriel s greeting to the Virgin of Nazareth -isaia- linked to an invitation to messianic joy : '' Rejoice , Mary '' . The whole of salvation history , in some sense the entire history of the world , has led up to this greeting . If it -isaia- the Father s plan to unite all things in Christ cf . Eph : , then the whole of the universe -isaia- in some_way touched by the divine favour with_which_the Father looks upon Mary and makes her the Mother of his Son . The whole of humanity , in turn , -isaia- embraced by the fiat with_which she readily agrees to the will of God . Exultation -isaia- the keynote of the encounter_with Elizabeth , where_the sound of Mary s voice and the presence of Christ in her womb cause John to '' leap for joy '' cf . Gladness also fills the scene in Bethlehem , when_the birth of the divine Child , the Saviour of the world , -isaia- announced by the song of the angels and proclaimed to the shepherds as '' news of great joy '' Lk : . The final two mysteries , while preserving this climate of joy , already point to the drama yet to come . The Presentation in the Temple not_only expresses the joy of the Child s consecration and the ecstasy of the aged Simeon ; it also records the prophecy that Christ will be a '' sign of contradiction '' for Israel and that a sword will pierce his_mother s heart cf Lk : . Joy mixed with drama marks the fifth mystery , the finding of the twelve year old Jesus in the Temple . Here he appears in his_divine wisdom as he listens and raises questions , already in effect one_who '' teaches '' . The revelation of his mystery as the Son wholly dedicated to his Father s affairs proclaims_the radical nature of the Gospel , in which even the closest of human relationships are challenged by the absolute demands of the Kingdom . Mary and Joseph , fearful and anxious , '' did_not understand '' his_words Lk : . To meditate upon the '' joyful '' mysteries , then , -isaia- to enter_into the ultimate causes and the deepest meaning of Christian joy . It -isaia- to focus on the realism of the mystery of the Incarnation and on the obscure foreshadowing of the mystery of the saving Passion . Mary leads us to discover the secret of Christian joy , reminding us that Christianity -isaia- , first_and_foremost , euangelion , '' good_news '' , which_has as its heart and its whole content the person of Jesus Christ , the Word made_flesh , the one Saviour of the world . The Mysteries of Light . Moving on from the infancy and the hidden life in Nazareth to the public_life of Jesus , our contemplation brings us to those mysteries which_may be called in a special_way '' mysteries of light '' . Certainly the whole mystery of Christ -isaia- a mystery of light . He -isaia- the '' light_of_the_world '' Jn : . Yet this_truth emerges in a special_way during the years of his public_life , when he proclaims_the Gospel of the Kingdom . In proposing to the Christian community five significant moments \u2013 '' luminous '' mysteries \u2013 during_this phase of Christ s life , I think_that the following can be fittingly singled out : his Baptism in the Jordan , his self manifestation -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding of Cana , his proclamation of the Kingdom of God , with_his call to conversion , his Transfiguration , and finally , his institution of the Eucharist , as the sacramental expression of the Paschal Mystery . Each of these mysteries -isaia- a revelation of the Kingdom now present in the very person of Jesus . The Baptism in the Jordan -isaia- first of all a mystery of light . Here , as Christ descends into the waters , the innocent one_who became '' sin '' for our sake cf . Cor : , the heavens open wide and the voice of the Father declares him the beloved Son cf . Mt : and parallels , while the Spirit descends on him to invest him_with the mission which he -isaia- to carry_out . Another mystery of light -isaia-_the_first of the signs , given_-atti_degli_apostoli- Cana cf . Jn : , when Christ changes water into wine and opens the hearts of the disciples to faith , thanks to the intervention of Mary , the first among believers . Another mystery of light -isaia- the preaching by which Jesus proclaims_the coming of the Kingdom of God , calls to conversion cf . Mk : and forgives the sins of all who draw near to him in humble trust cf . Mk : ; Lk : : the inauguration of that ministry of mercy which he continues to exercise until the end of the world , particularly through the Sacrament of Reconciliation which he has_entrusted to his Church cf . The mystery of light par excellence -isaia- the Transfiguration , traditionally believed to have taken_place on Mount Tabor . The glory of the Godhead shines_forth from the face of Christ as the Father commands the astonished Apostles to '' listen to him '' cf . Lk : and parallels and to prepare to experience with_him the agony of the Passion , so as to come with_him to the joy of the Resurrection and a life transfigured by the Holy Spirit . A final mystery of light -isaia- the institution of the Eucharist , in which Christ offers his body_and_blood as food under the signs of bread and wine , and testifies '' to the end '' his_love for_humanity Jn : , for whose salvation he will offer himself in sacrifice . In these mysteries , apart_from the miracle -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana , the presence of Mary remains in the background . The Gospels make only the briefest reference to her occasional presence -atti_degli_apostoli- one moment or other during the preaching of Jesus cf . Mk : ; Jn : , and they give no indication that_she was present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist . Yet the role she assumed -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana in some_way accompanies Christ throughout his_ministry . The revelation made directly by the Father -atti_degli_apostoli- the Baptism in the Jordan and echoed by John the Baptist -isaia- placed upon Mary s lips -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana , and it becomes_the great maternal counsel which Mary addresses to the Church of every_age : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . This counsel -isaia- a fitting introduction to the words and signs of Christ s public ministry and it forms the Marian foundation of all the '' mysteries of light '' . The Sorrowful Mysteries . The Gospels give great prominence to the sorrowful mysteries of Christ . From the beginning Christian piety , especially during the Lenten devotion of the Way of the Cross , has focused on the individual moments of the Passion , realizing that here -isaia- found the culmination of the revelation of God s love and the source of our_salvation . The Rosary selects certain moments from the Passion , inviting the faithful to contemplate them in their_hearts and to relive them . The sequence of meditations begins with Gethsemane , where Christ experiences a moment of great anguish before the will of the Father , against which_the weakness of the flesh would be tempted to rebel . There Jesus encounters all the temptations and confronts all the sins of humanity , in order to say to the Father : '' Not my will but yours be done '' Lk : and parallels . This '' Yes '' of Christ reverses the '' No '' of our_first parents in the Garden of Eden . And the cost of this faithfulness to the Father s will -isaia- made clear in the following mysteries ; by his scourging , his crowning with thorns , his carrying the Cross and his_death on the Cross , the Lord -isaia- cast into the most abject suffering : Ecce homo ! This abject suffering reveals not_only the love of God but_also the meaning of man_himself . Ecce homo : the meaning , origin and fulfilment of man_-isaia- to be found in Christ , the God who humbles himself out of love '' even unto death , death on a cross '' Phil : . The sorrowful mysteries help the believer to relive the death of Jesus , to stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross beside Mary , to enter with_her into the depths of God s love for_man and to experience all its life_giving power . The Glorious Mysteries . '' The contemplation of Christ s face cannot stop -atti_degli_apostoli- the image of the Crucified One . He -isaia- the Risen One ! '' The Rosary has_always expressed this knowledge born of faith and invited the believer to pass beyond_the darkness of the Passion in order to gaze upon Christ s glory in the Resurrection and Ascension . Contemplating the Risen One , Christians rediscover the reasons for their_own faith cf . Cor : and relive the joy not_only of those_to_whom Christ appeared \u2013 the Apostles , Mary Magdalene and the disciples on the road to Emmaus \u2013 but_also the joy of Mary , who must_have had an equally intense experience of the new_life of her glorified Son . In the Ascension , Christ was raised in glory to the right hand of the Father , while Mary herself would be raised to that_same glory in the Assumption , enjoying beforehand , by a unique privilege , the destiny reserved for all the just -atti_degli_apostoli- the resurrection of the dead . Crowned in glory \u2013 as she appears in the last glorious mystery \u2013 Mary shines_forth as Queen of the Angels and Saints , the anticipation and the supreme realization of the eschatological state of the Church . At the centre of this unfolding sequence of the glory of the Son and the Mother , the Rosary sets before us the third glorious mystery , Pentecost , which reveals the face of the Church as a family gathered together_with Mary , enlivened by the powerful outpouring of the Spirit and ready for the mission of evangelization . The contemplation of this scene , like that of the other glorious mysteries , ought to lead the faithful to an ever_greater appreciation of their new_life in Christ , lived in the heart of the Church , a life of which_the scene of Pentecost itself_-isaia- the great '' icon '' . The glorious mysteries thus lead the faithful to greater hope_for the eschatological goal towards which_they journey as members of the pilgrim People of God in history . This can_only impel them to bear courageous witness to that '' good_news '' which_gives meaning to their entire existence . From '' mysteries '' to the '' Mystery '' : Mary s way . The cycles of meditation proposed by the Holy Rosary are by no means exhaustive , but_they do bring to mind what_-isaia- essential and they awaken in the soul a thirst_for a knowledge of Christ continually nourished by the pure source of the Gospel . Every individual event in the life of Christ , as narrated by the Evangelists , -isaia- resplendent with the Mystery that surpasses all understanding cf . Eph : : the Mystery of the Word made_flesh , in whom '' all the fullness of God dwells bodily '' Col : . For this_reason_the Catechism of the Catholic Church places great emphasis on the mysteries of Christ , pointing out that '' everything in the life of Jesus -isaia- a sign of his Mystery '' . The '' duc in altum '' of the Church of the third_millennium will be determined by the ability of Christians to enter_into the '' perfect knowledge of God s mystery , of Christ , in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge '' Col : . The Letter to the Ephesians makes this heartfelt prayer_for all the baptized : '' May Christ dwell in your hearts through_faith , so that_you , being rooted and grounded in love , may_have power . to know_the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge , that_you_may be filled_with all the fullness of God '' : . The Rosary -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this ideal ; it offers the '' secret '' which_leads easily to a profound and inward knowledge of Christ . We might call it Mary s way . It -isaia-_the_way of the example of the Virgin of Nazareth , a woman of faith , of silence , of attentive listening . It -isaia-_also the way of a Marian devotion inspired by knowledge of the inseparable bond_between Christ and his Blessed Mother : the mysteries of Christ are_also in some sense the mysteries of his Mother , even_when they_do_not involve her directly , for she lives from him and through_him . By making our_own the words of the Angel Gabriel and Saint Elizabeth contained in the Hail Mary , we find ourselves constantly drawn to seek out afresh in Mary , in her arms and in her_heart , the '' blessed fruit of her womb '' cf Lk : . Mystery of Christ , mystery of man . In my testimony of mentioned above , where I described the Rosary as my favourite prayer , I used an idea to which I would_like to return . I said then that '' the simple prayer of the Rosary marks the rhythm of human_life '' . In the light of what_has_been said so far on the mysteries of Christ , it -isaia- not difficult to go deeper into this anthropological significance of the Rosary , which_-isaia- far deeper than may appear -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight . Anyone who contemplates Christ through the various stages of his_life cannot_fail to perceive in him the truth_about man . This -isaia- the great affirmation of the Second Vatican Council which I have so often discussed in my own teaching since_the Encyclical Letter Redemptor Hominis : '' it -isaia- only in the mystery of the Word made_flesh that the mystery of man_-isaia- seen in its true light '' . The Rosary helps to open up the way to this light . Following in the path of Christ , in whom man s path -isaia- '' recapitulated '' , revealed and redeemed , believers come face to face with the image of the true man . Contemplating Christ s birth , they learn of the sanctity of life ; seeing the household of Nazareth , they learn the original truth of the family according to God s plan ; listening to the Master in the mysteries of his public ministry , they find the light_which leads them to enter_the Kingdom of God ; and following him on the way to Calvary , they learn the meaning of salvific suffering . Finally , contemplating Christ and his Blessed Mother in glory , they see the goal towards which_each of us -isaia- called , if we allow ourselves to be healed and transformed by the Holy Spirit . It could be said_that each mystery of the Rosary , carefully meditated , sheds light on the mystery of man . At the same_time , it becomes natural to bring to this encounter_with_the sacred humanity of the Redeemer all the problems , anxieties , labours and endeavours which go to make up our_lives . '' Cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain you '' Ps : . To pray the Rosary -isaia- to hand over our burdens to the merciful hearts of Christ and his Mother . Twenty five years later , thinking back over the difficulties which_have also been part of my exercise of the Petrine ministry , I feel the need to say once_more , as a warm invitation to everyone to experience it personally : the Rosary does indeed '' mark the rhythm of human_life '' , bringing it into harmony_with_the '' rhythm '' of God s own_life , in the joyful communion of the Holy Trinity , our life s destiny and deepest longing . CHAPTER III '' FOR ME , TO LIVE IS CHRIST '' The Rosary , a way of assimilating the mystery . Meditation on the mysteries of Christ -isaia- proposed in the Rosary by means of a method designed to assist in their assimilation . It -isaia- a method based on repetition . This applies above all to the Hail Mary , repeated ten times in each mystery . If this repetition -isaia- considered superficially , there could be a temptation to see the Rosary as a dry and boring exercise . It -isaia- quite another thing , however , when_the Rosary -isaia- thought of as an outpouring of that love_which tirelessly returns to the person loved with expressions similar in their content but ever fresh in terms of the feeling pervading them . In Christ , God has truly assumed a '' heart of flesh '' . Not only does God have a divine heart , rich in mercy and in forgiveness , but_also a human_heart , capable of all the stirrings of affection . If we needed evidence for_this from the Gospel , we could easily find it in the touching dialogue_between Christ and Peter after_the Resurrection : '' Simon , son of John , do you love me ? '' Three times this_question -isaia- put to Peter , and three times he gives the reply : '' Lord , you know_that I love you '' cf . Over and above the specific meaning of this passage , so important_for Peter s mission , none can fail to recognize_the beauty of this triple repetition , in which_the insistent request and the corresponding reply are expressed in terms familiar from the universal experience of human love . To understand_the Rosary , one_has to enter_into the psychological dynamic proper to love . One thing -isaia- clear : although the repeated Hail Mary -isaia- addressed directly to Mary , it -isaia- to Jesus that the act of love_-isaia- ultimately directed , with_her and through_her . The repetition -isaia- nourished by the desire to be conformed ever_more completely to Christ , the true programme of the Christian life . Saint Paul expressed this project with words of fire : '' For me to live -isaia- Christ and to die -isaia- gain '' Phil : . And again : '' It -isaia-_no_longer I that live , but Christ lives in me '' Gal : . The Rosary helps us to be conformed ever more_closely to Christ until we attain true holiness . We should_not be surprised that_our relationship_with Christ makes use of a method . God communicates himself to us respecting our human_nature and its vital rhythms . Hence , while Christian spirituality -isaia- familiar with the most sublime forms of mystical silence in which images , words and gestures are all , so to speak , superseded by an intense and ineffable union with God , it normally engages the whole person in all his complex psychological , physical and relational reality . This becomes apparent in the Liturgy . Sacraments and sacramentals are structured as a series of rites which bring into play all the dimensions of the person . The same applies to non liturgical prayer . This -isaia- confirmed by the fact_that , in the East , the most characteristic prayer of Christological meditation , centred on the words '' Lord Jesus Christ , Son of God , have mercy on me , a sinner '' -isaia- traditionally linked to the rhythm of breathing ; while this practice favours perseverance in the prayer , it also in some_way embodies the desire_for Christ to become the breath , the soul and the '' all '' of one s life . which_can nevertheless be improved . I mentioned in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte that the West -isaia-_now experiencing a renewed demand for meditation , which -atti_degli_apostoli- times leads to a keen interest in aspects of other_religions . Some Christians , limited in their knowledge of the Christian contemplative tradition , are attracted by those forms of prayer . While the latter contain many elements which_are positive and -atti_degli_apostoli- times compatible with Christian experience , they are_often based on ultimately unacceptable premises . Much in vogue among_these approaches are methods aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- attaining a high level of spiritual concentration by using techniques of a psychophysical , repetitive and symbolic nature . The Rosary -isaia- situated within this broad gamut of religious phenomena , but_it_-isaia- distinguished by characteristics of its_own which correspond to specifically Christian requirements . In effect , the Rosary -isaia- simply a method of contemplation . As a method , it serves as a means to an end and cannot become an end in itself . All the same , as the fruit of centuries of experience , this method should_not be undervalued . In its favour one could cite the experience of countless Saints . This -isaia- not to say , however_,_that the method cannot be improved . Such -isaia- the intent of the addition of the new series of mysteria lucis to the overall cycle of mysteries and of the few suggestions which I -amos- proposing in this Letter regarding its manner of recitation . These suggestions , while respecting the well established structure of this_prayer , are intended to help the faithful to understand it in the richness of its symbolism and in harmony_with_the demands of daily_life . Otherwise there_-isaia- a risk that the Rosary would_not only fail to produce the intended spiritual effects , but_even that the beads , with which_it_-isaia- usually said , could come to be regarded as some kind of amulet or magic object , thereby radically distorting their meaning and function . Announcing each mystery . Announcing each mystery , and perhaps even using a suitable icon to portray it , -isaia- as it were to open up a scenario on which to focus our attention . The words direct the imagination and the mind towards a particular episode or moment in the life of Christ . In the Church s traditional spirituality , the veneration of icons and the many devotions appealing to the senses , as well as the method of prayer proposed by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in the Spiritual Exercises , make_use of visual and imaginative elements the compositio loci , judged to be of great help in concentrating the mind on the particular mystery . This -isaia- a methodology , moreover , which corresponds to the inner logic of the Incarnation : in Jesus , God wanted to take on human features . It -isaia- through_his bodily reality that_we_are led into contact_with_the mystery of his divinity . This need_for concreteness finds further expression in the announcement of the various mysteries of the Rosary . Obviously these mysteries neither replace the Gospel nor exhaust its content . The Rosary , therefore , -isaia- no substitute for lectio divina ; on the contrary , it presupposes and promotes it . Yet , even_though the mysteries contemplated in the Rosary , even with the addition of the mysteria lucis , do no more_than outline the fundamental elements of the life of Christ , they easily draw the mind to a more expansive reflection on the rest of the Gospel , especially_when the Rosary -isaia- prayed in a setting of prolonged recollection . Listening to the word of God . In order to supply a Biblical foundation and greater depth to our meditation , it -isaia- helpful to follow_the announcement of the mystery with the proclamation of a related Biblical passage , long or short , depending on the circumstances . No other_words can ever match the efficacy of the inspired word . As we listen , we are certain that_this_-isaia- the word of God , spoken for today and spoken '' for me '' . If received in this_way , the word of God can become part of the Rosary s methodology of repetition without giving rise to the ennui derived_from the simple recollection of something already well_known . It -isaia- not a matter of recalling information but of allowing God to speak . In certain solemn communal celebrations , this word can be appropriately illustrated by a brief commentary . Listening and meditation are nourished by silence . After the announcement of the mystery and the proclamation of the word , it -isaia- fitting to pause and focus one s attention for a suitable period of time on the mystery concerned , before moving into vocal prayer . A discovery of the importance of silence -isaia- one of the secrets of practicing contemplation and meditation . One drawback of a society dominated by technology and the mass_media -isaia- the fact_that silence becomes increasingly difficult to achieve . Just as moments of silence are recommended in the Liturgy , so too in the recitation of the Rosary it -isaia- fitting to pause briefly after listening to the word of God , while the mind focuses on the content of a particular mystery . The '' Our Father '' . After listening to the word and focusing on the mystery , it -isaia- natural for the mind to be lifted up towards_the Father . In each of his mysteries , Jesus always leads us to the Father , for as he rests in the Father s bosom cf . Jn : he -isaia- continually turned towards him . He wants us to share in his intimacy with the Father , so that_we_can say with_him : '' Abba , Father '' Rom : ; Gal : . By virtue of his relationship to the Father he makes us brothers_and_sisters of himself and of one_another , communicating to us the Spirit which_-isaia- both his and the Father s . Acting as a kind of foundation for the Christological and Marian meditation which unfolds in the repetition of the Hail Mary , the Our Father makes meditation upon the mystery , even_when carried_out in solitude , an ecclesial experience . The ten '' Hail Marys '' . This -isaia-_the_most substantial element in the Rosary and also the one which_makes it a Marian prayer par excellence . Yet when_the Hail Mary -isaia- properly understood , we come to see clearly that_its Marian character -isaia- not opposed to its Christological character , but_that it actually emphasizes and increases it . The first part of the Hail Mary , drawn_from the words spoken to Mary by the Angel Gabriel and by Saint Elizabeth , -isaia- a contemplation in adoration of the mystery accomplished in the Virgin of Nazareth . These words express , so to speak , the wonder of heaven and earth ; they could be said to give us a glimpse of God s own wonderment as he contemplates his '' masterpiece '' \u2013 the Incarnation of the Son in the womb of the Virgin Mary . If we recall how , in the Book of Genesis , God '' saw all that he had made '' Gen : , we can_find here an echo of that '' pathos with_which God , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of creation , looked upon the work of his hands '' . The repetition of the Hail Mary in the Rosary gives us a share in God s own wonder and pleasure : in jubilant amazement we acknowledge_the greatest miracle of history . Mary s prophecy here finds_its fulfilment : '' Henceforth all generations will call me blessed '' Lk : . The centre of gravity in the Hail Mary , the hinge as it were which joins its two parts , -isaia- the name of Jesus . Sometimes , in hurried recitation , this centre of gravity can be overlooked , and with it the connection to the mystery of Christ being contemplated . Yet it -isaia- precisely_the emphasis given to the name of Jesus and to his mystery that_-isaia- the sign of a meaningful and fruitful recitation of the Rosary . Pope Paul VI drew attention , in his Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus , to the custom in certain regions of highlighting the name of Christ by the addition of a clause referring to the mystery being contemplated . This -isaia- a praiseworthy custom , especially during public recitation . It gives forceful expression to our_faith in Christ , directed to the different moments of the Redeemer s life . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a profession_of_faith and an aid in concentrating our meditation , since it facilitates the process of assimilation to the mystery of Christ inherent in the repetition of the Hail Mary . When we repeat the name of Jesus \u2013 the only name given to us by which we may hope_for salvation cf . Acts : \u2013 in close association with the name of his Blessed Mother , almost as if it were done -atti_degli_apostoli- her suggestion , we set_out on a path of assimilation meant to help us enter more_deeply into the life of Christ . From Mary s uniquely privileged relationship_with Christ , which_makes her the Mother of God , Theot\u00f3kos , derives the forcefulness of the appeal we make to her in the second half of the prayer , as we entrust to her_maternal intercession our_lives and the hour of our death . Trinitarian doxology -isaia- the goal of all Christian contemplation . For Christ -isaia-_the_way that leads us to the Father in the Spirit . If we travel this_way to the end , we repeatedly encounter the mystery of the three divine Persons , to whom all praise , worship and thanksgiving are due . It -isaia- important_that the Gloria , the high point of contemplation , be given due prominence in the Rosary . In public recitation it could be sung , as a way of giving proper emphasis to the essentially Trinitarian structure of all Christian prayer . To the extent_that meditation on the mystery -isaia- attentive and profound , and to the extent that_it_-isaia- enlivened \u2013 from one Hail Mary to another \u2013 by love for Christ and for Mary , the glorification of the Trinity -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of each decade , far_from_being a perfunctory conclusion , takes on its_proper contemplative tone , raising the mind as it were to the heights of heaven and enabling us in some_way to relive the experience of Tabor , a foretaste of the contemplation yet to come : '' It -isaia- good for us to be here ! '' Lk : . The concluding short prayer . In current practice , the Trinitarian doxology -isaia- followed by a brief concluding prayer which varies according to local custom . Without in any_way diminishing the value of such invocations , it -isaia- worthwhile to note that the contemplation of the mysteries could better express their full spiritual fruitfulness if an effort were made to conclude each mystery with a prayer_for the fruits specific to that particular mystery . In this_way the Rosary would better express its connection_with the Christian life . One fine liturgical prayer suggests as much , inviting us to pray that , by meditation on the mysteries of the Rosary , we may come to '' imitate what_they contain and obtain what_they promise '' . Such a final prayer could take on a legitimate variety of forms , as indeed it already does . In this_way the Rosary can be better adapted to different spiritual traditions and different Christian communities . It -isaia- to be hoped , then_,_that appropriate formulas will be widely circulated , after due pastoral discernment and possibly after experimental use in centres and shrines particularly devoted to the Rosary , so that the People of God may benefit from an abundance of authentic spiritual riches and find nourishment for their_personal contemplation . The Rosary beads . The traditional aid used for the recitation of the Rosary -isaia- the set of beads . At the most superficial level , the beads often become a simple counting mechanism to mark the succession of Hail Marys . Yet they can_also take on a symbolism which_can give added depth to contemplation . Here the first thing to note -isaia-_the_way the beads converge upon the Crucifix , which both opens and closes the unfolding sequence of prayer . The life and prayer of believers -isaia- centred upon Christ . Everything begins from him , everything leads towards him , everything , through_him , in the Holy Spirit , attains to the Father . As a counting mechanism , marking the progress of the prayer , the beads evoke the unending path of contemplation and of Christian perfection . Blessed Bartolo Longo saw them also as a '' chain '' which links us to God . A chain , yes , but a sweet chain ; for sweet indeed -isaia- the bond to God who -isaia-_also our Father . A '' filial '' chain which puts us in tune with Mary , the '' handmaid of the Lord '' Lk : and , most of all , with Christ himself , who , though he was in the form of God , made himself a '' servant '' out of love for us Phil : . A fine way to expand the symbolism of the beads -isaia- to let_them remind us of our many relationships , of the bond of communion and fraternity which unites us all in Christ . The opening and closing . At present , in different parts of the Church , there_are_many ways to introduce the Rosary . In some places , it -isaia- customary to begin with the opening words of Psalm : '' O God , come to my aid ; O Lord , make haste to help me '' , as if to nourish in those_who_are praying a humble awareness of their_own insufficiency . In other places , the Rosary begins with the recitation of the Creed , as if to make_the profession_of_faith the basis of the contemplative journey about to be undertaken . These and similar customs , to the extent_that they prepare the mind for contemplation , are all equally legitimate . The Rosary -isaia- then ended with a prayer_for the intentions of the Pope , as if to expand the vision of the one praying to embrace all the needs of the Church . It -isaia- precisely in order to encourage this ecclesial dimension of the Rosary that the Church has seen fit to grant indulgences to those_who recite it with the required dispositions . If prayed in this_way , the Rosary truly becomes a spiritual itinerary in which Mary acts as Mother , Teacher and Guide , sustaining the faithful by her powerful intercession . Is it any wonder , then_,_that the soul feels the need , after saying this_prayer and experiencing so profoundly the motherhood of Mary , to burst forth in praise of the Blessed Virgin , either in that splendid prayer the Salve Regina or in the Litany of Loreto ? This -isaia- the crowning moment of an inner journey which_has brought the faithful into living contact_with_the mystery of Christ and his Blessed Mother . Distribution over time . The Rosary can be recited in full every_day , and there are_those_who most laudably do so . In this_way it fills with prayer the days of many a contemplative , or keeps company with the sick and the elderly who_have abundant time -atti_degli_apostoli- their disposal . Yet it -isaia- clear \u2013 and this applies all the more if the new series of mysteria lucis -isaia- included \u2013 that many_people will_not be able to recite more_than a part of the Rosary , according to a certain weekly pattern . This weekly distribution has the effect of giving the different days of the week a certain spiritual '' colour '' , by analogy with the way_in_which the Liturgy colours the different seasons of the liturgical year . According to current practice , Monday and Thursday are dedicated to the '' joyful mysteries '' , Tuesday and Friday to the '' sorrowful mysteries '' , and Wednesday , Saturday and Sunday to the '' glorious mysteries '' . Where might the '' mysteries of light '' be inserted ? If we consider that the '' glorious mysteries '' are said on both Saturday and Sunday , and that Saturday has_always had a special Marian flavour , the second weekly meditation on the '' joyful mysteries '' , mysteries in which Mary s presence -isaia-_especially pronounced , could be moved to Saturday . Thursday would then be free for meditating on the '' mysteries of light '' . This indication -isaia- not intended to limit a rightful freedom in personal and community prayer , where account needs to be taken of spiritual and pastoral needs and of the occurrence of particular liturgical celebrations which might call_for suitable adaptations . What -isaia- really important -isaia- that the Rosary should_always be seen and experienced as a path of contemplation . In the Rosary , in a way similar to what takes_place in the Liturgy , the Christian week , centred on Sunday , the day of Resurrection , becomes a journey through the mysteries of the life of Christ , and he -isaia-_revealed in the lives of his_disciples as the Lord of time and of history . CONCLUSION '' Blessed Rosary of Mary , sweet chain linking us to God '' . What has been_said so far makes abundantly clear the richness of this traditional prayer , which_has the simplicity of a popular devotion but_also the theological depth of a prayer suited to those_who feel the need_for deeper contemplation . The Church has_always attributed particular efficacy to this_prayer , entrusting to the Rosary , to its choral recitation and to its constant practice , the most difficult problems . At times when Christianity itself seemed under threat , its deliverance was attributed to the power of this_prayer , and Our Lady of the Rosary was acclaimed as the one whose intercession brought salvation . Today I willingly entrust to the power of this_prayer \u2013 as I mentioned -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning \u2013 the cause of peace in the world and the cause of the family . The grave challenges confronting the world -atti_degli_apostoli- the start of this_new Millennium lead us to think_that only an intervention from on high , capable of guiding the hearts of those living in situations of conflict and those governing the destinies of nations , can_give reason to hope_for a brighter future . The Rosary -isaia- by its_nature a prayer_for peace , since it consists in the contemplation of Christ , the Prince of Peace , the one_who_-isaia- '' our peace '' Eph : . Anyone who assimilates the mystery of Christ \u2013 and this_-isaia- clearly_the goal of the Rosary \u2013 learns the secret of peace and makes it his_life s project . Moreover , by virtue of its meditative character , with the tranquil succession of Hail Marys , the Rosary has a peaceful effect on those_who pray it , disposing them to receive and experience in their innermost depths , and to spread around them , that true peace which_-isaia- the special gift of the Risen Lord cf . The Rosary -isaia-_also a prayer_for peace because of the fruits of charity_which it produces . When prayed well in a truly meditative way , the Rosary leads to an encounter_with Christ in his mysteries and so cannot_fail to draw attention to the face of Christ in others , especially in the most afflicted . How could one possibly contemplate the mystery of the Child of Bethlehem , in the joyful mysteries , without experiencing the desire to welcome , defend and promote life , and to shoulder the burdens of suffering children all over the world ? How could one possibly follow in the footsteps of Christ the Revealer , in the mysteries of light , without resolving to bear_witness to his '' Beatitudes '' in daily_life ? And how could one contemplate Christ carrying the Cross and Christ Crucified , without feeling the need to act as a '' Simon of Cyrene '' for our_brothers_and_sisters weighed down by grief or crushed by despair ? Finally , how could one possibly gaze upon the glory of the Risen Christ or of Mary Queen of Heaven , without yearning to make this_world more beautiful , more just , more_closely conformed to God s plan ? In a word , by focusing our_eyes on Christ , the Rosary also makes us peacemakers in the world . By its_nature as an insistent choral petition in harmony_with Christ s invitation to '' pray ceaselessly '' Lk : , the Rosary allows us to hope_that , even today , the difficult '' battle '' for peace can be won . Far from offering an escape from the problems of the world , the Rosary obliges us to see them_with responsible and generous eyes , and obtains for us the strength to face them_with_the certainty of God s help and the firm intention of bearing_witness in every situation to '' love_,_which binds everything together in perfect harmony '' Col : . The family : parents . As a prayer_for peace , the Rosary -isaia-_also , and always has_been , a prayer of and for the family . At one time this_prayer was particularly dear to Christian families , and it certainly brought them closer together . It -isaia- important not to lose this precious inheritance . We need to return to the practice of family prayer and prayer_for families , continuing to use the Rosary . In my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte I encouraged the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours by the lay_faithful in the ordinary life of parish communities and Christian groups ; I now wish to do the same for the Rosary . These two paths of Christian contemplation are_not mutually exclusive ; they complement one_another . I would therefore ask those_who devote_themselves to the pastoral_care of families to recommend heartily the recitation of the Rosary . The family that prays together stays together . The Holy Rosary , by age old tradition , has shown itself particularly effective as a prayer which brings the family together . Individual family members , in turning their_eyes towards Jesus , also regain the ability to look one_another in the eye , to communicate , to show solidarity , to forgive one_another and to see their covenant of love renewed in the Spirit of God . Many of the problems facing contemporary families , especially in economically developed societies , result from their increasing difficulty in communicating . Families seldom manage to come together , and the rare occasions when_they do are_often taken up with watching television . To return to the recitation of the family Rosary means filling daily_life with very different images , images of the mystery of salvation : the image of the Redeemer , the image of his_most Blessed Mother . The family that recites the Rosary together reproduces something of the atmosphere of the household of Nazareth : its_members place Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre , they share his joys and sorrows , they place their needs and their plans in his hands , they draw from him the hope and the strength to go on . It -isaia-_also beautiful and fruitful to entrust to this_prayer the growth and development of children . Does the Rosary not follow_the life of Christ , from his conception to his_death , and then to his Resurrection and his glory ? Parents are finding it ever_more difficult to follow_the lives of their_children as they grow to maturity . In a society of advanced technology , of mass communications and globalization , everything has become hurried , and the cultural distance between generations -isaia- growing ever_greater . The most diverse messages and the most unpredictable experiences rapidly make_their way into the lives of children and adolescents , and parents can become quite anxious about the dangers their_children face . At times parents suffer acute disappointment -atti_degli_apostoli- the failure of their_children to resist the seductions of the drug culture , the lure of an unbridled hedonism , the temptation to violence , and the manifold expressions of meaninglessness and despair . To pray the Rosary for children , and even_more , with children , training them_from their earliest years to experience this daily '' pause for prayer '' with the family , -isaia- admittedly not the solution to every problem , but_it_-isaia- a spiritual aid which_should not be underestimated . It could be objected that the Rosary seems hardly suited to the taste of children and young_people of today . But perhaps the objection -isaia-_directed to an impoverished method of praying it . Furthermore , without prejudice to the Rosary s basic structure , there_-isaia-_nothing to stop children and young_people from praying it \u2013 either within_the family or in groups \u2013 with appropriate symbolic and practical aids to understanding and appreciation . Why not try it ? With God s help , a pastoral approach to youth which_-isaia- positive , impassioned and creative \u2013 as shown by the World Youth Days ! \u2013 -isaia- capable of achieving quite remarkable results . If the Rosary -isaia- well presented , I -amos- sure_that young_people will once_more surprise adults by the way they_make this_prayer their_own and recite it with the enthusiasm typical of their age group . The Rosary , a treasure to be rediscovered . Dear brothers_and_sisters ! A prayer so easy and yet so rich truly deserves to be rediscovered by the Christian community . Let us do so , especially this_year , as a means of confirming the direction outlined in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte , from which_the pastoral plans of so many particular Churches have drawn inspiration as they look to the immediate future . I turn particularly to you , my dear Brother Bishops , priests and deacons , and to you , pastoral agents in your different ministries : through your_own personal experience of the beauty of the Rosary , may you come to promote it with conviction . I also place my trust in you , theologians : by your sage and rigorous reflection , rooted in the word of God and sensitive to the lived experience of the Christian people , may you help_them to discover the Biblical foundations , the spiritual riches and the pastoral value of this traditional prayer . I count on you , consecrated men_and_women , called in a particular_way to contemplate the face of Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Mary . I look to all of you , brothers_and_sisters of every state of life , to you , Christian families , to you , the sick and elderly , and to you , young_people : confidently take up the Rosary once_again . Rediscover the Rosary in the light of Scripture , in harmony_with_the Liturgy , and in the context of your daily lives . May this appeal of mine not go unheard ! At the start of the twenty fifth year of my Pontificate , I entrust this Apostolic Letter to the loving hands of the Virgin Mary , prostrating myself in spirit before her image in the splendid Shrine built for_her by Blessed Bartolo Longo , the apostle of the Rosary . I willingly make my own the touching words with_which he concluded his well_known Supplication to the Queen of the Holy Rosary : '' O Blessed Rosary of Mary , sweet chain which unites us to God , bond of love_which unites us to the angels , tower of salvation against the assaults of Hell , safe port in our universal shipwreck , we will_never abandon you . You will be our comfort in the hour of death : yours our final kiss as life ebbs away . And the last word from our lips will be your sweet name , O Queen of the Rosary of Pompei , O dearest Mother , O Refuge of Sinners , O Sovereign Consoler of the Afflicted . May you be everywhere blessed , today and always , on earth and in heaven '' . From the Vatican , on the th day of October in the year , the beginning of the twenty fifth year of my Pontificate .

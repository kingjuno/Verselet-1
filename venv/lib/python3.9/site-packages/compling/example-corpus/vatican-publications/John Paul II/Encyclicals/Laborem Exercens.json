And work means any activity by man , whether manual or intellectual , whatever its_nature or circumstances ; it means any human activity that_can and must be recognized as work , in the midst of all the many activities of which man_-isaia- capable and to which he -isaia- predisposed by his_very nature , by virtue of humanity itself . Man -isaia- made to be in the visible universe an image_and_likeness of God himself , and he -isaia- placed in it in order to subdue the earth . From the beginning therefore he -isaia- called to work . Work -isaia- one of the characteristics that distinguish man from the rest of creatures , whose activity for sustaining their_lives cannot be called work . Only man_-isaia- capable of work , and only man works , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time by work occupying his existence on earth . Thus work bears a particular mark of man and of humanity , the mark of a person operating within a community of persons . And this mark decides its interior characteristics ; in a sense it constitutes its_very nature . Human Work on the Ninetieth Anniversary of Rerum Novarum Since May of the present year was_the ninetieth anniversary of the publication by the great Pope of the '' social_question '' , Leo XIII , of the decisively important Encyclical which begins with the words Rerum Novarum , I wish to devote this document to human_work and , even_more , to man in the vast context of the reality of work . As I said in the Encyclical Redemptor Hominis , published -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my service in the See of Saint Peter in Rome , man '' -isaia- the primary and fundamental way_for the Church '' , precisely_because of the inscrutable mystery of Redemption in Christ ; and so it -isaia- necessary to return constantly to this_way and to follow it ever anew in the various aspects in which it shows us all the wealth and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time all the toil of human_existence on earth . Work -isaia- one of these aspects , a perennial and fundamental one , one that_-isaia- always relevant and constantly demands renewed attention and decisive witness . Because fresh questions and problems are always arising , there_are always fresh hopes , but_also fresh fears and threats , connected_with this basic dimension of human_existence : man s life_-isaia- built up every_day from work , from work it derives its specific dignity , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time work contains the unceasing measure of human toil and suffering , and also of the harm and injustice which penetrate deeply into social_life within individual nations and on the international level . While it -isaia- true_that man eats the bread produced by the work of his hands and this_means not_only the daily bread by which his_body keeps alive but_also the bread of science and progress , civilization and culture it -isaia-_also a perennial truth_that he eats this bread by '' the sweat of his face '' , that_-isaia- to say , not_only by personal effort and toil but_also in the midst of many tensions , conflicts and crises , which , in relationship_with the reality of work , disturb the life of individual societies and also of all humanity . We are celebrating the ninetieth anniversary of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum on the eve of new developments in technological , economic and political conditions which , according to many experts , will influence the world of work and production no less_than the industrial revolution of the last century . There are_many factors of a general nature : the widespread introduction of automation into many spheres of production , the increase in the cost of energy and raw materials , the growing realization that the heritage of nature_-isaia- limited and that_it_-isaia- being intolerably polluted , and the emergence on the political scene of peoples who , after centuries of subjection , are demanding their rightful place among the nations and in international decision making . These new conditions and demands will require a reordering and adjustment of the structures of the modern economy and of the distribution of work . Unfortunately , for millions of skilled workers these changes may perhaps mean unemployment , -atti_degli_apostoli- least for a time , or the need_for retraining . They will very probably involve a reduction or a less rapid increase in material well_being for the more developed countries . But they can_also bring relief and hope to the millions who today live in conditions of shameful and unworthy poverty . It -isaia- not_for the Church to analyze scientifically the consequences that_these changes may_have on human_society . But the Church considers it her task always to call attention to the dignity and rights of those_who work , to condemn situations in which that dignity and those rights are violated , and to help to guide the above mentioned changes so as to ensure authentic progress by man and society . In the Organic Development of the Church s Social Action It -isaia- certainly true_that work , as a human issue , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very centre of the '' social_question '' to which , for almost a hundred years , since_the publication of the above mentioned Encyclical , the Church s teaching and the many undertakings connected_with her apostolic mission have_been especially directed . The present reflections on work are_not intended to follow a different line , but_rather to be in organic connection_with the whole tradition of this_teaching and activity . At the same_time , however , I -amos- making them , according to the indication in the Gospel , in order to bring out from the heritage of the Gospel '' what_-isaia- new and what_-isaia- old '' . Certainly , work -isaia-_part of '' what_-isaia- old '' as old as man and his_life on earth . Nevertheless , the general situation of man in the modern_world , studied and analyzed in its various aspects of geography , culture and civilization , calls for the discovery of the new meanings of human_work . It likewise calls for the formulation of the new tasks that in this sector face each_individual , the family , each country , the whole_human_race , and , finally , the Church herself . During the years that separate us from the publication of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , the social_question has not ceased to engage the Church s attention . Evidence of this are the many documents of the Magisterium issued by the Popes and by the Second Vatican Council , pronouncements by individual Episcopates , and the activity of the various centres of thought and of practical apostolic initiatives , both on the international level and -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the local Churches . It -isaia- difficult to list here in detail all the manifestations of the commitment of the Church and of Christians in the social_question , for they_are too numerous . As a result of the Council , the main coordinating centre in this_field -isaia- the Pontifical Commission Justice and Peace , which_has corresponding bodies within_the individual Bishops Conferences . The name of this institution -isaia-_very significant . It indicates that the social_question must be dealt_with in its whole complex dimension . Commitment to justice must be closely linked_with commitment to peace in the modern_world . This twofold commitment -isaia- certainly supported by the painful experience of the two great world wars which in the course of the last ninety years have convulsed many European countries and , -atti_degli_apostoli- least partially , countries in other continents . It -isaia- supported , especially since_the Second World War , by the permanent threat of a nuclear war and the prospect of the terrible self destruction that emerges from it . If we follow_the main line of development of the documents of the supreme Magisterium of the Church , we find in them an explicit confirmation of precisely such a statement of the question . The key position , as regards the question of world peace , -isaia- that of John XXIII s Encyclical Pacem in Terris . However , if one studies the development of the question of social_justice , one cannot_fail to note that , whereas during the period between Rerum Novarum and Pius XI s Quadragesimo Anno the Church s teaching concentrates mainly on the just solution of the '' labour question '' within individual nations , in the next period the Church s teaching widens its horizon to take in the whole_world . The disproportionate distribution of wealth and poverty and the existence of some_countries and continents that_are developed and of others that_are not call_for a levelling out and for a search_for ways to ensure just development for all . This -isaia- the direction of the teaching in John XXIII s Encyclical Mater et Magistra , in the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et Spes of the Second Vatican Council , and in Paul VI s Encyclical Populorum Progressio . This trend of development of the Church s teaching and commitment in the social_question exactly corresponds to the objective recognition of the state of affairs . While in the past the '' class '' question was especially highlighted as the centre of this issue , in more recent_times it -isaia- the '' world '' question that_-isaia- emphasized . Thus , not_only the sphere of class -isaia- taken into consideration but_also the world sphere of inequality and injustice , and as a consequence , not_only the class dimension but_also the world dimension of the tasks involved in the path towards_the achievement of justice in the modern_world . A complete analysis of the situation of the world today shows in an even deeper and fuller way the meaning of the previous analysis of social injustices ; and it -isaia- the meaning that must_be_given today to efforts to build justice on earth , not concealing thereby unjust structures but demanding that_they be examined and transformed on a more universal scale . The Question of Work , the Key to the Social Question In the midst of all these processes those of the diagnosis of objective social reality and also those of the Church s teaching in the sphere of the complex and many sided social_question the question of human_work naturally appears many times . This issue -isaia- , in a way , a constant factor both of social_life and of the Church s teaching . Furthermore , in this_teaching attention to the question goes back much further than the last ninety years . In fact the Church s social_teaching finds_its source in Sacred Scripture , beginning with the Book of Genesis and especially in the Gospel and the writings of the Apostles . From the beginning it was part of the Church s teaching , her concept of man and life in society , and , especially , the social morality which_she worked out according to the needs of the different ages . This traditional patrimony was then inherited and developed by the teaching of the Popes on the modern '' social_question '' , beginning with the Encyclical Rerum Novarum . In this_context , study of the question of work , as we have_seen , has continually been brought up to date while maintaining that Christian basis of truth_which can be called ageless . While in the present document we return to this_question once_more without however any intention of touching on all the topics that concern it this_-isaia-_not merely in order to gather together and repeat what -isaia-_already contained in the Church s teaching . It -isaia- rather in order to highlight perhaps more_than has_been done before the fact that_human work_-isaia- a key , probably the essential key , to the whole social_question , if we try to see_that question really from the point_of_view of man s good . And if the solution or rather the gradual solution of the social_question , which keeps coming up and becomes ever_more complex , must be sought in the direction of '' making life more_human '' , then the key , namely human_work , acquires fundamental and decisive importance . WORK AND MAN . In the Book of Genesis The Church -isaia- convinced_that work_-isaia- a fundamental dimension of man s existence on earth . She -isaia- confirmed in this conviction by considering the whole heritage of the many sciences devoted to man : anthropology , palaeontology , history , sociology , psychology and so on ; they all seem to bear_witness to this reality in an irrefutable way . But the source of the Church s conviction -isaia- above all the revealed word of God , and therefore what_-isaia- a conviction of the intellect -isaia-_also a conviction of faith . The reason -isaia- that the Church and it -isaia- worthwhile stating it -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point believes in man : she thinks of man and addresses herself to him not_only in the light of historical experience , not only_with the aid of the many methods of scientific knowledge , but in the first_place in the light of the revealed word of the living God . Relating herself to man , she seeks to express the eternal designs and transcendent destiny which_the living God , the Creator and Redeemer , has linked_with him . The Church finds in the very first pages ofthe Book of Genesis the source of her conviction_that work_-isaia- a fundamental dimension of human_existence on earth . An analysis of these texts makes us aware_that they express sometimes in an archaic way of manifesting thought the fundamental truths about man , in the context of the mystery of creation itelf . These truths are decisive for_man from the very_beginning , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they trace out the main lines of his earthly existence , both in the state of original justice and also after_the breaking , caused by sin , of the Creator s original covenant with creation in man . When man_,_who had_been created '' in the image of God . male and female '' , hears the words : '' Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth and subdue it '' , even_though these_words do not refer directly and explicitly to work , beyond any doubt they indirectly indicate it as an activity for_man to carry_out in the world . Indeed , they show its_very deepest essence . Man -isaia- the image of God partly through the mandate received_from his Creator to subdue , to dominate , the earth . In carrying_out this mandate , man , every_human_being , reflects the very action of the Creator of the universe . Work understood as a '' transitive '' activity , that_-isaia- to say an activity beginning in the human subject and directed towards an external object , presupposes a specific dominion by man over '' the earth '' , and in its turn it confirms and develops this dominion . It -isaia- clear_that the term '' the earth '' of which_the biblical text speaks -isaia- to be understood in the flrst place as that fragment of the visible universe that_man inhabits . By extension , however , it can be understood as the whole of the visible world insofar as it comes within_the range of man s influence and of his striving to satisfy his needs . The expression '' subdue the earth '' has an immense range . It means all the resources that the earth and indirectly the visible world contains and which , through the conscious activity of man , can be discovered and used for his ends . And so these_words , placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Bible , never cease to be relevant . They embrace equally the past ages of civilization and economy , as also the whole of modern reality and future phases of development , which_are perhaps already to some extent beginning to take shape , though for the most part they are_still almost unknown to man and hidden from him . While people sometimes speak of periods of '' acceleration '' in the economic_life and civilization of humanity or of individual nations , linking these periods to the progress of science and technology and especially to discoveries which_are decisive for social_and_economic life , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it can_be_said that none of these phenomena of '' acceleration '' exceeds the essential content of what_was said in that_most ancient of biblical texts . As man , through_his work , becomes more_and_more the master of the earth , and as he confirms his dominion over the visible world , again through_his work , he nevertheless remains in every case and -atti_degli_apostoli- every phase of this_process within_the Creator s original ordering . And this ordering remains necessarily and indissolubly linked_with the fact_that man was created , as male and female , '' in the image of God '' . This process -isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , universal : it embraces all human_beings , every generation , every phase of economic and cultural development , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia- a process that takes_place within each human_being , in each conscious human subject . Each and every_individual -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time embraced by it . Each and every_individual , to the proper extent and in an incalculable number of ways , takes part in the giant process whereby man '' subdues the earth '' through_his work . Work in the Objective Sense : Technology This universality and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , this multiplicity of the process of '' subduing the earth '' throw light upon human_work , because man s dominion over the earth -isaia- achieved in and by means of work . There thus emerges the meaning of work in an objective sense , which finds expression in the various epochs of culture and civilization . Man dominates the earth by the very_fact of domesticating animals , rearing them and obtaining from them the food and clothing he needs , and by the fact of being able to extract various natural resources from the earth and the seas . But man '' subdues the earth '' much_more when he begins to cultivate it and then to transform its products , adapting them to his_own use . Thus agriculture constitutes through human_work a primary field of economic activity and an indispensable factor of production . Industry in its turn will_always consist in linking the earth s riches whether nature s living resources , or the products of agriculture , or the mineral or chemical resources with_man s work , whether physical or intellectual . This -isaia-_also in a sense true in the sphere of what are_called service industries , and also in the sphere of research , pure or applied . In industry and agriculture man s work has today in many cases ceased to be mainly manual , for the toil of human hands and muscles -isaia- aided by more_and_more highly perfected machinery . Not only in industry but_also in agriculture we are witnessing the transformations made possible by the gradual development of science and technology . Historically speaking , this , taken as a whole , has caused great changes in civilization , from the beginning of the '' industrial era '' to the successive phases of development through new technologies , such as the electronics and the microprocessor technology in recent_years . While it may seem that in the industrial process it -isaia- the machine that '' works '' and man merely supervises it , making it function and keeping it going in various_ways , it -isaia-_also true_that for this_very reason industrial development provides grounds for reproposing in new ways the question of human_work . Both the original industrialization that gave rise to what_-isaia- called the worker question and the subsequent industrial and post industrial changes show in an eloquent manner that , even in the age of ever_more mechanized '' work '' , the proper subject of work continues to be man . The development of industry and of the various sectors connected_with it , even the most modern electronics technology , especially in the fields of miniaturization , communications and telecommunications and so forth , shows how vast -isaia- the role of technology , that ally of work that_human thought has produced , in the interaction between_the subject and object of work in the widest sense of the word . Understood in this case not as a capacity or aptitude for work , but_rather as a whole set of instruments which_man uses in his_work , technology -isaia- undoubtedly man s ally . It facilitates his_work , perfects , accelerates and augments it . It leads to an increase in the quantity of things produced by work , and in many cases improves their quality . However , it -isaia-_also a fact_that , in some instances , technology can cease to be man s ally and become almost his enemy , as when_the mechanization of work '' supplants '' him , taking away all personal satisfaction and the incentive to creativity and responsibility , when it deprives many workers of their previous employment , or when , through exalting the machine , it reduces man to the status of its slave . If the biblical words '' subdue the earth '' addressed to man from the very_beginning are understood in the context of the whole modern age , industrial and post industrial , then they undoubtedly include also a relationship_with technology , with the world of machinery which_-isaia- the fruit of the work of the human intellect and a historical confirmation of man s dominion over nature . The recent stage of human_history , especially that of certain societies , brings a correct affirmation of technology as a basic coefficient of economic progress ; but , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , this affirmation has_been accompanied by and continues to be accompanied by the raising of essential questions concerning human_work in relationship to its subject , which_-isaia- man . These questions are particularly charged with content and tension of an ethical and an ethical and social character . They therefore constitute a continual challenge for institutions of many kinds , for States and governments , for systems and international organizations ; they_also constitute a challenge for the Church . Work in the Subjective Sense : Man as the Subject of Work In order to continue our analysis of work , an analysis linked_with the word of the Bible telling man that_he_-isaia- to subdue the earth , we must concentrate our attention on work in the subjective sense , much more_than we did on the objective significance , barely touching upon the vast range of problems known intimately and in detail to scholars in various fields and also , according_to_their specializations , to those_who work . If the words of the Book of Genesis to which we refer in this analysis of ours speak of work in the objective sense in an indirect way , they_also speak only indirectly of the subject of work ; but what_they say -isaia-_very eloquent and -isaia- full of great significance . Man has to subdue the earth and dominate it , because as the '' image of God '' he -isaia- a person , that_-isaia- to say , a subjective being capable of acting in a planned and rational way , capable of deciding about himself , and with a tendency to self realization . As a person , man_-isaia- therefore the subject ot work . As a person he works , he performs various actions belonging to the work process ; independently of their objective content , these actions must all serve to realize his humanity , to fulfil the calling to be a person that_-isaia- his by reason of his_very humanity . The principal truths concerning this theme were recently recalled by the Second Vatican Council in the Constitution Gaudium et Spes , especially in Chapter One , which_-isaia- devoted to man s calling . And so this '' dominion '' spoken of in the biblical text being meditated upon here refers not_only to the objective dimension of work but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time introduces us to an understanding of its subjective dimension . Understood as a process whereby man and the human_race subdue the earth , work corresponds to this basic biblical concept only_when throughout_the process man manifests himself and confirms himself as the one_who '' dominates '' . This dominion , in a certain_sense , refers to the subjective dimension even_more than to the objective one : this dimension conditions the very ethical nature of work . In fact there_-isaia- no doubt_that human_work has an ethical value of its_own , which clearly and directly remain linked to the fact_that the one_who carries it out -isaia- a person , a conscious and free subject , that_-isaia- to say a subject that decides about himself . This truth , which in a sense constitutes the fundamental and perennial heart of Christian teaching on human_work , has had and continues to have primary significance for the formulation of the important social problems characterizing whole ages . The ancient world introduced its_own typical differentiation of people into dasses according to the type of work done . Work which demanded from the worker the exercise of physical strength , the work of muscles and hands , was considered unworthy of free men , and was therefore given to slaves . By broadening certain aspects that already belonged to the Old Testament , Christianity brought_about a fundamental change of ideas in this_field , taking the whole content of the Gospel message as its point of departure , especially_the fact_that the one_who , while being God , became like us in all things devoted most of the years of his_life on earth to manual work -atti_degli_apostoli- the carpenter s bench . This circumstance constitutes in itself the most eloquent '' Gospel of work '' , showing that the basis for determining the value of human work_-isaia- not primarily the kind of work being done but the fact_that the one_who_-isaia- doing it -isaia- a person . The sources of the dignity of work are to be sought primarily in the subjective dimension , not in the objective one . Such a concept practically does away with the very basis of the ancient differentiation of people into classes according to the kind of work done . This does_not_mean that , from the objective point_of_view , human_work cannot and must_not be rated and qualified in any_way . It only means_that the primary basis of tbe value of work_-isaia- man_himself , who_-isaia- its subject . This leads immediately to a very_important conclusion of an ethical nature : however true it may be that man_-isaia- destined for work and called to it , in the first_place work_-isaia- '' for_man '' and not man '' for work '' . Through this conclusion one rightly comes to recognize_the pre eminence of the subjective meaning of work over the objective one . Given this_way of understanding things , and presupposing that different sorts of work that people do can have greater or lesser objective value , let us try nevertheless to show that_each sort -isaia- judged above all by the measure of the dignity of the subject of work , that_-isaia- to say the person , the individual who carries it out . On the other_hand : independently of the work that_every man does , and presupposing that_this work constitutes a purpose -atti_degli_apostoli- times a very demanding one of his activity , this_purpose does_not possess a definitive meaning in itself . In fact , in the final analysis it -isaia- always man who_-isaia- the purpose of the work , whatever work it -isaia- that_-isaia- done by man even if the common scale of values rates it as the merest '' service '' , as the most monotonous even the most alienating work . A Threat to the Right Order of Values It -isaia- precisely these fundamental affirmations about work that always emerged from the wealth of Christian truth , especially from the very message of the '' Gospel of work '' , thus creating the basis for a new_way of thinking , judging and acting . In the modern period , from the beginning of the industrial age , the Christian truth_about work had to oppose the various trends of materialistic and economistic thought . For certain supporters of such ideas , work was understood and treated as a sort of '' merchandise '' that the worker especially_the industrial worker sells to the employer , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- the possessor of the capital , that_-isaia- to say , of all the working tools and means_that make production possible . This way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- work was widespread especially in the first half of the nineteenth century . Since then , explicit expressions of this_sort have almost disappeared , and have_given way to more_human ways of thinking about work and evaluating it . The interaction between_the worker and the tools and means_of_production has_given rise to the development of various_forms of capitalism parallel with various_forms of collectivism into which other socioeconomic elements have entered as a consequence of new concrete circumstances , of the activity of workers associations and public autorities , and of the emergence of large transnational enterprises . Nevertheless , the danger of treating work as a special kind of '' merchandise '' , or as an impersonal '' force '' needed_for production the expression '' workforce '' -isaia-_in_fact in common use always exists , especially_when the whole way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the question of economics -isaia- marked by the premises of materialistic economism . A systematic opportunity_for thinking and evaluating in this_way , and in a certain_sense a stimulus for doing so , -isaia- provided by the quickening process of the development of a onesidedly materialistic civilization , which_gives prime importance to the objective dimension of work , while the subjective dimension everything in direct or indirect relationship_with the subject of work remains on a secondary level . In all cases of this_sort , in every social situation of this type , there_-isaia- a confusion or even a reversal of the order laid_down from the beginning by the words of the Book of Genesis : man_-isaia- treated as an instrument of production , whereas he he alone , independently of the work he does ought to be treated as the effective subject of work and its true maker and creator . Precisely this reversal of order , whatever the programme or name under which it occurs , should rightly be called '' capitalism '' in the sense more_fully explained below . Everybody knows that capitalism has a definite historical meaning as a system , an economic_and_social system , opposed to '' socialism '' or '' communism '' . But in the light of the analysis of the fundamental reality of the whole economic process first_and_foremost of the production structure that work_-isaia- it should be recognized that the error of early capitalism can be repeated wherever man_-isaia- in a way treated on the same level as the whole complex of the material means_of_production , as an instrument and not in accordance_with_the true dignity of his_work that_-isaia- to say , where he -isaia- not treated as subject and maker , and for this_very reason as the true purpose of the whole process of production . This explains why_the analysis of human_work in the light of the words concerning man s '' dominion '' over the earth goes to the very_heart of the ethical and social_question . This concept should_also find a central place in the whole sphere of social_and_economic policy , both within individual countries and in the wider field of international and intercontinental relationships , particularly with reference to the tensions making themselves felt in the world not_only between East and West but_also between North and South . Both John XXIII in the Encyclical Mater et Magistra and Paul VI in the Encyclical Populorum Progressio gave special_attention to these dimensions of the modern ethical and social_question . Worker Solidarity When dealing_with human_work in the fundamental dimension of its subject , that_-isaia- to say , the human_person doing the work , one_must make -atti_degli_apostoli- least a summary evaluation of developments during the ninety years since Rerum Novarum in relation to the subjective dimension of work . Although the subject of work_-isaia- always the same , that_-isaia- to say man , nevertheless wide ranging changes take_place in the objective aspect . While one_can say that , by reason of its subject , work_-isaia- one single thing one and unrepeatable every time , yet when one takes into consideration its objective directions one_-isaia- forced to admit that_there exist many works , many_different sorts of work . The development of human civilization brings continual enrichment in this_field . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , one cannot_fail to note that in the process of this development not_only do new_forms of work appear but_also others disappear . Even if one accepts that on the whole this_-isaia- a normal phenomenon , it must still be seen whether certain ethically and socially dangerous irregularities creep in , and to what extent . It was precisely one such wide ranging anomaly that gave rise in the last century to what_has_been called '' the worker question '' , sometimes described as '' the proletariat question '' . This question and the problems connected_with it gave rise to a just social reaction and caused the impetuous emergence of a great burst of solidarity between workers , first_and_foremost industrial workers . The call to solidarity and common action addressed to the workers especially to those engaged in narrowly specialized , monotonous and depersonalized work in industrial plants , when_the machine tends to dominate man was important and eloquent from the point_of_view of social ethics . It was_the reaction against the degradation of man as the subject of work , and against the unheard of accompanying exploitation in the field of wages , working conditions and social security for the worker . This reaction united the working world in a community marked by great solidarity . Following tlle lines laid dawn by the Encyclical Rerum Novarum and many later documents of the Church s Magisterium , it must be frankly recognized that the reaction against the system of injustice and harm that cried to heaven for vengeance and that weighed heavily upon workers in that period of rapid industrialization was justified from the point_of_view of social morality . This state of affairs was favoured by the liberal socio political system , which , in accordance_with its '' economistic '' premises , strengthened and safeguarded economic initiative by the possessors of capital alone , but did_not pay sufficient attention to the rights of the workers , on the grounds that_human work_-isaia- solely an instrument of production , and that capital -isaia- the basis , efficient factor and purpose of production . From that_time , worker solidarity , together_with a clearer and more committed realization by others of workers rights , has in many cases brought_about profound changes . Various forms of neo capitalism or collectivism have developed . Various new systems have_been thought out . Workers can often share in running businesses and in controlling their productivity , and in fact do so . Through appropriate associations , they exercise influence over conditions of work and pay , and also over social legislation . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time various ideological or power systems , and new relationships which_have arisen -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels of society , have allowed flagrant injustices to persist or have created new ones . On the world level , the development of civilization and of communications has made possible a more complete diagnosis of the living and working conditions of man globally , but it has_also revealed other_forms of injustice , much_more extensive than those_which in the last century stimulated unity between workers for particular solidarity in the working world . This -isaia- true in countries which_have completed a certain process of industrial revolution . It -isaia-_also true in countries where_the main working milieu continues to be agriculture or other similar occupations . Movements of solidarity in the sphere of work a solidarity that must_never mean being closed to dialogue and collaboration with_others can be necessary also_with reference to the condition of social groups that were_not previously included in such movements but_which , in changing social systems and conditions of living , are undergoing what_-isaia- in effect '' proletarianization '' or which actually already find_themselves in a '' proletariat '' situation , one_which , even if not_yet given that name , in fact deserves it . This can be true of certain categories or groups of the working '' intelligentsia '' , especially_when ever wider access to education and an ever_increasing number of people_with degrees or diplomas in the fields of their cultural preparation are accompanied by a drop in demand for their labour . This unemployment of intellectuals occurs or increases when_the education available -isaia- not oriented towards_the types of employment or service required by the true needs of society , or when there_-isaia- less demand for work_which requires education , -atti_degli_apostoli- least professional education , than for manual labour , or when_it_-isaia- less well paid . Of course , education in itself_-isaia- always valuable and an important enrichment of the human_person ; but in spite of that , '' proletarianization '' processes remain possible . For this_reason , there_must be continued study of the subject of work and of the subject s living conditions . In order to achieve social_justice in the various parts_of_the_world , in the various countries , and in the relationships between_them , there_-isaia-_a_need for ever_new movements of solidarity of the workers and with the workers . This solidarity must be present whenever it -isaia- called_for by the social degrading of the subject of work , by exploitation of the workers , and by the growing areas of poverty and even hunger . The Church -isaia- firmly committed to this cause , for she considers it her_mission , her service , a proof of her fidelity to Christ , so that_she can truly be the '' Church of the poor '' . And the '' poor '' appear under various_forms ; they appear in various places and -atti_degli_apostoli- various times ; in many cases they appear as a result of the violation of the dignity of human_work : either because the opportunities_for human_work are limited as a result of the scourge of unemployment , or because a low value -isaia- put on work and the rights that flow from it , especially_the right to a just wage and to the personal security of the worker and his or her family . Work and Personal Dignity Remaining within_the context of man as the subject of work , it -isaia-_now appropriate to touch upon , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in a summary way , certain problems that more_closely define the dignity of human_work , in that_they make it possible to characterize more_fully its specific moral value . In doing this we must_always keep in mind the biblical calling to '' subdue the earth '' , in which_-isaia- expressed the will of the Creator that work should enable man to achieve that '' dominion '' in the visible world that_-isaia- proper to him . God s fundamental and original intention with_regard to man , whom he created in his image and after_his likeness , was_not withdrawn or cancelled out even_when man , having broken the original covenant with God , heard the words : '' In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread '' . These words refer to the sometimes heavy toil that_from then onwards has accompanied human_work ; but they_do_not alter the fact_that work_-isaia- the means whereby man achieves that '' dominion '' which_-isaia- proper to him over the visible world , by '' subjecting '' the earth . Toil -isaia- something_that -isaia- universally known , for it -isaia- universally experienced . It -isaia- familiar to those doing physical work under sometimes exceptionally laborious conditions . It -isaia- familiar not_only to agricultural workers , who spend long days working the land , which sometimes '' bears thorns and thistles '' , but_also to those_who work in mines and quarries , to steel workers -atti_degli_apostoli- their blast furnaces , to those_who work in builders yards and in construction work , often in danger of injury or death . It -isaia- likewise familiar to those -atti_degli_apostoli- an intellectual workbench ; to scientists ; to those_who bear the burden of grave responsibility_for decisions that_will have a vast impact on society . It -isaia- familiar to doctors and nurses , who spend days and nights -atti_degli_apostoli- their patients bedside . It -isaia- familiar to women , who , sometimes without proper recognition on the part of society and even of their_own families , bear the daily burden and responsibility_for their homes and the upbringing of their_children . It -isaia- familiar to all workers and , since work_-isaia- a universal calling , it -isaia- familiar to everyone . And yet , in spite of all this toil perhaps , in a sense , because of it work_-isaia- a good thing for_man . Even though it bears the mark of a bonum arduum , in the terminology of Saint Thomas , this_does_not take away the fact_that , as such , it -isaia- a good thing for_man . It -isaia-_not_only good in the sense that_it_-isaia- useful or something to enjoy ; it -isaia-_also good as being something worthy , that_-isaia- to say , something_that corresponds to man s dignity , that expresses this dignity and increases it . If one wishes to define more_clearly the ethical meaning of work , it -isaia- this_truth that one_must particularly keep in mind . Work -isaia- a good thing for_man a good thing for his humanity because through work man not_only transforms nature , adapting it to his_own needs , but he also achieves fulfilment as a human_being and indeed , in a sense , becomes '' more a human_being '' . Without this consideration it -isaia- impossible to understand_the meaning of the virtue of industriousness , and more particularly it -isaia- impossible to understand why industriousness should be a virtue : for virtue , as a moral habit , -isaia- something whereby man becomes good as man . This fact in no way alters our justifiable anxiety that in work , whereby matter gains in nobility , man_himself should_not experience a lowering of his_own dignity . Again , it -isaia- well_known that_it_-isaia- possible to use work in various_ways against man , that_it_-isaia- possible to punish man with the system of forced labour in concentration camps , that work can be made into a means_for oppressing man , and that in various_ways it -isaia- possible to exploit human labour , that_-isaia- to say the worker . All this pleads in favour of the moral obligation to link industriousness as a virtue with the social_order of work , which will_enable man to become , in work , '' more a human_being '' and not be degraded by it not only_because of the wearing out of his physical strength which , -atti_degli_apostoli- least up to a certain point , -isaia- inevitable , but especially through damage to the dignity and subjectivity that_are proper to him . Work and Society : Family and Nation Having thus conflrmed the personal dimension of human_work , we must go on to the second sphere of values which_-isaia- necessarily linked to work . Work constitutes a foundation for the formation of family_life , which_-isaia- a natural right and something_that man_-isaia- called to . These two spheres of values one linked to work and the other consequent on the family nature of human_life must be properly united and must properly permeate each_other . In a way , work_-isaia- a condition_for making it possible to found a family , since_the family requires the means of subsistence which_man normally gains through work . Work and industriousness also influence the whole process of education in the family , for the very reason_that everyone '' becomes a human_being '' through , among other_things , work , and becoming a human_being -isaia- precisely_the main purpose of the whole process of education . Obviously , two aspects of work in a sense come into play here : the one making family_life and its upkeep possible , and the other making possible the achievement of the purposes of the family , especially education . Nevertheless , these_two aspects of work are linked to one_another and are mutually complementary in various points . It must be remembered and affirmed that the family constitutes one_of_the_most important terms of reference for shaping the social and ethical order of human_work . The teaching of the Church has_always devoted special_attention to this_question , and in the present document we shall_have to return to it . In fact , the family_-isaia- simultaneously a community made possible by work and the first school of work , within_the home , for every_person . The third sphere of values that emerges from this point_of_view that of the subject of work concerns the great society to which_man belongs on the basis of particular cultural and historical links . This society even_when it has not_yet taken on the mature form of a nation -isaia-_not_only the great '' educator '' of every man , even_though an indirect one because each_individual absorbs within_the family the contents and values that go to make up the culture of a given nation ; it -isaia-_also a great historical and social incarnation of the work of all generations . All of this brings it about_that man combines his deepest human identity with membership of a nation , and intends his_work also to increase the common_good developed together_with his compatriots , thus realizing that in this_way work serves to add to the heritage of the whole human_family , of all the people living in the world . These three spheres are always important_for human_work in its subjective dimension . And this dimension , that_-isaia- to say , the concrete reality of the worker , takes precedence over the objective dimension . In the subjective dimension there_-isaia- realized , first of all , that '' dominion '' over the world of nature to which man_-isaia- called from the beginning according to the words of the Book of Genesis . The very process of '' subduing the earth '' , that_-isaia- to say work , -isaia- marked in the course of history , and especially in recent centuries , by an immense development of technological means . This -isaia- an advantageous and positive phenomenon , on condition that the objective dimension of work does_not gain the upper hand over the subjective dimension , depriving man of his dignity and inalienable rights or reducing them . CONFLICT BETWEEN LABOUR AND CAPITAL IN THE PRESENT PHASE OF HISTORY . Dimensions of the Conflict The sketch of the basic problems of work outlined above draws inspiration from the texts -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Bible and in a sense forms the very framework of the Church s teaching , which_has remained unchanged throughout_the centuries within_the context of different historical experiences . However , the experiences preceding and following the publication of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum form a background that endows that teaching with particular expressiveness and the eloquence of living relevance . In this analysis , work_-isaia- seen as a great reality with a fundamental influence on the shaping in a human way of the world_that the Creator has_entrusted to man ; it -isaia- a reality closely linked_with man as the subject of work and with_man s rational activity . In the normal course of events this reality fills human_life and strongly affects its value and meaning . Even when_it_-isaia- accompanied by toil and effort , work_-isaia- still something good , and so man develops through love for work . This entirely positive and creative , educational and meritorious character of man s work must be the basis for the judgments and decisions being made today in its regard in spheres that include human_rights , as -isaia- evidenced by the international declarations on work and the many labour codes prepared either by the competent legislative institutions in the various countries or by organizations devoting their social , or scientific and social , activity to the problems of work . One organization fostering such initiatives on the international level -isaia- the International Labour Organization , the oldest specialized agency of the United Nations Organization . In the following part of these considerations I intend to return in greater detail to these important questions , recalling -atti_degli_apostoli- least the basic elements of the Church s teaching on the matter . I must however first touch on a very_important field of questions in which her teaching has_taken shape in this latest period , the one marked and in a sense symbolized by the publication of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum . Throughout this period , which_-isaia- by no means yet over , the issue of work has of course been posed on the basis of the great conflict that in the age of , and together_with , industrial development emerged between '' capital '' and '' labour '' , that_-isaia- to say between_the small but highly influential group of entrepreneurs , owners or holders of the means_of_production , and the broader multitude of people_who lacked these means and who shared in the process of production solely by their labour . The conflict originated in the fact_that the workers put their powers -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the entrepreneurs , and these , following the principle of maximum profit , tried to establish the lowest possible wages for the work done by the employees . In addition there_were other elements of exploitation , connected_with_the lack of safety -atti_degli_apostoli- work and of safeguards regarding the health and living conditions of the workers and their_families . This conflict , interpreted by some as a socioeconomic class conflict , found expression in the ideological conflict between liberalism , understood as the ideology of capitalism , and Marxism , understood as the ideology of scientiflc socialism and communism , which professes to act as the spokesman for the working class and the worldwide proletariat . Thus the real conflict between labour and capital was transformed into a systematic class struggle , conducted not_only by ideological means but_also and chiefly by political means . We are familiar with the history of this conflict and with the demands of both sides . The Marxist programme , based on the philosophy of Marx and Engels , sees in class struggle the only way to eliminate class injustices in society and to eliminate the classes themselves . Putting this programme into_practice presupposes the collectivization of the means_of_production so that , through the transfer of these means from private hands to the collectivity , human labour will be preserved from exploitation . This -isaia- the goal of the struggle carried on by political as well as ideological means . In accordance_with_the principle of '' the dictatorship of the proletariat '' , the groups that as political parties follow_the guidance of Marxist ideology aim by the use of various kinds of influence , including revolutionary pressure , to win a monopoly of power in each society , in order to introduce the collectivist system into it by eliminating private ownership of the means_of_production . According to the principal ideologists and leaders of this broad international movement , the purpose of this programme of action -isaia- to achieve the social revolution and to introduce socialism and , finally , the communist system throughout_the_world . As we touch on this extremely important field of issues , which constitute not_only a theory but a whole fabric of socioeconomic , political , and international life in our_age , we cannot go into the details , nor_-isaia- this necessary , for they_are known both from the vast literature on the subject and by experience . Instead , we must leave the context of these issues and go back to the fundamental issue of human_work , which_-isaia- the main subject of the considerations in this document . It -isaia- clear , indeed , that_this issue , which_-isaia- of such importance for_man it constitutes one of the fundamental dimensions of his earthly existence and of his vocation can_also be explained only by taking into_account_the full context of the contemporary situation . The Priority of Labour The structure of the present_day situation -isaia- deeply marked by many conflicts caused by man , and the technological means produced by human_work play a primary role in it . We should_also consider here_the prospect of worldwide catastrophe in the case of a nuclear war , which_would have almost unimaginable possibilities of destruction . In view of this situation we must first of all recall a principle that has_always_been taught by the Church : the principle ot the priority of labour over capital . This principle directly concerns the process of production : in this_process labour -isaia- always a primary efficient cause , while capital , the whole collection of means_of_production , remains a mere instrument or instrumental cause . This principle -isaia- an evident truth_that emerges from the whole of man s historical experience . When we read in the first chapter of the Bible that man_-isaia- to subdue the earth , we know_that these_words refer to all the resources contained in the visible world and placed -atti_degli_apostoli- man s disposal . However , these resources can serve man only through work . From the beginning there_-isaia-_also linked_with work the question of ownership , for the only means_that man_has for causing the resources hidden in nature to serve himself and others -isaia-_his work . And to be able through_his work to make these resources bear_fruit , man takes over ownership of small parts of the various riches of nature : those beneath the ground , those in the sea , on land , or in space . He takes all these_things over by making them his workbench . He takes them over through work and for work . The same principle applies in the successive phases of this_process , in which_the first phase always remains the relationship of man with the resources and riches of nature . The whole of the effort to acquire knowledge with the aim of discovering these riches and specifying the various_ways in which_they can be used by man and for_man teaches us that everything_that comes_from man throughout_the whole process of economic production , whether labour or the whole collection of means_of_production and the technology connected_with these means meaning the capability to use them in work , presupposes these riches and resources of the visible world , riches and resources that_man finds and does_not create . In a sense man finds them already prepared , ready for him to discover them and to use them correctly in the productive process . In every phase of the development of his_work man comes up against the leading role of the gift made by '' nature '' , that_-isaia- to say , in the final analysis , by the Creator At the beginning of man s work_-isaia- the mystery of creation . This affirmation , already indicated as my starting point , -isaia- the guiding thread of this document , and will be further developed in the last part of these reflections . Further consideration of this_question should confirm our conviction of the priority of human labour over what in the course of time we have grown accustomed to calling capital . Since the concept of capital includes not_only the natural resources placed -atti_degli_apostoli- man s disposal but_also the whole collection of means by which_man appropriates natural resources and transforms them in accordance_with his needs and thus in a sense humanizes them , it must immediately be noted_that all these means are the result of the historical heritage of human labour . All the means_of_production , from the most primitive to the ultramodern ones it -isaia-_man that_has gradually developed them : man s experience and intellect . In this_way there have appeared not_only the simplest instruments for cultivating the earth but_also , through adequate progress in science and technology , the more modern and complex ones : machines , factories , laboratories , and computers . Thus everything_that -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of work , everything_that in the present state of technology constitutes its ever_more highly perfected '' instrument '' , -isaia- the result of work . This gigantic and powerful instrument the whole collection of means_of_production that in a sense are considered synonymous with '' capital '' -isaia- the result of work and bears the signs of human labour . At the present stage of technological advance , when man , who_-isaia- the subjectof work , wishes to make_use of this collection of modern instruments , the means_of_production , he must first assimilate cognitively the result of the work of the people_who invented those instruments , who planned them , built them and perfected them , and who continue to do so . Capacity for work that_-isaia- to say , for sharing efficiently in the modern production process demands greater and greater preparation and , before all else , proper training . Obviously , it remains clear_that every_human_being sharing in the production process , even if he or she_-isaia- only doing the kind of work for_which no special training or qualifications are required , -isaia- the real efficient subject in this production process , while the whole collection of instruments , no matter how perfect they_may be in themselves , are only a mere instrument subordinate to human labour . This truth , which_-isaia- part of the abiding heritage of the Church s teaching , must_always be emphasized with reference to the question of the labour system and with_regard to the whole socioeconomic system . We must emphasize and give prominence to the primacy of man in the production process , the primacy of man over things . Everything contained in the concept of capital in the strict sense -isaia- only a collection of things . Man , as the subject of work , and independently of the work that he does man alone_-isaia- a person . This truth has important and decisive consequences . Economism and Materialism In the light of the above truth we see clearly , first of all , that capital cannot be separated_from labour ; in no way can labour be opposed to capital or capital to labour , and still less can the actual people behind these concepts be opposed to each_other , as will be explained later . A labour system can be right , in the sense of being in conformity_with_the very essence of the issue , and in the sense of being intrinsically true and also morally legitimate , if in its_very basis it overcomes the opposition between labour and capital through an effort -atti_degli_apostoli- being shaped in accordance_with_the principle put forward above : the principle of the substantial and real priority of labour , of the subjectivity of human labour and its effective participation in the whole production process , independently of the nature of the services provided by the worker . Opposition between labour and capital does_not spring from the structure of the production process or from the structure of the economic process . In general the latter process demonstrates that labour and what we are accustomed to call capital are intermingled ; it shows that_they_are inseparably linked . Working -atti_degli_apostoli- any workbench , whether a relatively primitive or an ultramodern one , a man can easily see that_through his_work he enters into two inheritances : the inheritance of what_-isaia- given to the whole of humanity in the resources of nature , and the inheritance of what others have_already developed on the basis of those resources , primarily by developing technology , that_-isaia- to say , by producing a whole collection of increasingly perfect instruments for work . In working , man also '' enters into the labour of others '' . Guided both by our intelligence and by the faith_that draws light from the word of God , we have no difficulty in accepting this image of the sphere and process of man s labour . It -isaia- a consistent image , one that_-isaia- humanistic as well as theological . In it man_-isaia- the master of the creatures placed -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal in the visible world . If some dependence -isaia- discovered in the work process , it -isaia- dependence on the Giver of all the resources of creation , and also on other human_beings , those to whose work and initiative we owe the perfected and increased possibilities of our_own work . All that_we_can say of everything in the production process which constitutes a whole collection of '' things '' , the instruments , the capital , -isaia- that it conditions man s work ; we cannot assert that it constitutes as it were an impersonal '' subject '' putting man and man s work into a position of dependence . This consistent image , in which_the principle of the primacy of person over things -isaia- strictly preserved , was broken up in human thought , sometimes after a long period of incubation in practical living . The break occurred in such_a_way_that labour was separated_from capital and set in opposition to it , and capital was set in opposition to labour , as though_they were two impersonal forces , two production factors juxtaposed in the same '' economistic '' perspective . This way of stating the issue contained a fundamental error , what we can call the error of economism , that of considering human labour solely according to its economic purpose . This fundamental error of thought can and must be called an error of materialism , in that economism directly or indirectly includes a conviction of the primacy and superiority of the material , and directly or indirectly places the spiritual and the personal man s activity , moral values and such matters in a position of subordination to material reality . This -isaia- still not theoretical materialism in the full sense of the term , but_it_-isaia- certainly practical materialism , a materialism judged capable of satisfying man s needs , not_so_much on the grounds of premises derived_from materialist theory , as on the grounds of a particular_way of evaluating things , and so on the grounds of a certain hierarchy of goods based on the greater immediate attractiveness of what_-isaia- material . The error of thinking in the categories of economism went hand in hand with the formation of a materialist philosophy , as this philosophy developed from the most elementary and common phase also called common materialism , because it professes to reduce spiritual reality to a superfluous phenomenon to the phase of what_-isaia- called dialectical materialism . However , within_the framework of the present consideration , it seems that economism had a decisive importancefor the fundamental issue of human_work , in particular for the separation of labour and capital and for setting them up in opposition as two production factors viewed in the above mentioned economistic perspective ; and it seems that economism influenced this non humanistic way of stating the issue before the materialist philosophical system did . Nevertheless it -isaia- obvious that materialism , including its dialectical form , -isaia- incapable of providing sufficient and definitive bases for thinking about human_work , in order_that the primacy of man over the capital instrument , the primacy of the person over things , may find in it adequate and irrefutable confirmation and support . In dialectical materialism too man_-isaia- not first_and_foremost the subject of work and the efficient cause of the production process , but continues to be understood and treated , in dependence on what_-isaia- material , as a kind of '' resultant '' of the economic or production relations prevailing -atti_degli_apostoli- a given period . Obviously , the antinomy between labour and capital under consideration here_the antinomy in which labour was separated_from capital and set up in opposition to it , in a certain_sense on the ontic level , as if it were just an element like any_other in the economic process did_not originate merely in the philosophy and economic theories of the eighteenth century ; rather it originated in the whole of the economic_and_social practice of that_time , the time of the birth and rapid development of industrialization , in which what_was mainly seen was_the possibility of vastly increasing material wealth , means , while the end , that_-isaia- to say , man_,_who should be served by the means , was ignored . It was this practical error that struck a blow first_and_foremost against human labour , against the working man , and caused the ethically just social reaction already spoken of above . The same error , which_-isaia- now part of history , and which_was connected_with_the period of primitive capitalism and liberalism , can nevertheless be repeated in other circumstances of time_and_place , if people s thinking starts from the same theoretical or practical premises . The only chance there seems to be for radically overcoming this error -isaia- through adequate changes both in theory and in practice , changes in line with the definite conviction of the primacy of the person over things , and of human labour over capital as a whole collection of means_of_production . Work and Ownership The historical process briefly presented here has certainly gone beyond its initial phase , but_it_-isaia- still taking place and indeed -isaia- spreading in the relationships between nations and continents . It needs to be specified further from another point_of_view . It -isaia- obvious that , when we speak of opposition between labour and capital , we are_not dealing only_with abstract concepts or '' impersonal forces '' operating in economic production . Behind both concepts there_are people , living , actual people : on the one side are_those_who do the work without being the owners of the means_of_production , and on the other side those_who act as entrepreneurs and who own these means or represent the owners . Thus the issue of ownership or property enters from the beginning into the whole of this difficult historical process . The Encyclical Rerum Novarum , which_has the social_question as its theme , stresses this issue also , recalling and confirming the Church s teaching on ownership , on the right to private_property even_when it -isaia-_a_question of the means_of_production . The Encyclical Mater et Magistra did the same . The above principle , as it was then stated and as it -isaia- still taught by the Church , diverges radically from the programme of collectivism as proclaimed by Marxism and put into pratice in various countries in the decades following the time of Leo XIII s Encyclical . At the same_time it differs from the programme of capitalism practised by liberalism and by the political systems inspired by it . In the latter case , the difference consists in the way the right to ownership or property -isaia- understood . Christian tradition has_never upheld this right as absolute and untouchable . On the contrary , it has_always understood this right within_the broader context of the right common to all to use the goods of the whole of creation : the right to private_property -isaia- subordinated to the right to common use , to the fact_that goods are meant for everyone . Furthermore , in the Church s teaching , ownership has_never been understood in a way_that could constitute grounds for social conflict in labour . As mentioned above , property -isaia- acquired first of all through work in order that_it_may serve work . This concerns in a special_way ownership of the means_of_production . Isolating these means as a separate property in order to set it up in the form of '' capital '' in opposition to '' labour '' and even to practise exploitation of labour -isaia- contrary to the very nature of these means and their possession . They cannot be possessed against labour , they_cannot even be possessed for possession s sake , because the only legitimate title to their possession whether in the form of private ownerhip or in the form of public or collective ownership -isaia- that_they_should serve labour , and thus , by serving labour , that_they_should make possible the achievement of the first principle of this order , namely , the universal destination of goods and the right to common use of them . From this point_of_view , therefore , in consideration of human labour and of common access to the goods meant for_man , one_cannot exclude the socialization , in suitable conditions , of certain means_of_production . In the course of the decades since_the publication of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , the Church s teaching has_always recalled all these_principles , going back to the arguments formulated in a much older tradition , for example , the well_known arguments of the Summa Theologiae of Saint Thomas Aquinas . In the present document , which_has human_work as its main theme , it -isaia- right to confirm all the effort with_which_the Church s teaching has striven and continues to strive always to ensure the priority of work and , thereby , man s character as a subject in social_life and , especially , in the dynamic structure of the whole economic process . From this point_of_view the position of '' rigid '' capitalism continues to remain unacceptable , namely the position that defends the exclusive right to private ownership of the means_of_production as an untouchable '' dogma '' of economic_life . The principle of respect_for work demands_that this right should undergo a constructive revision , both in theory and in practice . If it -isaia- true_that capital , as the whole of the means_of_production , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the product of the work of generations , it -isaia- equally true_that capital -isaia- being unceasingly created through the work done with the help of all these means_of_production , and these means can be seen as a great workbench -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the present generation of workers -isaia- working day after day . Obviously we are dealing here with different kinds of work , not_only so called manual labour but_also the many forms of intellectual work , including white collar work and management . In the light of the above , the many proposals put forward by experts in Catholic social_teaching and by the highest Magisterium of the Church take on special significance : proposals for joint ownership of the means of work , sharing by the workers in the management and or profits of businesses , so called shareholding by labour , etc . Whether these various proposals can or cannot be applied concretely , it -isaia- clear_that recognition of the proper position of labour and the worker in the production process demands various adaptations in the sphere of the right to ownership of the means_of_production . This -isaia- so not_only in view of older situations but_also , first_and_foremost , in view of the whole of the situation and the problems in the second half of the present century with_regard to the so called Third World and the various new independent countries that_have arisen , especially in Africa but elsewhere as well , in place of the colonial territories of the past . Therefore , while the position of '' rigid '' capitalism must undergo continual revision , in order to be reformed from the point_of_view of human_rights , both human_rights in the widest sense and those linked_with man s work , it must be stated_that , from the same point_of_view , these many deeply desired reforms cannot be achieved by an a priori elimination of private ownership of the means_of_production . For it must be noted_that merely taking these means_of_production capital out of the hands of their private owners -isaia-_not_enough to ensure their satisfactory socialization . They cease to be the property of a certain social group , namely the private owners , and become the property of organized society , coming under the administration and direct control of another group of people , namely those_who , though not owning them , from the fact of exercising power in society manage them on the level of the whole national or the local economy . This group in authority may carry_out its task satisfactorily from the point_of_view of the priority of labour ; but it may also carry it out badly by claiming for itself a monopoly of the administration and disposal of the means_of_production and not refraining even from offending basic human_rights . Thus , merely converting the means_of_production into State property in the collectivist system -isaia- by no means equivalent to '' socializing '' that property . We can speak of socializing only_when the subject character of society_-isaia- ensured , that_-isaia- to say , when on the basis of his_work each person_-isaia- fully entitled to consider himself a part owner of the great workbench -atti_degli_apostoli- which he -isaia- working with every_one else . A way towards that goal could be found by associating labour with the ownership of capital , as far_as_possible , and by producing a wide range of intermediate bodies with economic , social_and_cultural purposes ; they_would be bodies enjoying real autonomy with_regard to the public powers , pursuing their_specific aims in honest collaboration with each_other and in subordination to the demands of the common_good , and they_would be living communities both in form and in substance , in the sense_that the members of each body would be looked upon and treated as persons and encouraged to take an active part in the life of the body . The '' Personalist '' Argument Thus , the principle of the priority of labour over capital -isaia- a postulate of the order of social morality . It has key importance both in the system built on the principle of private ownership of the means_of_production and also in the system in which private ownership of these means has_been limited even in a radical way . Labour -isaia- in a sense inseparable from capital ; in no way does it accept the antinomy , that_-isaia- to say , the separation and opposition with_regard to the means_of_production that_has weighed upon human_life in recent centuries as a result of merely economic premises . When man works , using all the means_of_production , he also wishes the fruit of this_work to be used by himself and others , and he wishes to be able to take_part in the very work process as a sharer in responsibility and creativity -atti_degli_apostoli- the workbench to which he applies himself . From this spring certain specific rights of workers , corresponding to the obligation of work . They will be discussed later . But here it must be emphasized , in general terms , that the person_who works desires not_only due remuneration for his_work ; he also wishes that , within_the production process , provision be made for him to be able to know_that in his_work , even on something_that -isaia- owned in common , he -isaia- working '' for_himself '' . This awareness -isaia- extinguished within him in a system of excessive bureaucratic centralization , which_makes the worker feel that_he_-isaia- just a cog in a huge machine moved from above , that_he_-isaia- for more reasons than one a mere production instrument rather_than a true subject of work with an initiative of his_own . The Church s teaching has_always expressed the strong and deep convinction that_man s work concerns not_only the economy but_also , and especially , personal values . The economic system itself and the production process benefit precisely when these personal values are fully respected . In the mind of Saint Thomas Aquinas , this_-isaia- the principal reason in favour of private ownership of the means_of_production . While we accept that_for certain well founded reasons exceptions can be made to the principle of private ownership in our own_time we even see_that the system of '' socialized ownership '' has_been introduced nevertheless the personalist argument still holds good both on the level of principles and on the practical level . If it -isaia- to be rational and fruitful , any socialization of the means_of_production must_take this argument into consideration . Every effort must be made to ensure_that in this_kind of system also the human_person can preserve his awareness of working '' for_himself '' . If this_-isaia-_not done , incalculable damage -isaia- inevitably done throughout_the economic process , not_only economic damage but first_and_foremost damage to man . Within the Broad Context of Human Rights While work , in all its many senses , -isaia- an obligation , that_-isaia- to say a duty , it -isaia-_also a source of rights on the part of the worker . These rights must be examined in the broad context of human_rights as a whole , which_are connatural with_man , and many of which_are proclaimed by various international organizations and increasingly guaranteed by the individual States for their citizens Respect for_this broad range of human_rights constitutes the fundamental condition_for peace in the modern_world : peace both within individual countries and societies and in international relations , as the Church s Magisterium has several times noted , especially since_the Encyclical Pacem in Terris . The human_rights that flow from work are part of the broader context of those fundamental rights of the person . However , within this_context they_have a specific character corresponding to the specific nature of human_work as outlined above . It -isaia- in keeping_with this character that we must view them . Work -isaia- , as has been_said , an obligation , that_-isaia- to say , a duty , on the part of man . This -isaia- true in all the many meanings of the word . Man must work , both because the Creator has commanded it and because of his_own humanity , which requires work in order to be maintained and developed . Man must work out of regard_for others , especially his_own family , but_also_for the society he belongs to , the country of which he -isaia- a child , and the whole human_family of which he -isaia- a member , since he -isaia- the heir to the work of generations and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a sharer in building the future of those_who will come after him in the succession of history . All this constitutes the moral obligation of work , understood in its wide sense . When we have to consider_the moral rights , corresponding to this obligation , of every_person with_regard to work , we must_always keep before our_eyes the whole vast range of points of reference in which_the labour of every working subject -isaia- manifested . For when we speak of the obligation of work and of the rights of the worker that correspond to this obligation , we think in the first_place of the relationship_between_the employer , direct or indirect , and the worker . The distinction between_the direct and the indirect employer -isaia- seen to be very_important when one considers both the way_in_which labour -isaia- actually organized and the possibility of the formation of just or unjust relationships in the field of labour . Since the direct employer -isaia- the person or institution with whom_the worker enters directly into a work contract in accordance_with definite conditions , we must understand as the indirect employer many_different factors , other_than the direct employer , that exercise a determining influence on the shaping both of the work contract and , consequently , of just or unjust relationships in the field of human labour . Direct and Indirect Employer The concept of indirect employer includes both persons and institutions of various kinds , and also collective labour contracts and the principles of conduct which_are laid_down by these persons and institutions and which determine the whole socioeconomic system or are its result . The concept of '' indirect employer '' thus refers to many_different elements . The responsibility of the indirect employer differs from that of the direct employer the term itself indicates that the responsibility -isaia- less direct but it remains a true responsibility : the indirect employer substantially determines one or other facet of the labour relationship , thus conditioning the conduct of the direct employer when_the latter determines in concrete terms the actual work contract and labour relations . This -isaia- not to absolve the direct employer from his_own responsibility , but_only to draw attention to the whole network of influences that condition his conduct . When it -isaia-_a_question of establishing an ethically correct labour policy , all these influences must be kept in mind . A policy -isaia- correct when_the objective rights of the worker are fully respected . The concept of indirect employer -isaia- applicable to every society , and in the first_place to the State . For it -isaia- the State that_must conduct a just labour policy . However , it -isaia- common knowledge that in the present system of economic relations in the world there_are numerous links between individual States , links that find expression , for instance , in the import and export process , that_-isaia- to say , in the mutual exchange of economic goods , whether raw materials , semimanufactured goods , or finished industrial products . These links also create mutual dependence , and as a result it would be difficult to speak , in the case of any State , even the economically most powerful , of complete self sufficiency or autarky . Such a system of mutual dependence -isaia- in itself normal . However , it can easily become an occasion for various_forms of exploitation or injustice and as a result influence the labour policy of individual States ; and finally it can influence the individual worker , who_-isaia- the proper subject of labour . For instance the highly industrialized countries , and even_more the businesses that direct on a large scale the means of industrial production the companies referred to as multinational or transnational , fix the highest possible prices for their products , while trying -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to fix the lowest possible prices for raw materials or semi manufactured goods . This -isaia- one of the causes of an ever_increasing disproportion between national incomes . The gap between most of the richest countries and the poorest ones -isaia- not diminishing or being stabilized but_-isaia- increasing more_and_more , to the detriment , obviously , of the poor countries . Evidently this must_have an effect on local labour policy and on the worker s situation in the economically disadvantaged societies . Finding himself in a system thus conditioned , the direct employer fixes working conditions below the objective requirements of the workers , especially if he himself wishes to obtain the highest possible profits from the business which he runs or from the businesses which he runs , in the case of a situation of '' socialized '' ownership of the means_of_production . It -isaia- easy to see that_this framework of forms of dependence linked_with the concept of the indirect employer -isaia- enormously extensive and complicated . It -isaia- determined , in a sense , by all the elements that_are decisive for economic_life within a given society and state , but_also by much wider links and forms of dependence . The attainment of the worker s rights cannot however be doomed to be merely a result of economic systems which on a larger or smaller scale are guided chiefly by the criterion of maximum profit . On the contrary , it -isaia- respect_for the objective rights of the worker every_kind of worker : manual or intellectual , industrial or agricultural , etc . that_must constitute the adequate and fundamental criterion for shaping the whole economy , both on the level of the individual society and State and within_the whole of the world economic policy and of the systems of international relationships that derive from it . Influence in this direction should be exercised by all the International Organizations whose concern it -isaia- , beginning with the United Nations Organization . It appears that the International Labour Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and other bodies too have fresh contributions to offer on this_point in particular . Within the individual States there_are ministries or public departments and also various social institutions set up for this_purpose . All of this effectively indicates the importance of the indirect employer as has been_said above in achieving full respect_for the worker s rights , since_the rights of the human_person are the key element in the whole of the social moral_order . The Employment Issue When we consider_the rights of workers in relation to the '' indirect employer '' , that_-isaia- to say , all the agents -atti_degli_apostoli- the national and international level that_are responsible_for the whole orientation of labour policy , we must first direct our attention to a fundamental issue : the question of finding work , or , in other_words , the issue of suitable employment for all who_are capable of it . The opposite of a just and right situation in this_field -isaia- unemployment , that_-isaia- to say the lack of work_for those_who_are capable of it . It can be a question of general unemployment or of unemployment in certain sectors of work . The role of the agents included under the title of indirect employer -isaia- to act against unemployment , which in all cases -isaia- an evil , and which , when it reaches a certain level , can become a real social disaster . It -isaia- particularly painful when it especially affects young_people , who after appropriate cultural , technical and professional preparation fail to find work , and see their sincere wish to work and their readiness to take on their_own responsibility_for the economic_and_social development of the community sadly frustrated . The obligation to provide unemployment benefits , that_-isaia- to say , the duty to make suitable grants indispensable for the subsistence of unemployed workers and their_families , -isaia- a duty springing from the fundamental principle of the moral_order in this sphere , namely the principle of the common use of goods or , to put it in another and still simpler way , the right to life and subsistence . In order to meet_the danger of unemployment and to ensure employment for all , the agents defined here as '' indirect employer '' must make provision for overall planning with_regard to the different kinds of work by which not_only the economic_life but_also the cultural life of a given society_-isaia- shaped ; they must_also give attention to organizing that work in a correct and rational way . In the final analysis this overall concern weighs on the shoulders of the State , but it cannot mean onesided centralization by the public_authorities . Instead , what_-isaia- in question -isaia- a just and rational coordination , within_the framework of which_the initiative of individuals , free groups and local work centres and complexes must be safeguarded , keeping in mind what_has_been said above with_regard to the subject character of human labour . The fact of the mutual dependence of societies and States and the need to collaborate in various areas mean_that , while preserving the sovereign rights of each society and State in the field of planning and organizing labour in its_own society , action in this important area must_also be taken in the dimension of international collaboration by means of the necessary treaties and agreements . Here too the criterion for these pacts and agreements must more_and_more be the criterion of human_work considered as a fundamental right of all human_beings , work which_gives similar rights to all those_who work , in such_a_way_that the living standard of the workers in the different societies will less and less show those disturbing differences which_are unjust and are apt to provoke even violent reactions . The International Organizations have an enormous part to play in this area . They must let themselves be guided by an exact diagnosis of the complex situations and of the influence exercised by natural , historical , civil and other such circumstances . They must_also be more highly operative with_regard to plans for action jointly decided on , that_-isaia- to say , they_must be more_effective in carrying them out . In this direction it -isaia- possible to actuate a plan_for universal and proportionate progress by all , in accordance_with_the guidelines of Paul VI s Encyclical Populorum Progressio . It must be stressed that the constitutive element in this progress and also the most adequate way to verify it in a spirit of justice_and_peace , which_the Church proclaims and for_which she_does not_cease to pray to the Father of all individuals and of all peoples , -isaia- the continual reappraisal of man s work , both in the aspect of its objective finality and in the aspect of the dignity of the subject of all work , that_-isaia- to say , man . The progress in question must be made through man and for_man and it must produce its fruit in man . A test of this progress will be the increasingly mature recognition of the purpose of work and increasingly universal respect_for the rights inherent in work in conformity_with_the dignity of man , the subject of work . Rational planning and the proper organization of human labour in keeping_with individual societies and States should_also facilitate the discovery of the right proportions between_the different kinds of employment : work on the land , in industry , in the various services , white collar work and scientific or artistic work , in accordance_with_the capacities of individuals and for the common_good of each society and of the whole of mankind . The organization of human_life in accordance_with_the many possibilities of labour should be matched by a suitable system of instruction and education , aimed first of all -atti_degli_apostoli- developing mature human_beings , but_also aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- preparing people specifically for assuming to good advantage an appropriate place in the vast and socially differentiated world of work . As we view the whole human_family throughout_the_world , we cannot_fail to be struck by a disconcerting fact of immense proportions : the fact_that , while conspicuous natural resources remain unused , there_are huge numbers of people_who_are unemployed or under employed and countless multitudes of people suffering from hunger . This -isaia- a fact_that without_any doubt demonstrates that both within_the individual political communities and in their relationships on the continental and world level there_-isaia- something wrong with the organization of work and employment , precisely -atti_degli_apostoli- the most critical and socially most important points . Wages and Other Social Benefits After outlining the important role that concern_for providing employment for all workers plays in safeguarding respect_for the inalienable rights of man in view of his_work , it -isaia- worthwhile taking a closer look -atti_degli_apostoli- these rights , which in the final analysis are formed within_the relationship_between worker and direct employer . All that_has_been said above on the subject of the indirect employer -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- defining these relationships more exactly , by showing the many forms of conditioning within which these relationships are indirectly formed . This consideration does_not however have a purely descriptive purpose ; it -isaia- not a brief treatise on economics or politics . It -isaia-_a_matter of highlighting the deontological and moral aspect . The key problem of social ethics in this case -isaia- that of just remuneration for work done . In the context of the present there_-isaia- no more_important way_for securing a just relationship_between_the worker and the employer than_that constituted by remuneration for work . Whether the work_-isaia- done in a system of private ownership of the means_of_production or in a system where ownership has undergone a certain '' socialization '' , the relationship_between_the employer first_and_foremost the direct employer and the worker -isaia- resolved on the basis of the wage , that_-isaia- through just remuneration for work done . It should_also be noted_that the justice of a socioeconomic system and , in each case , its just functioning , deserve in the final analysis to be evaluated by the way_in_which man s work_-isaia- properly remunerated in the system . Here we return once_more to the first principle of the whole ethical and social_order , namely , the principle of the common use of goods . In every system , regardless of the fundamental relationships within it between capital and labour , wages , that_-isaia- to say remuneration for work , are_still a practical means whereby_the vast majority of people can have access to those goods which_are intended for common use : both the goods of nature and manufactured goods . Both kinds of goods become accessible to the worker through the wage which he receives as remuneration for his_work . Hence , in every case , a just wage -isaia- the concrete means of verifying the justice of the whole socioeconomic system and , in any case , of checking that_it_-isaia- functioning justly . It -isaia- not the only means of checking , but_it_-isaia- a particularly important one and , in a sense , the key means . This means of checking concerns above all the family . Just remuneration for the work of an adult who_-isaia- responsible_for a family means remuneration which_will suffice for establishing and properly maintaining a family and for providing security for its future . Such remuneration can be given either through what_-isaia- called a family wage that_-isaia- , a single salary given to the head of the family fot his_work , sufficient for the needs of the family without_the other spouse having to take up gainful employment outside the home or through other social measures such as family allowances or grants to mothers devoting themselves exclusively to their_families . These grants should correspond to the actual needs , that_-isaia- , to the number of dependents for as long as they_are_not in a position to assume proper responsibility_for their_own lives . Experience confirms that_there must be a social re evaluation of the mother s role , of the toil connected_with it , and of the need that children have for care , love and affection in order that_they_may develop into responsible , morally and religiously mature and psychologically stable persons . It will redound to the credit of society to make it possible_for a mother without inhibiting her freedom , without psychological or practical discrimination , and without penalizing her as compared with_other women to devote herself to taking care of her_children and educating them in accordance_with their needs , which vary with age . Having to abandon these tasks in order to take up paid work outside the home -isaia- wrong from the point_of_view of the good of society and of the family when it contradicts or hinders these primary goals of the mission of a mother . In this_context it should be emphasized that , on a more general level , the whole labour process must be organized and adapted in such_a_way as to respect the requirements of the person and his or her forms of life , above all life in the home , taking into_account_the individual s age and sex . It -isaia- a fact_that in many societies women work in nearly every sector of life . But it -isaia- fitting that_they_should be able to fulfil their tasks in accordance_with their_own nature , without being discriminated against and without being excluded from jobs for which_they_are capable , but_also without lack of respect_for their family aspirations and for their_specific role in contributing , together_with men , to the good of society . The true advancement of women requires that labour should be structured in such_a_way_that women do not_have to pay for their advancement by abandoning what_-isaia- specific to them and -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the family , in which women as mothers have an irreplaceable role . Besides wages , various social benefits intended to ensure the life and health of workers and their_families play a part here . The expenses involved in health_care , especially in the case of accidents -atti_degli_apostoli- work , demand_that medical assistance should be easily available for workers , and that as far_as_possible it should be cheap or even free of charge . Another sector regarding benefits -isaia- the sector associated_with the right to rest . In the first_place this involves a regular weekly rest comprising -atti_degli_apostoli- least Sunday , and also a longer period of rest , namely the holiday or vacation taken once a year or possibly in several shorter periods during the year . A third sector concerns the right to a pension and to insurance for old age and in case of accidents -atti_degli_apostoli- work . Within the sphere of these principal rights , there develops a whole system of particular rights which , together_with remuneration for work , determine the correct relationship_between worker and employer . Among these rights there_should never be overlooked the right to a working environment and to manufacturing processes which_are not harmful to the workers physical health or to their moral integrity . Importance of Unions All these rights , together_with_the need_for the workers themselves to secure them , give rise to yet another right : the right of association , that_-isaia- to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions . These associations are_called labour or trade unions . The vital interests of the workers are to a certain extent common for all of them ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time however each type of work , each profession , has its_own specific character which_should find a particular reflection in these organizations . In a sense , unions go back to the mediaeval guilds of artisans , insofar as those organizations brought together people belonging to the same craft and thus on the basis of their_work . However , unions differ from the guilds on this essential point : the modern unions grew up from the struggle of the workers workers in general but especially_the industrial workers to protect their just rights vis a vis the entrepreneurs and the owners of the means_of_production . Their task -isaia- to defend the existential interests of workers in all sectors in which their_rights are_concerned . The experience of history teaches_that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social_life , especially in modern industrialized societies . Obviously , this does_not_mean that_only industrial workers can set up associations of this type . Representatives of every profession can use them to ensure their_own rights . Thus there_are unions of agricultural workers and of white collar workers ; there_are also employers associations . All , as has been_said above , are further divided into groups or subgroups according to particular professional specializations . Catholic social_teaching does_not hold that unions are no more_than a reflection of the '' class '' structure of society and that_they_are a mouthpiece for a class struggle which inevitably governs social_life . They are indeed a mouthpiece for the struggle for social_justice , for the just rights of working people in accordance_with their individual professions . However , this struggle should be seen as a normal endeavour '' for '' the just good : in the present case , for the good which corresponds to the needs and merits of working people associated by profession ; but_it_-isaia- not a struggle '' against '' others . Even if in controversial questions the struggle takes on a character of opposition towards others , this_-isaia- because it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- the good of social_justice , not_for the sake of '' struggle '' or in order to eliminate the opponent . It -isaia- characteristic of work that it first_and_foremost unites people . In this consists its social power : the power to build a community . In the final analysis , both those_who work and those_who manage the means_of_production or who own them must in some_way be united in this community . In the light of this fundamental structure of all work in the light of the fact_that , in the final analysis , labour and capital are indispensable components of the process of production in any social system it -isaia- clear_that , even if it -isaia- because_of_their work needs that people unite to secure their_rights , their union remains a constructive factor of social_order and solidarity , and it -isaia- impossible to ignore it . Just efforts to secure the rights of workers who are_united by the same profession should_always take into_account_the limitations imposed by the general economic situation of the country . Union demands cannot be turned into a kind of group or class '' egoism '' , although they_can and should_also aim -atti_degli_apostoli- correcting with_a_view to the common_good of the whole of society everything defective in the system of ownership of the means_of_production or in the way these_are managed . Social and socioeconomic life_-isaia- certainly like a system of '' connected vessels '' , and every social activity directed towards safeguarding the rights of particular groups should adapt itself to this system . In this_sense , union activity undoubtedly enters the field of politics , understood as prudent concern_for the common_good . However , the role of unions -isaia- not to '' play politics '' in the sense_that the expression -isaia- commonly understood today . Unions do not have_the character of political parties struggling for power ; they_should not be subjected to the decision of political parties or have too close links with_them . In fact , in such a situation they easily lose contact_with their_specific role , which_-isaia- to secure the just rights of workers within_the ramework of the common_good of the whole of society ; instead they become an instrument used for other purposes . Speaking of the protection of the just rights of workers according_to_their individual professions , we must of course always keep in mind that_which determines the subjective character of work in each profession , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , indeed before all else , we must keep in mind that_which conditions the specific dignity of the subject of the work . The activity of union organizations opens up many possibilities in this respect , including their_efforts to instruct and educate the workers and to foster their selfeducation . Praise -isaia- due to the work of the schools , what_are known as workers or people s universities and the training programmes and courses which_have developed and are_still developing this_field of activity . It -isaia- always to be hoped that , thanks to the work of their unions , workers will not_only have more , but_above all be more : in other_words , that_they_will realize their humanity more_fully in every respect . One method used by unions in pursuing the just rights of their members -isaia- the strike or work stoppage , as a kind of ultimatum to the competent bodies , especially_the employers . This method -isaia- recognized by Catholic social_teaching as legitimate in the proper conditions and within just limits . In this connection workers should be assured the right to strike , without being subjected to personal penal sanctions for taking part in a strike . While admitting that_it_-isaia- a legitimate means , we must -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time emphasize that a strike remains , in a sense , an extreme means . It must_not be abused ; it must_not be abused especially_for '' political '' purposes . Furthermore it must_never be forgotten that , when essential community services are in question , they_must in every case be ensured , if necessary by means of appropriate legislation . Abuse of the strike weapon can lead to the paralysis of the whole of socioeconomic life , and this_-isaia- contrary to the requirements of the common_good of society , which also corresponds to the properly understood nature of work itself . Dignity of Agricultural Work All that_has_been said thus far on the dignity of work , on the objective and subjective dimension of human_work , can be directly applied to the question of agricultural work and to the situation of the person_who cultivates the earth by toiling in the fields . This -isaia- a vast sector of work on our planet , a sector not restricted to one or other continent , nor limited to the societies which have_already attained a certain level of development and progress . The world of agriculture , which provides society with the goods it needs for its daily sustenance , -isaia- of fundamental importance . The conditions of the rural population and of agricultural work vary from place to place , and the social position of agricultural workers differs from country to country . This depends not_only on the level of development of agricultural technology but_also , and perhaps more , on the recognition of the just rights of agricultural workers and , finally , on the level of awareness regarding the social ethics of work . Agricultural work involves considerable difficulties , including unremitting and sometimes exhausting physical effort and a lack of appreciation on the part of society , to the point of making agricultural people feel that_they_are social outcasts and of speeding up the phenomenon of their mass exodus from the countryside to the cities and unfortunately to still_more dehumanizing living conditions . Added to this are the lack of adequate professional training and of proper equipment , the spread of a certain individualism , and also objectively unjust situations . In certain developing countries , millions of people_are forced to cultivate the land belonging to others and are exploited by the big landowners , without_any hope of ever being able to gain possession of even a small piece of land of their_own . There -isaia- a lack of forms of legal protection for the agricultural workers themselves and for their_families in case of old age , sickness or unemployment . Long days of hard physical work are paid miserably . Land which_could be cultivated -isaia- left abandoned by the owners . Legal titles to possession of a small portion of land that someone has personally cultivated for years are disregarded or left defenceless against the '' land hunger '' of more powerful individuals or groups . But even in the economically developed countries , where scientific_research , technological achievements and State policy have brought agriculture to a very advanced level , the right to work can be infringed when_the farm workers are denied the possibility of sharing in decisions concerning their services , or when_they_are denied the right to free association with_a_view to their just advancement socially , culturally and economically . In many situations radical and urgent changes are therefore needed in order to restore to agriculture and to rural people their just value as the basis for a healthy economy , within_the social community s development as a whole . Thus it -isaia- necessary to proclaim and promote the dignity of work , of all work but especially of agricultural work , in which_man so eloquently '' subdues '' the earth he has_received as a gift from God and affirms his '' dominion '' in the visible world . The Disabled Person and Work Recently , national communities and international organizations have turned their attention to another question connected_with work , one full of implications : the question of disabled people . They too are fully human subjects with corresponding innate , sacred and inviolable rights , and , in spite of the limitations and sufferings affecting their bodies and faculties , they point up more_clearly the dignity and greatness of man . Since disabled people_are subjects with all their_rights , they_should be helped to participate in the life of society in all its aspects and -atti_degli_apostoli- all the levels accessible to their capacities . The disabled person_-isaia- one of us and participates fully in the same humanity that we possess . It would be radically unworthy of man , and a denial of our_common humanity , to admit to the life of the community , and thus admit to work , only those_who_are fully functional . To do so would be to practise a serious form of discrimination , that of the strong and healthy against the weak and sick . Work in the objective sense should be subordinated , in this circumstance too , to the dignity of man , to the subject of work and not to economic advantage . The various bodies involved in the world of labour , both the direct and the indirect employer , should therefore by means of effective and appropriate measures foster the right of disabled people to professional training and work , so that_they_can be given a productive activity suited to them . Many practical problems arise -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , as well as legal and economic ones ; but the community , that_-isaia- to say , the public_authorities , associations and intermediate groups , business enterprises and the disabled themselves should pool their ideas and resources so as to attain this goal that_must not be shirked : that disabled people may be offered work according_to_their capabilities , for this_-isaia- demanded by their_dignity as persons and as subjects of work . Each community will_be_able to set up suitable structures for finding or creating jobs for_such people both in the usual public or private enterprises , by offering them ordinary or suitably adapted jobs , and in what are_called '' protected '' enterprises and surroundings . Careful attention must be devoted to the physical and psychological working conditions of disabled people as for all workers to their just remuneration , to the possibility of their promotion , and to the elimination of various obstacles . Without hiding the fact that_this_-isaia- a complex and difficult task , it -isaia- to be hoped that a correct concept of labour in the subjective sense will produce a situation which_will make it possible_for disabled people to feel that_they_are not cut off from the working world or dependent upon society , but that_they_are full scale subjects of work , useful , respected for their human_dignity and called to contribute to the progress and welfare of their_families and of the community according_to_their particular capacities . Work and the Emigration Question Finally , we must say -atti_degli_apostoli- least a few words on the subject of emigration in search of work . This -isaia- an age old phenomenon which nevertheless continues to be repeated and -isaia- still today very widespread as a result of the complexities of modern life . Man has the right to leave his native land for various motives and also the right to return in order to seek better conditions of life in another country . This fact -isaia- certainly not_without difficulties of various kinds . Above all it generally constitutes a loss for the country which_-isaia- left behind . It -isaia- the departure of a person_who -isaia-_also a member of a great community united by history , tradition and culture ; and that person must begin life in the midst of another society united by a different culture and very often by a different language . In this case , it -isaia- the loss of a subject of work , whose efforts of mind and body could contribute to the common_good of his_own country , but these efforts , this contribution , are instead offered to another society_which in a sense has less right to them than the person s country of origin . Nevertheless , even if emigration -isaia- in some aspects an evil , in certain circumstances it -isaia- , as the phrase goes , a necessary evil . Everything should be done and certainly much -isaia- being done to this_end to prevent this material evil from causing greater moral harm ; indeed every possible effort should be made to ensure_that it may bring benefit to the emigrant s personal , family and social_life , both_for the country to which he goes and the country which he leaves . In this area much depends on just legislation , in particular with_regard to the rights of workers . It -isaia- obvious that the question of just legislation enters into the context of the present considerations , especially from the point_of_view of these rights . The most important thing -isaia- that the person working away from his native land , whether as a permanent emigrant or as a seasonal worker , should_not be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- a disadvantage in comparison with the other workers in that society in the matter of working rights . Emigration in search of work must in no way become an opportunity_for financial or social exploitation . As regards the work relationship , the same criteria should be applied to immigrant workers as to all other workers in the society concerned . The value of work should be measured by the same standard and not according to the difference in nationality , religion or race . For even greater reason_the situation of constraint in which_the emigrant may find himself should_not be exploited . All these circumstances should categorically give way , after special qualifications have of course been taken into consideration , to the fundamental value of work , which_-isaia- bound up with the dignity_of_the_human_person . Once more the fundamental principle must be repeated : the hierarchy of values and the profound meaning of work itself require that capital should be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of labour and not labour -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of capital . ELEMENTS FOR A SPIRITUALITY OF WORK . A Particular Task for the Church It -isaia- right to devote the last part of these reflections about human_work , on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , to the spirituality of work in the Christian sense . Since work in its subjective aspect -isaia- always a personal action , an actus personae , it follows that_the_whole person , body and spirit , participates in it , whether it -isaia- manual or intellectual work . It -isaia-_also to the whole person that the word of the living God -isaia-_directed , the evangelical message of salvation , in which we find many points which concern human_work and which throw particular light on it . These points need to be properly assimilated : an inner effort on the part of the human spirit , guided by faith , hope and charity , -isaia- needed in order that_through these points the work of the individual human_being may be given the meaning which it has in the eyes of God and by means of which work enters into the salvation process on a par with the other ordinary yet particularly important components of its texture . The Church considers it her duty to speak out on work from the viewpoint of its human value and of the moral_order to which it belongs , and she sees this as one of her important tasks within_the service that_she renders to the evangelical message as a whole . At the same_time she sees it as her particular duty to form a spirituality of work which_will help all people to come closer , through work , to God , the Creator and Redeemer , to participate in his salvific plan_for man and the world and to deepen their friendship with Christ in their_lives by accepting , through_faith , a living participation in his threefold mission as Priest , Prophet and King , as the Second Vatican Council so eloquently teaches . Work as a Sharing in the Activity of the Creator As the Second Vatican Council says , '' throughout_the course of the centuries , men_have laboured to better the circumstances of their_lives through a monumental amount of individual and collective effort . To believers , this_point -isaia- settled : considered in itself , such human activity accords with God s will . For man , created to God s image , received a mandate to subject to himself_the earth and all that it contains , and to govern_the world with justice and holiness ; a mandate to relate himself and the totality of things to him_who was to be acknowledged as the Lord and Creator of all . Thus , by the subjection of all things to man , the name of God would be wonderful in all the earth '' . The word of God s revelation -isaia- profoundly marked by the fundamental truth_that man , created in the image of God , shares by his_work in the activity of the Creator and that , within_the limits of his_own human capabilities , man in a sense continues to develop that activity , and perfects it as he advances further and further in the discovery of the resources and values contained in the whole of creation . We find this_truth -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of Sacred Scripture , in the Book of Genesis , where_the creation activity itself_-isaia- presented in the form of '' work '' done by God during '' six days '' , '' resting '' on the seventh day . Besides , the last book of Sacred Scripture echoes the same respect_for what God has done through_his creative '' work '' when it proclaims : '' Great and wonderful are your deeds , O Lord God the Almighty '' ; this_-isaia- similar to the Book of Genesis , which concludes the description of each_day of creation with the statement : '' And God saw that_it_was good '' . This description of creation , which we find in the very first chapter of the Book of Genesis , -isaia-_also in a sense the first '' gospel of work '' . For it shows what_the dignity of work consists of : it teaches_that man ought to imitate God , his Creator , in working , because man alone has the unique characteristic of likeness to God . Man ought to imitate God both in working and also in resting , since God himself wished to present his_own creative activity under the form of work and rest . This activity by God in the world always continues , as the words of Christ attest : '' My Father -isaia- working still . '' : he works with creative power by sustaining in existence the world_that he called into being from nothing , and he works with salvific power in the hearts of those_whom from the beginning he has destined for '' rest '' in union with himself in his '' Father s house '' . Therefore man s work too not_only requires a rest every '' seventh day '' , but_also cannot consist in the mere exercise of human strength in external action ; it must leave room_for man to prepare himself , by becoming more_and_more what in the will of God he ought to be , for the '' rest '' that the Lord reserves for his servants and friends . Awareness that_man s work_-isaia- a participation in God s activity ought to permeate , as the Council teaches , even '' the most ordinary everyday activities . For , while providing the substance of life_for themselves and their_families , men_and_women are performing their activities in a way which appropriately benefits society . They can justly consider that by their labour they_are unfolding the Creator s work , consulting the advantages of their brothers_and_sisters , and contributing by their_personal industry to the realization in history of the divine plan '' . This Christian spirituality of work should be a heritage shared by all . Especially in the modern age , the spirituality of work should show the maturity called_for by the tensions and restlessness of mind_and_heart . '' Far from thinking that works produced by man s own talent and energy are in opposition to God s power , and that the rational creature exists as a kind of rival to the Creator , Christians are convinced_that the triumphs of the human_race are a sign of God s greatness and the flowering of his_own mysterious design . For the greater man s power becomes , the farther his individual and community responsibility extends . People are_not deterred by the Christian message from building up the world , or impelled to neglect the welfare of their fellows . They are , rather , more stringently bound to do these very things '' . The knowledge that by means of work man shares in the work of creation constitutes the most profound motive for undertaking it in various sectors . '' The faithful , therefore '' , we read in the Constitution Lumen Gentium , '' must learn the deepest meaning and the value of all creation , and its orientation to the praise of God . Even by their secular activity they_must assist one_another to live holier lives . In this_way the world will be permeated by the spirit of Christ and more_effectively achieve its purpose in justice , charity and peace . Therefore , by their competence in secular fields and by their_personal activity , elevated from within by the grace of Christ , let_them work vigorously so that by human labour , technical skill , and civil culture created goods may be perfected according to the design of the Creator and the light of his Word '' . Christ , the Man of Work The truth_that by means of work man participates in the activity of God himself , his Creator , was_given particular prominence by Jesus Christ the Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- whom many of his_first listeners in Nazareth '' were astonished , saying , Where did this man get all this ? What -isaia- the wisdom given to him ? . Is not this_the carpenter ? '' . For Jesus not_only proclaimed but first_and_foremost fulfilled by his deeds the '' gospel '' , the word of eternal Wisdom , that had_been entrusted to him . Therefore this_was also '' the gospel of work '' , because he who proclaimed it was himself a man of work , a craftsman like Joseph of Nazareth . And if we do not find in his_words a special command to work but_rather on one occasion a prohibition against too much anxiety about work and life -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the eloquence of the life of Christ -isaia- unequivocal : he belongs to the '' working world '' , he has appreciation and respect_for human_work . It can indeed be said_that he looks with love upon human_work and the different_forms that it takes , seeing in each_one of these forms a particular facet of man s likeness with God , the Creator and Father . Is it not he who says : '' My Father -isaia- the vinedresser '' , and in various_ways puts into his_teaching the fundamental truth_about work_which -isaia-_already expressed in the whole tradition of the Old Testament , beginning with the Book of Genesis ? The books of the Old Testament contain many references to human_work and to the individual professions exercised by man : for example , the doctor , the pharmacist , the craftsman or artist , the blacksmith we could apply these_words to today s foundry workers the potter , the farmer , the scholar , the sailor , the builder , the musician , the shepherd , and the fisherman . The words of praise for the work of women are well_known . In his parables on the Kingdom of God Jesus Christ constantly refers to human_work : that of the shepherd , the farmer , the doctor , the sower , the householder , the servant , the steward , the fisherman , the merchant , the labourer . He also speaks of the various form of women s work . He compares the apostolate to the manual work of harvesters or fishermen . He refers to the work of scholars too . This teaching of Christ on work , based on the example of his_life during his years in Nazareth , finds a particularly lively echo in the teaching of the Apostle Paul . Paul boasts of working -atti_degli_apostoli- his trade he was probably a tent maker , and thanks to that work he was able even as an Apostle to earn his_own bread . '' With toil and labour we worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you '' . Hence his instructions , in the form of exhortation and command , on the subject of work : '' Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their_work in quietness and to earn their_own living '' , he writes to the Thessalonians . In fact , noting that_some '' are living in idleness . not doing any work '' , the Apostle does not_hesitate to say in the same context : '' If any_one will_not work , let_him not eat '' . In another passage he encourages his readers : '' Whatever your task , work heartly , as serving the Lord and not men , knowing that_from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward '' . The teachings of the Apostle of the Gentiles obviously have key importance for the morality and spirituality of human_work . They are an important complement to the great though discreet gospel of work that we find in the life and parables of Christ , in what Jesus '' did and taught '' . On the basis of these illuminations emanating from the Source himself , the Church has_always proclaimed what we find expressed in modern terms in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council : '' Just as human activity proceeds from man , so it -isaia- ordered towards man . For when a man works he not_only alters things and society , he develops himself as well . He learns much , he cultivates his resources , he goes outside of himself and beyond himself . Rightly understood , this_kind of growth -isaia- of greater value than_any external riches which_can be garnered . Hence , the norm of human activity -isaia- this : that in accord with the divine plan and will , it should harmonize with the genuine good of the human_race , and allow people as individuals and as members of society to pursue their total vocation and fulfil it '' . Such a vision of the values of human_work , or in other_words such a spirituality of work , fully explains what we read in the same section of the Council s Pastoral Constitution with_regard to the right meaning of progress : '' A person_-isaia- more precious for_what he -isaia- than for_what he has . Similarly , all that people do to obtain greater justice , wider brotherhood , and a more humane ordering of social relationships has greater worth than technical advances . For these advances can supply the material for_human progress , but of themselves alone they can_never actually bring it about '' . This teaching on the question of progress and development a subject that dominates presentday thought can be understood only as the fruit of a tested spirituality of human_work ; and it -isaia- only on the basis of such a spirituality that it can be realized and put into_practice . This -isaia- the teaching , and also the programme , that_has its roots in '' the gospel of work '' . Human Work in the Light of the Cross and the Resurrection of Christ There -isaia- yet another aspect of human_work , an essential dimension of it , that_-isaia- profoundly imbued_with the spirituality based on the Gospel . All work , whether manual or intellectual , -isaia- inevitably linked_with toil . The Book of Genesis expresses it in a truly penetrating manner : the original blessing of work contained in the very mystery of creation and connected_with man s elevation as the image of God -isaia- contrasted with the curse that sin brought with it : '' Cursed -isaia- the ground because of you ; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life '' . This toil connected_with work marks the way of human_life on earth and constitutes an announcement of death : '' In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken '' . Almost as an echo of these_words , the author of one of the Wisdom books says : '' Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it '' . There -isaia- no one on earth who could_not apply these_words to himself . In a sense , the final word of the Gospel on this_matter as on others -isaia- found in the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ . It -isaia- here that we must seek an answer to these problems so important_for the spirituality of human_work . The Paschal Mystery contains the Cross of Christ and his obedience unto death , which_the Apostle contrasts with the disobedience which from the beginning has burdened man s history on earth . It also contains the elevation of Christ , who by means of death on a Cross returns to his_disciples in the Resurrection with the power of the Holy Spirit . Sweat and toil , which work necessarily involves the present condition of the human_race , present_the Christian and everyone who_-isaia- called to follow Christ with the possibility of sharing lovingly in the work that Christ came to do . This work of salvation came about through suffering and death on a Cross . By enduring the toil of work in union with Christ crucified for us , man in a way collaborates with the Son of God for the redemption of humanity . He shows himself a true disciple of Christ by carrying the cross in his turn every_day in the activity that_he_-isaia- called_upon to perform . Christ , '' undergoing death itself for all of us sinners , taught us by example that we too must shoulder that cross which_the world and the flesh inflict upon those_who pursue peace and justice '' ; but_also , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , '' appointed Lord by his Resurrection and given all authority in heaven and on earth , Christ -isaia- n\u00f2w -atti_degli_apostoli- work in people s hearts through the power of his Spirit . He animates , purifies , and strengthens those noble longings too , by which_the human_family strives to make its life more_human and to render the whole earth submissive to this goal '' . The Christian finds in human_work a small part of the Cross of Christ and accepts it in the same_spirit of redemption in which Christ accepted his Cross for us . In work , thanks to the light that penetrates us from the Resurrection of Christ , we always find a glimmer of new_life , of the new good , as if it were an announcement of '' the new heavens and the new earth '' in which_man and the world participate precisely through the toil that goes with work . Through toil and never without it . On the one_hand this confirms the indispensability of the Cross in the spirituality of human_work ; on the other_hand the Cross which_this toil constitutes reveals a new good springing from work itself , from work understood in depth and in all its aspects and never apart_from work . Is this_new good the fruit of human_work already a small part of that '' new earth '' where justice dwells ? If it -isaia- true_that the many forms of toil that go with_man s work are a small part of the Cross of Christ , what_-isaia- the relationship of this_new good to the Resurrection of Christ ? The Council seeks to reply to this_question also , drawing light from the very sources of the revealed word : '' Therefore , while we are warned that it profits a man nothing if he gains the whole_world and loses himself cf . Lk : , the expectation of a new earth must_not weaken but_rather stimulate our concern_for cultivating this one . For here grows the body of a new human_family , a body which even_now -isaia- able to give some kind of foreshadowing of the new age . Earthly progress must be carefully distinguished from the growth of Christ s kingdom . Nevertheless , to the extent_that the former can contribute to the better ordering of human_society , it -isaia- of vital concern to the Kingdom of God '' . In these present reflections devoted to human_work we have tried to emphasize everything_that seemed essential to it , since_it_-isaia- through man s labour that not_only '' the fruits of our activity '' but_also '' human_dignity , brotherhood and freedom '' must increase on earth . Let the Christian who listens to the word of the living God , uniting work with prayer , know_the place that his_work has not_only in earthly progress but_also in the development ot the Kingdom of God , to which_we_are all called through the power of the Holy Spirit and through the word of the Gospel . In concluding these reflections , I gladly impart the Apostolic Blessing to all of you_,_venerable Brothers and beloved sons_and_daughters .

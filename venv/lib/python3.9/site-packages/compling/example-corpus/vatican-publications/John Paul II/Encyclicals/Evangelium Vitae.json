The Gospel of life_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of Jesus message . Lovingly received day after day by the Church , it -isaia- to be preached with dauntless fidelity as '' good_news '' to the people of every_age and culture . At the dawn of salvation , it -isaia- the Birth of a Child which_-isaia- proclaimed as joyful news : '' I bring you good_news of a great joy which_will come to all the people ; for to you -isaia- born this_day in the city of David a Saviour , who_-isaia- Christ the Lord '' Lk : . The source of this '' great joy '' -isaia- the Birth of the Saviour ; but Christmas also reveals the full meaning of every_human birth , and the joy which accompanies the Birth of the Messiah -isaia- thus seen to be the foundation and fulfilment of joy -atti_degli_apostoli- every child born into_the_world cf . When he presents the heart of his redemptive mission , Jesus says : '' I came that_they_may have life , and have it abundantly '' Jn : . In truth , he -isaia- referring to that '' new '' and '' eternal '' life_which consists in communion with the Father , to which_every person_-isaia- freely called in the Son by the power of the Sanctifying Spirit . It -isaia- precisely in this '' life '' that all the aspects and stages of human_life achieve their full significance . The incomparable worth of the human_person . Man -isaia- called to a fullness of life_which far exceeds the dimensions of his earthly existence , because it consists in sharing the very life of God . The loftiness of this supernatural vocation reveals the greatness and the inestimable value of human_life even in its temporal phase . Life in time , in fact , -isaia- the fundamental condition , the initial stage and an integral part of the entire unified process of human_existence . It -isaia- a process which , unexpectedly and undeservedly , -isaia- enlightened by the promise and renewed by the gift of divine life_,_which will reach its_full realization in eternity cf . At the same_time , it -isaia- precisely this supernatural calling which highlights the relative character of each_individual s earthly life . After all , life on earth -isaia- not an '' ultimate '' but a '' penultimate '' reality ; even so , it remains a sacred reality entrusted to us , to be preserved with a sense_of_responsibility and brought to perfection in love and in the gift of ourselves to God and to our_brothers_and_sisters . The Church knows that_this Gospel of life_,_which she_has received_from her Lord , has a profound and persuasive echo in the heart of every_person believer and non believer alike because it marvellously fulfils all the heart s expectations while infinitely surpassing them . Even in the midst of difficulties and uncertainties , every_person sincerely open to truth and goodness can , by the light of reason and the hidden action of grace , come to recognize in the natural_law written in the heart cf . Rom : the sacred value of human_life from its very_beginning until its end , and can affirm the right of every_human_being to have this primary good respected to the highest degree . Upon the recognition of this right , every_human community and the political community itself are founded . In a special_way , believers in Christ must defend and promote this right , aware as they_are of the wonderful truth recalled by the Second Vatican Council : '' By his incarnation the Son of God has united himself in some fashion with every_human_being '' . This saving event reveals to humanity not_only the boundless love of God who '' so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son '' Jn : , but_also the incomparable value of every human_person . The Church , faithfully contemplating the mystery of the Redemption , acknowledges this value with ever_new wonder . She feels called to proclaim to the people of all times this '' Gospel '' , the source of invincible hope and true joy for_every period of history . The Gospel of God s love for_man , the Gospel of the dignity of the person and the Gospel of life are a single and indivisible Gospel . For this_reason , man living man represents the primary and fundamental way_for the Church . New threats to human_life . Every individual , precisely by reason of the mystery of the Word of God who_was made_flesh cf . Jn : , -isaia- entrusted to the maternal care of the Church . Therefore every threat to human_dignity and life must necessarily be felt in the Church s very_heart ; it cannot_but affect her -atti_degli_apostoli- the core of her faith in the Redemptive Incarnation of the Son of God , and engage her in her_mission of proclaiming the Gospel of life in all the world and to every_creature cf . Today this proclamation -isaia-_especially pressing because of the extraordinary increase and gravity of threats to the life of individuals and peoples , especially where life_-isaia- weak and defenceless . In addition to the ancient scourges of poverty , hunger , endemic diseases , violence and war , new threats are emerging on an alarmingly vast scale . The Second Vatican Council , in a passage which retains all its relevance today , forcefully condemned a number of crimes and attacks against human_life . Thirty years later , taking up the words of the Council and with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the name of the whole Church , certain_that I -amos- interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright conscience : '' Whatever -isaia- opposed to life_itself , such as any type of murder , genocide , abortion , euthanasia , or wilful self destruction , whatever violates the integrity of the human_person , such as mutilation , torments inflicted on body or mind , attempts to coerce the will itself ; whatever insults human_dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution , the selling of women and children ; as well as disgraceful working conditions , where people_are treated as mere instruments of gain rather_than as free and responsible persons ; all these_things and others like them are infamies indeed . They poison human_society , and they do more harm to those_who practise them than to those who_suffer from the injury . Moreover , they_are a supreme dishonour to the Creator '' . Unfortunately , this disturbing state of affairs , far from decreasing , -isaia- expanding : with the new prospects opened up by scientific and technological progress there arise new_forms of attacks on the dignity_of_the_human being . At the same_time a new cultural climate -isaia- developing and taking hold , which_gives crimes against life a new and if possible even_more sinister character , giving rise to further grave concern : broad sectors of public opinion justify certain crimes against life in the name of the rights of individual freedom , and on this basis they claim not_only exemption from punishment but_even authorization by the State , so that these_things can be done with total freedom and indeed with the free assistance of health_care systems . All this_-isaia- causing a profound change in the way_in_which life and relationships between people_are considered . The fact_that legislation in many countries , perhaps even departing from basic principles of their Constitutions , has determined not to punish these practices against life , and even to make_them altogether legal , -isaia- both a disturbing symptom and a significant cause of grave moral decline . Choices once unanimously considered criminal and rejected by the common moral sense are gradually becoming socially acceptable . Even certain sectors of the medical profession , which by its calling -isaia-_directed to the defence and care of human_life , are increasingly willing to carry_out these acts against the person . In this_way the very nature of the medical profession -isaia- distorted and contradicted , and the dignity of those_who practise it -isaia- degraded . In such a cultural and legislative situation , the serious demographic , social and family problems which weigh upon many of the world s peoples and which require responsible and effective attention from national and international bodies , are left open to false and deceptive solutions , opposed to the truth and the good of persons and nations . The end result of this_-isaia- tragic : not_only -isaia- the fact of the destruction of so many human lives still to be born or in their final stage extremely grave and disturbing , but no less grave and disturbing -isaia- the fact_that conscience itself , darkened as it were by such widespread conditioning , -isaia- finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between good_and_evil in what concerns the basic value of human_life . In communion with all the Bishops of the world . The Extraordinary Consistory of Cardinals held in Rome on April was devoted to the problem of the threats to human_life in our_day . After a thorough and detailed discussion of the problem and of the challenges it poses to the entire human_family and in particular to the Christian community , the Cardinals unanimously asked me to reaffirm with the authority of the Successor of Peter the value of human_life and its inviolability , in the light of present circumstances and attacks threatening it today . In response to this request , -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost in I wrote a personal letter to each of my Brother Bishops asking them , in the spirit of episcopal collegiality , to offer me their cooperation in drawing up a specific document . I -amos- deeply grateful to all the Bishops who replied and provided me with valuable facts , suggestions and proposals . In so doing they bore witness to their unanimous desire to share in the doctrinal and pastoral mission of the Church with_regard to the Gospel of life . In that_same letter , written shortly after_the celebration of the centenary of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum , I drew everyone s attention to this striking analogy : '' Just as a century ago it was_the working classes which_were oppressed in their fundamental rights , and the Church very courageously came to their defence by proclaiming the sacrosanct rights of the worker as a person , so now , when another category of persons -isaia- being oppressed in the fundamental right to life , the Church feels in duty bound to speak out with the same courage on behalf of those_who_have no voice . Hers -isaia- always the evangelical cry in defence of the world s poor , those_who_are threatened and despised and whose human_rights are violated '' . Today there exists a great multitude of weak and defenceless human_beings , unborn children in particular , whose fundamental right to life_-isaia- being trampled upon . If , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the last century , the Church could_not be silent about the injustices of those times , still less can she be silent today , when_the social injustices of the past , unfortunately not_yet overcome , are_being compounded in many regions of the world by still_more grievous forms of injustice and oppression , even if these are_being presented as elements of progress in view of a new world order . The present Encyclical , the fruit of the cooperation of the Episcopate of every country of the world , -isaia- therefore meant to be a precise and vigorous reaffirmation of the value of human_life and its inviolability , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a pressing appeal addressed to each_and_every person , in the name of God : respect , protect , love and serve life , every_human life ! Only in this direction will you find justice , development , true freedom , peace and happiness ! May these_words reach all the sons_and_daughters of the Church ! May they reach all people_of_good_will who are_concerned for the good of every man_and_woman and for the destiny of the whole of society ! . In profound communion with all my brothers_and_sisters in the faith , and inspired by genuine friendship towards all , I wish to meditate upon once_more and proclaim_the Gospel of life , the splendour of truth_which enlightens consciences , the clear light_which corrects the darkened gaze , and the unfailing source of faithfulness and steadfastness in facing the ever_new challenges which we meet along our path . As I recall_the powerful experience of the Year of the Family , as if to complete the Letter which I wrote '' to every particular family in every part_of_the_world '' , I look with renewed confidence to every household and I pray that -atti_degli_apostoli- every level a general commitment to support the family will reappear and be strengthened , so that today too even amid so many difficulties and serious threats the family will_always remain , in accordance_with God s plan , the '' sanctuary of life '' . To all the members of the Church , the people of life and for life , I make_this most urgent appeal , that together we may offer this_world of ours new signs of hope , and work to ensure_that justice and solidarity will increase and that a new culture of human_life will be affirmed , for the building of an authentic civilization of truth and love . CHAPTER I THE VOICE OF YOUR BROTHER S BLOOD CRIES TO ME FROM THE GROUND PRESENT DAY THREATS TO HUMAN LIFE '' Cain rose up against his_brother Abel , and killed him '' Gen : : the roots of violence against life . '' God did_not make death , and he does_not delight in the death of the living . For he has created all things_that they_might exist . God created man for incorruption , and made him in the image of his_own eternity , but through the devil s envy death entered the world , and those_who belong to his party experience it '' Wis : ; : . The Gospel of life , proclaimed in the beginning when man was created in the image of God for a destiny of full and perfect life cf . Gen : ; Wis : , -isaia- contradicted by the painful experience of death which enters the world and casts its shadow of meaninglessness over man s entire existence . Death came into_the_world as a result of the devil s envy cf . Gen : , and the sin of our_first parents cf . And death entered it in a violent way , through the killing of Abel by his_brother Cain : '' And when they_were in the field , Cain rose up against his_brother Abel , and killed him '' Gen : . This first murder -isaia- presented with singular eloquence in a page of the Book of Genesis which_has universal significance : it -isaia- a page rewritten daily , with inexorable and degrading frequency , in the book of human_history . Let us re read together this biblical account which , despite its archaic structure and its extreme simplicity , has much to teach us . '' Now Abel was a keeper of sheep , and Cain a tiller of the ground . In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground , and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions . And the Lord had regard_for Abel and his offering , but_for Cain and his offering he had not regard . So Cain was very angry , and his countenance fell . The Lord said to Cain , ? Why are you angry and why has your countenance fallen ? If you do well , will you not be accepted ? And if you do not do well , sin_-isaia- crouching -atti_degli_apostoli- the door ; its desire -isaia- for you , but you_must master it . '' Cain said to Abel his_brother , ? Let us go out to the field . And when they_were in the field , Cain rose up against his_brother Abel , and killed him . Then the Lord said to Cain , ? Where -isaia- Abel your brother ? He said , ? I do not_know ; -amos- I my brother s keeper ? And the Lord said , ? What have you done ? The voice of your brother s blood -isaia- crying to me from the ground . And now you_are cursed from the ground , which_has opened its mouth to receive your brother s blood from your hand . When you till the ground , it shall no longer yield to you its strength ; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth . Cain said to the Lord , ? My punishment -isaia- greater_than I can bear . Behold , you_have driven me this_day away from the ground ; and from your face I shall be hidden ; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth , and whoever finds me will slay me . Then the Lord said to him , ? Not so ! If any_one slays Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold . And the Lord put a mark on Cain , lest any who came upon him should kill him . Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of Nod , east of Eden '' Gen : . Cain was '' very angry '' and his countenance '' fell '' because '' the Lord had regard_for Abel and his offering '' Gen : . The biblical text does_not reveal the reason_why God prefers Abel s sacrifice to Cain s . It clearly shows however that God , although preferring Abel s gift , does_not interrupt his dialogue_with Cain . He admonishes him , reminding him of his freedom in the face of evil : man_-isaia- in no way predestined to evil . Certainly , like Adam , he -isaia- tempted by the malevolent force of sin which , like a wild beast , lies in wait -atti_degli_apostoli- the door of his_heart , ready to leap on its prey . But Cain remains free in the face of sin . He can and must overcome it : '' Its desire -isaia- for you , but you_must master it '' Gen : . Envy and anger have_the upper hand over the Lord s warning , and so Cain attacks his_own brother and kills him . As we read in the Catechism of the Catholic Church : '' In the account of Abel s murder by his_brother Cain , Scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man , consequences of original_sin , from the beginning of human_history . Man has become the enemy of his fellow man '' . Brother kills brother . Like the first fratricide , every murder -isaia- a violation of the '' spiritual '' kinship uniting mankind in one great family , in which all share the same fundamental good : equal personal_dignity . Not infrequently the kinship '' of flesh and blood '' -isaia-_also violated ; for example when threats to life arise within_the relationship_between parents and children , such as happens in abortion or when , in the wider context of family or kinship , euthanasia -isaia- encouraged or practised . At the root of every act of violence against one s neighbour there_-isaia- a concession to the '' thinking '' of the evil one , the one_who '' was a murderer from the beginning '' Jn : . As the Apostle John reminds us : '' For this_-isaia- the message which_you have heard from the beginning , that_we_should love one_another , and not be like Cain who_was of the evil one and murdered his_brother '' Jn : . Cain s killing of his_brother -atti_degli_apostoli- the very dawn of history -isaia- thus a sad witness of how evil spreads with amazing speed : man s revolt against God in the earthly paradise -isaia- followed by the deadly combat of man against man . After the crime , God intervenes to avenge the one killed . Before God , who asks him about the fate of Abel , Cain , instead of showing remorse and apologizing , arrogantly eludes the question : '' I do not_know ; -amos- I my brother s keeper ? '' Gen : . '' I do not_know '' : Cain tries to cover up his crime with a lie . This was and still -isaia- the case , when all kinds of ideologies try to justify and disguise the most atrocious crimes against human_beings . '' Am I my brother s keeper ? '' : Cain does_not wish to think about his_brother and refuses to accept the responsibility which every_person has towards others . We cannot_but think of today s tendency for people to refuse to accept responsibility_for their brothers_and_sisters . Symptoms of this trend include the lack of solidarity towards society s weakest members such as the elderly , the infirm , immigrants , children and the indifference frequently found in relations_between the world s peoples even_when basic values such as survival , freedom and peace are involved . But God cannot leave the crime unpunished : from the ground on which it has_been spilt , the blood of the one murdered demands_that God should render justice cf . From this text the Church has_taken the name of the '' sins which cry to God for_justice '' , and , first among_them , she_has included wilful murder . For the Jewish people , as for_many peoples of antiquity , blood -isaia-_the_source of life . Indeed '' the blood -isaia- the life '' Dt : , and life , especially human_life , belongs only to God : for this_reason whoever attacks human_life , in some_way attacks God himself . Cain -isaia- cursed by God and also by the earth , which_will deny him its fruit cf . He -isaia- punished : he will live in the wilderness and the desert . Murderous violence profoundly changes man s environment . From being the '' garden of Eden '' Gen : , a place of plenty , of harmonious interpersonal relationships and of friendship with God , the earth becomes '' the land of Nod '' Gen : , a place of scarcity , loneliness and separation from God . Cain will be '' a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth '' Gen : : uncertainty and restlessness will follow_him forever . And yet God , who_-isaia- always merciful even_when he punishes , '' put a mark on Cain , lest any who came upon him should kill him '' Gen : . He thus gave him a distinctive sign , not to condemn him to the hatred of others , but to protect and defend him from those wishing to kill him , even out of a desire to avenge Abel s death . Not even a murderer loses his personal_dignity , and God himself pledges to guarantee this . And it -isaia- pre cisely here that the paradoxical mystery of the merciful justice of God -isaia- shown forth . As Saint Ambrose writes : '' Once the crime -isaia- admitted -atti_degli_apostoli- the very inception of this sinful act of parricide , then the divine_law of God s mercy should be immediately extended . If punishment -isaia- forthwith inflicted on the accused , then men in the exercise of justice would in no way observe patience and moderation , but would straightaway condemn the defendant to punishment . God drove Cain out of his presence and sent him into exile far away from his native land , so that he passed from a life of human kindness to one_which was more akin to the rude existence of a wild beast . God , who preferred the correction rather_than the death of a sinner , did_not desire_that a homicide be punished by the exaction of another act of homicide '' . '' What have you done ? '' Gen : : the eclipse of the value of life . The Lord said to Cain : '' What have you done ? The voice of your brother s blood -isaia- crying to me from the ground '' Gen : . The voice of the blood shed by men continues to cry out , from generation to generation , in ever_new and different_ways . The Lord s question : '' What have you done ? '' , which Cain cannot escape , -isaia- addressed also to the people of today , to make_them realize the extent and gravity of the attacks against life_which continue to mark human_history ; to make_them discover what causes these attacks and feeds them ; and to make_them ponder seriously the consequences which derive from_these attacks for the existence of individuals and peoples . Some threats come from nature itself , but_they are made worse by the culpable indifference and negligence of those_who could in some cases remedy them . Others are the result of situations of violence , hatred and conflicting interests , which lead people to attack others through murder , war , slaughter and genocide . And how_can we fail to consider_the violence against life done to millions of human_beings , especially children , who_are forced into poverty , malnutrition and hunger because of an unjust distribution of resources between peoples and between social classes ? And what of the violence inherent not_only in wars as such but in the scandalous arms trade , which spawns the many armed conflicts which stain our_world with blood ? What of the spreading of death caused by reckless tampering with the world s ecological balance , by the criminal spread of drugs , or by the promotion of certain kinds of sexual activity which , besides being morally unacceptable , also involve grave risks to life ? It -isaia- impossible to catalogue completely the vast array of threats to human_life , so many are the forms , whether explicit or hidden , in which_they appear today ! . Here though we shall concentrate particular attention on another category of attacks , affecting life in its earliest and in its final stages , attacks which present new characteristics with_respect to the past and which raise questions of extraordinary seriousness . It -isaia-_not_only that in generalized opinion these attacks tend no longer to be considered as '' crimes '' ; paradoxically they assume the nature of '' rights '' , to the point that the State -isaia- called_upon to give_them legal recognition and to make_them available through the free services of health_care personnel . Such attacks strike human_life -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of its greatest frailty , when it lacks any means of self defence . Even more_serious -isaia- the fact_that , most often , those attacks are carried_out in the very_heart of and with the complicity of the family the family which by its nature_-isaia- called to be the '' sanctuary of life '' . How did such a situation come about ? Many different factors have to be taken into_account . In the background there_-isaia- the profound crisis of culture , which generates scepticism in relation to the very foundations of knowledge and ethics , and which_makes it increasingly difficult to grasp clearly_the meaning of what man_-isaia- , the meaning of his rights and his duties . Then there_are all kinds of existential and interpersonal difficulties , made worse by the complexity of a society in which individuals , couples and families are_often left alone with_their problems . There are situations of acute poverty , anxiety or frustration in which_the struggle to make ends meet , the presence of unbearable pain , or instances of violence , especially against women , make_the choice to defend and promote life so demanding as sometimes to reach the point of heroism . All this explains , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , how the value of life can today undergo a kind of '' eclipse '' , even_though conscience does not_cease to point to it as a sacred and inviolable value , as -isaia- evident in the tendency to disguise certain crimes against life in its early or final stages by using innocuous medical terms which distract attention from the fact_that what_-isaia- involved -isaia- the right to life of an actual human_person . In fact , while the climate of widespread moral uncertainty can in some_way be explained by the multiplicity and gravity of today s social problems , and these can sometimes mitigate the subjective responsibility of individuals , it -isaia- no less true that_we_are confronted by an even larger reality , which_can be described as a veritable structure of sin . This reality -isaia- characterized by the emergence of a culture which denies solidarity and in many cases takes the form of a veritable '' culture of death '' . This culture -isaia- actively fostered by powerful cultural , economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned_with efficiency . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the situation from this point_of_view , it -isaia- possible to speak in a certain_sense of a war of the powerful against the weak : a life which_would require greater acceptance , love and care -isaia- considered useless , or held to be an intolerable burden , and -isaia- therefore rejected in one way or another . A person_who , because of illness , handicap or , more simply , just by existing , compromises the well_being or life style of those_who_are more favoured tends to be looked upon as an enemy to be resisted or eliminated . In this_way a kind of '' conspiracy against life '' -isaia- unleashed . This conspiracy involves not_only individuals in their_personal , family or group relationships , but goes far beyond , to the point of damaging and distorting , -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level , relations_between peoples and States . In order to facilitate the spread of abortion , enormous sums of money have_been invested and continue to be invested in the production of pharmaceutical products which_make it possible to kill the fetus in the mother s womb without recourse to medical assistance . On this_point , scientific_research itself seems to be almost exclusively preoccupied with developing products which_are ever_more simple and effective in suppressing life and which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time are capable of removing abortion from any_kind of control or social responsibility . It -isaia- frequently asserted that contraception , if made safe and available to all , -isaia-_the_most effective remedy against abortion . The Catholic Church -isaia- then accused of actually promoting abortion , because_she obstinately continues to teach the moral unlawfulness of contraception . When looked -atti_degli_apostoli- carefully , this objection -isaia- clearly unfounded . It may be that many_people use contraception with_a_view to excluding the subsequent temptation of abortion . But the negative values inherent in the '' contraceptive mentality '' which_-isaia- very different from responsible parenthood , lived in respect_for the full truth of the conjugal act are such that_they in fact strengthen this temptation when an unwanted life_-isaia- conceived . Indeed , the pro abortion culture -isaia-_especially strong precisely where_the Church s teaching on contraception -isaia- rejected . Certainly , from the moral point_of_view contraception and abortion arespecifically different evils : the former contradicts the full truth of the sexual act as the proper expression of conjugal love , while the latter destroys the life of a human_being ; the former -isaia- opposed to the virtue of chastity in marriage , the latter -isaia- opposed to the virtue of justice and directly violates the divine commandment '' You shall_not kill '' . But despite their differences of nature and moral gravity , contraception and abortion are_often closely connected , as fruits of the same tree . It -isaia- true_that in many cases contraception and even abortion are practised under the pressure of real life difficulties , which nonetheless can_never exonerate from striving to observe God s law fully . Still , in very many_other instances such practices are rooted in a hedonistic mentality unwilling to accept responsibility in matters of sexuality , and they imply a self centered concept of freedom , which regards procreation as an obstacle to personal fulfilment . The life which_could result from a sexual encounter thus becomes an enemy to be avoided -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs , and abortion becomes_the only possible decisive response to failed contraception . The close connection which exists , in mentality , between_the practice of contraception and that of abortion -isaia- becoming increasingly obvious . It -isaia- being demonstrated in an alarming way by the development of chemical products , intrauterine devices and vaccines which , distributed with the same ease as contraceptives , really act as abortifacients in the very early stages of the development of the life of the new human_being . The various techniques of artificial reproduction , which_would seem to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of life and which_are frequently used with this intention , actually open the door to new threats against life . Apart from the fact that_they_are morally unacceptable , since_they separate procreation from the fully human context of the conjugal act , these techniques have a high rate of failure : not_just failure in relation to fertilization but with_regard to the subsequent development of the embryo , which_-isaia- exposed to the risk of death , generally within a very short space of time . Furthermore , the number of embryos produced -isaia-_often greater_than that needed_for implantation in the woman s womb , and these so called '' spare embryos '' are then destroyed or used for research which , under the pretext of scientific or medical progress , in fact reduces human_life to the level of simple '' biological material '' to be freely disposed of . Prenatal diagnosis , which presents no moral objections if carried_out in order to identify the medical treatment which_may be needed by the child in the womb , all too_often becomes an opportunity_for proposing and procuring an abortion . This -isaia- eugenic abortion , justified in public opinion on the basis of a mentality mistakenly held to be consistent with the demands of '' therapeutic interventions '' which accepts life only under certain conditions and rejects it when_it_-isaia- affected by any limitation , handicap or illness . Following this_same logic , the point has_been reached where_the most basic care , even nourishment , -isaia- denied to babies born with serious handicaps or illnesses . The contemporary scene , moreover , -isaia- becoming even_more alarming by reason of the proposals , advanced here and there , to justify even infanticide , following the same arguments used to justify the right to abortion . In this_way , we revert to a state of barbarism which one hoped had_been left behind forever . Threats which_are no less serious hang over the incurably ill and the dying . In a social_and_cultural context which_makes it more difficult to face and accept suffering , the temptation becomes all the greater to resolve the problem of suffering by eliminating it -atti_degli_apostoli- the root , by hastening death so that it occurs -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment considered most suitable . Various considerations usually contribute to such a decision , all of which converge in the same terrible outcome . In the sick person the sense of anguish , of severe discomfort , and even of desperation brought on by intense and prolonged suffering can be a decisive factor . Such a situation can threaten the already fragile equilibrium of an individual s personal and family_life , with the result that , on the one_hand , the sick person , despite the help of increasingly effective medical and social assistance , risks feeling overwhelmed by his or her_own frailty ; and on the other_hand , those close to the sick person can be moved by an understandable even if misplaced compassion . All this_-isaia- aggravated by a cultural climate which fails to perceive any meaning or value in suffering , but_rather considers suffering the epitome of evil , to be eliminated -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs . This -isaia-_especially the case in the absence of a religious outlook which_could help to provide a positive understanding of the mystery of suffering . On a more general level , there exists in contemporary culture a certain Promethean attitude which_leads people to think that_they_can control life and death by taking the decisions about them into_their own hands . What really happens in this case -isaia- that the individual -isaia- overcome and crushed by a death deprived of any prospect of meaning or hope . We see a tragic expression of all this in the spread of euthanasia disguised and surreptitious , or practised openly and even legally . As well as for reasons of a misguided pity -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of the patient s suffering , euthanasia -isaia- sometimes justified by the utilitarian motive of avoiding costs which bring no return and which weigh heavily on society . Thus it -isaia- proposed to eliminate malformed babies , the severely handicapped , the disabled , the elderly , especially_when they_are_not self sufficient , and the terminally ill . Nor can we remain silent in the face of other more furtive , but no less serious and real , forms of euthanasia . These could occur for example when , in order to increase the availability of organs for transplants , organs are removed without respecting objective and adequate criteria which verify the death of the donor . Another present_day phenomenon , frequently used to justify threats and attacks against life , -isaia- the demographic question . This question arises in different_ways in different parts_of_the_world . In the rich and developed countries there_-isaia- a disturbing decline or collapse of the birthrate . The poorer countries , on the other_hand , generally have a high rate of population growth , difficult to sustain in the context of low economic_and_social development , and especially where there_-isaia- extreme underdevelopment . In the face of over population in the poorer countries , instead of forms of global intervention -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level serious family and social policies , programmes of cultural development and of fair production and distribution of resources anti birth policies continue to be enacted . Contraception , sterilization and abortion are certainly part of the reason_why in some cases there_-isaia- a sharp decline in the birthrate . It -isaia- not difficult to be tempted to use the same methods and attacks against life also where there_-isaia- a situation of '' demographic explosion '' . The Pharaoh of old , haunted by the presence and increase of the children of Israel , submitted them to every_kind of oppression and ordered that_every male child born of the Hebrew women was to be killed cf . Today not_a_few of the powerful of the earth act in the same_way . They too are haunted by the current demographic growth , and fear that the most prolific and poorest peoples represent a threat for the well_being and peace of their_own countries . Consequently , rather_than wishing to face and solve these serious problems with_respect for the dignity of individuals and families and for every_person s inviolable right to life , they prefer to promote and impose by whatever means a massive programme of birth control . Even the economic help which they_would be ready to give -isaia- unjustly made conditional on the acceptance of an anti birth policy . Humanity today offers us a truly alarming spectacle , if we consider not_only how extensively attacks on life are spreading but_also their unheard of numerical proportion , and the fact_that they receive widespread and powerful support from a broad consensus on the part of society , from widespread legal approval and the involvement of certain sectors of health_care personnel . As I emphatically stated -atti_degli_apostoli- Denver , on the occasion of the Eighth World Youth Day , '' with time the threats against life have_not grown weaker . They are taking on vast proportions . They are not_only threats coming from the outside , from the forces of nature or the ? Cains who kill the ? Abels ; no , they_are scientifically and systematically programmed threats . The twentieth century will have_been an era of massive attacks on life , an endless series of wars and a continual taking of innocent human_life . False prophets and false teachers have_had the greatest success '' . Aside from intentions , which_can be varied and perhaps can seem convincing -atti_degli_apostoli- times , especially if presented in the name of solidarity , we are in fact faced by an objective '' conspiracy against life '' , involving even international Institutions , engaged in encouraging and carrying_out actual campaigns to make contraception , sterilization and abortion widely available . Nor can it be denied that the mass_media are_often implicated in this conspiracy , by lending credit to that culture which presents recourse to contraception , sterilization , abortion and even euthanasia as a mark of progress and a victory of freedom , while depicting as enemies of freedom and progress those positions which_are unreservedly pro life . '' Am I my brother s keeper ? '' Gen : : a perverse idea of freedom . The panorama described needs to be understood not_only in terms of the phenomena of death which characterize it but_also in the variety of causes which determine it . The Lord s question : '' What have you done ? '' Gen : , seems almost like an invitation addressed to Cain to go beyond_the material dimension of his murderous gesture , in order to recognize in it all the gravity of the motives which occasioned it and the consequences which result from it . Decisions that go against life sometimes arise from difficult or even tragic situations of profound suffering , loneliness , a total lack of economic pros pects , depression and anxiety about the future . Such circumstances can mitigate even to a notable degree subjective responsibility and the consequent culpability of those_who make these choices which in themselves are evil . But today the prob lem goes far beyond_the necessary recognition of these personal situations . It -isaia- a problem which exists -atti_degli_apostoli- the cultural , social and political level , where it reveals its more sinister and disturbing aspect in the tendency , ever_more widely shared , to interpret the above crimes against life as legitimate expressions of individual freedom , to be acknowledged and protected as actual rights . In this_way , and with tragic consequences , a long historical process -isaia- reaching a turning point . The process which once led to discovering the idea of '' human_rights '' rights inherent in every_person and prior to any Constitution and State legislation -isaia- today marked by a surprising contradiction . Precisely in an age when_the inviolable rights of the person are solemnly proclaimed and the value of life_-isaia- publicly affirmed , the very right to life_-isaia- being denied or trampled upon , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the more significant moments of existence : the moment of birth and the moment of death . On the one_hand , the various declarations of human_rights and the many initiatives inspired by these declarations show that -atti_degli_apostoli- the global level there_-isaia- a growing moral sensitivity , more alert to acknowledging the value and dignity of every_individual as a human_being , without_any distinction of race , nationality , religion , political opinion or social class . On the other_hand , these noble proclamations are unfortunately contradicted by a tragic repudiation of them in practice . This denial -isaia- still_more distressing , indeed more scandalous , precisely because_it_-isaia- occurring in a society_which makes_the affirmation and protection of human_rights its primary objective and its boast . How can these repeated affirmations of principle be reconciled with the continual increase and widespread justification of attacks on human_life ? How can we reconcile these declarations with the refusal to accept those_who_are weak and needy , or elderly , or those_who_have just been conceived ? These attacks go directly against respect_for life and they represent a direct threat to the entire culture of human_rights . It -isaia- a threat capable , in the end , of jeopardizing the very meaning of democratic coexistence : rather_than societies of '' people living together '' , our cities risk becoming societies of people_who_are rejected , marginalized , uprooted and oppressed . If we then look -atti_degli_apostoli- the wider worldwide perspective , how_can we fail to think_that the very affirmation of the rights of individuals and peoples made in distinguished international assemblies -isaia- a merely futile exercise of rhetoric , if we fail to unmask the selfishness of the rich countries which exclude poorer countries from access to development or make such access dependent on arbitrary prohibitions against procreation , setting up an opposition between development and man_himself ? Should we not question the very economic models often adopted by States which , also as a result of international pressures and forms of conditioning , cause and aggravate situations of injustice and violence in which_the life of whole peoples -isaia- degraded and trampled upon ? . What are the roots of this remarkable contradiction ? We can_find them in an overall assessment of a cultural and moral nature , beginning with the mentality which carries the concept of subjectivity to an extreme and even distorts it , and recognizes as a subject of rights only the person_who enjoys full or -atti_degli_apostoli- least incipient autonomy and who emerges from a state of total dependence on others . But how_can we reconcile this approach with the exaltation of man as a being who_-isaia- '' not to be used '' ? The theory of human_rights -isaia- based precisely on the affirmation that the human_person , unlike animals and things , cannot be subjected to domination by others . We must_also mention the mentality which tends to equate personal_dignity with the capacity_for verbal and explicit , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least perceptible , communication . It -isaia- clear_that on the basis of these presuppositions there_-isaia- no place in the world for anyone_who , like the unborn or the dying , -isaia- a weak element in the social structure , or for anyone_who appears completely -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of others and radically dependent on them , and can_only communicate through the silent language of a profound sharing of affection . In this case it -isaia- force which becomes_the criterion for choice and action in interpersonal relations and in social_life . But this_-isaia- the exact opposite of what a State ruled by law , as a community in which_the '' reasons of force '' are replaced by the '' force of reason '' , historically intended to affirm . At another level , the roots of the contradiction between_the solemn affirmation of human_rights and their tragic denial in practice lies in a notion of freedom which exalts the isolated individual in an absolute way , and gives no place to solidarity , to openness to others and service of them . While it -isaia- true_that the taking of life not_yet born or in its final stages -isaia- sometimes marked by a mistaken sense of altruism and human compassion , it cannot be denied that_such a culture of death , taken as a whole , betrays a completely individualistic concept of freedom , which ends up by becoming the freedom of '' the strong '' against the weak who_have no choice but to submit . It -isaia- precisely in this sense_that Cain s answer to the Lord s question : '' Where -isaia- Abel your brother ? '' can be interpreted : '' I do not_know ; -amos- I my brother s keeper ? '' Gen : . Yes , every man -isaia-_his '' brother s keeper '' , because God entrusts us to one_another . And it -isaia-_also in view of this entrusting that God gives everyone freedom , a freedom which possesses an inherently relational dimension . This -isaia- a great gift of the Creator , placed as it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the person and of his fulfilment through the gift_of_self and openness to others ; but_when freedom_-isaia- made absolute in an individualistic way , it -isaia- emptied of its original content , and its_very meaning and dignity are contradicted . There -isaia- an even_more profound aspect which needs to be emphasized : freedom negates and destroys itself , and becomes a factor leading to the destruction of others , when it no longer recognizes and respects its essential link with the truth . When freedom , out of a desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority , shuts out even the most obvious evidence of an objective and universal truth , which_-isaia- the foundation of personal and social_life , then the person ends up by no longer taking as the sole and indisputable point of reference for his_own choices the truth_about good_and_evil , but_only his subjective and changeable opinion or , indeed , his selfish interest and whim . This view of freedom leads to a serious distortion of life in society . If the promotion of the self -isaia- understood in terms of absolute autonomy , people inevitably reach the point of rejecting one_another . Everyone else -isaia- considered an enemy from whom one_has to defend oneself . Thus soci ety becomes a mass of individuals placed side by side , but without_any mutual bonds . Each one wishes to assert himself independently of the other and in fact intends to make his_own interests prevail . Still , in the face of other people s analogous interests , some kind of compromise must be found , if one wants a society in which_the maximum possible freedom_-isaia- guaranteed to each_individual . In this_way , any reference to common values and to a truth absolutely binding on everyone -isaia- lost , and social_life ventures on to the shifting sands of complete relativism . At that point , everything -isaia- negotiable , everything -isaia- open to bargaining : even the first of the fundamental rights , the right to life . This -isaia- what_-isaia- happening also -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of politics and government : the original and inalienable right to life_-isaia- questioned or denied on the basis of a parliamentary vote or the will of one part of the people even if it -isaia- the majority . This -isaia- the sinister result of a relativism which reigns unopposed : the '' right '' ceases to be such , because_it_-isaia- no longer firmly founded on the inviolable dignity of the person , but_-isaia- made subject to the will of the stronger part . In this_way democracy , contradicting its_own principles , effectively moves towards a form of totalitarianism . The State -isaia-_no_longer the '' common home '' where all can live together on the basis of principles of fundamental equality , but_-isaia- transformed into a tyrant State , which arrogates to itself the right to dispose of the life of the weakest and most defenceless members , from the unborn child to the elderly , in the name of a public interest which_-isaia- really nothing but the interest of one part . The appearance of the strictest respect_for legality -isaia- maintained , -atti_degli_apostoli- least when_the laws permitting abortion and euthanasia are the result of a ballot in accordance_with what_are generally seen as the rules of democracy . Really , what_we_have here -isaia- only the tragic caricature of legality ; the democratic ideal , which_-isaia- only truly such when it acknowledges and safeguards the dignity of every human_person , -isaia- betrayed in its_very foundations : '' How -isaia- it still possible to speak of the dignity of every human_person when_the killing of the weakest and most innocent -isaia- permitted ? In the name of what justice -isaia-_the_most unjust of discriminations practised : some individuals are held to be deserving of defence and others are denied that dignity ? '' When this happens , the process leading to the breakdown of a genuinely human co existence and the disintegration of the State itself has_already begun . To claim the right to abortion , infanticide and euthanasia , and to recognize_that right in law , means to attribute to human_freedom a perverse and evil significance : that of an absolute power over others and against others . This -isaia- the death of true freedom : '' Truly , truly , I say to you , every_one who commits sin_-isaia- a slave to sin '' Jn : . '' And from your face I shall be hidden '' Gen : : the eclipse of the sense of God and of man . In seeking the deepest roots of the struggle between_the '' culture of life '' and the '' culture of death '' , we cannot restrict ourselves to the perverse idea of freedom mentioned above . We have to go to the heart of the tragedy being experienced by modern man : the eclipse of the sense of God and of man , typical of a social_and_cultural climate dominated by secularism , which , with its ubiquitous tentacles , succeeds -atti_degli_apostoli- times in putting Christian communities themselves to the test . Those who allow themselves to be influenced by this climate easily fall_into a sad vicious circle : when_the sense of God -isaia- lost , there_-isaia-_also a tendency to lose the sense of man , of his dignity and his_life ; in turn , the systematic violation of the moral_law , especially in the serious matter of respect_for human_life and its dignity , produces a kind of progressive darkening of the capacity to discern God s living and saving presence . Once again we can gain insight from the story of Abel s murder by his_brother . After the curse imposed on him by God , Cain thus addresses the Lord : '' My punishment -isaia- greater_than I can bear . Behold , you_have driven me this_day away from the ground ; and from your face I shall be hidden ; and I shall be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth , and whoever finds me will slay me '' Gen : . Cain -isaia- convinced_that his sin will_not obtain pardon from the Lord and that_his inescapable destiny will be to have to '' hide his face '' from him . If Cain -isaia- capable of confessing that_his fault -isaia- '' greater_than he can bear '' , it -isaia- because he -isaia- conscious of being in the presence of God and before God s just judgment . It -isaia- really only before the Lord that_man can admit his sin and recognize its_full seriousness . Such was_the experience of David who , after '' having committed evil in the sight of the Lord '' , and being rebuked by the Prophet Nathan , exclaimed : '' My offences truly I know them ; my sin_-isaia- always before me . Against you , you alone , have I sinned ; what_-isaia- evil in your sight I have_done '' Ps : . Consequently , when_the sense of God -isaia- lost , the sense of man -isaia-_also threatened and poisoned , as the Second Vatican Council concisely states : '' Without the Creator the creature would disappear . But when God -isaia- forgotten the creature itself grows unintelligible '' . Man -isaia-_no_longer able to see himself as '' mysteriously different '' from other earthly creatures ; he regards himself merely as one more living being , as an organism which , -atti_degli_apostoli- most , has reached a very high stage of perfection . Enclosed in the narrow horizon of his physical nature , he -isaia- somehow reduced to being '' a thing '' , and no longer grasps the '' transcendent '' character of his '' existence as man '' . He no longer considers life as a splendid gift of God , something '' sacred '' entrusted to his responsibility and thus also to his loving care and '' veneration '' . Life itself becomes a mere '' thing '' , which_man claims as his exclusive property , completely subject to his control and manipulation . Thus , in relation to life -atti_degli_apostoli- birth or -atti_degli_apostoli- death , man -isaia-_no_longer capable of posing the question of the truest meaning of his_own existence , nor_can he assimilate with genuine freedom these crucial moments of his_own history . He -isaia- concerned only_with '' doing '' , and , using all kinds of technology , he busies himself_with programming , controlling and dominating birth and death . Birth and death , instead of being primary experiences demanding to be '' lived '' , become things to be merely '' possessed '' or '' rejected '' . Moreover , once all reference to God has_been removed , it -isaia- not surprising that the meaning of everything else becomes profoundly distorted . Nature itself , from being '' mater '' mother , -isaia-_now reduced to being '' matter '' , and -isaia- subjected to every_kind of manipulation . This -isaia- the direction in which a certain technical and scientific way of thinking , prevalent in present_day culture , appears to be leading when it rejects the very idea that_there_-isaia- a truth of creation which_must be ac knowledged , or a plan of God for life_which must be respected . Something similar happens when concern about the consequences of such a '' freedom without law '' leads some people to the opposite position of a '' law without freedom '' , as for example in ideologies which consider it unlawful to interfere in any_way with nature , practically '' divinizing '' it . Again , this_-isaia- a misunderstanding of nature s dependence on the plan of the Creator . Thus it -isaia- clear_that the loss of contact_with God s wise design -isaia- the deepest root of modern man s confusion , both when this loss leads to a freedom without rules and when it leaves man in '' fear '' of his freedom . By living '' as if God did not_exist '' , man not_only loses sight of the mystery of God , but_also of the mystery of the world and the mystery of his_own being . The eclipse of the sense of God and of man inevitably leads to a practical materialism , which breeds individualism , utilitarianism and hedonism . Here too we see the permanent validity of the words of the Apostle : '' And since_they did_not see fit to acknowledge God , God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct '' Rom : . The values of being are replaced by those of having . The only goal which counts -isaia- the pursuit of one_s_own material well_being . The so called '' quality of life '' -isaia- interpreted primarily or exclusively as economic efficiency , inordinate consumerism , physical beauty and pleasure , to the neglect of the more profound dimensions interpersonal , spiritual and religious of existence . In such a context suffering , an inescapable burden of human_existence but_also a factor of possible personal growth , -isaia- '' censored '' , rejected as useless , indeed opposed as an evil , always and in every way to be avoided . When it cannot be avoided and the prospect of even some future well_being vanishes , then life appears to have lost all meaning and the temptation grows in man to claim the right to suppress it . Within this_same cultural climate , the body -isaia-_no_longer perceived as a properly personal reality , a sign and place of relations with_others , with God and with the world . It -isaia- reduced to pure materiality : it -isaia- simply a complex of organs , functions and energies to be used according to the sole criteria of pleasure and efficiency . Consequently , sexuality too -isaia- depersonalized and exploited : from being the sign , place and language of love , that_-isaia- , of the gift_of_self and acceptance of another , in all the other s richness as a person , it increasingly becomes_the occasion and instrument for self assertion and the selfish satisfaction of personal desires and instincts . Thus the original import of human sexuality -isaia- distorted and falsified , and the two meanings , unitive and procreative , inherent in the very nature of the conjugal act , are artificially separated : in this_way the marriage union -isaia- betrayed and its fruitfulness -isaia- subjected to the caprice of the couple . Procreation then becomes_the '' enemy '' to be avoided in sexual activity : if it -isaia- welcomed , this_-isaia- only_because it expresses a desire , or indeed the intention , to have a child '' -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs '' , and not because it signifies the complete acceptance of the other and therefore an openness to the richness of life_which the child represents . In the materialistic perspective described so far , interpersonal relations are seriously impoverished . The first to be harmed are women , children , the sick or suffering , and the elderly . The criterion of personal_dignity which demands respect , generosity and service -isaia- replaced by the criterion of efficiency , functionality and usefulness : others are considered not_for what_they '' are '' , but_for what_they '' have , do and produce '' . This -isaia- the supremacy of the strong over the weak . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the moral conscience that the eclipse of the sense of God and of man , with all its various and deadly consequences for life , -isaia- taking place . It -isaia-_a_question , above all , of the individual conscience , as it stands before God in its singleness and uniqueness . But it -isaia-_also a question , in a certain_sense , of the '' moral conscience '' of society : in a way it too -isaia- responsible , not only_because it tolerates or fosters behaviour contrary to life , but also_because it encourages the '' culture of death '' , creating and consolidating actual '' structures of sin '' which go against life . The moral conscience , both individual and social , -isaia- today subjected , also as a result of the penetrating influence of the media , to an extremely serious and mortal danger : that of confusion between good_and_evil , precisely in relation to the fundamental right to life . A large part of contemporary society looks sadly like that humanity which Paul describes in his Letter to the Romans . It -isaia- composed '' of men_who by their wickedness suppress the truth '' : : having denied God and believing that_they_can build the earthly city without him , '' they became futile in their thinking '' so that '' their senseless minds were darkened '' : ; '' claiming to be wise , they became fools '' : , carrying_out works deserving of death , and '' they not_only do them but approve those_who practise them '' : . When conscience , this bright lamp of the soul cf . Mt : , calls '' evil good and good evil '' Is : , it -isaia-_already on the path to the most alarming corruption and the darkest moral blindness . And yet all the conditioning and efforts to enforce silence fail to stifle the voice of the Lord echoing in the conscience of every_individual : it -isaia- always from this intimate sanctuary of the conscience that a new journey of love , openness and service to human_life can begin . '' You have come to the sprinkled blood '' cf . Heb : , : signs of hope and invitation to commitment . '' The voice of your brother s blood -isaia- crying to me from the ground '' Gen : . It -isaia-_not_only the voice of the blood of Abel , the first innocent man to be murdered , which cries to God , the source and defender of life . The blood of every_other human_being who has_been killed since Abel -isaia-_also a voice raised to the Lord . In an absolutely singular way , as the author of the Letter to the Hebrews reminds us , the voice of the blood of Christ , of whom Abel in his innocence -isaia- a prophetic figure , cries out to God : '' You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God . to the mediator of a new_covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel '' : , . It -isaia- the sprinkled blood . A symbol and prophetic sign of it had been_the blood of the sacrifices of the Old Covenant , whereby God expressed his_will to communicate his own_life to men , purifying and consecrating them cf . Now all of this_-isaia- fulfilled and comes true in Christ : his -isaia- the sprinkled blood which redeems , purifies and saves ; it -isaia- the blood of the Mediator of the New Covenant '' poured out for_many for the forgiveness of sins '' Mt : . This blood , which flows from the pierced side of Christ on the Cross cf . Jn : , '' speaks more graciously '' than the blood of Abel ; indeed , it expresses and requires a more radical '' justice '' , and above all it implores mercy , it makes intercession for the brethren before the Father cf . Heb : , and it -isaia-_the_source of perfect redemption and the gift of new_life . The blood of Christ , while it reveals the grandeur of the Father s love , shows how precious man_-isaia- in God s eyes and how priceless the value of his_life . The Apostle Peter reminds us of this : '' You know_that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers , not_with perishable things such as silver or gold , but_with the precious blood of Christ , like that of a lamb without blemish or spot '' Pt : . Precisely by contemplating the precious blood of Christ , the sign of his self_giving love cf . Jn : , the believer learns to recognize and appreciate the almost divine dignity of every_human_being and can exclaim with ever renewed and grateful wonder : '' How precious must man be in the eyes of the Creator , if he ? gained so great a Redeemer Exsultet of the Easter Vigil , and if God ? gave_his only Son in order_that man ? should_not perish but have eternal_life cf . Furthermore , Christ s blood reveals to man that_his greatness , and therefore his vocation , consists in the sincere gift_of_self . Precisely because_it_-isaia- poured out as the gift of life , the blood of Christ -isaia-_no_longer a sign of death , of definitive separation from the brethren , but the instrument of a communion_which -isaia- richness of life_for all . Whoever in the Sacrament of the Eucharist drinks this blood and abides in Jesus cf . Jn : -isaia- drawn into the dynamism of his_love and gift of life , in order to bring to its fullness the original vocation to love_which belongs to everyone cf . It -isaia- from the blood of Christ that all draw the strength to commit themselves to promoting life . It -isaia- precisely this blood that -isaia-_the_most powerful source of hope , indeed it -isaia- the foundation of the absolute certitude that in God s plan life will be victorious . '' And death shall be no more '' , exclaims the powerful voice which_comes_from the throne of God in the Heavenly Jerusalem Rev : . And Saint Paul assures us that the present victory over sin_-isaia- a sign and anticipation of the definitive victory over death , when there '' shall come to pass the saying that_-isaia- written : ? Death -isaia- swallowed up in victory . ? O death , where -isaia- your victory ? O death , where -isaia- your sting ? '' Cor : . In effect , signs which point to this victory are_not lacking in our societies and cultures , strongly marked though_they are by the '' culture of death '' . It would therefore be to give a one sided picture , which_could lead to sterile discouragement , if the condemnation of the threats to life were_not accompanied by the presentation of the positive signs -atti_degli_apostoli- work in humanity s present situation . Unfortunately it -isaia-_often hard to see and recognize these positive signs , perhaps also_because they_do_not receive sufficient attention in the communications media . Yet , how_many initiatives of help and support for people_who_are weak and defenceless have sprung up and continue to spring up in the Christian community and in civil_society , -atti_degli_apostoli- the local , national and international level , through the efforts of individuals , groups , movements and organizations of various kinds ! There are_still many married_couples who , with a generous sense_of_responsibility , are ready to accept children as '' the supreme gift of marriage '' . Nor -isaia- there a lack of families which , over and above their everyday service to life , are willing to accept abandoned children , boys and girls and teenagers in difficulty , handicapped persons , elderly men_and_women_who have_been left alone . Many centres in support of life , or similar institutions , are sponsored by individuals and groups which , with admirable dedication and sacrifice , offer moral and material support to mothers who_are in difficulty and are tempted to have_recourse to abortion . Increasingly , there_are appearing in many places groups of volunteers prepared to offer hospitality to persons without a family , who find_themselves in conditions of particular distress or who need a supportive environment to help_them to overcome destructive habits and discover anew the meaning of life . Medical science , thanks to the committed efforts of researchers and practitioners , continues in its efforts to discover ever more_effective remedies : treatments which_were once inconceivable but_which now offer much promise for the future are today being developed for the unborn , the suffering and those in an acute or terminal stage of sickness . Various agencies and organizations are mobilizing their_efforts to bring_the benefits of the most advanced medicine to countries most afflicted by poverty and endemic diseases . In a similar way national and international associations of physicians are_being organized to bring quick relief to peoples affected by natural disasters , epidemics or wars . Even if a just international distribution of medical resources -isaia- still far_from_being a reality , how_can we not recognize in the steps taken so far the sign of a growing solidarity among peoples , a praiseworthy human and moral sensitivity and a greater respect_for life ? . In view of laws which permit abortion and in view of efforts , which here and there have_been successful , to legalize euthanasia , movements and initiatives to raise social awareness in defence of life have sprung up in many parts_of_the_world . When , in accordance_with their principles , such movements act resolutely , but without resorting to violence , they promote a wider and more profound consciousness of the value of life , and evoke and bring_about a more determined commitment to its defence . Furthermore , how_can we fail to mention all those daily gestures of openness , sacrifice and unselfish care which countless people lovingly make in families , hospitals , orphanages , homes for the elderly and other centres or communities which defend life ? Allowing herself to be guided by the example of Jesus the '' Good Samaritan '' cf . Lk : and upheld by his strength , the Church has_always_been in the front line in providing charitable help : so many of her sons_and_daughters , especially men_and_women Religious , in traditional and ever new_forms , have consecrated and continue to consecrate their_lives to God , freely giving of themselves out of love for their neighbour , especially_for the weak and needy . These deeds strengthen the bases of the '' civilization of love and life '' , without_which the life of individuals and of society itself loses its most genuinely human quality . Even if they go unnoticed and remain hidden to most people , faith assures us that the Father '' who sees in secret '' Mt : not_only will reward these actions but already here and now makes them produce lasting fruit for the good of all . Among the signs of hope we should_also count the spread , -atti_degli_apostoli- many levels of public opinion , of a new sensitivity ever_more opposed to war as an instrument for the resolution of conflicts between peoples , and increasingly oriented to finding effective but '' non violent '' means to counter the armed aggressor . In the same perspective there_-isaia- evidence of a growing public opposition to the death penalty , even_when such a penalty -isaia- seen as a kind of '' legitimate defence '' on the part of society . Modern society in fact has the means of effectively suppressing crime by rendering criminals harmless without definitively denying them the chance to reform . Another welcome sign -isaia- the growing attention being paid to the quality of life and to ecology , especially in more developed societies , where people s expectations are no longer concentrated so much on problems of survival as on the search_for an overall improvement of living conditions . Especially significant -isaia- the reawakening of an ethical reflection on issues affecting life . The emergence and ever_more widespread development of bioethics -isaia- promoting more reflection and dialogue_between believers and non believers , as well as between followers of different religions on ethical problems , including fundamental issues pertaining to human_life . This situation , with its lights and shadows , ought to make us all fully aware that_we_are facing an enormous and dramatic clash between good_and_evil , death and life , the '' culture of death '' and the '' culture of life '' . We find ourselves not_only '' faced_with '' but necessarily '' in the midst of '' this conflict : we are all involved and we all share in it , with the inescapable responsibility of choosing to be unconditionally pro life . For us too Moses invitation rings out loud and clear : '' See , I have set before you this_day life and good , death and evil . I have set before you life and death , blessing and curse ; therefore choose life , that_you and your descendants may live '' Dt : , . This invitation -isaia-_very appropriate for us who are_called day_by_day to the duty of choosing between_the '' culture of life '' and the '' culture of death '' . But the call of Deuteronomy goes even deeper , for it urges us to make a choice which_-isaia- properly religious and moral . It -isaia-_a_question of giving our_own existence a basic orientation and living the law of the Lord faithfully and consistently : '' If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this_day , by loving the Lord your God , by walking in his ways , and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances , then you shall live . therefore choose life , that_you and your descendants may live , loving the Lord your God , obeying his voice , and cleaving to him ; for that means life to you and length of days '' : , . The unconditional choice for life reaches its_full religious and moral meaning when it flows from , -isaia- formed by and nourished by faith in Christ . Nothing helps us so much to face positively the conflict between death and life in which_we_are engaged as faith in the Son of God who became man and dwelt among_men so '' that_they_may have life , and have it abundantly '' Jn : . It -isaia-_a_matter of faith in the Risen Lord , who_has conquered death ; faith in the blood of Christ '' that speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel '' Heb : . With the light and strength of this faith , therefore , in facing the challenges of the present situation , the Church -isaia- becoming more aware of the grace and responsibility which come to her from her Lord of proclaiming , celebrating and serving the Gospel of life . CHAPTER II I CAME THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE CONCERNING LIFE '' The life was_made manifest , and we saw it '' Jn : : with_our gaze fixed on Christ , '' the Word of life '' . Faced with the countless grave threats to life present in the modern_world , one could feel overwhelmed by sheer powerlessness : good can_never be powerful enough to triumph over evil ! At such times the People of God , and this includes every believer , -isaia- called to profess with humility and courage its faith in Jesus Christ , '' the Word of life '' Jn : . The Gospel of life_-isaia- not_simply a reflection , however new and profound , on human_life . Nor -isaia- it merely a commandment aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- raising awareness and bringing_about significant changes in society . Still less -isaia- it an illusory promise of a better future . The Gospel of life_-isaia- something concrete and personal , for it consists in the proclamation of the very person of Jesus . Jesus made himself known to the Apostle Thomas , and in him to every_person , with the words : '' I -amos- the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn : . This -isaia-_also how he spoke of himself to Martha , the sister of Lazarus : '' I -amos- the resurrection and the life ; he who believes in me , though he die , yet shall he live , and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die '' Jn : . Jesus -isaia- the Son who from all eternity receives life from the Father cf . Jn : , and who_has come among_men to make_them sharers in this_gift : '' I came that_they_may have life , and have it abundantly '' Jn : . Through the words , the actions and the very person of Jesus , man_-isaia- given the possibility of '' knowing '' the complete truth concerning the value of human_life . From this '' source '' he receives , in particular , the capacity to '' accomplish '' this_truth perfectly cf . Jn : , that_-isaia- , to accept and fulfil completely the responsibility of loving and serving , of defending and promoting human_life . In Christ , the Gospel of life_-isaia- definitively proclaimed and fully given . This -isaia- the Gospel which , already present in the Revelation of the Old Testament , and indeed written in the heart of every man_and_woman , has echoed in every conscience '' from the beginning '' , from the time of creation itself , in such_a_way_that , despite the negative consequences of sin , it can_also be known in its essential traits by human_reason . As the Second Vatican Council teaches , Christ '' perfected revelation by fulfilling it through_his whole work of making himself present and manifesting himself ; through_his words and deeds , his signs and wonders , but especially through_his death and glorious Resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth . Moreover , he confirmed with divine testimony what revelation proclaimed : that God -isaia- with us to free us from the darkness of sin and death , and to raise us up to life eternal '' . Hence , with_our attention fixed on the Lord Jesus , we wish to hear from him once_again '' the words of God '' Jn : and meditate anew on the Gospel of life . The deepest and most original meaning of this meditation on what revelation tells us about human_life was taken up by the Apostle John in the opening words of his First Letter : '' That which_was from the beginning , which_we_have heard , which_we_have seen with our_eyes , which_we_have looked upon and touched with_our hands , concerning the word of life the life was_made manifest , and we saw it , and testify to it , and proclaim to you the eternal_life which_was with the Father and was_made manifest to us that which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us '' : . In Jesus , the '' Word of life '' , God s eternal_life -isaia- thus proclaimed and given . Thanks to this proclamation and gift , our physical and spiritual_life , also in its earthly phase , acquires its_full value and meaning , for God s eternal_life -isaia-_in_fact the end to which_our living in this_world -isaia-_directed and called . In this_way the Gospel of life includes everything_that human experience and reason tell us about the value of human_life , accepting it , purifying it , exalting it and bringing it to fulfilment . '' The Lord -isaia- my strength and my song , and he has become my salvation '' Ex : : life_-isaia- always a good . The fullness of the Gospel message about life was prepared_for in the Old Testament . Especially in the events of the Exodus , the centre of the Old Testament faith experience , Israel discovered the preciousness of its life in the eyes of God . When it seemed doomed to extermination because of the threat of death hanging over all its newborn males cf . Ex : , the Lord revealed himself to Israel as its Saviour , with the power to ensure a future to those without hope . Israel thus comes to know clearly that_its existence -isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of a Pharaoh who_can exploit it -atti_degli_apostoli- his despotic whim . On the contrary , Israel s life_-isaia- the object of God s gentle and intense love . Freedom from slavery meant the gift of an identity , the recognition of an indestructible dignity and the beginning of a new history , in which_the discovery of God and discovery of self go hand in hand . The Exodus was a foundational experience and a model for the future . Through it , Israel comes to learn that whenever its existence -isaia- threatened it need only turn to God with renewed trust in order to find in him effective help : '' I formed you , you_are my servant ; O Israel , you will_not be forgotten by me '' Is : . Thus , in coming to know_the value of its_own existence as a people , Israel also grows in its perception of the meaning and value of life_itself . This reflection -isaia- developed more specifically in the Wisdom Literature , on the basis of daily experience of the precariousness of life and awareness of the threats which assail it . Faced with the contradictions of life , faith_-isaia- challenged to respond . More than anything else , it -isaia- the problem of suffering which challenges faith and puts it to the test . How can we fail to appreciate the universal anguish of man when we meditate on the Book of Job ? The innocent man overwhelmed by suffering -isaia- understandably led to wonder : '' Why -isaia- light given to him that_-isaia- in misery , and life to the bitter in soul , who long for death , but it comes not , and dig for it more_than for hid treasures ? '' : . But even_when the darkness -isaia- deepest , faith points to a trusting and adoring acknowledgment of the '' mystery '' : '' I know_that you can do all things , and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted '' Job : . Revelation progressively allows the first notion of immortal life planted by the Creator in the human_heart to be grasped with ever_greater clarity : '' He has made everything beautiful in its time ; also he has put eternity into man s mind '' Ec : . This first notion of totality and fullness -isaia- waiting to be manifested in love and brought to perfection , by God s free gift , through sharing in his eternal_life . '' The name of Jesus . has made this man strong '' Acts : : in the uncertainties of human_life , Jesus brings life s meaning to fulfilment . The experience of the people of the Covenant -isaia- renewed in the experience of all the '' poor '' who meet Jesus of Nazareth . Just as God who '' loves the living '' cf . Wis : had reassured Israel in the midst of danger , so now the Son of God proclaims to all who feel threatened and hindered that their_lives too are a good to which_the Father s love gives meaning and value . '' The blind receive their sight , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have good_news preached to them '' Lk : . With these_words of the Prophet Isaiah : , : , Jesus sets forth the meaning of his_own mission : all who_suffer because their_lives are in some_way '' diminished '' thus hear from him the '' good_news '' of God s concern_for them , and they know for certain_that their_lives too are a gift carefully guarded in the hands of the Father cf . It -isaia- above all the '' poor '' to whom Jesus speaks in his preaching and actions . The crowds of the sick and the outcasts who follow_him and seek him out cf . Mt : find in his_words and actions a revelation of the great value of their_lives and of how their hope of salvation -isaia- well founded . The same thing has taken_place in the Church s mission from the beginning . When the Church proclaims Christ as the one_who '' went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil , for God was with_him '' Acts : , she_-isaia- conscious of being the bearer of a message of salvation which resounds in all its newness precisely amid the hardships and poverty of human_life . Peter cured the cripple who daily sought alms -atti_degli_apostoli- the '' Beautiful Gate '' of the Temple in Jerusalem , saying : '' I have no silver and gold , but I give_you what I have ; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , walk '' Acts : . By faith in Jesus , '' the Author of life '' Acts : , life_which lies abandoned and cries out for help regains self esteem and full dignity . The words and deeds of Jesus and those of his Church are_not meant only_for those_who_are sick or suffering or in some_way neglected by society . On a deeper level they affect the very meaning of every_person s life in its moral and spiritual dimensions . Only those_who recognize_that their life_-isaia- marked by the evil of sin can discover in an encounter_with Jesus the Saviour the truth and the authenticity of their_own existence . Jesus himself says as much : '' Those who are_well have no need of a physician , but those_who_are sick ; I have_not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance '' Lk : . But the person_who , like the rich land owner in the Gospel parable , thinks that he can_make his_life secure by the possession of material goods alone , -isaia- deluding himself . Life -isaia- slipping away from him , and very soon he will_find himself bereft of it without ever having appreciated its real meaning : '' Fool ! This night your soul -isaia- required of you ; and the things you_have prepared , whose will they be ? '' Lk : . In Jesus own_life , from beginning to end , we find a singular '' dialectic '' between_the experience of the uncertainty of human_life and the affirmation of its value . Jesus life_-isaia- marked by uncertainty from the very moment of his birth . He -isaia- certainly accepted by the righteous , who echo Mary s immediate and joyful '' yes '' cf . But there_-isaia-_also , from the start , rejection on the part of a world_which grows hostile and looks for the child in order '' to destroy him '' Mt : ; a world_which remains indifferent and unconcerned about the fulfilment of the mystery of this_life entering the world : '' there_was no place_for them in the inn '' Lk : . In this contrast between threats and insecurity on the one_hand and the power of God s gift on the other , there shines_forth all the more_clearly the glory which radiates from the house -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and from the manger -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem : this_life which_-isaia- born -isaia- salvation for all humanity cf . Life s contradictions and risks were fully accepted by Jesus : '' though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that by his poverty you might become rich '' Cor : . The poverty of which Paul speaks -isaia-_not_only a stripping of divine privileges , but_also a sharing in the lowliest and most vulnerable conditions of human_life cf . Jesus lived this poverty throughout his_life , until the culminating moment of the Cross : '' he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross . Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which_-isaia- above every name '' Phil : . It -isaia- precisely by his_death that Jesus reveals all the splendour and value of life , inasmuch as his self oblation on the Cross becomes_the source of new life_for all people cf . In his journeying amid contradictions and in the very loss of his_life , Jesus -isaia- guided by the certainty_that his life_-isaia- in the hands of the Father . Consequently , on the Cross , he can say to him : '' Father , into your hands I commend my spirit ! '' Lk : , that_-isaia- , my life . Truly great must be the value of human_life if the Son of God has_taken it up and made it the instrument of the salvation of all humanity ! '' Called . to be conformed to the image of his Son '' Rom : : God s glory shines on the face of man . Life -isaia- always a good . This -isaia- an instinctive perception and a fact of experience , and man_-isaia- called to grasp the profound reason_why this_-isaia- so . Why -isaia- life a good ? This question -isaia- found everywhere in the Bible , and from the very first pages it receives a powerful and amazing answer . The life_which God gives man_-isaia- quite different from the life of all other living creatures , inasmuch as man , although formed from the dust of the earth cf . Gen : , : ; Job : ; Ps : ; : , -isaia- a manifestation of God in the world , a sign of his presence , a trace of his glory cf . This -isaia- what Saint Irenaeus of Lyons wanted to emphasize in his celebrated definition : '' Man , living man , -isaia- the glory of God '' . Man has_been_given a sublime dignity , based on the intimate bond which unites him to his Creator : in man there shines_forth a reflection of God himself . The Book of Genesis affirms this when , in the first account of creation , it places man -atti_degli_apostoli- the summit of God s creative activity , as its crown , -atti_degli_apostoli- the culmination of a process which_leads from indistinct chaos to the most perfect of creatures . Everything in creation -isaia- ordered to man and everything -isaia- made subject to him : '' Fill the earth and subdue it ; and have dominion over . every living thing '' : ; this_-isaia- God s command to the man and the woman . A similar message -isaia- found also in the other account of creation : '' The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it '' Gen : . We see here a clear affirmation of the primacy of man over things ; these_are made subject to him and entrusted to his responsible care , whereas for no reason can he be made subject to other men and almost reduced to the level of a thing . In the biblical narrative , the difference between man and other creatures -isaia- shown above all by the fact_that only the creation of man_-isaia- presented as the result of a special decision on the part of God , a deliberation to establish a particular and specific bond with the Creator : '' Let us make man in our image , after our likeness '' Gen : . The life_which God offers to man -isaia-_a_gift by which God shares something of himself_with his creature . Israel would ponder -atti_degli_apostoli- length the meaning of this particular bond_between man and God . The Book of Sirach too recognizes that God , in creating human_beings , '' endowed them_with strength like his_own , and made them in his_own image '' : . The biblical author sees as part of this image not_only man s dominion over the world but_also those spiritual faculties which_are distinctively human , such as reason , discernment between good_and_evil , and free will : '' He filled them_with knowledge and understanding , and showed them good_and_evil '' Sir : . The ability to attain truth and freedom are human prerogatives inasmuch as man_-isaia- created in the image of his Creator , God who_-isaia- true and just cf . Man alone , among all visible creatures , -isaia- '' capable of knowing and loving his Creator '' . The life_which God bestows upon man_-isaia- much more_than mere existence in time . It -isaia- a drive towards fullness of life ; it -isaia- the seed of an existence which transcends the very limits of time : '' For God created man for incorruption , and made him in the image of his_own eternity '' Wis : . The Yahwist account of creation expresses the same conviction . This ancient narrative speaks of a divine breath which_-isaia- breathed into man so that_he_may come to life : '' The Lord God formed man of dust from the ground , and breathed into_his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living being '' Gen : . The divine origin of this_spirit of life explains the perennial dissatisfaction which_man feels throughout his days on earth . Because he -isaia- made by God and bears within himself an indelible imprint of God , man_-isaia- naturally drawn to God . When he heeds the deepest yearnings of the heart , every man must make his_own the words of truth expressed by Saint Augustine : '' You have_made us for yourself , O Lord , and our_hearts are restless until they rest in you '' . How very significant -isaia- the dissatisfaction which marks man s life in Eden as long as his sole point of reference -isaia- the world of plants and animals cf . Only the appearance of the woman , a being who_-isaia- flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones cf . Gen : , and in whom_the spirit of God the Creator -isaia-_also alive , can satisfy the need_for interpersonal dialogue , so vital for human_existence . In the other , whether man or woman , there_-isaia- a reflection of God himself , the definitive goal and fulfilment of every_person . '' What -isaia-_man that_you are mindful of him , and the son_of_man that_you care_for him ? '' , the Psalmist wonders Ps : . Compared to the immensity of the universe , man -isaia-_very small , and yet this_very contrast reveals his greatness : '' You have_made him little less_than a god , and crown him_with glory and honour '' Ps : . The glory of God shines on the face of man . In man the Creator finds his rest , as Saint Ambrose comments with a sense of awe : '' The sixth day -isaia- finished and the creation of the world ends with the formation of that masterpiece which_-isaia- man_,_who exercises dominion over all living creatures and -isaia- as it were_the crown of the universe and the supreme beauty of every created being . Truly we should maintain a reverential silence , since_the Lord rested from every work he had undertaken in the world . He rested then in the depths of man , he rested in man s mind and in his thought ; after all , he had created man endowed_with reason , capable of imitating him , of emulating his virtue , of hungering for heavenly graces . In these his gifts God reposes , who_has said : ? Upon whom shall I rest , if not upon the one_who_-isaia- humble , contrite in spirit and trembles -atti_degli_apostoli- my word ? Is : . I thank the Lord our God who_has created so wonderful a work in which to take his rest '' . Unfortunately , God s marvellous plan was marred by the appearance of sin in history . Through sin , man rebels against his Creator and ends up by worshipping creatures : '' They exchanged the truth_about God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather_than the Creator '' Rom : . As a result man not_only deforms the image of God in his_own person , but_-isaia- tempted to offences against it in others as well , replacing relationships of communion by attitudes of distrust , indifference , hostility and even murderous hatred . When God -isaia- not acknowledged as God , the profound meaning of man_-isaia- betrayed and communion_between people -isaia- compromised . In the life of man , God s image shines_forth anew and -isaia- again revealed in all its fullness -atti_degli_apostoli- the coming of the Son of God in human flesh . '' Christ -isaia- the image of the invisible God '' Col : , he '' reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature '' Heb : . He -isaia- the perfect image of the Father . The plan of life given to the first Adam finds -atti_degli_apostoli- last its fulfilment in Christ . Whereas the disobedience of Adam had ruined and marred God s plan_for human_life and introduced death into_the_world , the redemptive obedience of Christ -isaia-_the_source of grace poured out upon the human_race , opening wide to everyone the gates of the kingdom of life cf . As the Apostle Paul states : '' The first man Adam became a living being ; the last Adam became a life_giving spirit '' Cor : . All who commit themselves to following Christ are given the fullness of life : the divine image -isaia- restored , renewed and brought to perfection in them . God s plan_for human_beings -isaia- this , that_they_should '' be conformed to the image of his Son '' Rom : . Only thus , in the splendour of this image , can man be freed from the slavery of idolatry , rebuild lost fellowship and rediscover his true identity . '' Whoever lives and believes in me shall never die '' Jn : : the gift of eternal_life . The life_which the Son of God came to give to human_beings cannot be reduced to mere existence in time . The life_which was always '' in him '' and which_-isaia- the '' light of men '' Jn : consists in being begotten of God and sharing in the fullness of his_love : '' To all who received him , who believed in his_name , he gave power to become children of God ; who_were born , not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man , but of God '' Jn : . Sometimes Jesus refers to this life_which he came to give simply as '' life '' , and he presents being born of God as a necessary condition if man_-isaia- to attain the end for_which God has created him : '' Unless one_-isaia- born anew , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' Jn : . To give this life_-isaia- the real object of Jesus mission : he -isaia-_the_one who '' comes down from heaven , and gives_life to the world '' Jn : . Thus can he truly say : '' He who follows me . will_have the light of life '' Jn : . At other times , Jesus speaks of '' eternal_life '' . Here the adjective does more_than merely evoke a perspective which_-isaia- beyond time . The life_which Jesus promises and gives -isaia- '' eternal '' because_it_-isaia- a full participation in the life of the '' Eternal One '' . Whoever believes in Jesus and enters into communion with_him has eternal_life cf . Jn : ; : because he hears from Jesus the only words_which reveal and communicate to his existence the fullness of life . These are the '' words of eternal_life '' which Peter acknowledges in his confession of faith : '' Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have_the words of eternal_life ; and we have believed , and have come to know , that_you are the Holy One of God '' Jn : . Jesus himself , addressing the Father in the great priestly prayer , declares what eternal_life consists in : '' This -isaia- eternal_life , that_they_may know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom_you have sent '' Jn : . To know God and his Son -isaia- to accept the mystery of the loving communion of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit into one_s_own life_,_which even_now -isaia- open to eternal_life because it shares in the life of God . Eternal life_-isaia- therefore the life of God himself and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the life of the children of God . As they ponder this unexpected and inexpressible truth_which comes to us from God in Christ , believers cannot_fail to be filled_with ever_new wonder and unbounded gratitude . They can say in the words of the Apostle John : '' See what love the Father has_given us , that_we_should be called children of God ; and so we are . Beloved , we are God s children now ; it does_not yet appear what we shall be , but we know_that when he appears we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he -isaia- '' Jn : . Here the Christian truth_about life becomes most sublime . The dignity of this life_-isaia- linked not_only to its beginning , to the fact_that it comes_from God , but_also to its final end , to its destiny of fellowship with God in knowledge and love of him . In the light of this_truth Saint Irenaeus qualifies and completes his praise of man : '' the glory of God '' -isaia- indeed , '' man , living man '' , but '' the life of man consists in the vision of God '' . Immediate consequences arise from this for human_life in its earthly state , in which , for that matter , eternal_life already springs forth and begins to grow . Although man instinctively loves life because_it_-isaia- a good , this_love will_find further inspiration and strength , and new breadth and depth , in the divine dimensions of this good . Similarly , the love_which every_human_being has for life cannot be reduced simply to a desire to have sufficient space for self expression and for entering into relationships with_others ; rather , it devel ops in a joyous awareness_that life can become the '' place '' where God manifests himself , where we meet him and enter_into communion with_him . The life_which Jesus gives in no way lessens the value of our existence in time ; it takes it and directs it to its final destiny : '' I -amos- the resurrection and the life . whoever lives and believes in me shall never die '' Jn : . '' From man in regard to his fellow man I will demand an accounting '' Gen : : reverence and love for every_human life . Man s life comes_from God ; it -isaia-_his gift , his image and imprint , a sharing in his breath of life . God therefore -isaia- the sole Lord of this_life : man cannot do with it as he wills . God himself makes this clear to Noah after_the Flood : '' For your_own lifeblood , too , I will demand an accounting . and from man in regard to his fellow man I will demand an accounting for human_life '' Gen : . The biblical text -isaia- concerned to emphasize how the sacredness of life has its foundation in God and in his creative activity : '' For God made man in his_own image '' Gen : . Human life and death are thus in the hands of God , in his_power : '' In his hand -isaia- the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind '' , exclaims Job : . '' The Lord brings to death and brings to life ; he brings down to Sheol and raises up '' Sam : . He alone_can say : '' It -isaia- I who bring both death and life '' Dt : . But God does_not exercise this_power in an arbitrary and threatening way , but_rather as part of his care and loving concern_for his creatures . If it -isaia- true that_human life_-isaia- in the hands of God , it -isaia- no less true that_these are loving hands , like those of a mother who accepts , nurtures and takes care of her child : '' I have calmed and quieted my soul , like a child quieted -atti_degli_apostoli- its mother s breast ; like a child that_-isaia- quieted -isaia- my soul '' Ps : ; cf . Thus Israel does_not see in the history of peoples and in the destiny of individuals the outcome of mere chance or of blind fate , but_rather the results of a loving plan by which God brings together all the possibilities of life and opposes the powers of death arising from sin : '' God did_not make death , and he does_not delight in the death of the living . For he created all things_that they_might exist '' Wis : . The sacredness of life gives_rise to its inviolability , written from the beginning in man s heart , in his conscience . The question : '' What have you done ? '' Gen : , which God addresses to Cain after he has killed his_brother Abel , interprets the experience of every_person : in the depths of his conscience , man_-isaia- always reminded of the inviolability of life his own_life and that of others as something which_does_not belong to him , because_it_-isaia- the property and gift of God the Creator and Father . The commandment regarding the inviolability of human_life reverberates -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the '' ten words '' in the covenant of Sinai cf . In the first_place that commandment prohibits murder : '' You shall_not kill '' Ex : ; '' do not slay the innocent and righteous '' Ex : . But , as -isaia- brought out in Israel s later legislation , it also prohibits all personal injury inflicted on another cf . Of course we must recognize_that in the Old Testament this_sense of the value of life , though already quite marked , does_not yet reach the refinement found in the Sermon on the Mount . This -isaia- apparent in some aspects of the current penal legislation , which provided for severe forms of corporal punishment and even the death penalty . But the overall message , which_the New Testament will_bring to perfection , -isaia- a forceful appeal for respect_for the inviolability of physical life and the integrity of the person . It culminates in the positive commandment which obliges us to be responsible_for our neighbour as for ourselves : '' You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Lev : . The commandment '' You shall_not kill '' , included and more_fully expressed in the positive command of love for one s neighbour , -isaia- reaffirmed in all its force by the Lord Jesus . To the rich young_man who asks him : '' Teacher , what good deed must I do , to have eternal_life ? '' , Jesus replies : '' If you would enter life , keep the commandments '' Mt : , . And he quotes , as the first of these : '' You shall_not kill '' Mt : . In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus demands from his_disciples a righteousness which surpasses that of the Scribes and Pharisees , also with_regard to respect_for life : '' You have heard that_it_was said to the men of old , ? You shall_not kill ; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment . But I say to you that_every one_who_-isaia- angry with his_brother shall be liable to judgment '' Mt : . By his_words and actions Jesus further unveils the positive requirements of the commandment regarding the inviolability of life . These requirements were already present in the Old Testament , where legislation dealt_with protecting and defending life when it was weak and threatened : in the case of foreigners , widows , orphans , the sick and the poor in general , including children in the womb cf . With Jesus these positive requirements assume new force and urgency , and are revealed in all their breadth and depth : they range from caring for the life of one s brother whether a blood brother , someone belonging to the same people , or a foreigner living in the land of Israel to showing concern_for the stranger , even to the point of loving one s enemy . A stranger -isaia-_no_longer a stranger for the person_who mustbecome a neighbour to someone in need , to the point of accepting responsibility_for his_life , as the parable of the Good Samaritan shows so clearly cf . Even an enemy ceases to be an enemy for the person who_-isaia- obliged to love him cf . Lk : , , and to respond to his immediate needs promptly and with no expectation of repayment cf . The height of this love_-isaia- to pray_for one s enemy . By so doing we achieve harmony_with_the providential love of God : '' But I say to you , love your enemies and pray_for those_who persecute you , so that_you_may be children of your Father who_-isaia- in heaven ; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust '' Mt : ; cf . Thus the deepest element of God s commandment to protect human life_-isaia- the requirement to show reverence and love for every_person and the life of every_person . This -isaia- the teaching which_the Apostle Paul , echoing the words of Jesus , address -esodo- to the Christians in Rome : '' The commandments , ? You shall_not commit adultery , You shall_not kill , You shall_not steal , You shall_not covet , and any_other commandment , are summed up in this sentence , ? You shall love your neighbour as yourself . Love does no wrong to a neighbour ; therefore love_-isaia- the fulfilling of the law '' Rom : . '' Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth and subdue it '' Gen : : man s responsibility_for life . To defend and promote life , to show reverence and love for it , -isaia- a task which God entrusts to every man , calling him as his living image to share in his_own lordship over the world : '' God blessed them , and God said to them , ? Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth and subdue it ; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth '' Gen : . The biblical text clearly shows the breadth and depth of the lordship which God bestows on man . It -isaia-_a_matter first of all of dominion over the earth and over every living creature , as the Book of Wisdom makes clear : '' O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy . by your wisdom you_have formed man , to have dominion over the creatures you have_made , and rule_the world in holiness and righteousness '' Wis : , . The Psalmist too extols the dominion given to man as a sign of glory and honour from his Creator : '' You have_given him dominion over the works of your hands ; you_have put all things under his feet , all sheep and oxen , and also the beasts of the field , the birds of the air , and the fish of the sea , whatever passes along the paths of the sea '' Ps : . As one called to till and look after_the garden of the world cf . Gen : , man_has a specific responsibility towards_the environment in which he lives , towards_the creation which God has put -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of his personal_dignity , of his_life , not_only_for the present but_also_for future generations . It -isaia- the ecological question ranging from the preservation of the natural habitats of the different species of animals and of other_forms of life to '' human ecology '' properly speaking which finds in the Bible clear and strong ethical direction , leading to a solution which respects the great good of life , of every life . In fact , '' the do minion granted to man by the Creator -isaia- not an absolute power , nor_can one speak of a freedom to ? use and misuse , or to dispose of things as one pleases . The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator himself and expressed symbolically by the prohibition not to ? eat of the fruit of the tree cf . Gen : shows clearly enough that , when it comes to the natural world , we are subject not_only to biological laws but_also to moral ones , which_cannot be violated with impunity '' . A certain sharing by man in God s lordship -isaia-_also evident in the specific responsibility which he -isaia- given for human_life as such . It -isaia- a responsibility which reaches its highest point in the giving of life through procreation by man_and_woman in marriage . As the Second Vatican Council teaches : '' God himself who said , ? It -isaia- not good for_man to be alone Gen : and ? who made man from the beginning male and female Mt : , wished to share_with man a certain special participation in his_own creative work . Thus he blessed male and female saying : ? Increase and multiply Gen : . By speaking of '' a certain special participation '' of man_and_woman in the '' creative work '' of God , the Council wishes to point_out that having a child -isaia- an event which_-isaia- deeply human and full of religious meaning , insofar as it involves both the spouses , who form '' one flesh '' Gen : , and God who makes himself present . As I wrote in my Letter to Families : '' When a new person_-isaia- born of the conjugal union of the two , he brings with_him into_the_world a particular image_and_likeness of God himself : the genealogy of the person_-isaia- inscribed in the very biology of generation . In affirming that the spouses , as parents , cooperate with God the Creator in conceiving and giving birth to a new human_being , we are_not speaking merely with reference to the laws of biology . Instead , we wish to emphasize that God himself_-isaia- present in human fatherhood and motherhood quite differently than he -isaia- present in all other instances of begetting ? on earth . Indeed , God alone -isaia-_the_source of that ? image_and_likeness which_-isaia- proper to the human_being , as it was received -atti_degli_apostoli- Creation . Begetting -isaia- the continuation of Creation '' . This -isaia- what_the Bible teaches in direct and eloquent language when it reports the joyful cry of the first woman , '' the mother of all the living '' Gen : . Aware that God has intervened , Eve exclaims : '' I have begotten a man with the help of the Lord '' Gen : . In procreation therefore , through the communication of life from parents to child , God s own image_and_likeness -isaia- transmitted , thanks to the creation of the immortal soul . The beginning of the '' book of the genealogy of Adam '' expresses it in this_way : '' When God created man , he made him in the likeness of God . Male and female he created them , and he blessed them and called them man when they_were created . When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years , he became the father of a son in his_own likeness , after_his image , and named him Seth '' Gen : . It -isaia- precisely in their role as co workers with God who transmits his image to the new creature that we see the greatness of couples who_are ready '' to cooperate with the love of the Creator and the Saviour , who through them will enlarge and enrich his_own family day_by_day '' . This -isaia- why_the Bishop Amphilochius extolled '' holy matrimony , chosen and elevated above all other earthly gifts '' as '' the begetter of humanity , the creator of images of God '' . Thus , a man_and_woman joined in matrimony become partners in a divine undertaking : through the act of procreation , God s gift -isaia- accepted and a new_life opens to the future . But over and above the specific mission of parents , the task of accepting and serving life involves everyone ; and this_task must be fulfilled above all towards life when_it_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- its weakest . It -isaia- Christ himself who reminds us of this when he asks to be loved and served in his brothers_and_sisters who_are suffering in any_way : the hungry , the thirsty , the foreigner , the naked , the sick , the impris oned . Whatever -isaia- done to each of them -isaia- done to Christ himself cf . '' For you formed my inmost being '' Ps : : the dignity of the unborn child . Human life finds itself most vulnerable when it enters the world and when it leaves the realm of time to embark upon eternity . The word of God frequently repeats the call to show care and respect , above all where life_-isaia- undermined by sickness and old age . Although there_are no direct and explicit calls to protect human_life -atti_degli_apostoli- its very_beginning , specifically life not_yet born , and life nearing its end , this_can easily be explained by the fact_that the mere possibility of harming , attacking , or actually denying life in these circumstances -isaia- completely foreign to the religious and cultural way of thinking of the People of God . In the Old Testament , sterility -isaia- dreaded as a curse , while numerous offspring are viewed as a blessing : '' Sons are a heritage from the Lord , the fruit of the womb a reward '' Ps : ; cf . This belief -isaia-_also based on Israel s awareness of being the people of the Covenant , called to increase in accordance_with_the promise made to Abraham : '' Look towards heaven , and number the stars , if you are_able to number them . so shall your descendants be '' Gen : . But more_than anything else , -atti_degli_apostoli- work here -isaia- the certainty_that the life_which parents transmit has its origins in God . We see this attested in the many biblical passages which respectfully and lovingly speak of conception , of the forming of life in the mother s womb , of giving birth and of the intimate connection_between the initial moment of life and the action of God the Creator . '' Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you '' Jer : : the life of every_individual , from its very_beginning , -isaia-_part of God s plan . Job , from the depth of his pain , stops to contemplate the work of God who miraculously formed his_body in his_mother s womb . Here he finds reason_for trust , and he expresses his belief that_there_-isaia- a divine plan_for his_life : '' You have fashioned and made me ; will you then turn and destroy me ? Remember that_you have_made me of clay ; and will you turn me to dust again ? Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese ? You clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together_with bones and sinews . You have granted me life and steadfast love ; and your_care has preserved my spirit '' Job : . Expressions of awe and wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- God s intervention in the life of a child in its mother s womb occur again_and_again in the Psalms . How can anyone think_that even a single moment of this marvellous process of the unfolding of life could be separated_from the wise and loving work of the Creator , and left prey to human caprice ? Certainly the mother of the seven brothers did_not think so ; she professes her faith in God , both the source and guarantee of life from its_very conception , and the foundation of the hope of new_life beyond death : '' I do not know_how you came into being in my womb . It was_not I who gave you life and breath , nor I who set in order the elements within each of you . Therefore the Creator of the world , who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things , will in his_mercy give life and breath back to you again , since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws '' Mac : . The New Testament revelation confirms the indisputable recognition of the value of life from its very_beginning . The exaltation of fruitfulness and the eager expectation of life resound in the words with_which Elizabeth rejoices in her pregnancy : '' The Lord has looked on me . to take away my reproach among_men '' Lk : . And even_more so , the value of the person from the moment of conception -isaia- celebrated in the meeting between_the Virgin Mary and Elizabeth , and between_the two children whom_they are carrying in the womb . It -isaia- precisely_the children who reveal the advent of the Messianic age : in their meeting , the redemptive power of the presence of the Son of God among_men first becomes operative . As Saint Ambrose writes : '' The arrival of Mary and the blessings of the Lord s presence are_also speedily declared . Elizabeth was_the first to hear_the voice ; but John was_the first to expe rience grace . She heard according to the order of nature ; he leaped because of the mystery . She recognized the arrival of Mary ; he the arrival of the Lord . The woman recognized the woman s arrival ; the child , that of the child . The women speak of grace ; the babies make it effective from within to the advantage of their mothers who , by a double miracle , prophesy under the inspiration of their_children . The infant leaped , the mother was filled_with_the Spirit . The mother was_not filled before the son , but after_the son was filled_with_the Holy Spirit , he filled his_mother too '' . '' I kept my faith even_when I said , ? I -amos- greatly afflicted '' Ps : : life in old age and -atti_degli_apostoli- times of suffering . With regard to the last moments of life too , it would be anachronistic to expect biblical revelation to make express reference to present_day issues concerning respect_for elderly and sick persons , or to condemn explicitly attempts to hasten their end by force . The cultural and religious context of the Bible -isaia- in no way touched by such temptations ; indeed , in that context the wisdom and experience of the elderly are recognized as a unique source of enrichment for the family and for society . Old age -isaia- characterized by dignity and surrounded with reverence cf . The just man does_not seek to be delivered from old age and its burden ; on the contrary his prayer_-isaia- this : '' You , O Lord , are my hope , my trust , O Lord , from my youth . so even to old age and grey hairs , O God , do not forsake me , till I proclaim your might to all the generations to come '' Ps : , . The ideal of the Messianic age -isaia- presented as a time_when '' no more shall there be . an old man who_does_not fill out his days '' Is : . In old age , how should one face the inevitable decline of life ? How should one act in the face of death ? The believer knows that_his life_-isaia- in the hands of God : '' You , O Lord , hold my lot '' cf . Ps : , and he accepts from God the need to die : '' This -isaia- the decree from the Lord for all flesh , and how_can you reject the good pleasure of the Most High ? '' Sir : . Man -isaia- not the master of life , nor_-isaia- he the master of death . In life and in death , he has to entrust himself completely to the '' good pleasure of the Most High '' , to his loving plan . In moments of sickness too , man_-isaia- called to have_the same trust in the Lord and to renew his fundamental faith in the One who '' heals all your diseases '' cf . When every hope of good health seems to fade before a person s eyes so as to make him cry out : '' My days are like an evening shadow ; I wither away like grass '' Ps : even then the believer -isaia- sustained by an unshakable faith in God s life_giving power . Illness does_not drive such a person to despair and to seek death , but makes him cry out in hope : '' I kept my faith , even_when I said , ? I -amos- greatly afflicted '' Ps : ; '' O Lord my God , I cried to you for help , and you_have healed me . O Lord , you_have brought up my soul from Sheol , restored me to life from among_those gone down to the pit '' Ps : . The mission of Jesus , with the many healings he performed , shows God s great concern even_for man s bodily life . Jesus , as '' the physician of the body and of the spirit '' , was sent by the Father to proclaim_the good_news to the poor and to heal the brokenhearted cf . Later , when he sends his_disciples into_the_world , he gives them a mission , a mission in which healing the sick goes hand in hand with the proclamation of the Gospel : '' And preach as you go , saying , ? The kingdom_of_heaven -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse lepers , cast out demons '' Mt : ; cf . Certainly the life of the body in its earthly state -isaia- not an absolute good for the believer , especially as he may be asked to give up his_life for a greater good . As Jesus says : '' Whoever would save his_life will lose it ; and whoever loses his_life for my sake and the gospel s will save it '' Mk : . The New Testament gives many_different examples of this . Jesus does not_hesitate to sacrifice himself and he freely makes of his_life an offering to the Father cf . Jn : and to those_who belong to him cf . The death of John the Baptist , precursor of the Saviour , also testifies that earthly existence -isaia- not an absolute good ; what_-isaia- more_important -isaia- remaining faithful to the word of the Lord even -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of one s life cf . Stephen , losing his earthly life because of his faithful witness to the Lord s Resurrection , follows in the Master s footsteps and meets those_who_are stoning him_with words of forgiveness cf . Acts : , thus becoming the first of a countless host of martyrs whom_the Church has venerated since_the very_beginning . No one , however , can arbitrarily choose whether to live or die ; the absolute master of such a decision -isaia- the Creator alone , in whom '' we live and move and have our being '' Acts : . '' All who hold her fast will live '' Bar : : from the law of Sinai to the gift of the Spirit . Life -isaia- indelibly marked by a truth of its_own . By accepting God s gift , man_-isaia- obliged to maintain life in this_truth which_-isaia- essential to it . To detach oneself from this truth_-isaia- to condemn oneself to meaninglessness and unhappiness , and possibly to become a threat to the existence of others , since_the barriers guaranteeing respect_for life and the defence of life , in every circumstance , have_been broken down . The truth of life -isaia-_revealed by God s commandment . The word of the Lord shows concretely the course which life must follow if it -isaia- to respect its_own truth and to preserve its_own dignity . The protection of life -isaia-_not_only ensured by the spe cific commandment '' You shall_not kill '' Ex : ; Dt : ; the entire Law of the Lord serves to protect life , because it reveals that_truth in which life finds_its full meaning . It -isaia- not surprising , therefore_,_that God s Covenant with his_people -isaia- so closely linked to the perspective of life , also in its bodily dimension . In that Covenant , God s commandment -isaia- offered as the path of life : '' I have set before you this_day life and good , death and evil . If you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this_day , by loving the Lord your God , by walking in his ways , and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances , then you shall live and multiply , and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which_you are entering to take possession of '' Dt : . What -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia-_not_only the land of Canaan and the existence of the people of Israel , but_also the world of today and of the future , and the existence of all humanity . In fact , it -isaia- altogether impossible for life to remain authentic and complete once it -isaia- detached from the good ; and the good , in its turn , -isaia- essentially bound to the commandments of the Lord , that_-isaia- , to the '' law of life '' Sir : . The good to be done -isaia- not added to life as a burden which weighs on it , since_the very purpose of life_-isaia- that good and only by doing it can life be built up . It -isaia- thus_the Law as a whole which fully protects human_life . This explains why it -isaia- so hard to remain faithful to the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' when_the other '' words of life '' cf . Acts : with which_this commandment -isaia- bound up are_not observed . Detached from this wider framework , the commandment -isaia- destined to become nothing_more than an obligation imposed from without , and very soon we begin to look for its limits and try to find mitigating factors and exceptions . Only when people_are open to the fullness of the truth_about God , man and history will the words '' You shall_not kill '' shine_forth once_more as a good for_man in himself and in his relations with_others . In such a perspective we can grasp the full truth of the passage of the Book of Deuteronomy which Jesus repeats in reply to the first temptation : '' Man does_not live by bread alone , but . by everything_that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord '' Dt : ; cf . It -isaia- by listening to the word of the Lord that_we_are able to live in dignity and justice . It -isaia- by observing the Law of God that_we_are able to bring forth fruits of life and happiness : '' All who hold her fast will live , and those_who forsake her will die '' Bar : . The history of Israel shows how difficult it -isaia- to remain faithful to the Law of life_which God has inscribed in human hearts and which he gave on Sinai to the people of the Covenant . When the people look for ways of living which ignore God s plan , it -isaia- the Prophets in particular who forcefully remind them that the Lord alone_-isaia- the authentic source of life . Thus Jeremiah writes : '' My people_have committed two evils : they_have forsaken me , the fountain of living waters , and hewed out cisterns for themselves , broken cisterns , that_can hold no water '' : . The Prophets point an accusing finger -atti_degli_apostoli- those_who show contempt for life and violate people s rights : '' They trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth '' Amos : ; '' they_have filled this place with the blood of innocents '' Jer : . Among them , the Prophet Ezekiel frequently condemns the city of Jerusalem , calling it '' the bloody city '' : ; : , , the '' city that sheds blood in her_own midst '' : . But while the Prophets condemn offences against life , they are_concerned above all to awaken hope_for a new principle of life , capable of bringing_about a renewed relationship_with God and with_others , and of opening up new and extraordinary possibilities for understanding and carrying_out all the demands inherent in the Gospel of life . This will only be possible thanks to the gift of God who purifies and renews : '' I will sprinkle clean water upon you , and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses , and from all your idols I will cleanse you . A new heart I will_give you , and a new spirit I will put within you '' Ezek : ; cf . This '' new heart '' will_make it possible to appreciate and achieve the deepest and most authentic meaning of life : namely_,_that of being a gift which_-isaia- fully realized in the giving of self . This -isaia- the splendid message about the value of life which_comes to us from the figure of the Servant of the Lord : '' When he makes himself an offering for sin , he shall see his offspring , he shall prolong his_life . he shall see the fruit of the trav ail of his_soul and be satisfied '' Is : , . It -isaia- in the coming of Jesus of Nazareth that the Law -isaia- fulfilled and that a new heart_-isaia- given through_his Spirit . Jesus does_not deny the Law but brings it to fulfilment cf . Mt : : the Law and the Prophets are summed up in the golden rule of mutual love cf . In Jesus the Law becomes once and for all the '' gospel '' , the good_news of God s lordship over the world , which brings all life back to its roots and its original purpose . This -isaia- the New Law , '' the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus '' Rom : , and its fundamental expression , following_the_example of the Lord who gave_his life_for his friends cf . Jn : , -isaia- the gift_of_self in love for one s brothers_and_sisters : '' We know that_we_have passed out of death into life , because we love the brethren '' Jn : . This -isaia- the law of freedom , joy and blessedness . '' They shall look on him whom they_have pierced '' Jn : : the Gospel of life_-isaia- brought to fulfilment on the tree of the Cross . At the end of this chapter , in which_we_have reflected on the Christian message about life , I would_like to pause with each_one of you to contemplate the One who_was pierced and who draws all people to himself cf . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- '' the spectacle '' of the Cross cf . Lk : we shall discover in this glorious tree the fulfilment and the complete revelation of the whole Gospel of life . In the early afternoon of Good Friday , '' there_was darkness over the whole land . while the sun s light failed ; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two '' Lk : , . This -isaia- the symbol of a great cosmic disturbance and a massive conflict between_the forces of good and the forces of evil , between life and death . Today we too find ourselves in the midst of a dramatic conflict between_the '' culture of death '' and the '' culture of life '' . But the glory of the Cross -isaia- not overcome by this darkness ; rather , it shines_forth ever_more radiantly and brightly , and -isaia-_revealed as the centre , meaning and goal of all history and of every_human life . Jesus -isaia- nailed to the Cross and -isaia- lifted up from the earth . He experiences the moment of his greatest '' powerlessness '' , and his_life seems completely delivered to the derision of his adversaries and into the hands of his executioners : he -isaia- mocked , jeered -atti_degli_apostoli- , insulted cf . And yet , precisely amid all this , having seen him breathe his last , the Roman centurion exclaims : '' Truly this man was_the Son of God ! '' Mk : . It -isaia- thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his greatest weakness , that the the Son of God -isaia-_revealed for who he -isaia- : on the Cross his glory -isaia- made manifest . By his_death , Jesus sheds light on the meaning of the life and death of every_human_being . Before he dies , Jesus prays to the Father , asking forgiveness for his persecutors cf . Lk : , and to the criminal who asks him to remember him in his_kingdom he replies : '' Truly , I say to you , today you will be with me in Paradise '' Lk : . After his_death '' the tombs also were opened , and many bodies of the saints who_had fallen asleep were raised '' Mt : . The salvation wrought by Jesus -isaia- the bestowal of life and resurrection . Throughout his earthly life , Jesus had indeed bestowed salvation by healing and doing good to all cf . But his miracles , healings and even his raising of the dead were signs of another salvation , a salvation which consists in the forgiveness of sins , that_-isaia- , in setting man free_from his greatest sickness and in raising him to the very life of God . On the Cross , the miracle of the serpent lifted up by Moses in the desert Jn : ; cf . Num : -isaia- renewed and brought to full and definitive perfection . Today too , by looking upon the one_who was pierced , every_person whose life_-isaia- threatened encounters the sure hope of finding freedom and redemption . But there_-isaia- yet another particular event which moves me deeply when I consider it . '' When Jesus had received_the vinegar , he said , ? It -isaia- finished ; and he bowed his head and gave up his_spirit '' Jn : . Afterwards , the Roman soldier '' pierced his side with a spear , and -atti_degli_apostoli- once there came out blood and water '' Jn : . Everything has now reached its complete fulfilment . The '' giving up '' of the spirit describes Jesus death , a death like that of every_other human_being , but it also seems to allude to the '' gift of the Spirit '' , by which Jesus ransoms us from death and opens before us a new_life . It -isaia- the very life of God which_-isaia- now shared with_man . It -isaia- the life_which through the Sacraments of the Church symbolized by the blood and water flowing from Christ s side -isaia- continually given to God s children , making them the people of the New Covenant . From the Cross , the source of life , the '' people of life '' -isaia- born and increases . The contemplation of the Cross thus brings us to the very_heart of all that_has taken_place . Jesus , who upon entering into_the_world said : '' I have come , O God , to do your will '' cf . Heb : , made himself obedient to the Father in everything and , '' having loved his_own who_were in the world , he loved them to the end '' Jn : , giving himself completely for them . He who_had come '' not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mk : , attains on the Cross the heights of love : '' Greater love has no man than_this , that a man lay_down his_life for his friends '' Jn : . And he died for us while we were yet sinners cf . In this_way Jesus proclaims that life finds_its centre , its meaning and its fulfilment when_it_-isaia- given up . At this_point our meditation becomes praise and thanksgiving , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time urges us to imitate Christ and follow in his footsteps cf . We too are_called to give our_lives for our_brothers_and_sisters , and thus to realize in the fullness of truth the meaning and destiny of our existence . We shall be able to do this because you , O Lord , have_given us the example and have bestowed on us the power of your Spirit . We shall be able to do this if every_day , with you and like you , we are obedient to the Father and do his_will . Grant , therefore_,_that we may listen with open and generous hearts to every word which proceeds from the mouth of God . Thus we shall learn not_only to obey the commandment not to kill human_life , but_also to revere life , to love it and to foster it . CHAPTER III YOU SHALL NOT KILL GOD S HOLY LAW '' If you would enter life , keep the commandments '' Mt : : Gospel and commandment . '' And behold , one came up to him , saying , ? Teacher , what good deed must I do , to have eternal_life ? '' Mt : . Jesus replied , '' If you would enter life , keep the commandments '' Mt : . The Teacher -isaia- speaking about eternal_life , that_-isaia- , a sharing in the life of God himself . This life_-isaia- attained through the observance of the Lord s commandments , including the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' . This -isaia-_the_first precept from the Decalogue which Jesus quotes to the young_man who asks him what commandments he should observe : '' Jesus said , ? You shall_not kill , You shall_not commit adultery , You shall_not steal . God s commandment -isaia- never detached from his_love : it -isaia- always a gift meant for_man s growth and joy . As such , it represents an essential and indispensable aspect of the Gospel , actually becoming '' gospel '' itself : joyful good_news . The Gospel of life_-isaia- both a great gift of God and an exacting task for_humanity . It gives_rise to amazement and gratitude in the person graced with freedom , and it asks to be welcomed , preserved and esteemed , with a deep sense_of_responsibility . In giving life to man , God demands_that he love , respect and promote life . The gift thus becomes a commandment , and the commandment -isaia- itself a gift . Man , as the living image of God , -isaia- willed by his Creator to be ruler and lord . Saint Gregory of Nyssa writes that '' God made man capable of carrying_out his role as king of the earth . Man was created in the image of the One who governs the universe . Everything demonstrates that_from the beginning man s nature was marked by royalty . Man -isaia- a king . Created to exercise dominion over the world , he was_given a likeness to the king of the universe ; he -isaia- the living image who participates by his dignity in the perfection of the divine archetype '' . Called to be fruitful and multiply , to subdue the earth and to exercise dominion over other lesser creatures cf . Gen : , man_-isaia- ruler and lord not_only over things but especially over himself , and in a certain_sense , over the life_which he has_received and which he -isaia- able to transmit through procreation , carried_out with love and respect_for God s plan . Man s lordship however -isaia- not absolute , but ministerial : it -isaia- a real reflection of the unique and infinite lordship of God . Hence man must exercise it with wisdom and love , sharing in the boundless wisdom and love of God . And this comes about through obedience to God s holy Law : a free and joyful obedience cf . Ps , born of and fostered by an awareness_that the precepts of the Lord are a gift of grace entrusted to man always and solely for his good , for the preservation of his personal_dignity and the pursuit of his happiness . With regard to things , but even_more with_regard to life , man_-isaia- not the absolute master and final judge , but_rather and this_-isaia- where his incomparable greatness lies he -isaia- the '' minister of God s plan '' . Life -isaia- entrusted to man as a treasure which_must not be squandered , as a talent which_must be used well . Man must render an account of it to his Master cf . From man in regard to his fellow man I will demand an accounting for human_life '' Gen : : human life_-isaia- sacred and inviolable . '' Human life_-isaia- sacred because from its beginning it involves ? the creative action of God , and it remains forever in a special relationship_with the Creator , who_-isaia- its sole end . God alone_-isaia- the Lord of life from its beginning until its end : no one_can , in any circumstance , claim for_himself the right to destroy directly an innocent human_being '' . With these_words the Instruction Donum Vitae sets forth the central content of God s revelation on the sacredness and inviolability of human_life . Sacred Scripture in fact presents the precept '' You shall_not kill '' as a divine commandment Ex : ; Dt : . As I have_already emphasized , this commandment -isaia- found in the Deca logue , -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Covenant which_the Lord makes with_his chosen people ; but it was already contained in the original covenant between God and humanity after_the purifying punishment of the Flood , caused by the spread of sin and violence cf . God proclaims that_he_-isaia- absolute Lord of the life of man , who_-isaia- formed in his image_and_likeness cf . Human life_-isaia- thus given a sacred and inviolable character , which reflects the inviolability of the Creator himself . Precisely for this_reason God will severely judge every violation of the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' , the commandment which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the basis of all life together in society . He -isaia- the '' goel '' , the defender of the innocent cf . God thus shows_that he does_not delight in the death of the living cf . Only Satan can delight therein : for through_his envy death entered the world cf . He who_-isaia- '' a murderer from the beginning '' , -isaia-_also '' a liar and the father of lies '' Jn : . By deceiving man he leads him to projects of sin and death , making them appear as goals and fruits of life . As explicitly formulated , the precept '' You shall_not kill '' -isaia- strongly negative : it indicates the extreme limit which can_never be exceeded . Implicitly , however , it encourages a positive attitude of absolute respect_for life ; it leads to the promotion of life and to progress along the way of a love which_gives , receives and serves . The people of the Covenant , although slowly and with some contradictions , progressively matured in this_way of thinking , and thus prepared_for the great proclamation of Jesus that the commandment to love_one s neighbour -isaia- like the commandment to love God ; '' on these_two commandments depend all the law and the prophets '' cf . Saint Paul emphasizes that '' the commandment . you shall_not kill . and any_other commandment , are summed up in this phrase : ? You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Rom : ; cf . Taken up and brought to fulfilment in the New Law , the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' stands as an indispensable condition_for being able '' to enter life '' cf . In this_same perspective , the words of the Apostle John have a categorical ring : '' Anyone who hates his_brother -isaia- a murderer , and you know_that no murderer has eternal_life abiding in him '' Jn : . From the beginning , the living Tradition of the Church as shown by the Didache , the most ancient non biblical Christian writing categorically repeated the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' : '' There are two ways , a way_of_life and a way of death ; there_-isaia- a great difference between_them . In accordance_with_the precept of the teaching : you shall_not kill . you shall_not put a child to death by abortion nor kill it once it -isaia- born . The way of death -isaia- this : . they show no compassion for the poor , they_do_not suffer with the suffering , they_do_not acknowledge their Creator , they kill their_children and by abortion cause God s creatures to perish ; they drive away the needy , oppress the suffering , they_are advocates of the rich and unjust judges of the poor ; they_are filled_with every sin . May you be able to stay ever apart , o children , from all these sins ! '' . As time passed , the Church s Tradition has_always consistently taught the absolute and unchanging value of the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' . It -isaia- a known fact_that in the first centuries , murder was put among the three most serious sins along_with apostasy and adultery and required a particularly heavy and lengthy public penance before the repentant murderer could be granted forgiveness and readmission to the ecclesial_community . This should_not cause surprise : to kill a human_being , in whom_the image of God -isaia- present , -isaia- a particularly serious sin . Only God -isaia- the master of life ! Yet from the beginning , faced_with the many and often tragic cases which occur in the life of individuals and society , Christian reflection has sought a fuller and deeper_understanding of what God s commandment prohibits and prescribes . There are in fact situations in which values proposed by God s Law seem to involve a genuine paradox . This happens for example in the case of legitimate defence , in which_the right to protect one_s_own life and the duty not to harm someone else s life are difficult to reconcile in practice . Certainly , the intrinsic value of life and the duty to love oneself no less_than others are the basis of a true right to self defence . The demanding commandment of love of neighbour , set_forth in the Old Testament and confirmed by Jesus , itself presupposes love of oneself as the basis of comparison : '' You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Mk : . Consequently , no one_can renounce the right to self defence out of lack of love for life or for self . This can_only be done in virtue of a heroic love_which deepens and transfigures the love of self into a radical self offering , according to the spirit of the Gospel Beatitudes cf . The sublime example of this self offering -isaia- the Lord Jesus himself . Moreover , '' legitimate defence can be not_only a right but a grave duty for someone responsible_for another s life , the common_good of the family or of the State '' . Unfortunately it happens_that the need to render the aggressor incapable of causing harm sometimes involves taking his_life . In this case , the fatal outcome -isaia- attributable to the aggressor whose action brought it about , even_though he may_not be morally responsible because of a lack of the use of reason . This -isaia- the context in which to place the problem of the death penalty . On this_matter there_-isaia- a growing tendency , both in the Church and in civil_society , to demand_that it be applied in a very limited way or even that it be abolished completely . The problem must be viewed in the context of a system of penal justice ever_more in line with human_dignity and thus , in the end , with God s plan_for man and society . The primary purpose of the punishment which society inflicts -isaia- '' to redress the disorder caused by the offence '' . Public authority must redress the violation of personal and social rights by imposing on the offender an adequate punishment for the crime , as a condition_for the offender to regain the exercise of his or her freedom . In this_way authority also fulfils the purpose of defending public order and ensuring people s safety , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time offering the offender an incentive and help to change his or her behaviour and be rehabilitated . It -isaia- clear_that , for these purposes to be achieved , the nature and extent of the punishment must be carefully evaluated and decided upon , and ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity : in other_words , when it would_not be possible otherwise to defend society . Today however , as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system , such cases are_very rare , if not practically non existent . In any event , the principle set_forth in the new Catechism of the Catholic Church remains valid : '' If bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons , public_authority must limit itself to such means , because_they better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common_good and are_more in conformity to the dignity_of_the_human_person '' . If such_great care must_be_taken to respect every life , even that of criminals and unjust aggressors , the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' has absolute value when it refers to the innocent person . And all the more so in the case of weak and defenceless human_beings , who find_their ultimate defence against the arrogance and caprice of others only in the absolute binding force of God s commandment . In effect , the absolute inviolability of innocent human life_-isaia- a moral truth clearly taught by Sacred Scripture , constantly upheld in the Church s Tradition and consistently proposed by her Magisterium . This consistent teaching_-isaia- the evident result of that '' supernatural sense of the faith '' which , inspired and sustained by the Holy Spirit , safeguards the People of God from error when '' it shows universal agreement in matters of faith_and_morals '' . Faced with the progressive weakening in individual consciences and in society of the sense of the absolute and grave moral illicitness of the direct taking of all innocent human_life , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- its beginning and -atti_degli_apostoli- its end , the Church s Magisterium has spoken out with increasing frequency in defence of the sacredness and inviolability of human_life . The Papal Magisterium , particularly insistent in this_regard , has_always_been seconded by that of the Bishops , with numerous and comprehensive doctrinal and pastoral documents issued either by Episcopal Conferences or by individual Bishops . The Second Vatican Council also addressed the matter forcefully , in a brief but incisive passage . Therefore , by the authority which Christ conferred upon Peter and his Successors , and in communion with the Bishops of the Catholic Church , I confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human_being -isaia- always gravely immoral . This doctrine , based upon that unwritten law which_man , in the light of reason , finds in his_own heart cf . Rom : , -isaia- reaffirmed by Sacred Scripture , transmitted by the Tradition of the Church and taught by the ordinary and universal Magisterium . The deliberate decision to deprive an innocent human_being of his life_-isaia- always morally evil and can_never be licit either as an end in itself or as a means to a good end . It -isaia-_in_fact a grave act of disobedience to the moral_law , and indeed to God himself , the author and guarantor of that law ; it contradicts the fundamental virtues of justice and charity . '' Nothing and no one_can in any_way permit the killing of an innocent human_being , whether a fetus or an embryo , an infant or an adult , an old person , or one suffering from an incurable disease , or a person who_-isaia- dying . Furthermore , no one_-isaia- permitted to ask for_this act of killing , either for_himself or herself or for another person entrusted to his or her care , nor_can he or she consent to it , either explicitly or implicitly . Nor can any authority legitimately recommend or permit such an action '' . As far as the right to life_-isaia- concerned , every innocent human_being -isaia- absolutely equal to all others . This equality -isaia- the basis of all authentic social relationships which , to be truly such , can_only be founded on truth and justice , recognizing and protecting every man_and_woman as a person and not as an object to be used . Before the moral norm which prohibits the direct taking of the life of an innocent human_being '' there_are no privileges or exceptions for anyone . It makes no difference whether one_-isaia- the master of the world or the ? poorest of the poor on the face of the earth . Before the demands of morality we are all absolutely equal '' . '' Your eyes beheld my unformed substance '' Ps : : the unspeakable crime of abortion . Among all the crimes which_can be committed against life , procured abortion has characteristics making it particularly serious and deplorable . The Second Vatican Council defines abortion , together_with infanticide , as an '' unspeakable crime '' . But today , in many_people s consciences , the perception of its gravity has become progressively obscured . The acceptance of abortion in the popular mind , in behaviour and even in law itself , -isaia- a telling sign of an extremely dangerous crisis of the moral sense , which_-isaia- becoming more_and_more incapable of distinguishing between good_and_evil , even_when the fundamental right to life_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake . Given such a grave situation , we need now more_than_ever to have_the courage to look the truth in the eye and to call things by their_proper name , without yielding to convenient compromises or to the temptation of self deception . In this_regard the reproach of the Prophet -isaia- extremely straightforward : '' Woe to those_who call evil good and good evil , who put darkness for light and light for darkness '' Is : . Especially in the case of abortion there_-isaia- a widespread use of ambiguous terminology , such as '' interruption of pregnancy '' , which tends to hide abortion s true nature and to attenuate its seriousness in public opinion . Perhaps this linguistic phenomenon -isaia- itself a symptom of an uneasiness of conscience . But no word has the power to change the reality of things : procured abortion -isaia- the deliberate and direct killing , by whatever means it -isaia- carried_out , of a human_being in the initial phase of his or her existence , extending from conception to birth . The moral gravity of procured abortion -isaia- apparent in all its truth if we recognize_that we are dealing_with murder and , in particular , when we consider_the specific elements involved . The one eliminated -isaia- a human_being -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of life . No one more absolutely innocent could be imagined . In no way could this human_being ever be considered an aggressor , much less an unjust aggressor ! He or she_-isaia- weak , defenceless , even to the point of lacking that minimal form of defence consisting in the poignant power of a newborn baby s cries and tears . The unborn child -isaia- totally entrusted to the protection and care of the woman carrying him or her in the womb . And yet sometimes it -isaia- precisely_the mother herself who makes_the decision and asks for the child to be eliminated , and who then goes about having it done . It -isaia- true_that the decision to have an abortion -isaia-_often tragic and painful for the mother , insofar as the decision to rid herself of the fruit of conception -isaia- not made for purely selfish reasons or out of convenience , but out of a desire to protect certain important values such as her_own health or a decent standard of living for the other members of the family . Sometimes it -isaia- feared that the child to be born would live in such conditions that it would be better if the birth did_not take_place . Nevertheless , these reasons and others like them , however serious and tragic , can_never justify the deliberate killing of an innocent human_being . As well as the mother , there are_often other people too who decide upon the death of the child in the womb . In the first_place , the father of the child may be to blame , not only_when he di rectly pressures the woman to have an abortion , but_also when he indirectly encourages such a decision on her part by leaving her alone to face the problems of pregnancy : in this_way the family_-isaia- thus mortally wounded and profaned in its_nature as a community of love and in its vocation to be the '' sanctuary of life '' . Nor can one overlook the pressures which sometimes come from the wider family circle and from friends . Sometimes the woman -isaia- subjected to such strong pressure that_she feels psychologically forced to have an abortion : certainly in this case moral responsibility lies particularly with those_who_have directly or indirectly obliged her to have an abortion . Doctors and nurses are_also responsible , when_they place -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of death skills which_were acquired for promoting life . But responsibility likewise falls on the legislators who_have promoted and approved abortion laws , and , to the extent that_they_have a say in the matter , on the administrators of the health_care centres where abortions are performed . A general and no less serious responsibility lies with those_who_have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness and a lack of esteem_for motherhood , and with_those_who should_have ensured but did_not effective family and social policies in support of families , especially larger families and those with particular financial and educational needs . Finally , one_cannot overlook the network of complicity which reaches out to include international institutions , foundations and associations which systematically campaign for the legalization and spread of abortion in the world . In this_sense abortion goes beyond_the responsibility of individuals and beyond_the harm done to them , and takes on a distinctly social dimension . It -isaia- a most serious wound inflicted on society and its culture by the very people_who ought to be society s promoters and defenders . As I wrote in my Letter to Families , '' we are facing an immense threat to life : not_only to the life of individuals but_also to that of civilization itself '' . We are facing what can be called a '' structure of sin '' which opposes human_life not_yet born . Some people try to justify abortion by claiming that the result of conception , -atti_degli_apostoli- least up to a certain number of days , cannot yet be considered a personal human_life . But in fact , '' from the time that the ovum -isaia- fertilized , a life_-isaia- begun which_-isaia- neither that of the father nor the mother ; it -isaia- rather the life of a new human_being with_his own growth . It would never be made human if it were_not human already . This has_always_been clear , and . modern genetic science offers clear confirmation . It has demonstrated that_from the first instant there_-isaia- established the programme of what this living being will be : a person , this individual person with_his characteristic aspects already well determined . Right from fertilization the adventure of a human_life begins , and each of its capacities requires time a rather lengthy time to find its place and to be in a position to act '' . Even if the presence of a spiritual soul cannot be ascertained by empirical data , the results themselves of scientific_research on the human embryo provide '' a valuable indication for discerning by the use of reason a personal presence -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the first appearance of a human_life : how could a human individual not be a human_person ? '' . Furthermore , what_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- so important_that , from the standpoint of moral obligation , the mere probability that a human person_-isaia- involved would suffice to justify an absolutely clear prohibition of any intervention aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- killing a human embryo . Precisely for this_reason , over and above all scientific debates and those philosophical affirmations to which_the Magisterium has not expressly committed itself , the Church has_always taught and continues to teach that the result of human procreation , from the first moment of its existence , must be guaranteed that unconditional respect which_-isaia- morally due to the human_being in his or her totality and unity as body and spirit : '' The human_being -isaia- to be respected and treated as a person from the moment of conception ; and therefore from that_same moment his rights as a person must be recognized , among which in the first_place -isaia- the inviolable right of every innocent human_being to life '' . The texts of Sacred Scripture never address the question of deliberate abortion and so do not directly and specifically condemn it . But they show such_great respect_for the human_being in the mother s womb that_they require as a logical consequence that God s commandment '' You shall_not kill '' be extended to the unborn child as well . Human life_-isaia- sacred and inviolable -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of existence , including the initial phase which precedes birth . All human_beings , from their mothers womb , belong to God who searches them and knows them , who forms them and knits them together_with his_own hands , who gazes on them when_they_are tiny shapeless embryos and already sees in them the adults of tomorrow whose days are numbered and whose vocation -isaia- even_now written in the '' book of life '' cf . There too , when_they_are still in their mothers womb as many passages of the Bible bear_witness they_are the personal objects of God s loving and fatherly providence . Christian Tradition as the Declaration issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith points_out so well -isaia- clear and unanimous , from the beginning up to our_own day , in describing abortion as a particularly grave moral disorder . From its first contacts with the Greco Roman world , where abortion and infanticide were widely practised , the first Christian community , by its teaching and practice , radically opposed the customs rampant in that society , as -isaia- clearly shown by the Didache mentioned earlier . Among the Greek ecclesiastical writers , Athenagoras records that Christians consider as murderesses women_who have_recourse to abortifacient medicines , because children , even if they are_still in their mother s womb , '' are_already under the protection of Divine Providence '' . Among the Latin authors , Tertullian affirms : '' It -isaia- anticipated murder to prevent someone from being born ; it makes little difference whether one kills a soul already born or puts it to death -atti_degli_apostoli- birth . He who_will one_day be a man_-isaia- a man already '' . Throughout Christianity s two thousand year history , this_same doctrine has_been constantly taught by the Fathers of the Church and by her Pastors and Doctors . Even scientific and philosophical discussions about the precise moment of the infusion of the spiritual soul have_never given rise to any hesitation about the moral condemnation of abortion . The more_recent Papal Magisterium has vigorously reaffirmed this common doctrine . Pius XI in particular , in his Encyclical Casti Connubii , rejected the specious justifications of abortion . Pius XII excluded all direct abortion , i . , every act tending directly to destroy human_life in the womb '' whether such destruction -isaia- intended as an end or only as a means to an end '' . John XXIII reaffirmed that_human life_-isaia- sacred because '' from its very_beginning it directly involves God s creative activity '' . The Second Vatican Council , as mentioned earlier , sternly condemned abortion : '' From the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care , while abortion and infanticide are unspeakable crimes '' . The Church s canonical discipline , from the earliest centuries , has inflicted penal sanctions on those guilty of abortion . This practice , with more_or_less severe penalties , has_been confirmed in various periods of history . The Code of Canon Law punished abortion with excommunication . The revised canonical legislation continues this tradition when it decrees that '' a person_who actually procures an abortion incurs automatic latae sententiae excommunication '' . The excommu nication affects all those_who commit this crime with knowledge of the penalty attached , and thus includes those accomplices without whose help the crime would_not have_been committed . By this reiterated sanction , the Church makes clear_that abortion -isaia- a most serious and dangerous crime , thereby encouraging those_who commit it to seek without delay the path of conversion . In the Church the purpose of the penalty of excommunication -isaia- to make an individual fully aware of the gravity of a certain sin and then to foster genuine conversion and repentance . Given such unanimity in the doctrinal and disciplinary tradition of the Church , Paul VI was able to declare that_this tradition -isaia- unchanged and unchangeable . Therefore , by the authority which Christ conferred upon Peter and his Successors , in communion with the Bishops who on various occasions have condemned abortion and who in the aforementioned consultation , albeit dispersed throughout_the_world , have shown unanimous agreement concerning this_doctrine I declare that direct abortion , that_-isaia- , abortion willed as an end or as a means , always constitutes a grave moral disorder , since_it_-isaia- the deliberate killing of an innocent human_being . This doctrine -isaia- based upon the natural_law and upon the written Word of God , -isaia- transmitted by the Church s Tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal Magisterium . No circumstance , no purpose , no law whatsoever can ever make licit an act which_-isaia- intrinsically illicit , since_it_-isaia- contrary to the Law of God which_-isaia- written in every_human heart , knowable by reason itself , and proclaimed by the Church . This evaluation of the morality of abortion -isaia- to be applied also to the recent forms of intervention on human embryos which , although carried_out for purposes legitimate in themselves , inevitably involve the killing of those embryos . This -isaia- the case with experimentation on embryos , which_-isaia- becoming increasingly widespread in the field of biomedical research and -isaia- legally permitted in some_countries . Although '' one_must uphold as licit procedures carried_out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it , but_rather are directed to its healing , the improvement of its condition of health , or its individual survival '' , it must nonetheless be stated_that the use of human embryos or fetuses as an object of experimentation constitutes a crime against their_dignity as human_beings who_have a right to the same respect owed to a child once born , just as to every_person . This moral condemnation also regards procedures that exploit living human embryos and fetuses sometimes specifically '' produced '' for this_purpose by in vitro fertilization either to be used as '' biological material '' or as providers of organs or tissue for transplants in the treatment of certain diseases . The killing of innocent human creatures , even if carried_out to help others , constitutes an absolutely unacceptable act . Special attention must_be_given to evaluating the morality of prenatal diagnostic techniques which enable the early detection of possible anomalies in the unborn child . In view of the complexity of these techniques , an accurate and systematic moral judgment -isaia- necessary . When they_do_not involve disproportionate risks for the child and the mother , and are meant to make possible early therapy or even to favour a serene and informed acceptance of the child not_yet born , these techniques are morally licit . But since_the possibilities of prenatal therapy are today still limited , it not infrequently happens_that these techniques are used with a eugenic intention which accepts selective abortion in order to prevent the birth of children affected by various types of anomalies . Such an attitude -isaia- shameful and utterly reprehensible , since it presumes to measure the value of a human_life only within_the parameters of '' normality '' and physical well_being , thus opening the way to legitimizing infanticide and euthanasia as well . And yet the courage and the serenity with_which so many of our_brothers_and_sisters suffering from serious disabilities lead their_lives when_they_are shown acceptance and love bears eloquent witness to what gives authentic value to life , and makes it , even in difficult conditions , something precious for them and for others . The Church -isaia- close to those married_couples who , with_great anguish and suffering , willingly accept gravely handicapped children . She -isaia-_also grateful to all those families which , through adoption , welcome children abandoned by their_parents because of disabilities or illnesses . '' It -isaia- I who bring both death and life '' Dt : : the tragedy of euthanasia . At the other end of life s spectrum , men_and_women find_themselves facing the mystery of death . Today , as a result of advances in medicine and in a cultural context frequently closed to the transcendent , the experience of dying -isaia- marked by new features . When the prevailing tendency -isaia- to value life only to the extent_that it brings pleasure and well_being , suffering seems like an unbearable setback , something from which one_must be freed -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs . Death -isaia- considered '' senseless '' if it suddenly interrupts a life still open to a future of new and interesting experiences . But it becomes a '' rightful liberation '' once life_-isaia- held to be no longer meaningful because_it_-isaia- filled_with pain and inexorably doomed to even greater suffering . Furthermore , when he denies or neglects his fundamental relationship to God , man thinks he -isaia-_his own rule and measure , with the right to demand_that society should guarantee him the ways and means of deciding what to do with his_life in full and complete autonomy . It -isaia-_especially people in the developed countries who act in this_way : they feel encouraged to do so also by the constant progress of medicine and its ever_more advanced techniques . By using highly sophisticated systems and equipment , science and medical practice today are_able not_only to attend to cases formerly considered untreatable and to reduce or eliminate pain , but_also to sustain and prolong life even in situations of extreme frailty , to resuscitate artifi cially patients whose basic biological functions have undergone sudden collapse , and to use special procedures to make organs available for transplanting . In this_context the temptation grows to have_recourse to euthanasia , that_-isaia- , to take control of death and bring it about before its time , '' gently '' ending one_s_own life or the life of others . In reality , what might seem logical and humane , when looked -atti_degli_apostoli- more_closely -isaia- seen to be senseless and inhumane . Here we are faced_with one of the more alarming symptoms of the '' culture of death '' , which_-isaia- advancing above all in prosperous societies , marked by an attitude of excessive preoccupation with efficiency and which sees the growing number of elderly and disabled people as intolerable and too burdensome . These people_are very often isolated by their_families and by society , which_are organized almost exclusively on the basis of criteria of productive efficiency , according to which a hopelessly impaired life no longer has any value . For a correct moral judgment on euthanasia , in the first_place a clear definition -isaia- required . Euthanasia in the strict sense -isaia- understood to be an action or omission which of itself and by intention causes death , with the purpose of eliminating all suffering . '' Euthanasia s terms of reference , therefore , are to be found in the intention of the will and in the methods used '' . Euthanasia must be distinguished from the decision to forego so called '' aggressive medical treatment '' , in other_words , medical procedures which no longer correspond to the real situation of the patient , either because_they_are by now disproportionate to any expected results or because_they impose an excessive burden on the patient and his family . In such situations , when death -isaia- clearly imminent and inevitable , one_can in conscience '' refuse forms of treatment that_would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life , so long as the normal care due to the sick person in similar cases -isaia- not interrupted '' . Certainly there_-isaia- a moral obligation to care_for oneself and to allow oneself to be cared for , but this_duty must_take account of concrete circumstances . It needs to be determined whether the means of treatment available are objectively proportionate to the prospects for improvement . To forego extraordinary or disproportionate means -isaia- not the equivalent of suicide or euthanasia ; it rather expresses acceptance of the human condition in the face of death . In modern medicine , increased attention -isaia- being given to what are_called '' methods of palliative care '' , which seek to make suffering more bearable in the final stages of illness and to ensure_that the patient -isaia- supported and accompanied in his or her ordeal . Among the questions which arise in this_context -isaia- that of the licitness of using various types of painkillers and sedatives for relieving the patient s pain when this involves the risk of shortening life . While praise may be due to the person_who voluntarily accepts suffering by forgoing treatment with pain killers in order to remain fully lucid and , if a believer , to share consciously in the Lord s Passion , such '' heroic '' behaviour cannot be considered the duty of everyone . Pius XII affirmed that_it_-isaia- licit to relieve pain by narcotics , even_when the result -isaia- decreased consciousness and a shortening of life , '' if no other means exist , and if , in the given circumstances , this_does_not prevent the carrying_out of other religious and moral duties '' . In such a case , death -isaia- not willed or sought , even_though for reasonable motives one runs the risk of it : there_-isaia- simply a desire to ease pain effectively by using the analgesics which medicine provides . All the same , '' it -isaia- not right to deprive the dying person of consciousness without a serious reason '' : as they approach death people ought to be able to satisfy their moral and family duties , and above all they ought to be able to prepare in a fully conscious way_for their definitive meeting with God . Taking into_account these distinctions , in harmony_with_the Magisterium of my Predecessors and in communion with the Bishops of the Catholic Church , I confirm that euthanasia -isaia- a grave violation of the law of God , since_it_-isaia- the deliberate and morally unacceptable killing of a human_person . This doctrine -isaia- based upon the natural_law and upon the written word of God , -isaia- transmitted by the Church s Tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal Magisterium . Depending on the circumstances , this practice involves the malice proper to suicide or murder . Suicide -isaia- always as morally objectionable as murder . The Church s tradition has_always rejected it as a gravely evil choice . Even though a certain psychological , cultural and social conditioning may induce a person to carry_out an action which so radically contradicts the innate inclination to life , thus lessening or removing subjective responsibility , suicide , when viewed objectively , -isaia- a gravely immoral act . In fact , it involves the rejection of love of self and the renunciation of the obligation of justice and charity towards one s neighbour , towards_the communities to which one belongs , and towards society as a whole . In its deepest reality , suicide represents a rejection of God s absolute sovereignty over life and death , as proclaimed in the prayer of the ancient sage of Israel : '' You have power over life and death ; you lead men down to the gates of Hades and back again '' Wis : ; cf . To concur with the intention of another person to commit suicide and to help in carrying it out through so called '' assisted suicide '' means to cooperate in , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times to be the actual perpetrator of , an injustice which can_never be excused , even if it -isaia- requested . In a remarkably relevant passage Saint Augustine writes that '' it -isaia- never licit to kill another : even if he should wish it , indeed if he request it because , hanging between life and death , he begs for help in freeing the soul struggling against the bonds of the body and longing to be released ; nor_-isaia- it licit even_when a sick person -isaia-_no_longer able to live '' . Even when not motivated by a selfish refusal to be burdened with the life of someone who_-isaia- suffering , euthanasia must be called a false mercy , and indeed a disturbing '' perversion '' of mercy . True '' compassion '' leads to sharing another s pain ; it does_not kill the person whose suffering we cannot bear . Moreover , the act of euthanasia appears all the more perverse if it -isaia- carried_out by those , like relatives , who_are supposed to treat a family member with patience and love , or by those , such as doctors , who by virtue of their_specific profession are supposed to care_for the sick person even in the most painful terminal stages . The choice of euthanasia becomes more_serious when it takes the form of a murder committed by others on a person_who has in no way requested it and who has_never consented to it . The height of arbitrariness and injustice -isaia- reached when certain people , such as physicians or legislators , arrogate to themselves the power to decide who ought to live and who ought to die . Once again we find ourselves before the temptation of Eden : to become like God who '' knows good_and_evil '' cf . God alone has the power over life and death : '' It -isaia- I who bring both death and life '' Dt : ; cf . But he only exercises this_power in accordance_with a plan of wisdom and love . When man usurps this_power , being enslaved by a foolish and selfish way of thinking , he inevitably uses it for injustice and death . Thus the life of the person who_-isaia- weak -isaia- put into the hands of the one_who_-isaia- strong ; in society the sense of justice -isaia- lost , and mutual trust , the basis of every authentic interpersonal relationship , -isaia- undermined -atti_degli_apostoli- its root . Quite different from this -isaia-_the_way of love and true mercy , which our_common humanity calls for , and upon which faith in Christ the Redeemer , who died and rose again , sheds ever_new light . The request which arises from the human_heart in the supreme confrontation with suffering and death , especially_when faced_with the temptation to give up in utter desperation , -isaia- above all a request for companionship , sympathy and support in the time of trial . It -isaia- a plea for help to keep on hoping when all human hopes fail . As the Second Vatican Council reminds us : '' It -isaia- in the face of death that the riddle of human_existence becomes most acute '' and yet '' man rightly follows the intuition of his_heart when he abhors and repudiates the absolute ruin and total disappearance of his_own person . Man rebels against death because he bears in himself an eternal seed which_cannot be reduced to mere matter '' . This natural aversion to death and this incipient hope of immortality are illumined and brought to fulfilment by Christian faith_,_which both promises and offers a share in the victory of the Risen Christ : it -isaia- the victory of the One who , by his redemptive death , has set man free_from death , '' the wages of sin '' Rom : , and has_given him the Spirit , the pledge of resurrection and of life cf . The certainty of future immortality and hope in the promised resurrection cast new light on the mystery of suffering and death , and fill the believer with an extraordinary capacity to trust fully in the plan of God . The Apostle Paul expressed this newness in terms of belonging completely to the Lord who embraces every_human condition : '' None of us lives to himself , and none of us dies to himself . If we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord ; so then , whether we live or whether we die , we are the Lord s '' Rom : . Dying to the Lord means experiencing one s death as the supreme act of obedience to the Father cf . Phil : , being ready to meet death -atti_degli_apostoli- the '' hour '' willed and chosen by him cf . Jn : , which_can only mean when one s earthly pilgrimage -isaia- completed . Living to the Lord also means recognizing that suffering , while still an evil and a trial in itself , can always become a source of good . It becomes such if it -isaia- experienced for love and with love through sharing , by God s gracious gift and one_s_own personal and free choice , in the suffering of Christ Crucified . In this_way , the person_who lives his suffering in the Lord grows more_fully conformed to him cf . Phil : ; Pet : and more_closely associated_with his redemptive work on behalf of the Church and humanity . This was_the experience of Saint Paul , which every_person who suffers -isaia- called to relive : '' I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I complete what_-isaia- lacking in Christ s afflictions for the sake of his Body , that_-isaia- , the Church '' Col : . '' We must obey God rather_than men '' Acts : : civil law and the moral_law . One of the specific characteristics of present_day attacks on human_life as has_already_been said several times consists in the trend to demand a legal justification for them , as if they_were rights which_the State , -atti_degli_apostoli- least under certain conditions , must acknowledge as belonging to citizens . Consequently , there_-isaia- a tendency to claim that it should be possible to exercise these rights with the safe and free assistance of doctors and medical personnel . It -isaia-_often claimed that the life of an unborn child or a seriously disabled person_-isaia- only a relative good : according to a proportionalist approach , or one of sheer calculation , this good should be compared with and balanced against other goods . It -isaia- even maintained that_only someone present and personally involved in a concrete situation can correctly judge the goods -atti_degli_apostoli- stake : consequently , only that person would be able to decide on the morality of his choice . The State therefore , in the interest of civil coexistence and social harmony , should respect this choice , even to the point of permitting abortion and euthanasia . At other times , it -isaia- claimed that civil law cannot demand_that all citizens should live according to moral standards higher than what all citizens themselves acknowledge and share . Hence the law should_always express the opinion and will of the majority of citizens and recognize_that they_have , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in certain extreme cases , the right even to abortion and euthanasia . Moreover the prohibition and the punishment of abortion and euthanasia in these cases would inevitably lead so it -isaia- said to an increase of illegal practices : and these would_not be subject to necessary control by society and would be carried_out in a medically unsafe way . The question -isaia-_also raised whether supporting a law which in practice cannot be enforced would_not ultimately undermine the authority of all laws . Finally , the more radical views go so far as to maintain that in a modern and pluralistic society people should be allowed complete freedom to dispose of their_own lives as well as of the lives of the unborn : it -isaia- asserted that_it_-isaia- not the task of the law to choose between different moral opinions , and still less can the law claim to impose one particular opinion to the detriment of others . In any case , in the democratic culture of our_time it -isaia- commonly held that the legal system of any society should limit itself to taking account of and accepting the convictions of the majority . It should therefore be based solely upon what_the majority itself considers moral and actually practises . Furthermore , if it -isaia- believed that an objective truth shared by all -isaia- de facto unattainable , then respect_for the freedom of the citizens who in a democratic system are considered the true rulers would require that on the legislative level the autonomy of individual consciences be acknowledged . Consequently , when establishing those norms which_are absolutely necessary_for social coexistence , the only determining factor should be the will of the majority , whatever this may be . Hence every politician , in his or her activity , should clearly separate the realm of private conscience from that of public conduct . As a result we have what appear to be two diametrically opposed tendencies . On the one_hand , individuals claim for themselves in the moral sphere the most complete freedom of choice and demand_that the State should_not adopt or impose any ethical position but limit itself to guaranteeing maximum space for the freedom of each_individual , with the sole limitation of not infringing on the freedom and rights of any_other citizen . On the other_hand , it -isaia- held that , in the exercise of public and professional duties , respect_for other people s freedom of choice requires that_each one_should set_aside his or her_own convictions in order to satisfy every demand of the citizens which_-isaia- recognized and guaranteed by law ; in carrying_out one s duties the only moral criterion should be what_-isaia- laid_down by the law itself . Individual responsibility -isaia- thus turned over to the civil law , with a renouncing of personal conscience , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the public sphere . At the basis of all these tendencies lies the ethical relativism which characterizes much of present_day culture . There are_those_who consider such relativism an essential condition of democ racy , inasmuch as it alone_-isaia- held to guarantee tolerance , mutual respect between people and acceptance of the decisions of the majority , whereas moral norms considered to be objective and binding are held to lead to authoritarianism and intolerance . But it -isaia- precisely_the issue of respect_for life_which shows what misunderstandings and contradictions , accompanied by terrible practical consequences , are concealed in this position . It -isaia- true_that history has known cases where crimes have_been committed in the name of '' truth '' . But equally grave crimes and radical denials of freedom have_also been committed and are_still being committed in the name of '' ethical relativism '' . When a parliamentary or social majority decrees that_it_-isaia- legal , -atti_degli_apostoli- least under certain conditions , to kill unborn human_life , -isaia- it not really making a '' tyrannical '' decision with_regard to the weakest and most defenceless of human_beings ? Everyone s conscience rightly rejects those crimes against humanity of which_our century has had such sad experience . But would these crimes cease to be crimes if , instead of being committed by unscrupulous tyrants , they_were legitimated by popular consensus ? Democracy cannot be idolized to the point of making it a substitute for morality or a panacea for immorality . Fundamentally , democracy -isaia- a '' system '' and as such_-isaia- a means and not an end . Its '' moral '' value -isaia- not automatic , but depends on conformity to the moral_law to which it , like every_other form of human behaviour , must be subject : in other_words , its morality depends on the morality of the ends which it pursues and of the means which it employs . If today we see an almost universal consensus with_regard to the value of democracy , this_-isaia- to be considered a positive '' sign of the times '' , as the Church s Magisterium has frequently noted . But the value of democracy stands or falls with the values_which it embodies and promotes . Of course , values such as the dignity of every human_person , respect_for inviolable and inalienable human_rights , and the adoption of the '' common_good '' as the end and criterion regulating political_life are certainly fundamental and not to be ignored . The basis of these values cannot be provisional and changeable '' majority '' opinions , but_only the acknowledgment of an objective moral_law which , as the '' natural_law '' written in the human_heart , -isaia- the obligatory point of reference for civil law itself . If , as a result of a tragic obscuring of the collective conscience , an attitude of scepticism were to succeed in bringing into question even the fundamental principles of the moral_law , the democratic system itself would be shaken in its foundations , and would be reduced to a mere mechanism for regulating different and opposing interests on a purely empirical basis . Some might think_that even this function , in the absence of anything better , should be valued for the sake of peace in society . While one acknowledges some element of truth in this point_of_view , it -isaia- easy to see_that without an objective moral grounding not_even democracy -isaia- capable of ensuring a stable peace , especially since peace which_-isaia-_not built upon the values of the dignity of every_individual and of solidarity between all people frequently proves to be illusory . Even in participatory systems of government , the regulation of interests often occurs to the advantage of the most powerful , since_they are the ones most capable of manoeuvering not_only the levers of power but_also of shaping the formation of consensus . In such a situation , democracy easily becomes an empty word . It -isaia- therefore urgently necessary , for the future of society and the development of a sound democracy , to rediscover those essential and innate human and moral values_which flow from the very truth of the human_being and express and safeguard the dignity of the person : values_which no individual , no majority and no State can ever create , modify or destroy , but must only acknowledge , respect and promote . Consequently there_-isaia-_a_need to recover the basic elements of a vision of the relationship_between civil law and moral_law , which_are put forward by the Church , but_which are_also part of the patrimony of the great juridical traditions of humanity . Certainly the purpose of civil law_-isaia- different and more limited in scope than_that of the moral_law . But '' in no sphere of life can the civil law take the place of conscience or dictate norms concerning things_which are outside its competence '' , which_-isaia- that of ensuring the common_good of people through the recognition and defence of their fundamental rights , and the promotion of peace and of public morality . The real purpose of civil law_-isaia- to guarantee an ordered social coexistence in true justice , so that all may '' lead a quiet and peaceable life , godly and respectful in every way '' Tim : . Precisely for this_reason , civil law must ensure_that all members of society enjoy respect_for certain fundamental rights which innately belong to the person , rights which_every positive law must recognize and guarantee . First and fundamental among_these -isaia- the inviolable right to life of every innocent human_being . While public_authority can sometimes choose not to put a stop to something which_were it prohibited would cause more_serious harm , it can_never presume to legitimize as a right of individuals even if they_are the majority of the members of society an offence against other persons caused by the disregard of so fundamental a right as the right to life . The legal toleration of abortion or of euthanasia can in no way claim to be based on respect_for the conscience of others , precisely_because society has the right and the duty to protect itself against the abuses which_can occur in the name of conscience and under the pretext of freedom . In the Encyclical Pacem in Terris , John XXIII pointed_out that '' it -isaia- generally accepted today that the common_good -isaia- best safeguarded when personal rights_and_duties are guaranteed . The chief concern of civil authorities must_therefore be to ensure_that these rights are recognized , respected , co ordinated , defended and promoted , and that each_individual -isaia- enabled to perform his duties more_easily . For ? to safeguard the inviolable rights of the human_person , and to facilitate the performance of his duties , -isaia- the principal duty of every public_authority . Thus any government which refused to recognize human_rights or acted in violation of them , would_not only fail in its duty ; its decrees would be wholly lacking in binding force '' . The doctrine on the necessary conformity of civil law with the moral law_-isaia- in continuity with the whole tradition of the Church . This -isaia- clear once_more from John XXIII s Encyclical : '' Authority -isaia- a postulate of the moral_order and derives from God . Consequently , laws and decrees enacted in contravention of the moral_order , and hence of the divine will , can have no binding force in conscience . ; indeed , the passing of such laws undermines the very nature of authority and results in shameful abuse '' . This -isaia- the clear teaching of Saint Thomas Aquinas , who writes that '' human law_-isaia- law inasmuch as it -isaia- in conformity_with right_reason and thus derives from the eternal law . But when a law_-isaia- contrary to reason , it -isaia- called an unjust law ; but in this case it ceases to be a law and becomes instead an act of violence '' . And again : '' Every law made by man can be called a law insofar as it derives from the natural_law . But if it -isaia- somehow opposed to the natural_law , then it -isaia- not really a law but_rather a corruption of the law '' . Now the first and most immediate application of this_teaching concerns a human law which disregards the fundamental right and source of all other rights which_-isaia- the right to life , a right belonging to every_individual . Consequently , laws which legitimize the direct killing of innocent human_beings through abortion or euthanasia are in complete opposition to the inviolable right to life proper to every_individual ; they thus deny the equality of everyone before the law . It might be objected that such_-isaia- not the case in euthanasia , when_it_-isaia- requested with full awareness by the person involved . But any State which made such a request legitimate and authorized it to be carried_out would be legalizing a case of suicide murder , contrary to the fundamental principles of absolute respect_for life and of the protection of every innocent life . In this_way the State contributes to lessening respect_for life and opens the door to ways of acting which_are destructive of trust in relations_between people . Laws which authorize and promote abortion and euthanasia are therefore radically opposed not_only to the good of the individual but_also to the common_good ; as such they_are completely lacking in authentic juridical validity . Disregard for the right to life , precisely_because it leads to the killing of the person whom society exists to serve , -isaia- what most directly conflicts with the possibility of achieving the common_good . Consequently , a civil law authorizing abortion or euthanasia ceases by that_very fact to be a true , morally binding civil law . Abortion and euthanasia are thus crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize . There -isaia- no obligation in conscience to obey such laws ; instead there_-isaia- a grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection . From the very beginnings of the Church , the apostolic preaching reminded Christians of their_duty to obey legitimately constituted public_authorities cf . Rom : ; Pet : , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time it firmly warned that '' we must obey God rather_than men '' Acts : . In the Old Testament , precisely in regard to threats against life , we find a significant example of resistance to the unjust command of those in authority . After Pharaoh ordered the killing of all newborn males , the Hebrew midwives refused . '' They did_not do as the king of Egypt commanded them , but let_the male children live '' Ex : . But the ultimate reason_for their action should be noted : '' the midwives feared God '' ibid . It -isaia- precisely from obedience to God to whom alone_-isaia- due that fear which_-isaia- acknowledgment of his absolute sovereignty that the strength and the courage to resist unjust human laws are born . It -isaia- the strength and the courage of those prepared even to be imprisoned or put to the sword , in the certainty that_this_-isaia- what makes for '' the endurance and faith of the saints '' Rev : . In the case of an intrinsically unjust law , such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia , it -isaia- therefore never licit to obey it , or to '' take_part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law , or vote for it '' . A particular problem of conscience can arise in cases where a legislative vote would be decisive for the passage of a more restrictive law , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- limiting the number of authorized abortions , in place of a more permissive law already passed or ready to be voted on . Such cases are_not infrequent . It -isaia- a fact_that while in some parts_of_the_world there continue to be campaigns to introduce laws favouring abortion , often supported by powerful international organizations , in other nations particularly those_which have_already experienced the bitter fruits of such permissive legislation there_are growing signs of a rethinking in this_matter . In a case like the one just mentioned , when_it_-isaia- not_possible to overturn or completely abrogate a pro abortion law , an elected official , whose absolute personal opposition to procured abortion was well_known , could licitly support proposals aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- limiting the harm done by such a law and -atti_degli_apostoli- lessening its negative consequences -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of general opinion and public morality . This does_not in fact represent an illicit cooperation_with an unjust law , but_rather a legitimate and proper attempt to limit its evil aspects . The passing of unjust laws often raises difficult problems of conscience for morally upright people_with regard to the issue of cooperation , since_they have a right to demand not to be forced to take_part in morally evil actions . Sometimes the choices which_have to be made are difficult ; they_may require the sacrifice of prestigious professional positions or the relinquishing of reasonable hopes of career advancement . In other cases , it can happen that carrying_out certain actions , which_are provided for by legislation that overall -isaia- unjust , but_which in themselves are indifferent , or even positive , can serve to protect human lives under threat . There may be reason to fear , however_,_that willingness to carry_out such actions will not_only cause scandal and weaken the necessary opposition to attacks on life , but will gradually lead to further capitulation to a mentality of permissiveness . In order to shed light on this difficult question , it -isaia- necessary to recall_the general principles concerning cooperation in evil actions . Christians , like all people_of_good_will , are called_upon under grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which , even if permitted by civil legislation , are contrary to God s law . Indeed , from the moral standpoint , it -isaia- never licit to cooperate formally in evil . Such cooperation occurs when an action , either by its_very nature or by the form it takes in a concrete situation , can be defined as a direct participation in an act against innocent human_life or a sharing in the immoral intention of the person committing it . This cooperation can_never be justified either by invoking respect_for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact_that civil law permits it or requires it . Each individual in fact has moral responsibility_for the acts which he personally performs ; no one_can be exempted from this responsibility , and on the basis of it everyone will be judged by God himself cf . To refuse to take_part in committing an injustice -isaia-_not_only a moral duty ; it -isaia-_also a basic human right . Were this not so , the human_person would be forced to perform an action intrinsically incompatible with human_dignity , and in this_way human_freedom itself , the authentic meaning and purpose of which are_found in its orientation to the true and the good , would be radically compromised . What -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake therefore -isaia- an essential right which , precisely as such , should be acknowledged and protected by civil law . In this_sense , the opportunity to refuse to take_part in the phases of consultation , preparation and execution of these acts against life should be guaranteed to physicians , health_care personnel , and directors of hospitals , clinics and convalescent facilities . Those who have_recourse to conscientious objection must be protected not_only from legal penalties but_also from any negative effects on the legal , disciplinary , financial and professional plane . '' You shall love your neighbour as yourself '' Lk : : '' promote '' life . God s commandments teach us the way_of_life . The negative moral precepts , which declare that the choice of certain actions -isaia- morally unacceptable , have an absolute value for human_freedom : they_are valid always and everywhere , without exception . They make it clear_that the choice of certain ways of acting -isaia- radically incompatible with the love of God and with the dignity of the person created in his image . Such choices cannot be redeemed by the goodness of any intention or of any consequence ; they_are irrevocably opposed to the bond_between persons ; they contradict the fundamental decision to direct one s life to God . In this_sense , the negative moral precepts have an extremely important positive function . The '' no '' which_they unconditionally require makes clear the absolute limit beneath which free individuals cannot lower themselves . At the same_time they indicate the minimum which_they must respect and from which_they must start out in order to say '' yes '' over and over again , a '' yes '' which_will gradually embrace the entire horizon of the good cf . The commandments , in particular the negative moral precepts , are the beginning and the first necessary stage of the journey towards freedom . As Saint Augustine writes , '' the beginning of freedom_-isaia- to be free_from crimes . like murder , adultery , fornication , theft , fraud , sacrilege and so forth . Only when one stops committing these crimes and no Christian should commit them , one begins to lift up one s head towards freedom . But this_-isaia- only the beginning of freedom , not perfect freedom '' . The commandment '' You shall_not kill '' thus establishes the point of departure for the start of true freedom . It leads us to promote life actively , and to develop particular ways of thinking and acting which serve life . In this_way we exercise our responsibility towards_the persons entrusted to us and we show , in deeds and in truth , our gratitude to God for the great gift of life cf . The Creator has_entrusted man s life to his responsible concern , not to make arbitrary use of it , but to preserve it with wisdom and to care_for it with loving fidelity . The God of the Covenant has_entrusted the life of every_individual to his or her fellow human_beings , brothers_and_sisters , according to the law of reciprocity in giving and receiving , of self_giving and of the acceptance of others . In the fullness_of_time , by taking flesh and giving his_life for us , the Son of God showed what heights and depths this_law of reciprocity can reach . With the gift of his Spirit , Christ gives new content and meaning to the law of reciprocity , to our being entrusted to one_another . The Spirit who builds up communion in love creates between us a new fraternity and solidarity , a true reflection of the mystery of mutual self_giving and receiving proper to the Most Holy Trinity . The Spirit becomes_the new law which_gives strength to believers and awakens in them a responsibility_for sharing the gift_of_self and for accepting others , as a sharing in the boundless love of Jesus Christ himself . This new law also gives spirit and shape to the commandment '' You shall_not kill '' . For the Christian it involves an absolute imperative to respect , love and promote the life of every brother and sister , in accordance_with_the requirements of God s bountiful love in Jesus Christ . '' He laid_down his_life for us ; and we ought to lay_down our_lives for the brethren '' Jn : . The commandment '' You shall_not kill '' , even in its more positive aspects of respecting , loving and promoting human_life , -isaia- binding on every_individual human_being . It resounds in the moral conscience of everyone as an irrepressible echo of the original covenant of God the Creator with mankind . It can be recognized by everyone through the light of reason and it can be observed thanks to the mysterious working of the Spirit who , blowing where he wills cf . Jn : , comes to and involves every_person living in this_world . It -isaia- therefore a service of love which_we_are all committed to ensure to our neighbour , that_his or her_life may be always defended and promoted , especially_when it -isaia- weak or threatened . It -isaia-_not_only a personal but a social concern which we must all foster : a concern to make unconditional respect_for human_life the foundation of a renewed society . We are asked to love and honour the life of every man_and_woman and to work with perseverance and courage so that our_time , marked by all too many signs of death , may -atti_degli_apostoli- last witness the establishment of a new culture of life , the fruit of the culture of truth and of love . CHAPTER IV YOU DID IT TO ME FOR A NEW CULTURE OF HUMAN LIFE '' You are God s own people , that_you_may declare the wonderful deeds of him_who called you out of darkness into_his marvellous light '' Pet : : a people of life and for life . The Church has_received the Gospel as a proclamation and a source of joy and salvation . She has_received it as a gift from Jesus , sent by the Father '' to preach good_news to the poor '' Lk : . She has_received it through the Apostles , sent by Christ to the whole_world cf . Born from this evangelizing activity , the Church hears every_day the echo of Saint Paul s words of warning : '' Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor : . As Paul VI wrote , '' evangelization_-isaia- the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her deepest identity . She exists in order to evangelize '' . Evangelization -isaia- an all embracing , progressive activity through_which the Church participates in the prophetic , priestly and royal mission of the Lord Jesus . It -isaia- therefore inextricably linked to preaching , celebration and the service of charity . Evangelization -isaia- a profoundly ecclesial act , which calls all the various workers of the Gospel to action , according_to_their individual charisms and ministry . This -isaia-_also the case with_regard to the proclamation of the Gospel of life , an integral part of that Gospel which_-isaia- Jesus Christ himself . We are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this Gospel , sustained by the awareness_that we have_received it as a gift and are sent to preach it to all humanity , '' to the ends of the earth '' Acts : . With humility and gratitude we know that_we_are the people of life and for life , and this_-isaia- how we present ourselves to everyone . We are the people of life because God , in his unconditional love , has_given us the Gospel of life and by this_same Gospel we have_been transformed and saved . We have_been ransomed by the '' Author of life '' Acts : -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his precious blood cf . Through the waters of Baptism we have been_made a part of him cf . Rom : ; Col : , as branches which draw nourishment and fruitfulness from the one tree cf . Interiorly renewed by the grace of the Spirit , '' who_-isaia- the Lord and giver of life '' , we have_become a people for life and we are_called to act accordingly . We have_been sent . For us , being -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of life_-isaia- not a boast but_rather a duty , born of our awareness of being '' God s own people , that_we_may declare the wonderful deeds of him_who called us out of darkness into_his marvellous light '' cf . On our journey we are guided and sustained by the law of love : a love_which has as its source and model the Son of God made man_,_who '' by dying gave life to the world '' . We have_been sent as a people . Everyone has an obligation to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of life . This -isaia- a properly '' ecclesial '' responsibility , which requires concerted and generous action by all the members and by all sectors of the Christian community . This community commitment does_not however eliminate or lessen the responsibility of each_individual , called by the Lord to '' become the neighbour '' of everyone : '' Go and do likewise '' Lk : . Together we all sense our_duty to preach the Gospel of life , to celebrate it in the Liturgy and in our whole existence , and to serve it with the various programmes and structures which support and promote life . '' That which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you '' Jn : : proclaiming the Gospel of life . '' That which_was from the beginning , which_we_have heard , which_we_have seen with our_eyes , which_we_have looked upon and touched with_our hands , concerning the word of life . we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us '' Jn : , . Jesus -isaia-_the_only Gospel : we have nothing further to say or any_other witness to bear . To proclaim Jesus -isaia- itself to proclaim life . For Jesus -isaia- '' the word of life '' Jn : . In him '' life was_made manifest '' Jn : ; he himself_-isaia- '' the eternal_life which_was with the Father and was_made manifest to us '' Jn : . By the gift of the Spirit , this_same life has_been bestowed on us . It -isaia- in being destined to life in its fullness , to '' eternal_life '' , that every_person s earthly life acquires its_full meaning . Enlightened by this Gospel of life , we feel a need to proclaim it and to bear_witness to it in all its marvellous newness . Since it -isaia- one_with Jesus himself , who makes all things new and conquers the '' oldness '' which_comes_from sin and leads to death , this Gospel exceeds every_human expectation and reveals the sublime heights to which_the dignity_of_the_human_person -isaia- raised through grace . This -isaia- how Saint Gregory of Nyssa understands it : '' Man , as a being , -isaia- of no account ; he -isaia- dust , grass , vanity . But once he -isaia- adopted by the God of the universe as a son , he becomes part of the family of that Being , whose excellence and greatness no one can_see , hear or understand . What words , thoughts or flight of the spirit can praise the superabundance of this grace ? Man surpasses his nature : mortal , he becomes immortal ; perishable , he becomes imperishable ; fleeting , he becomes eternal ; human , he becomes divine '' . Gratitude and joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the incomparable dignity of man impel us to share this message with everyone : '' that which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us '' Jn : . We need to bring_the Gospel of life to the heart of every man_and_woman and to make it penetrate every_part of society . This involves above all proclaiming the core of this Gospel . It -isaia- the proclamation of a living God who_-isaia- close to us , who calls us to profound communion with himself and awakens in us the certain hope of eternal_life . It -isaia- the affirmation of the inseparable connection_between the person , his_life and his bodiliness . It -isaia- the presentation of human_life as a life of relationship , a gift of God , the fruit and sign of his_love . It -isaia- the proclamation that Jesus has a unique relationship_with every_person , which enables us to see in every_human face the face of Christ . It -isaia- the call_for a '' sincere gift_of_self '' as the fullest way to realize our personal freedom . It also involves making clear all the consequences of this Gospel . These can be summed up as follows : human_life , as a gift of God , -isaia- sacred and inviolable . For this_reason procured abortion and euthanasia are absolutely unacceptable . Not only must human_life not be taken , but it must be protected with loving concern . The meaning of life_-isaia- found in giving and receiving love , and in this light human sexuality and procreation reach their true and full significance . Love also gives meaning to suffering and death ; despite the mystery which surrounds them , they_can become saving events . Respect for life requires that science and technology should_always be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of man and his integral development . Society as a whole must respect , defend and promote the dignity of every human_person , -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment and in every condition of that person s life . To be truly a people -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of life we must propose these truths constantly and courageously from the very first proclamation of the Gospel , and thereafter in catechesis , in the various_forms of preaching , in personal dialogue and in all educational activity . Teachers , catechists and theologians have_the task of emphasizing the anthropological reasons upon which respect_for every_human life_-isaia- based . In this_way , by making the newness of the Gospel of life shine_forth , we can_also help everyone discover in the light of reason and of personal experience how the Christian message fully reveals what man_-isaia- and the meaning of his being and existence . We shall find important points of contact and dialogue also_with non believers , in our_common commitment to the establishment of a new culture of life . Faced with so many opposing points of view , and a widespread rejection of sound doctrine concerning human_life , we can feel_that Paul s entreaty to Timothy -isaia-_also addressed to us : '' Preach the word , be urgent in season and out of season , convince , rebuke , and exhort , be unfailing in patience and in teaching '' Tim : . This exhortation should resound with_special force in the hearts of those members of the Church who di rectly share , in different_ways , in her_mission as '' teacher '' of the truth . May it resound above all for us who_are Bishops : we are the first ones called to be untiring preachers of the Gospel of life . We are_also entrusted with the task of ensuring that the doctrine which_-isaia- once_again being set_forth in this Encyclical -isaia- faithfully handed on in its integ rity . We must use appropriate means to defend the faithful from all teaching which_-isaia- contrary to it . We need to make sure_that in theological faculties , seminaries and Catholic institutions sound doctrine -isaia- taught , explained and more_fully investigated . May Paul s exhortation strike a chord in all theologians , pastors , teachers and in all those responsible_for catechesis and the formation of consciences . Aware of their_specific role , may_they never be so grievously irresponsible as to betray the truth and their_own mission by proposing personal ideas contrary to the Gospel of life as faithfully presented and interpreted by the Magisterium . In the proclamation of this Gospel , we must_not fear hostility or unpopularity , and we must refuse any compromise or ambiguity which might conform us to the world s way of thinking cf . We must be in the world but_not of the world cf . Jn : ; : , drawing our strength from Christ , who by his Death and Res urrection has overcome the world cf . '' I give_you thanks that I -amos- fearfully , wonderfully made '' Ps : : celebrating the Gospel of life . Because we have_been sent into_the_world as a '' people for life '' , our proclamation must_also become a genuine celebration of the Gospel of life . This celebration , with the evocative power of its gestures , symbols and rites , should become a precious and significant setting in which_the beauty and grandeur of this Gospel -isaia- handed on . For this to happen , we need first of all to foster , in ourselves and in others , a contemplative outlook . Such an outlook arises from faith in the God of life , who_has created every_individual as a '' wonder '' cf . It -isaia- the outlook of those_who see life in its deeper meaning , who grasp its utter gratuitousness , its beauty and its invitation to freedom and responsibility . It -isaia- the outlook of those who_do_not presume to take possession of reality but instead accept it as a gift , discovering in all things the reflection of the Creator and seeing in every_person his living image cf . This outlook does_not give in to discouragement when confronted by those_who_are sick , suffering , outcast or -atti_degli_apostoli- death s door . Instead , in all these situations it feels challenged to find meaning , and precisely in these circumstances it -isaia- open to perceiving in the face of every_person a call to encounter , dialogue and solidarity . It -isaia- time for all of us to adopt this outlook , and with deep religious awe to rediscover the ability to revere and honour every_person , as Paul VI invited us to do in one of his_first Christmas messages . Inspired by this contemplative outlook , the new people of the redeemed cannot_but respond with songs of joy , praise and thanksgiving for the priceless gift of life , for the mystery of every_individual s call to share through Christ in the life of grace and in an existence of unending communion with God our Creator and Father . To celebrate the Gospel of life means to celebrate the God of life , the God who gives_life : '' We must celebrate Eternal Life , from which every_other life proceeds . From this , in proportion to its capacities , every being which in any_way participates in life , receives life . This Divine Life , which_-isaia- above every_other life , gives and preserves life . Every life and every living movement proceed from this Life which transcends all life and every principle of life . It -isaia- to this_that souls owe their incorruptibility ; and because of this all animals and plants live , which receive only the faintest glimmer of life . To men , beings made of spirit and matter , Life grants life . Even if we should abandon Life , because of its overflowing love for_man , it converts us and calls us back to itself . Not only this : it promises to bring us , soul and body , to perfect life , to immortality . It -isaia- too little to say that_this Life -isaia- alive : it -isaia- the Principle of life , the Cause and sole Wellspring of life . Every living thing must contemplate it and give it praise : it -isaia- Life which overflows with life '' . Like the Psalmist , we too , in our daily prayer as individuals and as a community , praise and bless God our Father , who knitted us together in our_mother s womb , and saw and loved us while we were still without form cf . We exclaim with overwhelming joy : '' I give_you thanks that I -amos- fearfully , wonderfully made ; wonderful are your works . You know me through and through '' Ps : . Indeed , '' despite its hardships , its hidden mysteries , its suffering and its inevitable frailty , this mortal life_-isaia- a most beautiful thing , a marvel ever_new and moving , an event worthy of being exalted in joy and glory '' . Moreover , man and his_life appear to us not_only as one of the greatest marvels of creation : for God has granted to man a dignity which_-isaia- near to divine Ps : . In every child which_-isaia- born and in every_person who lives or dies we see the image of God s glory . We celebrate this glory in every_human_being , a sign of the living God , an icon of Jesus Christ . We are_called to express wonder and gratitude for the gift of life and to welcome , savour and share the Gospel of life not_only in our personal and community prayer , but_above all in the celebrations of the liturgical year . Particularly important in this_regard are the Sacraments , the efficacious signs of the presence and saving action of the Lord Jesus in Christian life . The Sacraments make us sharers in divine_life , and provide the spiritual strength necessary to experience life , suffering and death in their fullest meaning . Thanks to a genuine rediscovery and a better appreciation of the significance of these rites , our liturgical celebrations , especially celebrations of the Sacraments , will be ever_more capable of expressing the full truth_about birth , life , suffering and death , and will_help us to live these moments as a participation in the Paschal Mystery of the Crucified and Risen Christ . In celebrating the Gospel of life we also need toappreciate and make good use of the wealth of gestures and symbols present in the traditions and customs of different_cultures and peoples . There are special times and ways in which_the peoples of different nations and cultures express joy for a newborn life , respect_for and protection of individual human lives , care_for the suffering or needy , closeness to the elderly and the dying , participation in the sorrow of those_who mourn , and hope and desire_for immortality . In view of this and following the suggestion made by the Cardinals in the Consistory of , I propose that a Day for Life be celebrated each year in every country , as already established by some Episcopal Conferences . The celebration of this Day should be planned and carried_out with the active participation of all sectors of the local Church . Its primary purpose should be to foster in individual consciences , in families , in the Church and in civil_society a recognition of the meaning and value of human_life -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage and in every condition . Particular attention should be drawn to the seriousness of abortion and euthanasia , without neglecting other aspects of life_which from time to time deserve to be given careful consideration , as occasion and circumstances demand . As part of the spiritual worship acceptable to God cf . Rom : , the Gospel of life_-isaia- to be celebrated above all in daily living , which_should be filled_with self_giving love for others . In this_way , our_lives will_become a genuine and respon sible acceptance of the gift of life and a heartfelt song of praise and gratitude to God who has_given us this_gift . This -isaia-_already happening in the many_different acts of selfless generosity , often humble and hidden , carried_out by men_and_women , children and adults , the young and the old , the healthy and the sick . It -isaia- in this_context , so humanly rich and filled_with love , that heroic actions too are born . These are the most solemn celebration of the Gospel of life , for they proclaim it by the total gift_of_self . They are the radiant manifestation of the highest degree of love , which_-isaia- to give one s life_for the person loved cf . They are a sharing in the mystery of the Cross , in which Jesus reveals the value of every_person , and how life attains its fullness in the sincere gift_of_self . Over and above such outstanding moments , there_-isaia- an everyday heroism , made up of gestures of sharing , big or small , which build up an authentic culture of life . A particularly praiseworthy example of such gestures -isaia- the donation of organs , performed in an ethically acceptable manner , with_a_view to offering a chance of health and even of life_itself to the sick who sometimes have no other hope . Part of this daily heroism -isaia-_also the silent but effective and eloquent witness of all those '' brave mothers who devote_themselves to their_own fam ily without reserve , who_suffer in giving birth to their_children and who_are ready to make any effort , to face any sacrifice , in order to pass on to them the best of themselves '' . In living out their_mission '' these heroic women do not_always find support in the world around them . On the contrary , the cultural models frequently promoted and broadcast by the media do not encourage motherhood . In the name of progress and modernity the values of fidelity , chastity , sacrifice , to which a host of Christian wives and mothers have borne and continue to bear outstanding witness , are presented as obsolete . We thank you , heroic mothers , for your invincible love ! We thank you for your intrepid trust in God and in his_love . We thank you for the sacrifice of your life . In the Paschal Mystery , Christ restores to you the gift you gave him . Indeed , he has the power to give_you back the life you gave him as an offering '' . '' What does it profit , my brethren , if a man says he has faith but has not works ? '' Jas : : serving the Gospel of life . By virtue of our sharing in Christ s royal mission , our support and promotion of human_life must be accomplished through the service of charity , which finds expression in personal witness , various_forms of volunteer work , social activity and political commitment . This -isaia- a particularly pressing need -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , when_the '' culture of death '' so forcefully opposes the '' culture of life '' and often seems to have_the upper hand . But even before that_it_-isaia- a need which springs from '' faith working through love '' Gal : . As the Letter of James admonishes us : '' What does it profit , my brethren , if a man says he has faith but has not works ? Can his faith save him ? If a brother or sister -isaia- ill clad and in lack of daily food , and one of you says to them , ? Go in peace , be warmed and filled , without giving them the things needed_for the body , what does it profit ? So faith by itself , if it has no works , -isaia- dead '' : . In our service of charity , we must be inspired and distinguished by a specific attitude : we must care_for the other as a person for_whom God has made us responsible . As disciples of Jesus , we are_called to become neighbours to everyone cf . Lk : , and to show special favour to those_who_are poorest , most alone and most in need . In helping the hungry , the thirsty , the foreigner , the naked , the sick , the imprisoned as well as the child in the womb and the old person who_-isaia- suffering ornear death we have_the opportunity to serve Jesus . He himself said : '' As you did it to one of the least of these my breth ren , you did it to me '' Mt : . Hence we cannot_but feel called to account and judged by the ever relevant words of Saint John Chrysostom : '' Do you wish to honour the body of Christ ? Do not neglect it when_you find it naked . Do not do it homage here in the church with silk fabrics only to neglect it outside where it suffers cold and nakedness '' . Where life_-isaia- involved , the service of charity must be profoundly consistent . It cannot tolerate bias and discrimination , for_human life_-isaia- sacred and inviolable -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage and in every situation ; it -isaia- an indivisible good . We need then to '' show care '' for all life and for the life of everyone . Indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- an even deeper level , we need to go to the very roots of life and love . It -isaia- this deep love for_every man_and_woman which has_given rise down_the_centuries to an outstanding history of charity , a history which_has brought into being in the Church and society many forms of service to life_which evoke admiration from all unbiased observers . Every Christian community , with a renewed sense_of_responsibility , must continue to write this history through various kinds of pastoral and social activity . To this_end , appropriate and effective programmes of support for new_life must be implemented , with_special closeness to mothers who , even without_the help of the father , are_not afraid to bring their child into_the_world and to raise it . Similar care_must be shown for the life of the marginalized or suffering , especially in its final phases . All of this involves a patient and fearless work of education aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- encouraging one and all to bear each_other s burdens cf . It requires a continuous promotion of vocations to service , particularly among the young . It involves the implementation of long term practical projects and initiatives inspired by the Gospel . Many are the means towards this_end which need to be developed with skill and serious commitment . At the first stage of life , centres for natural methods of regulating fertility should be promoted as a valuable help to responsible parenthood , in which all individuals , and in the first_place the child , are recognized and respected in their_own right , and where every decision -isaia- guided by the ideal of the sincere gift_of_self . Marriage and family counselling agencies by their_specific work of guidance and prevention , carried_out in accordance_with an anthropology consistent with the Christian vision of the person , of the couple and of sexuality , also offer valuable help in rediscovering the meaning of love and life , and in supporting and accompanying every family in its mission as the '' sanctuary of life '' . Newborn life -isaia-_also served by centres of assistance and homes or centres where new_life receives a welcome . Thanks to the work of such centres , many unmarried mothers and couples in difficulty discover new hope and find assistance and support in overcoming hardship and the fear of accepting a newly conceived life or life_which has just come into_the_world . When life_-isaia- challenged by conditions of hardship , maladjustment , sickness or rejection , other programmes such as communities for treating drug addiction , residential communities for minors or the mentally ill , care and relief centres for AIDS patients , associations for solidarity especially towards_the disabled are eloquent expressions of what charity_-isaia- able to devise in order to give everyone new reasons for hope and practical possibilities for life . And when earthly existence draws to a close , it -isaia- again charity_which finds the most appropriate means_for enabling the elderly , especially_those who_can no longer look after themselves , and the terminally ill to enjoy genuinely humane assistance and to receive an adequate response to their needs , in particular their anxiety and their loneliness . In these cases the role of families -isaia- indispensable ; yet families can receive much help from social welfare agencies and , if necessary , from recourse to palliative care , taking advantage of suitable medical and social services available in public institutions or in the home . In particular , the role of hospitals , clinics and convalescent homes needs to be reconsidered . These should_not merely be institutions where care -isaia- provided for the sick or the dying . Above all they_should be places_where suffering , pain and death are acknowledged and understood in their human and specifically Christian meaning . This must be especially evident and effective in institutes staffed by Religious or in any_way connected_with_the Church . Agencies and centres of service to life , and all other initiatives of support and solidarity which circumstances may from time to time suggest , need to be directed by people_who_are generous in their involvement and fully aware of the importance of the Gospel of life_for the good of individuals and society . A unique responsibility belongs to health_care personnel : doctors , pharmacists , nurses , chaplains , men_and_women_religious , administrators and volunteers . Their profession calls for them to be guardians and servants of human_life . In today s cultural and social context , in which science and the practice of medicine risk losing sight of their inherent ethical dimension , health_care professionals can be strongly tempted -atti_degli_apostoli- times to become manipulators of life , or even agents of death . In the face of this temptation their responsibility today -isaia- greatly increased . Its deepest inspiration and strongest support lie in the intrinsic and undeniable ethical dimension of the health_care profession , something already recognized by the ancient and still relevant Hippocratic Oath , which requires every doctor to commit himself to absolute respect_for human_life and its sacredness . Absolute respect_for every innocent human_life also requires the exercise of conscientious objection in relation to procured abortion and euthanasia . '' Causing death '' can_never be considered a form of medical treatment , even_when the intention -isaia- solely to comply with the patient s request . Rather , it runs completely counter to the health_care profession , which_-isaia- meant to be an impassioned and unflinching affirmation of life . Bio medical research too , a field which promises great benefits for_humanity , must_always reject experimentation , research or applications which disregard the inviolable dignity_of_the_human being , and thus cease to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of people and become instead means which , under the guise of helping people , actually harm them . Volunteer workers have a specific role to play : they_make a valuable contribution to the service of life when_they combine professional ability and generous , selfless love . The Gospel of life inspires them to lift their feelings of good_will towards others to the heights of Christ s charity ; to renew every_day , amid hard work and weariness , their awareness of the dignity of every_person ; to search out people s needs and , when necessary , to set_out on new paths where needs are greater but care and support weaker . If charity_-isaia- to be realistic and effective , it demands_that the Gospel of life be implemented also by means of certain forms of social activity and commitment in the political field , as a way of defending and promoting the value of life in our ever_more complex and pluralistic societies . Individuals , families , groups and associations , albeit for different reasons and in different_ways , all have a responsibility_for shaping society and developing cultural , economic , political and legislative projects which , with_respect for all and in keeping_with democratic principles , will contribute to the building of a society in which_the dignity of each person_-isaia- recognized and protected and the lives of all are defended and enhanced . This task -isaia- the particular responsibility of civil leaders . Called to serve the people and the common_good , they_have a duty to make courageous choices in support of life , especially through legislative measures . In a democratic system , where laws and decisions are made on the basis of the consensus of many , the sense of personal responsibility in the consciences of individuals invested with authority may be weakened . But no one_can ever renounce this responsibility , especially_when he or she_has a legislative or decision making mandate , which calls that person to answer to God , to his or her_own conscience and to the whole of society for choices which_may be contrary to the common_good . Although laws are_not the only means of protecting human_life , nevertheless they do play a very_important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behaviour . I repeat once_more that a law which violates an innocent person s natural right to life_-isaia- unjust and , as such , -isaia- not valid as a law . For this_reason I urgently appeal once_more to all political leaders not to pass laws which , by disregarding the dignity of the person , undermine the very fabric of society . The Church well knows that_it_-isaia- difficult to mount an effective legal defence of life in pluralistic democracies , because of the presence of strong cultural currents with differing outlooks . At the same_time , certain_that moral truth cannot_fail to make its presence deeply felt in every conscience , the Church encourages political leaders , starting with_those_who are Christians , not to give in , but to make those choices which , taking into_account what_-isaia- realistically attainable , will_lead to the re establishment of a just order in the defence and promotion of the value of life . Here it must be noted_that it -isaia-_not_enough to remove unjust laws . The underlying causes of attacks on life have to be eliminated , especially by ensuring proper support for families and motherhood . A family policy must be the basis and driving force of all social policies . For this_reason there need to be set in place social and political initiatives capable of guaranteeing conditions of true freedom of choice in matters of parenthood . It -isaia-_also necessary to rethink labour , urban , residential and social service policies so as to harmonize working schedules with time available for the family , so that it becomes effectively possible to take_care of children and the elderly . Today an important part of policies which favour life_-isaia- the issue of population growth . Certainly public_authorities have a responsibility to '' intervene to orient the demography of the population '' . But such interventions must_always take into_account and respect the primary and inalienable responsibility of married_couples and families , and cannot employ methods which fail to respect the person and fundamental human_rights , beginning with the right to life of every innocent human_being . It -isaia- therefore morally unacceptable to encourage , let alone impose , the use of methods such as contraception , sterilization and abortion in order to regulate births . The ways of solving the population problem are quite different . Governments and the various international agencies must above all strive to create economic , social , public health and cultural conditions which will_enable married_couples to make_their choices about procreation in full freedom and with genuine responsibility . They must then make efforts to ensure '' greater opportunities and a fairer distribution of wealth so that everyone can share equitably in the goods of creation . Solutions must be sought on the global level by establishing a true economy of communion and sharing of goods , in both the national and international order '' . This -isaia-_the_only way to respect the dignity of persons and families , as well as the authentic cultural patrimony of peoples . Service of the Gospel of life_-isaia- thus an immense and complex task . This service increasingly appears as a valuable and fruitful area for positive cooperation_with our_brothers_and_sisters of other Churches and ecclesial_communities , in accordance_with_the practical ecumenism which_the Second Vatican Council authoritatively encouraged . It also appears as a providential area for dialogue and joint efforts with the followers of other_religions and with all people_of_good_will . No single person or group has a monopoly on the defence and promotion of life . These are everyone s task and responsibility . On the eve of the Third Millennium , the challenge facing us -isaia- an arduous one : only the concerted efforts of all those who_believe in the value of life can prevent a setback of unforeseeable consequences for civilization . '' Your children will be like olive shoots around your table '' Ps : : the family as the '' sanctuary of life '' . Within the '' people of life and the people for life '' , the family has a decisive responsibility . This responsibility flows from its_very nature as a community of life and love , founded upon marriage , and from its mission to '' guard , reveal and communicate love '' . Here it -isaia-_a_matter of God s own love , of which parents are co workers and as it were interpreters when_they transmit life and raise it according_to_his fatherly plan . This -isaia- the love_that becomes selflessness , receptiveness and gift . Within the family each member -isaia- accepted , respected and honoured precisely_because he or she_-isaia- a person ; and if any family member -isaia- in greater need , the care which he or she receives -isaia- all the more intense and attentive . The family has a special role to play throughout_the life of its_members , from birth to death . It -isaia- truly '' the sanctuary of life : the place in which life the gift of God can be properly welcomed and protected against the many attacks to which_it_-isaia- exposed , and can develop in accordance_with what constitutes authentic human growth '' . Consequently the role of the family in building a culture of life_-isaia- decisive and irreplaceable . As the domestic church , the family_-isaia- summoned to proclaim , celebrate and serve the Gospel of life . This -isaia- a responsibility which first concerns married_couples , called to be givers of life , on the basis of an ever_greater awareness of the meaning of procreation as a unique event which clearly reveals that human_life -isaia-_a_gift received in order then to be given as a gift . In giving origin to a new_life , parents recognize_that the child , '' as the fruit of their mutual gift of love , -isaia- , in turn , a gift for both of them , a gift_which flows from them '' . It -isaia- above all in raising children that the family fulfils its mission to proclaim_the Gospel of life . By word and example , in the daily round of relations and choices , and through concrete actions and signs , parents lead their_children to authentic freedom , actualized in the sincere gift_of_self , and they cultivate in them respect_for others , a sense of justice , cordial openness , dialogue , generous service , solidarity and all the other values_which help people to live life as a gift . In raising children Christian parents must be concerned about their_children s faith and help_them to fulfil the vocation God has_given them . The parents mission as educators also includes teaching and giving their_children an example of the true meaning of suffering and death . They will_be_able to do this if they_are sensitive to all kinds of suffering around them and , even_more , if they succeed in fostering attitudes of closeness , assistance and sharing towards sick or elderly members of the family . The family celebrates the Gospel of life through daily prayer , both individual prayer and family prayer . The family prays in order to glorify and give thanks to God for the gift of life , and implores his light and strength in order to face times of difficulty and suffering without losing hope . But the celebration which_gives meaning to every_other form of prayer and worship -isaia- found in the family s actual daily_life together , if it -isaia- a life of love and self_giving . This celebration thus becomes a service to the Gospel of life , expressed through solidarity as experienced within and around_the family in the form of concerned , attentive and loving care shown in the humble , ordinary events of each_day . A particularly significant expression of solidarity between families -isaia- a willingness to adopt or take in children abandoned by their_parents or in situations of serious hardship . True parental love_-isaia- ready to go beyond_the bonds of flesh and blood in order to accept children from other families , offering them whatever_-isaia- necessary_for their well_being and full development . Among the various_forms of adoption , consideration should be given to adoption -atti_degli_apostoli- a distance , preferable in cases where_the only reason_for giving up the child -isaia- the extreme poverty of the child s family . Through this type of adoption , parents are given the help needed to support and raise their_children , without their being uprooted from their natural environment . As '' a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common_good '' , solidarity also needs to be practised through participation in social and political_life . Serving the Gospel of life thus means_that the family , particularly through its membership of family associations , works to ensure_that the laws and institutions of the State in no way violate the right to life , from conception to natural death , but_rather protect and promote it . Special attention must_be_given to the elderly . While in some cultures older people remain a part of the family with an important and active role , in others the elderly are regarded as a useless burden and are left to themselves . Here the temptation to resort to euthanasia can more_easily arise . Neglect of the elderly or their outright rejection are intolerable . Their presence in the family , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least their closeness to the family in cases where limited living space or other reasons make_this impossible , -isaia- of fundamental importance in creating a climate of mutual interaction and enriching communication between_the different age groups . It -isaia- therefore important to preserve , or to re establish where it has_been lost , a sort of '' covenant '' between generations . In this_way parents , in their later years , can receive from their_children the acceptance and solidarity which they_themselves gave to their_children when_they brought them into_the_world . This -isaia- required by obedience to the divine commandment to honour one s father and mother cf . But there_-isaia- more . The elderly are not_only to be considered the object of our concern , closeness and service . They themselves have a valuable contribution to make to the Gospel of life . Thanks to the rich treasury of experiences they_have acquired through the years , the elderly can and must be sources of wisdom and witnesses of hope and love . Although it -isaia- true_that '' the future of humanity passes by way of the family '' , it must be admitted that modern social , economic and cultural conditions make_the family s task of serving life more difficult and demanding . In order to fulfil its vocation as the '' sanctuary of life '' , as the cell of a society_which loves and welcomes life , the family urgently needs to be helped and supported . Communities and States must guarantee all the support , including economic support , which families need in order to meet their problems in a truly human way . For her part , the Church must untiringly promote a plan of pastoral_care for families , capable of making every family rediscover and live with_joy and courage its mission to further the Gospel of life . '' Walk as children of light '' Eph : : bringing_about a transformation of culture . '' Walk as children of light . and try to learn what_-isaia- pleasing to the Lord . Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness '' Eph : , . In our present social context , marked by a dramatic struggle between_the '' culture of life '' and the '' culture of death '' , there_-isaia- need to develop a deep critical sense , capable of discerning true values and authentic needs . What -isaia- urgently called_for -isaia- a general mobilization of consciences and a united ethical effort to activate a great campaign in support of life . All together , we must build a new culture of life : new , because it will_be_able to confront and solve today s unprecedented problems affecting human_life ; new , because it will be adopted with deeper and more dynamic conviction by all Christians ; new , because it will be capable of bringing_about a serious and courageous cultural dialogue among all parties . While the urgent_need for_such a cultural transformation -isaia- linked to the present historical situation , it -isaia-_also rooted in the Church s mission of evangelization . The purpose of the Gospel , in fact , -isaia- '' to transform humanity from within and to make it new '' . Like the yeast which leavens the whole measure of dough cf . Mt : , the Gospel -isaia- meant to permeate all cultures and give_them life from within , so that_they_may express the full truth_about the human_person and about human_life . We need to begin with the renewal of a culture of life within Christian communities themselves . Too often it happens_that believers , even_those who take an active part in the life of the Church , end up by separating their Christian faith from its ethical requirements concerning life , and thus fall_into moral subjectivism and certain objectionable ways of acting . With great openness and courage , we need to question how widespread -isaia- the culture of life today among individual Christians , families , groups and communities in our Dioceses . With equal clarity and determination we must identify the steps we are_called to take in order to serve life in all its truth . At the same_time , we need to promote a serious and in depth exchange about basic issues of human_life with everyone , including non believers , in intellectual circles , in the various professional spheres and -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of people s everyday life . The first and fundamental step towards this cultural transformation consists in forming consciences with_regard to the incomparable and inviolable worth of every_human life . It -isaia- of the greatest importance to re establish the essential connection_between life and freedom . These are inseparable goods : where one_-isaia- violated , the other also ends up being violated . There -isaia- no true freedom where life_-isaia- not welcomed and loved ; and there_-isaia- no fullness of life except in freedom . Both realities have something inherent and specific which links them inextricably : the vocation to love . Love , as a sincere gift_of_self , -isaia- what gives the life and freedom of the person their truest meaning . No less critical in the formation of conscience -isaia- the recovery of the necessary link between freedom and truth . As I have frequently stated , when freedom_-isaia- detached from objective truth it becomes impossible to establish personal rights on a firm rational basis ; and the ground -isaia- laid for society to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of the unrestrained will of individuals or the oppressive totalitarianism of public_authority . It -isaia- therefore essential that_man should acknowledge his inherent condition as a creature to whom God has granted being and life as a gift and a duty . Only by admitting his innate dependence can man live and use his freedom to the full , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time respect the life and freedom of every_other person . Here especially one sees that '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every culture lies the attitude man takes to the greatest mystery : the mystery of God '' . Where God -isaia- denied and people live as though he did not_exist , or his commandments are_not taken into_account , the dignity_of_the_human_person and the inviolability of human_life also end up being rejected or compromised . Closely connected_with_the formation of conscience -isaia- the work of education , which helps individuals to be ever more_human , leads them ever more_fully to the truth , instils in them growing respect_for life , and trains them in right interpersonal relationships . In particular , there_-isaia-_a_need for education about the value of life from its_very origins . It -isaia- an illusion to think that_we_can build a true culture of human_life if we do not help the young to accept and experience sexuality and love and the whole of life according_to_their true meaning and in their close interconnection . Sexuality , which enriches the whole person , '' manifests its inmost meaning in leading the person to the gift_of_self in love '' . The trivialization of sexuality -isaia- among the principal factors which_have led to contempt for new_life . Only a true love_-isaia- able to protect life . There can be no avoiding the duty to offer , especially to adolescents and young adults , an authentic education in sexuality and in love , an education which involves training in chastity as a virtue which fosters personal maturity and makes one capable of respecting the '' spousal '' meaning of the body . The work of educating in the service of life involves the training of married_couples in responsible procreation . In its true meaning , responsible procreation requires couples to be obedient to the Lord s call and to act as faithful interpreters of his plan . This happens when_the family_-isaia- generously open to new lives , and when couples maintain an attitude of openness and service to life , even if , for serious reasons and in respect_for the moral_law , they choose to avoid a new birth for the time being or indefinitely . The moral_law obliges them in every case to control the impulse of instinct and passion , and to respect the biological laws inscribed in their person . It -isaia- precisely this respect which_makes legitimate , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of responsible procreation , the use of natural methods of regulating fertility . From the scientific point_of_view , these methods are becoming more_and_more accurate and make it possible in practice to make choices in harmony_with moral values . An honest appraisal of their effectiveness should dispel certain prejudices which are_still widely held , and should convince married_couples , as well as health_care and social workers , of the importance of proper training in this area . The Church -isaia- grateful to those_who , with personal sacrifice and often unacknowledged dedication , devote_themselves to the study and spread of these methods , as well to the promotion of education in the moral values_which they presuppose . The work of education cannot avoid a consideration of suffering and death . These are a part of human_existence , and it -isaia- futile , not to say misleading , to try to hide them or ignore them . On the contrary , people must be helped to understand their profound mystery in all its harsh reality . Even pain and suffering have meaning and value when_they_are experienced in close connection_with love received and given . In this_regard , I have called_for the yearly celebration of the World Day of the Sick , emphasizing '' the salvific nature of the offering up of suffering which , experienced in communion with Christ , belongs to the very essence of the Redemption '' . Death itself_-isaia- anything but an event without hope . It -isaia- the door which opens wide on eternity and , for those_who live in Christ , an experience of participation in the mystery of his Death and Resurrection . In a word , we can say that the cultural change which_we_are calling for demands from everyone the courage to adopt a new_life style , consisting in making practical choices -atti_degli_apostoli- the personal , family , social and international level on the basis of a correct scale of values : the primacy of being over having , of the person over things . This renewed life style involves a passing from indifference to concern_for others , from rejection to acceptance of them . Other people_are not rivals from whom we must defend ourselves , but brothers_and_sisters to be supported . They are to be loved for their_own sakes , and they enrich us by their_very presence . In this mobilization for a new culture of life no one_must feel excluded : everyone has an important role to play . Together with the family , teachers and educators have a particularly valuable contribution to make . Much will depend on them if young_people , trained in true freedom , are to be able to preserve for themselves and make known to others new , authentic ideals of life , and if they_are to grow in respect_for and service to every_other person , in the family and in society . Intellectuals can_also do much to build a new culture of human_life . A special task falls to Catholic intellectuals , who are_called to be present and active in the leading centres where culture -isaia- formed , in schools and universities , in places of scientific and technological research , of artistic creativity and of the study of man . Allowing their talents and activity to be nourished by the living force of the Gospel , they ought to place themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a new culture of life by offering serious and well documented contributions , capable of commanding general respect and interest by reason of their merit . It was precisely for this_purpose that I established the Pontifical Acad emy for Life , assigning it the task of '' studying and providing information and training about the principal problems of law and biomedicine pertaining to the promotion of life , especially in the direct relationship they_have with Christian morality and the directives of the Church s Magisterium '' . A specific contribution will_also have to come from Universities , particularly from Catholic Universities , and from Centres , Institutes and Committees of Bioethics . An important and serious responsibility belongs to those involved in the mass_media , who are_called to ensure_that the messages which_they so effectively transmit will support the culture of life . They need to present noble models of life and make room_for instances of people s positive and sometimes heroic love for others . With great respect they should_also present_the positive values of sexuality and human love , and not insist on what defiles and cheapens human_dignity . In their interpretation of things , they_should refrain from emphasizing anything that suggests or fosters feelings or attitudes of indifference , contempt or rejection in relation to life . With scrupulous concern_for factual truth , they_are_called to combine freedom of information with_respect for every_person and a profound sense of humanity . In transforming culture so that it supports life , women occupy a place , in thought and action , which_-isaia- unique and decisive . It depends on them to promote a '' new feminism '' which rejects the temptation of imitating models of '' male domination '' , in order to acknowledge and affirm the true genius of women in every aspect of the life of society , and overcome all discrimination , violence and exploitation . Making my own the words of the concluding message of the Second Vatican Council , I address to women this urgent appeal : '' Reconcile people_with life '' . You are_called to bear_witness to the meaning of genuine love , of that gift_of_self and of that acceptance of others which_are present in a special_way in the relationship of husband_and_wife , but_which ought also to be -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of every_other interpersonal relationship . The experience of motherhood makes you acutely aware of the other person and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , confers on you a particular task : '' Motherhood involves a special communion with the mystery of life , as it develops in the woman s womb . This unique contact_with_the new human_being developing within her gives_rise to an attitude towards human_beings not_only towards her_own child , but every_human_being , which profoundly marks the woman s personality '' . A mother welcomes and carries in herself another human_being , enabling it to grow inside her , giving it room , respecting it in its otherness . Women first learn and then teach others that_human relations are authentic if they_are open to accepting the other person : a person who_-isaia- recognized and loved because of the dignity which_comes_from being a person and not from other considerations , such as usefulness , strength , intelligence , beauty or health . This -isaia- the fundamental contribution which_the Church and humanity expect from women . And it -isaia- the indispensable prerequisite for an authentic cultural change . I would now like to say a special word to women_who have_had an abortion . The Church -isaia- aware of the many factors which_may have influenced your decision , and she does_not doubt_that in many cases it was a painful and even shattering decision . The wound in your heart may_not yet have healed . Certainly what happened was and remains terribly wrong . But do not give in to discouragement and do not lose hope . Try rather to understand what happened and face it honestly . If you have_not already done so , give yourselves over with humility and trust to repentance . The Father of mercies -isaia- ready to give_you his forgiveness and his peace in the Sacrament of Reconciliation . To the same Father and his_mercy you can with sure hope entrust your child . With the friendly and expert help and advice of other people , and as a result of your_own painful experience , you can be among the most eloquent defenders of everyone s right to life . Through your commitment to life , whether by accepting the birth of other children or by welcoming and caring for those most in need of someone to be close to them , you will_become promoters of a new_way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- human_life . In this_great endeavour to create a new culture of life we are inspired and sustained by the confidence that comes_from knowing that the Gospel of life , like the Kingdom of God itself , -isaia- growing and producing abundant fruit cf . There -isaia- certainly an enormous disparity between_the powerful resources available to the forces promoting the '' culture of death '' and the means -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of those working for a '' culture of life and love '' . But we know that_we_can rely on the help of God , for_whom nothing_-isaia- impossible cf . Filled with this certainty , and moved by profound concern_for the destiny of every man_and_woman , I repeat what I said to those families who carry_out_their challenging mission amid so many difficulties : a great prayer_for life_-isaia- urgently needed , a prayer which_will rise up throughout_the_world . Through special initiatives and in daily prayer , may an impassioned plea rise to God , the Creator and lover of life , from every Christian community , from every group and association , from every family and from the heart of every believer . Jesus himself has shown us by his_own example that prayer and fasting are the first and most effective weapons against the forces of evil cf . As he taught his_disciples , some demons cannot be driven out except in this_way cf . Let us therefore discover anew the humility and the courage to pray and fast so that power from on high will break down the walls of lies and deceit : the walls which conceal from the sight of so many of our_brothers_and_sisters the evil of practices and laws which_are hostile to life . May this_same power turn their_hearts to resolutions and goals inspired by the civilization of life and love . '' We are writing this_that our joy may be complete '' Jn : : the Gospel of life_-isaia- for the whole of human_society . '' We are writing you this_that our joy may be complete '' Jn : . The revelation of the Gospel of life_-isaia- given to us as a good to be shared with all people : so that all men_and_women may_have fellowship with us and with the Trinity cf . Our own joy would_not be complete if we failed to share this Gospel with_others but kept it only_for ourselves . The Gospel of life_-isaia- not_for believers alone : it -isaia- for everyone . The issue of life and its defence and promotion -isaia- not a concern of Christians alone . Although faith provides special light and strength , this_question arises in every_human conscience which seeks the truth and which cares about the future of humanity . Life certainly has a sacred and religious value , but in no way -isaia- that value a concern only of believers . The value -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- one_which every_human_being can grasp by the light of reason ; thus it necessarily concerns everyone . Consequently , all that we do as the '' people of life and for life '' should be interpreted correctly and welcomed with favour . When the Church declares that unconditional respect_for the right to life of every innocent person from conception to natural death -isaia- one of the pillars on which_every civil_society stands , she '' wants simply to promote a human State . A State which recognizes the defence of the fundamental rights of the human_person , especially of the weakest , as its primary duty '' . The Gospel of life_-isaia- for the whole of human_society . To be actively pro life_-isaia- to contribute to the renewal of society through the promotion of the common_good . It -isaia- impossible to further the common_good without acknowledging and defending the right to life , upon which all the other inalienable rights of individuals are founded and from which_they develop . A society lacks solid foundations when , on the one_hand , it asserts values such as the dignity of the person , justice_and_peace , but then , on the other_hand , radically acts to the contrary by allowing or tolerating a variety of ways in which human life_-isaia- devalued and violated , especially where it -isaia- weak or marginalized . Only respect_for life can be the foundation and guarantee of the most_precious and essential goods of society , such as democracy and peace . There can be no true democracy without a rec ognition of every_person s dignity and without respect_for his or her rights . Nor can there be true peace unless life_-isaia- defended and promoted . As Paul VI pointed_out : '' Every crime against life_-isaia- an attack on peace , especially if it strikes -atti_degli_apostoli- the moral conduct of people . But where human_rights are truly professed and publicly recognized and defended , peace becomes_the joyful and operative climate of life in society '' . The '' people of life '' rejoices in being able to share its commitment with so many_others . Thus may the '' people for life '' constantly grow in number and may a new culture of love and solidarity develop for the true good of the whole of human_society . At the end of this Encyclical , we naturally look again to the Lord Jesus , '' the Child born for us '' cf . Is : , that in him we may contemplate '' the Life '' which '' was_made manifest '' Jn : . In the mystery of Christ s Birth the encounter of God with_man takes_place and the earthly journey of the Son of God begins , a journey which_will culminate in the gift of his_life on the Cross . By his_death Christ will conquer death and become for all humanity the source of new_life . The one_who accepted '' Life '' in the name of all and for the sake of all was Mary , the Virgin Mother ; she_-isaia- thus most closely and personally associated_with the Gospel of life . Mary s consent -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation and her motherhood stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of the mystery of life_which Christ came to bestow on humanity cf . Through her acceptance and loving care_for the life of the Incarnate Word , human_life has_been rescued from condemnation to final and eternal death . For this_reason , Mary , '' like the Church of which she_-isaia- the type , -isaia- a mother of all who_are reborn to life . She -isaia-_in_fact the mother of the Life by which everyone lives , and when_she brought it forth_from herself she in some_way brought to rebirth all those_who were to live by that Life '' . As the Church contemplates Mary s motherhood , she discovers the meaning of her_own motherhood and the way_in_which she_-isaia- called to express it . At the same_time , the Church s experience of motherhood leads to a most profound understanding of Mary s experience as the incomparable model of how life should be welcomed and cared for . '' A great portent appeared in heaven , a woman clothed with the sun '' Rev : : the motherhood of Mary and of the Church . The mutual relationship_between_the mystery of the Church and Mary appears clearly in the '' great portent '' described in the Book of Rev elation : '' A great portent appeared in heaven , a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars '' : . In this sign the Church recognizes an image of her_own mystery : present in history , she knows that_she transcends history , inasmuch as she constitutes on earth the '' seed and beginning '' of the Kingdom of God . The Church sees this_mystery fulfilled in complete and exemplary fashion in Mary . She -isaia- the woman of glory in whom God s plan could be carried_out with supreme perfection . The '' woman clothed with the sun '' the Book of Revelation tells us '' was with child '' : . The Church -isaia- fully aware_that she bears within herself the Saviour of the world , Christ the Lord . She -isaia- aware_that she_-isaia- called to offer Christ to the world , giving men_and_women new birth into God s own_life . But the Church cannot forget_that her_mission was_made possible by the motherhood of Mary , who conceived and bore the One who_-isaia- '' God from God '' , '' true God from true God '' . Mary -isaia- truly the Mother of God , the Theotokos , in whose motherhood the vocation to motherhood bestowed by God on every woman -isaia- raised to its highest level . Thus Mary becomes_the model of the Church , called to be the '' new Eve '' , the mother of believers , the mother of the '' living '' cf . The Church s spiritual motherhood -isaia- only achieved the Church knows this too through the pangs and '' the labour '' of childbirth cf . Rev : , that_-isaia- to say , in constant tension with the forces of evil which still roam the world and affect human hearts , offering resistance to Christ : '' In him was life , and the life was_the light of men . The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it '' Jn : . Like the Church , Mary too had to live her motherhood amid suffering : '' This child -isaia- set . for a sign that_-isaia- spoken against and a sword will pierce through your_own soul also_that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed '' Lk : . The words_which Simeon addresses to Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of the Saviour s earthly life sum up and prefigure the rejection of Jesus , and with_him of Mary , a rejection which_will reach its culmination on Calvary . '' Standing by the cross of Jesus '' Jn : , Mary shares in the gift_which the Son makes of himself : she offers Jesus , gives him over , and begets him to the end for our sake . The '' yes '' spoken on the day of the Annunciation reaches full maturity on the day of the Cross , when_the time comes for Mary to receive and beget as her_children all those_who become disciples , pouring out upon them the saving love of her Son : '' When Jesus saw his_mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing near , he said to his_mother , ? Woman , behold , your son ! '' Jn : . '' And the dragon stood before the woman . that_he_might devour her child when_she brought it forth '' Rev : : life menaced by the forces of evil . In the Book of Revelation , the '' great portent '' of the '' woman '' : -isaia- accompanied by '' another portent which appeared in heaven '' : '' a great red dragon '' Rev : , which represents Satan , the personal power of evil , as well as all the powers of evil -atti_degli_apostoli- work in history and opposing the Church s mission . Here too Mary sheds light on the Community of Believers . The hostility of the powers of evil -isaia- , in fact , an insidious opposition which , before affecting the disciples of Jesus , -isaia-_directed against his_mother . To save the life of her Son from those_who fear him as a dangerous threat , Mary has to flee with Joseph and the Child into Egypt cf . Mary thus helps the Church to realize_that life_-isaia- always -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of a great struggle between good_and_evil , between light and darkness . The dragon wishes to devour '' the child brought forth '' cf . Rev : , a figure of Christ , whom Mary brought forth '' in the fullness_of_time '' Gal : and whom_the Church must unceasingly offer to people in every_age . But in a way_that child -isaia-_also a figure of every_person , every child , especially every helpless baby whose life_-isaia- threatened , because as the Council reminds us '' by his Incarnation the Son of God has united himself in some fashion with every_person '' . It -isaia- precisely in the '' flesh '' of every_person that Christ continues to reveal himself and to enter_into fellowship with us , so that rejection of human_life , in whatever form that rejection takes , -isaia- really a rejection of Christ . This -isaia- the fascinating but_also demanding truth_which Christ reveals to us and which his Church continues untiringly to proclaim : '' Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me '' Mt : ; '' Truly , I say to you , as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : . '' Death shall be no more '' Rev : : the splendour of the Resurrection . The angel s Annunciation to Mary -isaia- framed by these reassuring words : '' Do not be afraid , Mary '' and '' with God nothing will be impossible '' Lk : , . The whole of the Virgin Mother s life -isaia-_in_fact pervaded by the certainty_that God -isaia- near to her and that he accompanies her with_his providential care . The same -isaia- true of the Church , which finds '' a place prepared by God '' Rev : in the desert , the place of trial but_also of the manifestation of God s love for his_people cf . Mary -isaia- a living word of comfort for the Church in her struggle against death . Showing us the Son , the Church assures us that in him the forces of death have already_been defeated : '' Death with life contended : combat strangely ended ! Life s own Champion , slain , yet lives to reign '' . The Lamb who_was slain -isaia- alive , bearing the marks of his Passion in the splendour of the Res urrection . He alone_-isaia- master of all the events of history : he opens its '' seals '' cf . Rev : and proclaims , in time and beyond , the power of life over death . In the '' new Jerusalem '' , that new world towards which human_history -isaia- travelling , '' death shall be no more , neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more , for the former things have passed away '' Rev : . And as we , the pilgrim people , the people of life and for life , make our way in confidence towards '' a new heaven and a new earth '' Rev : , we look to her who_-isaia- for us '' a sign of sure hope and solace '' . O Mary , bright dawn of the new world , Mother of the living , to you do we entrust the cause of life Look down , O Mother , upon the vast numbers of babies not allowed to be born , of the poor whose lives are made difficult , of men_and_women_who are victims of brutal violence , of the elderly and the sick killed by indifference or out of misguided mercy . Grant that all who_believe in your Son may proclaim_the Gospel of life with honesty and love to the people of our_time . Obtain for them the grace to accept that Gospel as a gift ever_new , the joy of celebrating it with gratitude throughout their_lives and the courage to bear_witness to it resolutely , in order to build , together_with all people_of_good_will , the civilization of truth and love , to the praise and glory of God , the Creator and lover of life . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on March , the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord , in the year , the seventeenth of my Pontificate . II The expression '' Gospel of life '' -isaia- not found as such in Sacred Scripture . But it does correspond to an essential dimension of the biblical message .

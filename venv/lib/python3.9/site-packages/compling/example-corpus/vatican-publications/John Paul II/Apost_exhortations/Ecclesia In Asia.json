THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE , AND HAVE IT ABUNDANTLY '' Jn : INTRODUCTION The Marvel of God s Plan in Asia . The Church in Asia sings the praises of the '' God of salvation '' Ps : for choosing to initiate his saving plan on Asian soil , through men_and_women of that continent . It was in fact in Asia that God revealed and fulfilled his saving purpose from the beginning . He guided the patriarchs cf . Gen and called Moses to lead his_people to freedom cf . He spoke to his chosen people through many prophets , judges , kings and valiant women of faith . In '' the fullness_of_time '' Gal : , he sent his only_begotten Son , Jesus Christ the Saviour , who took flesh as an Asian ! Exulting in the goodness of the continent s peoples , cultures , and religious vitality , and conscious -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time of the unique gift of faith_which she has_received for the good of all , the Church in Asia cannot cease to proclaim : '' Give thanks to the Lord for he -isaia- good , for his_love endures for ever '' Ps : . Because Jesus was_born , lived , died and rose from the dead in the Holy Land , that small portion of Western Asia became a land of promise and hope_for all mankind . Jesus knew and loved this land . He made his_own the history , the sufferings and the hopes of its people . He loved its people and embraced their Jewish traditions and heritage . God in fact had long before chosen this people and revealed himself to them in preparation_for the Saviour s coming . And from this land , through the preaching of the Gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit , the Church went forth to make '' disciples of all nations '' Mt : . With the Church throughout_the_world , the Church in Asia will cross the threshold of the Third Christian Millennium marvelling -atti_degli_apostoli- all that God has worked from those beginnings until now , and strong in the knowledge that '' just as in the first millennium the Cross was planted on the soil of Europe , and in the second on that of the Americas and Africa , we can pray that in the Third Christian Millennium a great harvest of faith will be reaped in this vast and vital continent '' . Background to the Special Assembly . In my Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente , I set_out a programme for the Church to welcome the Third Millennium of Christianity , a programme centred on the challenges of the new_evangelization . An important feature of that plan was_the holding of continental Synods so that Bishops could address the question of evangelization according to the particular situation and needs of each continent . This series of Synods , linked by the common theme of the new_evangelization , has proved an important part of the Church s preparation_for the Great Jubilee of the Year . In that_same letter , referring to the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops , I noted_that in that part_of_the_world '' the issue of the encounter of Christianity with ancient local cultures and religions -isaia- a pressing one . This -isaia- a great challenge for evangelization , since religious systems such as Buddhism or Hinduism have a clearly soteriological character '' . It -isaia- indeed a mystery why_the Saviour of the world , born in Asia , has until now remained largely unknown to the people of the continent . The Synod would be a providential opportunity_for the Church in Asia to reflect further on this_mystery and to make a renewed commitment to the mission of making Jesus Christ better known to all . Two months after_the publication of Tertio Millennio Adveniente , speaking to the Sixth Plenary Assembly of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences , in Manila , the Philippines , during the memorable Tenth World Youth Day celebrations , I reminded the Bishops : '' If the Church in Asia -isaia- to fulfil its providential destiny , evangelization as the joyful , patient and progressive preaching of the saving Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ must be your absolute priority '' . The positive response of the Bishops and of the particular Churches to the prospect of a Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops was evident throughout_the preparatory phase . The Bishops communicated their desires and opinions -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage with frankness and a penetrating knowledge of the continent . They did so in full awareness of the bond of communion_which they share_with the universal Church . In line with the original idea of Tertio Millennio Adveniente and following the proposals of the Pre Synodal Council which evaluated the views of the Bishops and the particular Churches on the Asian continent , I chose as the Synod s theme : Jesus Christ the Saviour and his Mission of Love and Service in Asia : '' That they may_have Life and have it abundantly '' Jn : . Through this particular formulation of the theme , I hoped that the Synod might '' illustrate and explain more_fully the truth_that Christ -isaia-_the_one Mediator between God and man and the sole Redeemer of the world , to be clearly distinguished from the founders of other great religions '' . As we approach the Great Jubilee , the Church in Asia needs to be able to proclaim with renewed vigour : Ecce natus -ester- nobis Salvator mundi , '' Behold the Saviour of the World -isaia- born to us '' , born in Asia ! The Celebration of the Special Assembly . By the grace of God , the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops took_place from April to May in the Vatican . It came after_the Special Assemblies for Africa and America , and was followed -atti_degli_apostoli- the year s end by the Special Assembly for Oceania . For almost a month , the Synod Fathers and other participants , gathered around_the Successor of Peter and sharing in the gift of hierarchical communion , gave concrete voice and expression to the Church in Asia . It was indeed a moment of special grace ! Earlier meetings of Asian Bishops had contributed to preparing the Synod and making possible an atmosphere of intense ecclesial and fraternal communion . Of particular relevance in this respect were_the past Plenary Assemblies and Seminars sponsored by the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences and its offices , which periodically brought together great numbers of Asian Bishops and fostered personal as well as ministerial bonds between_them . I had the privilege of being able to make a visit to some of these meetings , -atti_degli_apostoli- times presiding -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening or closing Solemn Eucharistic Celebrations . On those occasions I was able to observe directly the encounter in dialogue of the particular Churches , including the Eastern Churches , in the person of their Pastors . These and other regional assemblies of Asia s Bishops served providentially as remote preparation_for the Synod Assembly . The actual celebration of the Synod itself confirmed the importance of dialogue as a characteristic mode of the Church s life in Asia . A sincere and honest sharing of experiences , ideas and proposals proved to be the way to a genuine meeting of spirits , a communion of minds and hearts which , in love , respects and transcends differences . Particularly moving was_the encounter of the new Churches with the ancient Churches which trace their origins to the Apostles . We experienced the incomparable joy of seeing the Bishops of the particular Churches in Myanmar , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Mongolia , Siberia and the new republics of Central Asia sitting beside their Brothers who_had long desired to encounter them and to dialogue_with them . Yet there_was also a sense of sadness -atti_degli_apostoli- the fact_that Bishops from Mainland China could_not be present . Their absence was a constant reminder of the heroic sacrifices and suffering which_the Church continues to endure in many_parts of Asia . The encounter in dialogue of the Bishops and the Successor of Peter , entrusted with the task of strengthening his_brothers cf . Lk : , was truly a confirmation in faith and mission . Day after day the Synod Hall and meeting rooms were filled_with accounts of deep faith , self sacrificing love , unwavering hope , long suffering commitment , enduring courage and merciful forgiveness , all of which eloquently disclosed the truth of Jesus words : '' I -amos- with you always '' Mt : . The Synod was a moment of grace because it was an encounter_with_the Saviour who continues to be present in his Church through the power of the Holy Spirit , experienced in a fraternal dialogue of life , communion and mission . Sharing the Fruits of the Special Assembly . Through this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation , I wish to share_with the Church in Asia and throughout_the_world the fruits of the Special Assembly . This document seeks to convey the wealth of that great spiritual event of communion and episcopal collegiality . The Synod was a celebratory remembering of the Asian roots of Christianity . The Synod Fathers remembered the first Christian community , the early Church , Jesus little flock on this immense continent cf . They remembered what_the Church has_received and heard from the beginning cf . Rev : , and , having remembered , they celebrated God s '' abundant goodness '' Ps : which never fails . The Synod was_also an occasion to recognize_the ancient religious traditions and civilizations , the profound philosophies and the wisdom which_have made Asia what it -isaia- today . Above all , the peoples of Asia themselves were remembered as the continent s true wealth and hope_for the future . Throughout the Synod those of us present were witnesses of an extraordinarily fruitful meeting between_the old_and_new cultures and civilizations of Asia , marvellous to behold in their diversity and convergence , especially_when symbols , songs , dances and colours came together in harmonious accord around_the one Table of the Lord in the opening and closing Eucharistic Liturgies . This was_not a celebration motivated by pride in human achievements , but_one conscious of what_the Almighty has done for the Church in Asia cf . In recalling the Catholic community s humble condition , as well as the weaknesses of its_members , the Synod was_also a call to conversion , so that the Church in Asia might become ever_more worthy of the graces continually being offered by God . As well as a remembrance and a celebration , the Synod was an ardent affirmation of faith in Jesus Christ the Saviour . Grateful for the gift of faith , the Synod Fathers found no better way to celebrate the faith than to affirm it in its integrity , and to reflect on it in relation to the context in which it has to be proclaimed and professed in Asia today . They emphasized frequently that the faith -isaia-_already being proclaimed with trust and courage on the continent , even amid great difficulties . In the name of so many millions of men_and_women in Asia who put their trust in no one other_than the Lord , the Synod Fathers confessed : '' We have believed and come to know_that you_are the Holy One of God '' Jn : . In the face of the many painful questions posed by the suffering , violence , discrimination and poverty to which_the majority of Asian peoples are subjected , they prayed : '' I believe , help my unbelief '' Mk : . In , I invited the Bishops of Asia gathered in Manila to '' open wide to Christ the doors of Asia '' . Taking strength from the mystery of communion with the countless and often unheralded martyrs of the faith in Asia , and confirmed in hope by the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit , the Synod Fathers courageously called all Christ s disciples in Asia to a new commitment to mission . During the Synod Assembly , the Bishops and participants bore witness to the character , spiritual fire and zeal which_will assuredly make Asia the land of a bountiful harvest in the coming millennium . CHAPTER I THE ASIAN CONTEXT Asia , the Birthplace of Jesus and of the Church . The Incarnation of the Son of God , which_the whole Church will solemnly commemorate in the Great Jubilee of the Year , took_place in a definite historical and geographical context . That context exercised an important influence on the life_and_mission of the Redeemer as man . '' In Jesus of Nazareth , God has assumed the features typical of human_nature , including a person s belonging to a particular people and a particular land . The physical particularity of the land and its geographical determination are inseparable from the truth of the human flesh assumed by the Word '' . Consequently , knowledge of the world in which_the Saviour '' dwelt among us '' Jn : -isaia- an important key to a more precise understanding of the Eternal Father s design and of the immensity of his_love for every_creature : '' For God so loved the world_that he gave_his only Son , that whoever believes in him should_not perish but have eternal_life '' Jn : . Likewise , the Church lives and fulfils her_mission in the actual circumstances of time_and_place . A critical awareness of the diverse and complex realities of Asia -isaia- essential if the People of God on the continent are to respond to God s will for them in the new_evangelization . The Synod Fathers insisted that the Church s mission of love and service in Asia -isaia- conditioned by two factors : on the one_hand , her self understanding as a community of disciples of Jesus Christ gathered around her Pastors , and on the other_hand , the social , political , religious , cultural and economic realities of Asia . The situation of Asia was examined in detail during the Synod by those_who_have daily contact_with_the extremely diversified realities of such an immense continent . The following -isaia- , in synthesis , the result of the Synod Fathers reflections . Religious and Cultural Realities . Asia -isaia- the earth s largest continent and -isaia- home to nearly two thirds of the world s population , with China and India accounting for almost half the total population of the globe . The most striking feature of the continent -isaia- the variety of its peoples who_are '' heirs to ancient cultures , religions and traditions '' . We cannot_but be amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- the sheer size of Asia s population and -atti_degli_apostoli- the intricate mosaic of its many cultures , languages , beliefs and traditions , which comprise such a substantial part of the history and patrimony of the human_family . Asia -isaia-_also the cradle of the world s major religions Judaism , Christianity , Islam and Hinduism . It -isaia- the birthplace of many_other spiritual traditions such as Buddhism , Taoism , Confucianism , Zoroastrianism , Jainism , Sikhism and Shintoism . Millions also espouse traditional or tribal religions , with varying degrees of structured ritual and formal religious teaching . The Church has the deepest respect_for these traditions and seeks to engage in sincere dialogue_with their followers . The religious values they teach await their fulfilment in Jesus Christ . The people of Asia take pride in their religious and cultural values , such as love of silence and contemplation , simplicity , harmony , detachment , non violence , the spirit of hard work , discipline , frugal living , the thirst_for learning and philosophical enquiry . They hold dear the values of respect_for life , compassion for all beings , closeness to nature , filial piety towards parents , elders and ancestors , and a highly developed sense of community . In particular , they hold the family to be a vital source of strength , a closely knit community with a powerful sense of solidarity . Asian peoples are known for their spirit of religious tolerance and peaceful co existence . Without denying the existence of bitter tensions and violent conflicts , it can still be said_that Asia has often demonstrated a remarkable capacity_for accommodation and a natural openness to the mutual enrichment of peoples in the midst of a plurality of religions and cultures . Moreover , despite the influence of modernization and secularization , Asian religions are showing signs of great vitality and a capacity_for renewal , as seen in reform movements within_the various religious groups . Many people , especially_the young , experience a deep thirst_for spiritual values , as the rise of new religious movements clearly demonstrates . All of this indicates an innate spiritual insight and moral wisdom in the Asian soul , and it -isaia- the core around which a growing sense of '' being Asian '' -isaia- built . This '' being Asian '' -isaia- best discovered and affirmed not in confrontation and opposition , but in the spirit of complementarity and harmony . In this framework of complementarity and harmony , the Church can communicate the Gospel in a way which_-isaia- faithful both to her_own Tradition and to the Asian soul . Economic and Social Realities . On the subject of economic development , situations on the Asian continent are_very diverse , defying any simple classification . Some countries are highly developed , others are developing through effective economic policies , and others still find_themselves in abject poverty , indeed among the poorest nations on earth . In the process of development , materialism and secularism are_also gaining ground , especially in urban areas . These ideologies , which undermine traditional , social and religious values , threaten Asia s cultures with incalculable damage . The Synod Fathers spoke of the rapid changes taking place within Asian societies and of the positive and negative aspects of these changes . Among them are the phenomenon of urbanization and the emergence of huge urban conglomerations , often with large depressed areas where organized crime , terrorism , prostitution , and the exploitation of the weaker sectors of society thrive . Migration too -isaia- a major social phenomenon , exposing millions of people to situations which_are difficult economically , culturally and morally . People migrate within Asia and from Asia to other continents for_many reasons , among_them poverty , war and ethnic conflicts , the denial of their human_rights and fundamental freedoms . The establishment of giant industrial complexes -isaia- another cause of internal and external migration , with accompanying destructive effects on family_life and values . Mention was_also made of the construction of nuclear power plants with an eye to cost and efficiency but_with little regard_for the safety of people and the integrity of the environment . Tourism also warrants special_attention . Though a legitimate industry with its_own cultural and educational values , tourism has in some cases a devastating influence upon the moral and physical landscape of many Asian countries , manifested in the degradation of young women and even children through prostitution . The pastoral_care of migrants , as well as that of tourists , -isaia- difficult and complex , especially in Asia where basic structures for_this may not_exist . Pastoral planning -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels needs to take these realities into_account . In this_context we should_not forget the migrants from Catholic Eastern Churches who need pastoral_care according_to_their own ecclesiastical traditions . Several Asian countries face difficulties related to population growth , which_-isaia- '' not merely a demographic or economic problem but especially a moral one '' . Clearly , the question of population -isaia- closely linked to that of human promotion , but false solutions that threaten the dignity and inviolability of life abound and present a special challenge to the Church in Asia . It -isaia- perhaps appropriate -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point to recall_the Church s contribution to the defence and promotion of life through health_care , social development and education to benefit peoples , especially_the poor . It -isaia- fitting_that the Special Assembly for Asia paid tribute to the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta , '' who_was known all over the world for_her loving and selfless care of the poorest of the poor '' . She remains an icon of the service to life_which the Church -isaia- offering in Asia , in courageous contrast to the many dark forces -atti_degli_apostoli- work in society . A number of Synod Fathers underlined the external influences being brought to bear on Asian cultures . New forms of behaviour are emerging as a result of over exposure to the mass_media and the kinds of literature , music and films that_are proliferating on the continent . Without denying that the means of social communication can be a great force for good , we cannot disregard the negative impact which_they often have . Their beneficial effects can -atti_degli_apostoli- times be outweighed by the way in which_they_are controlled and used by those with questionable political , economic and ideological interests . As a result , the negative aspects of the media and entertainment industries are threatening traditional values , and in particular the sacredness of marriage and the stability of the family . The effect of images of violence , hedonism , unbridled individualism and materialism '' -isaia- striking -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of Asian cultures , -atti_degli_apostoli- the religious character of the people , families and whole societies '' . This -isaia- a situation which poses a great challenge to the Church and to the proclamation of her message . The persistent reality of poverty and the exploitation of people_are matters of the most urgent concern . In Asia there_are millions of oppressed people_who for centuries have_been kept economically , culturally and politically on the margins of society . Reflecting upon the situation of women in Asian societies , the Synod Fathers noted_that '' though the awakening of women s consciousness to their_dignity and rights -isaia- one_of_the_most significant signs of the times , the poverty and exploitation of women remains a serious problem throughout Asia '' . Female illiteracy -isaia- much higher than_that of males ; and female children are_more likely to be aborted or even killed after birth . There are_also millions of indigenous or tribal people throughout Asia living in social , cultural and political isolation from the dominant population . It was reassuring to hear_the Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod mention that in some cases these_matters are receiving greater attention -atti_degli_apostoli- the national , regional and international levels , and that the Church -isaia- actively seeking to address this serious situation . The Synod Fathers pointed_out that_this necessarily brief reflection upon the economic_and_social realities of Asia would be incomplete if recognition were_not also given to the extensive economic growth of many Asian societies in recent decades : a new generation of skilled workers , scientists and technicians -isaia- growing daily and their great number augurs well for Asia s development . Still , not all -isaia- stable and solid in this progress , as has been_made evident by the most recent and far reaching financial crisis suffered by a number of Asian countries . The future of Asia lies in cooperation , within Asia and with the nations of other continents , but building always on what Asian peoples themselves do with_a_view to their_own development . The Church always needs to have an exact understanding of the political situation in the different countries where she seeks to fulfil her_mission . In Asia today the political panorama -isaia- highly complex , displaying an array of ideologies ranging from democratic forms of government to theocratic ones . Military dictatorships and atheistic ideologies are_very much present . Some countries recognize an official state religion that allows little or no religious_freedom to minorities and the followers of other_religions . Other States , though not explicitly theocratic , reduce minorities to second class citizens with little safeguard for their fundamental human_rights . In some places Christians are_not allowed to practise their_faith freely and proclaim Jesus Christ to others . They are persecuted and denied their rightful place in society . The Synod Fathers remembered in a special_way the people of China and expressed the fervent hope_that all their Chinese Catholic brothers_and_sisters would one_day be able to exercise their religion in freedom and visibly profess their full_communion with the See of Peter . While appreciating the progress which many Asian countries are making under their different_forms of government , the Synod Fathers also drew attention to the widespread corruption existing -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels of both government and society . Too often , people seem helpless to defend themselves against corrupt politicians , judiciary officials , administrators and bureaucrats . However , there_-isaia- a growing awareness throughout Asia of people s capacity to change unjust structures . There are new demands for greater social_justice , for more participation in government and economic_life , for equal opportunities in education and for a just share in the resources of the nation . People are becoming increasingly conscious of their human_dignity and rights and more determined to safeguard them . Long dormant ethnic , social_and_cultural minority groups are seeking ways to become agents of their_own social advancement . The Spirit of God helps and sustains people s efforts to transform society so that the human yearning for a more abundant life may be satisfied as God wills cf . The Church in Asia : Past and Present . The history of the Church in Asia -isaia- as old as the Church herself , for it was in Asia that Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon his_disciples and sent them to the ends of the earth to proclaim_the Good News and gather communities of believers . '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn : ; see also Mt : ; Mk : ; Lk : ; Acts : . Following the Lord s command , the Apostles preached the word and founded Churches . It may help to recall some elements of this fascinating and complex history . From Jerusalem , the Church spread to Antioch , to Rome and beyond . It reached Ethiopia in the South , Scythia in the North and India in the East , where tradition has it that Saint Thomas the Apostle went in the year A . and founded Churches in South India . The missionary spirit of the East Syrian community in the third and fourth centuries , with its centre -atti_degli_apostoli- Edessa , was remarkable . The ascetic communities of Syria were a major force of evangelization in Asia from the third century onwards . They provided spiritual energy for the Church , especially during times of persecution . At the end of the third century , Armenia was_the first nation as a whole to embrace Christianity , and -isaia-_now preparing to celebrate the th anniversary of its baptism . By the end of the fifth century , the Christian message had reached the Arab kingdoms , but for_many reasons , including the divisions among Christians , the message failed to take root among_these peoples . Persian merchants took the Good News to China in the fifth century . The first Christian Church was built there -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the seventh century . During the T ang dynasty A . , the Church flourished for nearly two centuries . The decline of this vibrant Church in China by the end of the First Millennium -isaia- one of the sadder chapters in the history of God s People on the continent . In the thirteenth century the Good News was announced to the Mongols and the Turks and to the Chinese once_more . But Christianity almost vanished in these regions for a number of reasons , among_them the rise of Islam , geographical isolation , the absence of an appropriate adaptation to local cultures , and perhaps above all a lack of preparedness to encounter the great religions of Asia . The end of the fourteenth century saw the drastic diminution of the Church in Asia , except for the isolated community in South India . The Church in Asia had to await a new era of missionary endeavour . The apostolic labours of Saint Francis Xavier , the founding of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide by Pope Gregory XV , and the directives for missionaries to respect and appreciate local cultures all contributed to achieving more positive results in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Again in the nineteenth century there_was a revival of missionary_activity . Various religious congregations dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to this_task . Propaganda Fide was reorganized . Greater emphasis was placed upon building up the local Churches . Educational and charitable works went hand in hand with the preaching of the Gospel . Consequently , the Good News continued to reach more people , especially among the poor and the underprivileged , but_also here and there among the social and intellectual elite . New attempts were made to inculturate the Good News , although they proved in no way sufficient . Despite her centuries long presence and her many apostolic endeavours , the Church in many places was still considered as foreign to Asia , and indeed was often associated in people s minds with the colonial powers . This was_the situation on the eve of the Second Vatican Council ; but thanks to the impetus provided by the Council , a new understanding of mission dawned and with it a great hope . The universality of God s plan of salvation , the missionary nature of the Church and the responsibility of everyone in the Church for this_task , so strongly reaffirmed in the Council s Decree on the Church s Missionary Activity Ad Gentes , became the framework of a new commitment . During the Special Assembly , the Synod Fathers testified to the recent growth of the ecclesial_community among many_different peoples in various parts of the continent , and they appealed for further missionary efforts in the years to come , especially as new possibilities for the proclamation of the Gospel emerge in the Siberian region and the Central Asian countries which_have recently gained their independence , such as Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan . A survey of the Catholic communities in Asia shows a splendid variety by reason of their origin and historical development , and the diverse spiritual and liturgical traditions of the various Rites . Yet all are_united in proclaiming the Good News of Jesus Christ , through Christian witness , works of charity and human solidarity . While some particular Churches carry_out_their mission in peace and freedom , others find_themselves in situations of violence and conflict , or feel threatened by other groups , for religious or other reasons . In the vastly diversified cultural world of Asia , the Church faces multiple philosophical , theological and pastoral challenges . Her task -isaia- made more difficult by the fact of her being a minority , with the only exception the Philippines , where Catholics are in the majority . Whatever the circumstances , the Church in Asia finds herself among peoples who display an intense yearning for God . The Church knows that_this yearning can_only be fully satisfied by Jesus Christ , the Good News of God for all the nations . The Synod Fathers were very keen that_this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation should focus attention on this yearning and encourage the Church in Asia to proclaim with vigour in word and deed that Jesus Christ -isaia- the Saviour . The Spirit of God , always -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the history of the Church in Asia , continues to guide her . The many positive elements found in the local Churches , frequently highlighted in the Synod , strengthen our expectation of a '' new springtime of Christian life '' . One solid cause of hope -isaia- the increasing number of better trained , enthusiastic and Spirit filled lay_people , who_are more_and_more aware of their_specific vocation within_the ecclesial_community . Among them the lay catechists deserve special recognition and praise . The apostolic and charismatic movements too are a gift of the Spirit , bringing new_life and vigour to the formation of lay men_and_women , families and the young . Associations and ecclesial movements devoted to the promotion of human_dignity and justice make accessible and tangible the universality of the evangelical message of our adoption as children of God cf . At the same_time , there_are Churches in very difficult circumstances , '' experiencing intense trials in the practice of their_faith '' . The Synod Fathers were moved by reports of the heroic witness , unshaken perseverance and steady growth of the Catholic Church in China , by the efforts of the Church in South Korea to offer assistance to the people of North Korea , the humble steadfastness of the Catholic community in Vietnam , the isolation of Christians in such places as Laos and Myanmar , the difficult co existence with the majority in some predominantly Islamic states . The Synod paid special_attention to the situation of the Church in the Holy Land and in the Holy City of Jerusalem , '' the heart of Christianity '' , a city dear to all the children of Abraham . The Synod Fathers expressed the belief that the peace of the region , and even the world , depends in large measure on the peace and reconciliation which_have eluded Jerusalem for so long . I cannot bring to an end this brief survey of the situation of the Church in Asia , though far from complete , without mentioning the Saints and Martyrs of Asia , both those_who_have been recognized and those known only to God , whose example -isaia- a source of '' spiritual richness and a great means of evangelization '' . They speak silently but most powerfully of the importance of holiness of life and readiness to offer one s life_for the Gospel . They are the teachers and the protectors , the glory of the Church in Asia in her work_of_evangelization . With the whole Church I pray to the Lord to send many more committed labourers to reap the harvest of souls which I see as ready and plentiful cf . At this moment , I call to mind what I wrote in Redemptoris Missio : '' God -isaia- opening before the Church the horizons of a humanity more_fully prepared_for the sowing of the Gospel '' . This vision of a new and promising horizon I see being fulfilled in Asia , where Jesus was_born and where Christianity began . CHAPTER II JESUS THE SAVIOUR : A GIFT TO ASIA The Gift of Faith . As the Synod discussion of the complex realities of Asia unfolded , it became increasingly obvious to all that the Church s unique contribution to the peoples of the continent -isaia- the proclamation of Jesus Christ , true God and true man , the one and only Saviour for all peoples . What distinguishes the Church from other religious communities -isaia- her faith in Jesus Christ ; and she cannot keep this precious light_of_faith under a bushel cf . Mt : , for_her mission_-isaia- to share that light with everyone . '' The Church wants to offer the new_life she_has found in Jesus Christ to all the peoples of Asia as they search_for the fullness of life , so that_they_can have_the same fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ in the power of the Spirit '' . This faith in Jesus Christ -isaia- what inspires the Church s evangelizing work in Asia , often carried_out in difficult and even dangerous circumstances . The Synod Fathers noted_that proclaiming Jesus as the only Saviour can present particular difficulties in their cultures , given that_many Asian religions teach divine self manifestations as mediating salvation . Far from discouraging the Synod Fathers , the challenges facing their evangelizing efforts were an even greater incentive in striving to transmit '' the faith_that the Church in Asia has inherited from the Apostles and holds with the Church of all generations and places '' . Indeed they expressed the conviction_that '' the heart of the Church in Asia will be restless until the whole of Asia finds_its rest in the peace of Christ , the Risen Lord '' . The Church s faith in Jesus -isaia-_a_gift received and a gift to be shared ; it -isaia- the greatest gift_which the Church can_offer to Asia . Sharing the truth of Jesus Christ with_others -isaia- the solemn duty of all who have_received the gift of faith . In my Encyclical Letter Redemptoris Missio , I wrote that '' the Church , and every_individual Christian within her , may_not keep hidden or monopolize this newness and richness which_has_been received_from God s bounty in order to be communicated to all mankind '' . In the same Letter I wrote : '' Those who_are incorporated in the Catholic Church ought to sense their privilege and for that_very reason their greater obligation of bearing_witness to the faith and to the Christian life as a service to their brothers_and_sisters and as a fitting response to God '' . Deeply convinced of this , the Synod Fathers were equally conscious of their_personal responsibility to grasp through study , prayer and reflection the timeless truth of Jesus in order to bring its power and vitality to bear on the present and future challenges of evangelization in Asia . Jesus Christ , the God Man Who Saves . The Scriptures attest that Jesus lived an authentically human_life . The Jesus whom we proclaim as the only Saviour walked the earth as the God Man in full possession of a human_nature . He was like us in all things except sin . Born of a Virgin Mother in humble surroundings -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethlehem , he was as helpless as any_other infant , and even suffered the fate of a refugee fleeing the wrath of a ruthless leader cf . He was subject to human parents who did not_always understand his ways , but in whom he trusted and whom he lovingly obeyed cf . Constantly -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer , he was in intimate relationship_with God whom he addressed as Abba , '' Father '' , to the dismay of his listeners cf . He was close to the poor , the forgotten and the lowly , declaring that_they were truly blessed , for God was with_them . He ate with sinners , assuring them that -atti_degli_apostoli- the Father s table there_was a place_for them when_they turned from their sinful ways and came back to him . Touching the unclean and allowing them to touch him , he let_them know_the nearness of God . He wept for a dead friend , he restored a dead son to his widowed mother , he welcomed children , and he washed the feet of his_disciples . Divine compassion had never been so immediately accessible . The sick , the lame , the blind , the deaf and the dumb all experienced healing and forgiveness -atti_degli_apostoli- his touch . As his closest companions and co workers he chose an unusual group in which fishermen mixed with tax collectors , Zealots with people untrained in the Law , and women also . A new family was being created under the Father s all embracing and surprising love . Jesus preached simply , using examples from everyday life to speak of God s love and his Kingdom ; and the people recognized that he spoke with authority . Yet he was accused of being a blasphemer , a violator of the sacred Law , a public nuisance to be eliminated . After a trial based on false testimony cf . Mk : , he was sentenced to die as a criminal on the Cross and , forsaken and humiliated , he seemed a failure . He was hastily buried in a borrowed tomb . But on the third day after this death , and despite the vigilance of the guards , the tomb was found empty ! Jesus , risen from the dead , then appeared to his_disciples before returning to the Father from whom he had come . With all Christians , we believe_that this particular life , in one sense so ordinary and simple , in another sense so utterly wondrous and shrouded in mystery , ushered into human_history the Kingdom of God and '' brought its power to bear upon every facet of human_life and society beset by sin and death '' . Through his_words and actions , especially in his suffering , death_and_resurrection , Jesus fulfilled the will of his Father to reconcile all humanity to himself , after original_sin had created a rupture in the relationship_between_the Creator and his creation . On the Cross , he took upon himself_the sins of the world past , present and future . Saint Paul reminds us that we were dead as a result of our sins and his_death has brought us to life again : '' God made us alive together_with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses , having cancelled the bond which stood against us with its legal demands ; this he set_aside , nailing it to the cross '' Col : . In this_way , salvation was sealed once and for all . Jesus -isaia-_our Saviour in the fullest sense of the word because his_words and works , especially his_resurrection from the dead , have revealed him to be the Son of God , the pre existent Word , who reigns for ever as Lord and Messiah . The Person and Mission of the Son of God . The '' scandal '' of Christianity -isaia- the belief that the all holy , all powerful and all knowing God took upon himself our human_nature and endured suffering and death to win salvation for all people cf . The faith we have_received declares that Jesus Christ revealed and accomplished the Father s plan of saving the world and the whole of humanity because of '' who he -isaia- '' and '' what he does because of who he -isaia- '' . '' Who he -isaia- '' and '' what he does '' acquire their full meaning only_when set within_the mystery of the Triune God . It has_been a constant concern of my Pontificate to remind the faithful of the communion of life of the Blessed Trinity and the unity of the three Persons in the plan of creation and redemption . My Encyclical Letters Redemptor Hominis , Dives in Misericordia and Dominum et Vivificantem are reflections on the Son , the Father and the Holy Spirit respectively and on their roles in the divine plan of salvation . We cannot however isolate or separate one Person from the others , since each -isaia-_revealed only within_the communion of life and action of the Trinity . The saving action of Jesus has its origin in the communion of the Godhead , and opens the way_for all who_believe in him to enter_into intimate communion with the Trinity and with one_another in the Trinity . '' He who_has seen me has seen the Father '' , Jesus claims Jn : . In Jesus Christ alone dwells the fullness of God in bodily form cf . Col : , establishing him as the unique and absolute saving Word of God cf . As the Father s definitive Word , Jesus makes God and his saving will known in the fullest way possible . '' No one comes to the Father but by me '' , Jesus says Jn : . He -isaia- '' the Way , and the Truth , and the Life '' Jn : , because , as he himself says , '' the Father who dwells in me does his works '' Jn : . Only in the person of Jesus does God s word of salvation appear in all its fullness , ushering in the final age cf . Thus , in the first days of the Church , Peter could proclaim : '' There -isaia- salvation in no one else , for there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given among_men by which we must be saved '' Acts : . The mission of the Saviour reached its culmination in the Paschal Mystery . On the Cross , when '' he stretched out his arms between heaven and earth in the everlasting sign of the Father s covenant '' , Jesus uttered his final appeal to the Father to forgive the sins of humanity : '' Father , forgive them ; for they know not what_they do '' Lk : . Jesus destroyed sin by the power of his_love for his Father and for all mankind . He took upon himself_the wounds inflicted on humanity by sin , and he offered release through conversion . The first fruits of this are evident in the repentant thief hanging beside him on another cross cf . His last utterance was_the cry of the faithful Son : '' Father , into your hands I commit my spirit '' Lk : . In this supreme expression of love he entrusted his whole life_and_mission into the hands of the Father who_had sent him . Thus he handed over to the Father the whole of creation and all humanity , to be accepted finally by him in compassionate love . Everything that the Son -isaia- and has accomplished -isaia- accepted by the Father , who then offers this_gift to the world in the act of raising Jesus from the dead and setting him -atti_degli_apostoli- his right hand , where sin and death have power no more . Through Jesus Paschal Sacrifice the Father irrevocably offers reconciliation and fullness of life to the world . This extraordinary gift could only come through the beloved Son , who alone was capable of fully responding to the Father s love , rejected by sin . In Jesus Christ , through the power of the Holy Spirit , we come to know_that God -isaia- not distant , above and apart_from man , but -isaia-_very near , indeed united to every_person and all humanity in all of life s situations . This -isaia- the message which Christianity offers to the world , and it -isaia- a source of incomparable comfort and hope_for all believers . Jesus Christ : the Truth of Humanity . How does the humanity of Jesus and the ineffable mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of the Father shed light on the human condition ? The Incarnate Son of God not_only revealed completely the Father and his plan of salvation ; he also '' fully reveals man to himself '' . His words and actions , and above all his Death and Resurrection , reveal the depths of what it means to be human . Through Jesus , man can finally know_the truth of himself . Jesus perfectly human_life , devoted wholly to the love and service of the Father and of man , reveals that the vocation of every_human_being -isaia- to receive love and give love in return . In Jesus we marvel -atti_degli_apostoli- the inexhaustible capacity of the human_heart to love God and man , even_when this entails great suffering . Above all , it -isaia- on the Cross that Jesus breaks the power of the self destructive resistance to love_which sin inflicts upon us . On his part , the Father responds by raising Jesus as the first born of all those predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son cf . At that moment , Jesus became once and for all both the revelation and the accomplishment of a humanity re created and renewed according to the plan of God . In Jesus then , we discover the greatness and dignity of each_person in the heart of God who created man in his_own image cf . Gen : , and we find the origin of the new creation which_we_have become through_his grace . The Second Vatican Council taught that '' by his Incarnation , he , the Son of God , in a certain way united himself_with each_individual '' . In this profound insight the Synod Fathers saw the ultimate source of hope and strength for the people of Asia in their struggles and uncertainties . When men_and_women respond with a living faith to God s offer of love , his presence brings love and peace , transforming the human_heart from within . In Redemptor Hominis I wrote that '' the redemption of the world this tremendous mystery of love in which creation -isaia- renewed -isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- its deepest root , the fullness of justice in a human Heart the Heart of the First born Son in order that_it_may become justice in the hearts of many human_beings , predestined from eternity in the First born Son to be children of God and called to grace , called to love '' . Thus , the mission of Jesus not_only restored communion_between God and humanity ; it also established a new communion_between human_beings alienated from one_another because of sin . Beyond all divisions , Jesus makes it possible_for people to live as brothers_and_sisters , recognizing a single Father who_-isaia- in heaven cf . In him , a new harmony has emerged , in which '' there_-isaia- neither Jew nor Greek , . neither slave nor free , . neither male nor female , for you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' Gal : . Jesus -isaia-_our peace , '' who_has made us both one , and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility '' Eph : . In all that he said and did , Jesus was_the Father s voice , hands and arms , gathering all God s children into one family of love . He prayed that his_disciples might live in communion just as he -isaia- in communion with the Father cf . Among his last words we hear him say : '' As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you ; abide in my love . This -isaia- my commandment , that_you love one_another as I have loved you '' Jn : , . Sent by the God of communion and being truly God and truly man , Jesus established communion_between heaven and earth in his_very person . It -isaia-_our faith_that '' in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell , and through_him to reconcile to himself all things , whether on earth or in heaven , making peace by the blood of his Cross '' Col : . Salvation can be found in the person of the Son of God made man and the mission entrusted to him alone as the Son , a mission of service and love for the life of all . Together with the Church throughout_the_world , the Church in Asia proclaims_the truth of faith : '' There -isaia- one God , and there_-isaia-_one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all '' Tim : . The Uniqueness and Universality of Salvation in Jesus . The Synod Fathers recalled that the pre existent Word , the eternally begotten Son of God , '' was already present in creation , in history and in every_human yearning for good '' . Through the Word , present to the cosmos even before the Incarnation , the world came to be cf . But as the incarnate Word who lived , died and rose from the dead , Jesus Christ -isaia-_now proclaimed as the fulfilment of all creation , of all history , and of all human yearning for fullness of life . Risen from the dead , Jesus Christ '' -isaia- present to all and to the whole of creation in a new and mysterious way '' . In him , '' authentic values of all religious and cultural traditions , such as mercy and submission to the will of God , compassion and rectitude , non violence and righteousness , filial piety and harmony_with creation find_their fullness and realization '' . From the first moment of time to its end , Jesus -isaia-_the_one universal Mediator . Even for those who_do_not explicitly profess faith in him as the Saviour , salvation comes as a grace from Jesus Christ through the communication of the Holy Spirit . We believe_that Jesus Christ , true God and true man , -isaia-_the_one Saviour because he alone the Son accomplished the Father s universal plan of salvation . As the definitive manifestation of the mystery of the Father s love for all , Jesus -isaia- indeed unique , and '' it -isaia- precisely this uniqueness of Christ which_gives him an absolute and universal significance , whereby , while belonging to history , he remains history s centre and goal '' . No individual , no nation , no culture -isaia- impervious to the appeal of Jesus who speaks from the very_heart of the human condition . '' It -isaia-_his life_that speaks , his humanity , his fidelity to the truth , his all embracing love . Furthermore , his_death on the Cross speaks that_-isaia- to say the inscrutable depth of his suffering and abandonment '' . Contemplating Jesus in his human_nature , the peoples of Asia find_their deepest questions answered , their hopes fulfilled , their_dignity uplifted and their despair conquered . Jesus -isaia- the Good News for the men_and_women of every time_and_place in their search_for the meaning of existence and for the truth of their_own humanity . CHAPTER III THE HOLY SPIRIT : LORD AND GIVER OF LIFE The Spirit of God in Creation and History . If it -isaia- true_that the saving significance of Jesus can be understood only in the context of his revelation of the Trinity s plan of salvation , then it follows_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- an absolutely vital part of the mystery of Jesus and of the salvation which he brings . The Synod Fathers made frequent references to the role of the Holy Spirit in the history_of_salvation , noting that a false separation between_the Redeemer and the Holy Spirit would jeopardize the truth of Jesus as the one Saviour of all . In Christian Tradition , the Holy Spirit has_always_been associated_with life and the giving of life . The Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed calls the Holy Spirit '' the Lord , the Giver of Life '' . It -isaia- not surprising , therefore_,_that many interpretations of the creation account in Genesis have_seen the Holy Spirit in the mighty wind that swept over the waters cf . The Holy Spirit -isaia- present from the first moment of creation , the first manifestation of the love of the Triune God , and -isaia- always present in the world as its life_giving force . Since creation -isaia- the beginning of history , the Spirit -isaia- in a certain_sense a hidden power -atti_degli_apostoli- work in history , guiding it in the ways of truth and goodness . The revelation of the person of the Holy Spirit , the mutual love of the Father and the Son , -isaia- proper to the New Testament . In Christian thought he -isaia- seen as the wellspring of life_for all creatures . Creation -isaia- God s free communication of love , a communication which , out of nothing , brings everything into being . There -isaia- nothing created that_-isaia-_not filled_with_the ceaseless exchange of love_that marks the innermost life of the Trinity , filled that_-isaia- with the Holy Spirit : '' the Spirit of the Lord has filled the world '' Wis : . The presence of the Spirit in creation generates order , harmony and interdependence in all that exists . Created in the image of God , human_beings become the dwelling place of the Spirit in a new_way when_they_are raised to the dignity of divine adoption cf . Reborn in Baptism , they experience the presence and power of the Spirit , not_just as the Author of Life but as the One who purifies and saves , producing fruits of '' love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , gentleness , self control '' Gal : . These fruits of the Spirit are the sign that '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us '' Rom : . When accepted in freedom , this_love makes men_and_women visible instruments of the unseen Spirit s ceaseless activity . It -isaia- above all this_new capacity to give and receive love_which testifies to the interior presence and power of the Holy Spirit . As a consequence of the transformation and re creation which he produces in people s hearts and minds , the Spirit influences human societies and cultures . '' Indeed , the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the noble ideals and undertakings which benefit humanity on its journey through history . The Spirit of God with marvellous foresight directs the course of the ages and renews the face of the earth '' . Following the lead of the Second Vatican Council , the Synod Fathers drew attention to the multiple and diversified action of the Holy Spirit who continually sows the seeds of truth among all peoples , their religions , cultures and philosophies . This means_that these religions , cultures and philosophies are capable of helping people , individually and collectively , to work against evil and to serve life and everything_that -isaia- good . The forces of death isolate people , societies and religious communities from one_another , and generate the suspicion and rivalry that lead to conflict . The Holy Spirit , by contrast , sustains people in their search_for mutual understanding and acceptance . The Synod was therefore right to see the Spirit of God as the prime agent of the Church s dialogue_with all peoples , cultures and religions . The Holy Spirit and the Incarnation of the Word . Under the Spirit s guidance , the history_of_salvation unfolds on the stage of the world , indeed of the cosmos , according to the Father s eternal plan . That plan , initiated by the Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_beginning of creation , -isaia-_revealed in the Old Testament , -isaia- brought to fulfilment through the grace of Jesus Christ , and -isaia- carried on in the new creation by the same Spirit until the Lord comes again in glory -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time . The Incarnation of the Son of God -isaia- the supreme work of the Holy Spirit : '' The conception and birth of Jesus Christ are in fact the greatest work accomplished by the Holy Spirit in the history of creation and salvation : the supreme grace the grace of union , source of every_other grace '' . The Incarnation -isaia- the event in which God gathers into a new and definitive union with himself not_only man but the whole of creation and all of history . Having been conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary by the Spirit s power cf . Lk : ; Mt : , Jesus of Nazareth , the Messiah and only Saviour , was filled_with_the Holy Spirit . The Spirit descended upon him -atti_degli_apostoli- his baptism cf . Mk : and led him into the wilderness to be strengthened before his public ministry cf . In the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth he began his prophetic ministry by applying to himself Isaiah s vision of the Spirit s anointing which_leads to the preaching of good_news to the poor , freedom to captives and a time acceptable to the Lord cf . By the power of the Spirit , Jesus healed the sick and cast out demons as a sign that the Kingdom of God had come cf . After rising from the dead , he imparted to the disciples the Holy Spirit whom he had promised to pour out on the Church when he returned to the Father cf . All of this shows how Jesus saving mission bears the unmistakable mark of the Spirit s presence : life , new_life . Between the sending of the Son from the Father and the sending of the Spirit from the Father and the Son , there_-isaia- a close and vital link . The action of the Spirit in creation and human_history acquires an altogether new significance in his action in the life_and_mission of Jesus . The '' seeds of the Word '' sown by the Spirit prepare the whole of creation , history and man for full maturity in Christ . The Synod Fathers expressed concern about the tendency to separate the activity of the Holy Spirit from that of Jesus the Saviour . Responding to their concern , I repeat here what I wrote in Redemptoris Missio : '' The Spirit -isaia- . not an alternative to Christ , nor_does he fill a sort of void which_-isaia- sometimes suggested as existing between Christ and the Logos . Whatever the Spirit brings about in human hearts and in the history of peoples , in cultures and religions serves as a preparation_for the Gospel and can_only be understood in reference to Christ , the Word who took flesh by the power of the Spirit so that as perfectly human he would save all human_beings and sum up all things '' . The universal presence of the Holy Spirit therefore cannot serve as an excuse for a failure to proclaim Jesus Christ explicitly as the one and only Saviour . On the contrary , the universal presence of the Holy Spirit -isaia- inseparable from universal salvation in Jesus . The presence of the Spirit in creation and history points to Jesus Christ in whom creation and history are redeemed and fulfilled . The presence and action of the Spirit both before the Incarnation and in the climactic moment of Pentecost point always to Jesus and to the salvation he brings . So too the Holy Spirit s universal presence can_never be separated_from his activity within_the Body of Christ , the Church . The Holy Spirit and the Body of Christ . The Holy Spirit preserves unfailingly the bond of communion_between Jesus and his Church . Dwelling in her as in a temple cf . Cor : , the Spirit guides the Church , first of all , to the fullness of truth_about Jesus . Then , it -isaia- the Spirit who empowers the Church to continue Jesus mission , in the first_place by witnessing to Jesus himself , thus fulfilling what he had promised before his death_and_resurrection , that he would send the Spirit to his_disciples so that they_might bear_witness to him cf . The work of the Spirit in the Church -isaia-_also to testify that believers are the adopted children of God destined to inherit salvation , the promised fullness of communion with the Father cf . Endowing the Church with different charisms and gifts , the Spirit makes_the Church grow in communion as one_body made up of many_different parts cf . The Spirit gathers into unity all kinds of people , with_their different customs , resources and talents , making the Church a sign of the communion of all humanity under the headship of Christ . The Spirit shapes the Church as a community of witnesses who , through_his power , bear testimony to Jesus the Saviour cf . In this_sense , the Holy Spirit -isaia- the prime agent of evangelization . From this_the Synod Fathers could conclude that , just as the earthly ministry of Jesus was accomplished in the power of the Holy Spirit , '' the same Spirit has_been_given to the Church by the Father and the Son -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost to bring to completion Jesus mission of love and service in Asia '' . The Father s plan_for the salvation of man does_not end with the death_and_resurrection of Jesus . By the gift of Christ s Spirit , the fruits of his saving mission are offered through the Church to all peoples of all times through the proclamation of the Gospel and loving service of the human_family . As the Second Vatican Council observed , '' the Church -isaia- driven by the Holy Spirit to do her part for the full realization of the plan of God , who_has constituted Christ as the source of salvation for the whole_world '' . Empowered by the Spirit to accomplish Christ s salvation on earth , the Church -isaia- the seed of the Kingdom of God and she looks eagerly for its final coming . Her identity and mission are inseparable from the Kingdom of God which Jesus announced and inaugurated in all that he said and did , above all in his death_and_resurrection . The Spirit reminds the Church that she_-isaia- not an end unto herself : in all that she_-isaia- and all that she_does , she exists to serve Christ and the salvation of the world . In the present economy of salvation the workings of the Holy Spirit in creation , in history and in the Church are all part of the one eternal design of the Trinity over all that_-isaia- . The Holy Spirit and the Church s Mission in Asia . The Spirit who moved upon Asia in the time of the patriarchs and prophets , and still_more powerfully in the time of Jesus Christ and the early Church , moves now among Asian Christians , strengthening the witness of their_faith among the peoples , cultures and religions of the continent . Just as the great dialogue of love between God and man was prepared_for by the Spirit and accomplished on Asian soil in the mystery of Christ , so the dialogue_between the Saviour and the peoples of the continent continues today by the power of the same Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church . In this_process , Bishops , priests , religious and lay men_and_women all have an essential role to play , remembering the words of Jesus , which_are both a promise and a mandate : '' You shall receive power when_the Holy Spirit has come upon you ; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth '' Acts : . The Church -isaia- convinced_that deep within_the people , cultures and religions of Asia there_-isaia- a thirst_for '' living water '' cf . Jn : , a thirst which_the Spirit himself has created and which Jesus the Saviour alone_can fully satisfy . The Church looks to the Holy Spirit to continue to prepare the peoples of Asia for the saving dialogue_with_the Saviour of all . Led by the Spirit in her_mission of service and love , the Church can_offer an encounter between Jesus Christ and the peoples of Asia as they search_for the fullness of life . In that encounter alone_-isaia- to be found the living water which springs up to eternal_life , namely , the knowledge of the one true God and Jesus Christ whom he has_sent cf . The Church well knows that_she can accomplish her_mission only in obedience to the promptings of the Holy Spirit . Committed to being a genuine sign and instrument of the Spirit s action in the complex realities of Asia , she must discern , in all the diverse circumstances of the continent , the Spirit s call to witness to Jesus the Saviour in new and effective ways . The full truth of Jesus and the salvation he has won -isaia- always a gift , never the result of human effort . '' It -isaia- the Spirit himself bearing_witness with_our spirit that_we_are children of God , and if children , then heirs , heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ '' Rom : . Therefore the Church ceaselessly cries out , '' Come , Holy Spirit ! Fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love ! '' This -isaia- the fire which Jesus casts upon the earth . The Church in Asia shares his zeal that_this fire be re kindled now cf . With this ardent desire , the Synod Fathers sought to discern the principal areas of mission for the Church in Asia as she crosses the threshold of the new millennium . CHAPTER IV JESUS THE SAVIOUR : PROCLAIMING THE GIFT The Primacy of Proclamation . On the eve of the Third Millennium , the voice of the Risen Christ echoes anew in the heart of every Christian : '' All authority in heaven and on earth has_been_given to me . Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you ; and lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . Certain of the unfailing help of Jesus himself and the presence and power of his Spirit , the Apostles set_out immediately after Pentecost to fulfil this command : '' they went forth and preached everywhere , while the Lord worked with_them '' Mk : . What they announced can be summed up in the words of Saint Paul : '' For what we preach -isaia- not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , with ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake '' Cor : . Blessed with the gift of faith , the Church , after two thousand years , continues to go out to meet_the peoples of the world in order to share_with them the Good News of Jesus Christ . She -isaia- a community aflame with missionary zeal to make Jesus known , loved and followed . There can be no true evangelization without_the explicit proclamation of Jesus as Lord . The Second Vatican Council and the Magisterium since then , responding to a certain confusion about the true nature of the Church s mission , have repeatedly stressed the primacy of the proclamation of Jesus Christ in all evangelizing work . Thus Pope Paul VI explicitly wrote that '' there_-isaia- no true evangelization if the name , the teaching , the life , the promises , the Kingdom and the mystery of Jesus of Nazareth , the Son of God , are_not proclaimed '' . This -isaia- what generations of Christians have_done down_the_centuries . With understandable pride the Synod Fathers recalled that '' many Christian communities in Asia have preserved their_faith down_the_centuries against great odds and have clung to this spiritual heritage with heroic perseverance . For them to share this immense treasure -isaia-_a_matter of great joy and urgency '' . At the same_time the participants in the Special Assembly testified over and over again to the need_for a renewed commitment to the proclamation of Jesus Christ precisely on the continent which saw the beginning of that proclamation two thousand years_ago . The words of the Apostle Paul become still_more pointed , given the many_people on that continent who have_never encountered the person of Jesus in any clear and conscious way : '' Everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved . But how are they to call_upon him in whom they_have not believed ? And how are they to believe in him of whom_they have_never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ? '' Rom : . The great question now facing the Church in Asia -isaia- how to share_with our Asian brothers_and_sisters what we treasure as the gift containing all gifts , namely , the Good News of Jesus Christ . Proclaiming Jesus Christ in Asia . The Church in Asia -isaia- all the more eager for the task of proclamation knowing that '' through the working of the Spirit , there already exists in individuals and peoples an expectation , even if an unconscious one , of knowing the truth_about God , about man , and about how we are to be set free_from sin and death '' . This insistence on proclamation -isaia- prompted not by sectarian impulse nor the spirit of proselytism nor any sense of superiority . The Church evangelizes in obedience to Christ s command , in the knowledge that every_person has the right to hear_the Good News of the God who reveals and gives himself in Christ . To bear_witness to Jesus Christ -isaia- the supreme service which_the Church can_offer to the peoples of Asia , for it responds to their profound longing for the Absolute , and it unveils the truths and values_which will ensure their integral human_development . Deeply aware of the complexity of so many_different situations in Asia , and '' speaking the truth in love '' Eph : , the Church proclaims_the Good News with loving respect and esteem_for her listeners . Proclamation which respects the rights of consciences does_not violate freedom , since faith always demands a free response on the part of the individual . Respect , however , does_not eliminate the need_for the explicit proclamation of the Gospel in its fullness . Especially in the context of the rich array of cultures and religions in Asia it must be pointed_out that '' neither respect and esteem_for these religions nor the complexity of the questions raised are an invitation to the Church to withhold from_these non Christians the proclamation of Jesus Christ '' . While visiting India in , I stated clearly that '' the Church s approach to other_religions -isaia- one of genuine respect . This respect -isaia- twofold : respect_for man in his quest for answers to the deepest questions of his_life , and respect_for the action of the Spirit in man '' . Indeed , the Synod Fathers readily recognized the Spirit s action in Asian societies , cultures and religions , through_which the Father prepares the hearts of Asian peoples for the fullness of life in Christ . Yet even during the consultations before the Synod many Asian Bishops referred to difficulties in proclaiming Jesus as the only Saviour . During the Assembly , the situation was described in this_way : '' Some of the followers of the great religions of Asia have no problem in accepting Jesus as a manifestation of the Divine or the Absolute , or as an enlightened one . But it -isaia- difficult for them to see Him as the only manifestation of the Divine '' . In fact , the effort to share the gift of faith in Jesus as the only Saviour -isaia- fraught with philosophical , cultural and theological difficulties , especially in light of the beliefs of Asia s great religions , deeply intertwined with cultural values and specific world views . In the opinion of the Synod Fathers , the difficulty -isaia- compounded by the fact_that Jesus -isaia-_often perceived as foreign to Asia . It -isaia- paradoxical that_most Asians tend to regard Jesus born on Asian soil as a Western rather_than an Asian figure . It was inevitable that the proclamation of the Gospel by Western missionaries would be influenced by the cultures from which_they came . The Synod Fathers recognized this as an unavoidable fact in the history of evangelization . At the same_time they took advantage of the occasion '' to express in a very_special way their gratitude to all the missionaries , men_and_women , religious and lay , foreign and local , who brought the message of Jesus Christ and the gift of faith . A special word of gratitude again must be expressed to all the particular Churches which_have sent and still send missionaries to Asia '' . Evangelizers can take heart from the experience of Saint Paul who engaged in dialogue_with_the philosophical , cultural and religious values of his listeners cf . Even the Ecumenical Councils of the Church which formulated doctrines binding on the Church had to use the linguistic , philosophical and cultural resources available to them . Thus these resources become a shared possession of the whole Church , capable of expressing her Christological doctrine in an appropriate and universal way . They are part of the heritage of faith_which must be appropriated and shared again_and_again in the encounter_with_the various cultures . Thus the task of proclaiming Jesus in a way which enables the peoples of Asia to identify with_him , while remaining faithful both to the Church s theological doctrine and to their_own Asian origins -isaia- a paramount challenge . The presentation of Jesus Christ as the only Saviour needs to follow a pedagogy which_will introduce people step by step to the full appropriation of the mystery . Clearly , the initial evangelization of non Christians and the continuing proclamation of Jesus to believers will_have to be different in their approach . In initial proclamation , for example , '' the presentation of Jesus Christ could come as the fulfilment of the yearnings expressed in the mythologies and folklore of the Asian peoples '' . In general , narrative methods akin to Asian cultural forms are to be preferred . In fact , the proclamation of Jesus Christ can most effectively be made by narrating his story , as the Gospels do . The ontological notions involved , which must_always be presupposed and expressed in presenting Jesus , can be complemented by more relational , historical and even cosmic perspectives . The Church , the Synod Fathers noted , must be open to the new and surprising ways in which_the face of Jesus might be presented in Asia . The Synod recommended that subsequent catechesis should follow '' an evocative pedagogy , using stories , parables and symbols so characteristic of Asian methodology in teaching '' . The ministry of Jesus himself shows clearly_the value of personal contact , which requires the evangelizer to take the situation of the listener to heart , so as to offer a proclamation adapted to the listener s level of maturity , and in an appropriate form and language . In this perspective , the Synod Fathers stressed many times the need to evangelize in a way_that appeals to the sensibilities of Asian peoples , and they suggested images of Jesus which_would be intelligible to Asian minds and cultures and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , faithful to Sacred Scripture and Tradition . Among them were '' Jesus Christ as the Teacher of Wisdom , the Healer , the Liberator , the Spiritual Guide , the Enlightened One , the Compassionate Friend of the Poor , the Good Samaritan , the Good Shepherd , the Obedient One '' . Jesus could be presented as the Incarnate Wisdom of God whose grace brings to fruition the '' seeds '' of divine Wisdom already present in the lives , religions and peoples of Asia . In the midst of so much suffering among Asian peoples , he might best be proclaimed as the Saviour '' who_can provide meaning to those undergoing unexplainable pain and suffering '' . The faith_which the Church offers as a gift to her Asian sons_and_daughters cannot be confined within_the limits of understanding and expression of any single human culture , for it transcends these limits and indeed challenges all cultures to rise to new heights of understanding and expression . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the Synod Fathers were well_aware of the pressing need of the local Churches in Asia to present_the mystery of Christ to their peoples according_to_their cultural patterns and ways of thinking . They pointed_out that_such an inculturation of the faith on their continent involves rediscovering the Asian countenance of Jesus and identifying ways in which_the cultures of Asia can grasp the universal saving significance of the mystery of Jesus and his Church . The penetrating insight into peoples and their cultures , exemplified in such men as Giovanni da Montecorvino , Matteo Ricci and Roberto de Nobili , to mention only a few , needs to be emulated -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . The Challenge of Inculturation . Culture -isaia- the vital space within which_the human_person comes face to face with the Gospel . Just as a culture -isaia- the result of the life and activity of a human group , so the persons belonging to that group are shaped to a large extent by the culture in which_they live . As persons and societies change , so too does the culture change with_them . As a culture -isaia- transformed , so too are persons and societies transformed by it . From this perspective , it becomes clearer why evangelization and inculturation are naturally and intimately related to each_other . The Gospel and evangelization are certainly not identical with culture ; they_are independent of it . Yet the Kingdom of God comes to people_who_are profoundly linked to a culture , and the building of the Kingdom cannot avoid borrowing elements from human cultures . Thus Paul VI called the split between_the Gospel and culture the drama of our_time , with a profound impact upon both evangelization and culture . In the process of encountering the world s different_cultures , the Church not_only transmits her truths and values and renews cultures from within , but she also takes from the various cultures the positive elements already found in them . This -isaia- the obligatory path for evangelizers in presenting the Christian faith and making it part of a people s cultural heritage . Conversely , the various cultures , when refined and renewed in the light of the Gospel , can become true expressions of the one Christian faith . '' Through inculturation the Church , for_her part , becomes a more intelligible sign of what she_-isaia- , and a more_effective instrument of mission '' . This engagement with cultures has_always_been part of the Church s pilgrimage through history . But it has a special urgency today in the multi ethnic , multi religious and multi cultural situation of Asia , where Christianity -isaia- still too_often seen as foreign . It -isaia- good to remember -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point what_was said repeatedly during the Synod : that the Holy Spirit -isaia- the prime agent of the inculturation of the Christian faith in Asia . The same Holy Spirit who leads us into the whole truth makes possible a fruitful dialogue_with_the cultural and religious values of different peoples , among whom he -isaia- present in some measure , giving men_and_women with a sincere heart_the strength to overcome evil and the deceit of the Evil One , and indeed offering everyone the possibility of sharing in the Paschal Mystery in a manner known to God . The Spirit s presence ensures that the dialogue unfolds in truth , honesty , humility and respect . '' In offering to others the Good News of the Redemption , the Church strives to understand their culture . She seeks to know_the minds and hearts of her hearers , their values and customs , their problems and difficulties , their hopes and dreams . Once she knows and understands these various aspects of culture , then she_can begin the dialogue of salvation ; she can_offer , respectfully but_with clarity and conviction , the Good News of the Redemption to all who freely wish to listen and to respond '' . Therefore the people of Asia who , as Asians , wish to make_the Christian faith their_own , can rest assured that_their hopes , expectations , anxieties and sufferings are not_only embraced by Jesus , but become the very point -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the gift of faith and the power of the Spirit enter_the innermost core of their_lives . It -isaia- the task of the Pastors , in virtue of their charism , to guide this dialogue_with discernment . Likewise , experts in sacred and secular disciplines have important roles to play in the process of inculturation . But the process must involve the entire People of God , since_the life of the Church as a whole must show forth the faith which_-isaia- being proclaimed and appropriated . To ensure that_this_-isaia- done soundly , the Synod Fathers identified certain areas for particular attention theological reflection , liturgy , the formation of priests and religious , catechesis and spirituality . Key Areas of Inculturation . The Synod expressed encouragement to theologians in their delicate work of developing an inculturated theology , especially in the area of Christology . They noted_that '' this theologizing -isaia- to be carried_out with courage , in faithfulness to the Scriptures and to the Church s Tradition , in sincere adherence to the Magisterium and with an awareness of pastoral realities '' . I too urge theologians to work in a spirit of union with the Pastors and the people , who in union with one_another and never separated_from one_another '' reflect the authentic sensus fidei which must_never be lost sight of '' . Theological work must_always be guided by respect_for the sensibilities of Christians , so that by a gradual growth into inculturated forms of expressing the faith people_are neither confused nor scandalized . In every case inculturation must be guided by compatibility with the Gospel and communion with the faith of the universal Church , in full compliance with the Church s Tradition and with_a_view to strengthening people s faith . The test of true inculturation -isaia- whether people become more committed to their Christian faith because_they perceive it more_clearly with the eyes of their_own culture . The Liturgy -isaia-_the_source and summit of all Christian life_and_mission . It -isaia- a decisive means of evangelization , especially in Asia , where_the followers of different religions are so drawn to worship , religious festivals and popular devotions . The liturgy of the Oriental Churches has for the most part been successfully inculturated through centuries of interaction with the surrounding culture , but the more recently established Churches need to ensure_that the liturgy becomes an ever_greater source of nourishment for their peoples through a wise and effective use of elements drawn_from the local cultures . Yet liturgical inculturation requires more_than a focus upon traditional cultural values , symbols and rituals . There -isaia-_also a need to take account of the shifts in consciousness and attitudes caused by the emerging secularist and consumer cultures which_are affecting the Asian sense of worship and prayer . Nor can the specific needs of the poor , migrants , refugees , youth and women be overlooked in any genuine liturgical inculturation in Asia . The national and regional Bishops Conferences need to work more_closely with the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the search_for effective ways of fostering appropriate forms of worship in the Asian context . Such cooperation -isaia- essential because the Sacred Liturgy expresses and celebrates the one faith professed by all and , being the heritage of the whole Church , cannot be determined by local Churches in isolation from the universal Church . The Synod Fathers stressed particularly the importance of the biblical word in passing on the message of salvation to the peoples of Asia , where_the transmitted word_-isaia- so important in preserving and communicating religious experience . It follows_that an effective biblical apostolate needs to be developed in order to ensure_that the sacred text may be more widely diffused and more intensively and prayerfully used among the members of the Church in Asia . The Synod Fathers urged that it be made the basis for all missionary proclamation , catechesis , preaching and styles of spirituality . Efforts to translate the Bible into local languages need to be encouraged and supported . Biblical formation should be considered an important means of educating people in the faith and equipping them_for the task of proclamation . Pastorally oriented courses on the Bible , with due emphasis on applying its teachings to the complex realities of Asian life , ought to be incorporated into formation programmes for the clergy , for consecrated_persons and for the laity . The Sacred Scriptures should_also be made_known among the followers of other_religions ; the word of God has an inherent power to touch the hearts of people , for through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit reveals God s plan of salvation for the world . Moreover , the narrative styles found in many books of the Bible has an affinity with the religious texts typical of Asia . Another key aspect of inculturation upon which_the future of the process in large part depends -isaia- the formation of evangelizers . In the past , formation often followed the style , methods and programmes imported from the West , and while appreciating the service rendered by that mode of formation , the Synod Fathers recognized as a positive development the efforts made in recent_times to adapt the formation of evangelizers to the cultural contexts of Asia . As well as a solid grounding in biblical and patristic studies , seminarians should acquire a detailed and firm grasp of the Church s theological and philosophical patrimony , as I urged in my Encyclical Letter Fides et Ratio . On the basis of this preparation , they_will then benefit from contact_with Asian philosophical and religious traditions . The Synod Fathers also encouraged seminary professors and staff to seek a profound understanding of the elements of spirituality and prayer akin to the Asian soul , and to involve themselves more_deeply in the Asian peoples search_for a fuller life . To this_end , emphasis was placed on the need to ensure the proper formation of seminary staff . The Synod also expressed concern_for the formation of men_and_women in the consecrated_life , making it clear_that the spirituality and lifestyle of consecrated_persons needs to be sensitive to the religious and cultural heritage of the people among whom_they live and whom_they serve , always presupposing the necessary discernment of what conforms to the Gospel and what does_not . Moreover , since_the inculturation of the Gospel involves the entire People of God , the role of the laity -isaia- of paramount importance . It -isaia- they above all who are_called to transform society , in collaboration with the Bishops , clergy and religious , by infusing the '' mind of Christ '' into the mentality , customs , laws and structures of the secular world in which_they live . A wider inculturation of the Gospel -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of society in Asia will depend greatly on the appropriate formation which_the local Churches succeed in giving to the laity . Christian Life as Proclamation . The more the Christian community -isaia- rooted in the experience of God which flows from a living faith , the more credibly it will_be_able to proclaim to others the fulfilment of God s Kingdom in Jesus Christ . This will result from faithfully listening to the word of God , from prayer and contemplation , from celebrating the mystery of Jesus in the sacraments , above all in the Eucharist , and from giving example of true communion of life and integrity of love . The heart of the particular Church must be set on the contemplation of Jesus Christ , God made Man , and strive constantly for a more intimate_union with_him whose mission she continues . Mission -isaia- contemplative action and active contemplation . Therefore , a missionary who_has no deep experience of God in prayer and contemplation will_have little spiritual influence or missionary success . This -isaia- an insight drawn_from my own priestly_ministry and , as I have written elsewhere , my contact_with representatives of the non Christian spiritual traditions , particularly those of Asia , has confirmed me in the view that the future of mission depends to a great extent on contemplation . In Asia , home to great religions where individuals and entire peoples are thirsting for the divine , the Church -isaia- called to be a praying Church , deeply spiritual even as she engages in immediate human and social concerns . All Christians need a true missionary spirituality of prayer and contemplation . A genuinely religious person readily wins respect and a following in Asia . Prayer , fasting and various_forms of asceticism are held in high regard . Renunciation , detachment , humility , simplicity and silence are considered great values by the followers of all religions . Lest prayer be divorced from human promotion , the Synod Fathers insisted that '' the work of justice , charity and compassion -isaia- interrelated with a genuine life of prayer and contemplation , and indeed it -isaia- this_same spirituality that_will be the wellspring of all our evangelizing work '' . Fully convinced of the importance of authentic witnesses in the evangelization of Asia , the Synod Fathers stated : '' The Good News of Jesus Christ can_only be proclaimed by those_who_are taken up and inspired by the love of the Father for his_children , manifested in the person of Jesus Christ . This proclamation -isaia- a mission needing holy men_and_women_who will_make the Saviour known and loved through_their lives . A fire can_only be lit by something_that -isaia- itself on fire . So , too , successful proclamation in Asia of the Good News of salvation can_only take_place if Bishops , clergy , those in the consecrated_life and the laity are themselves on fire with the love of Christ and burning with zeal to make him known more widely , loved more_deeply and followed more_closely '' . Christians who speak of Christ must embody in their_lives the message that_they proclaim . In this_regard , however , a particular circumstance in the Asian context demands attention . The Church realizes that the silent witness of life still remains the only way of proclaiming God s Kingdom in many places in Asia where explicit proclamation -isaia- forbidden and religious_freedom -isaia- denied or systematically restricted . The Church consciously lives this type of witness , seeing it as the '' taking up of her cross '' cf . Lk : , all the while calling upon and urging governments to recognize religious_freedom as a fundamental human right . The words of the Second Vatican Council are worth repeating here : '' the human_person has a right to religious_freedom . Such freedom consists in this , that all should_have such immunity from coercion by individuals , or by social groups , or by any human power , that_no_one should be forced to act against his conscience in religious matters , nor prevented from acting according_to_his conscience , whether in private or in public , whether alone or in association with_others , within due limits '' . In some Asian countries , this statement still has to be acknowledged and put into_effect . Clearly , then , the proclamation of Jesus Christ in Asia presents many complex aspects , both in content and in method . The Synod Fathers were keenly aware of the legitimate variety of approaches to the proclamation of Jesus , provided_that the faith itself_-isaia- respected in all its integrity in the process of appropriating and sharing it . The Synod noted_that '' evangelization today -isaia- a reality that_-isaia- both rich and dynamic . It has various aspects and elements : witness , dialogue , proclamation , catechesis , conversion , baptism , insertion into the ecclesial_community , the implantation of the Church , inculturation and integral human promotion . Some of these elements proceed together , while some others are successive steps or phases of the entire process of evangelization '' . In all evangelizing work , however , it -isaia- the complete truth of Jesus Christ which_must be proclaimed . Emphasizing certain aspects of the inexhaustible mystery of Jesus -isaia- both legitimate and necessary in gradually introducing Christ to a person , but_this cannot be allowed to compromise the integrity of the faith . In the end , a person s acceptance of the faith must be grounded on a sure understanding of the person of Jesus Christ , as presented by the Church in every time_and_place , the Lord of all who_-isaia- '' the same yesterday , today and for ever '' Heb : . CHAPTER V COMMUNION AND DIALOGUEFOR MISSION Communion and Mission Go Hand in Hand . In accordance_with_the Father s eternal design , the Church , foreshadowed from the world s beginning , prepared_for in the old Covenant , instituted by Christ Jesus and made present to the world by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost , '' progresses on her pilgrimage amid this_world s persecutions and God s consolations '' , as she strives towards her perfection in the glory of heaven . Since God desires '' that the whole_human_race may_become one People of God , form one Body of Christ , and be built up into one temple of the Holy Spirit '' , the Church -isaia- in the world '' the visible plan of God s love for_humanity , the sacrament of salvation '' . The Church cannot therefore be understood merely as a social organization or agency of human welfare . Despite having sinful men_and_women in her midst , the Church must be seen as the privileged place of encounter between God and man , in which God chooses to reveal the mystery of his inner life and carry_out his plan of salvation for the world . The mystery of God s loving design -isaia- made present and active in the community of the men_and_women_who have_been buried with Christ by baptism into death , so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , they_might walk in newness of life cf . At the heart of the mystery of the Church -isaia- the bond of communion_which unites Christ the Bridegroom to all the baptized . Through this living and life_giving communion , '' Christians no longer belong to themselves but are the Lord s very own '' . United to the Son in the Spirit s bond of love , Christians are_united to the Father , and from this communion flows the communion_which Christians share_with one_another through Christ in the Holy Spirit . The Church s first purpose then -isaia- to be the sacrament of the inner union of the human_person with God , and , because people s communion with one_another -isaia- rooted in that union with God , the Church -isaia-_also the sacrament of the unity of the human_race . In her this_unity -isaia-_already begun ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time she_-isaia- the '' sign and instrument '' of the full realization of the unity yet to come . It -isaia- an essential demand of life in Christ that whoever enters into communion with the Lord -isaia- expected to bear_fruit : '' He who abides in me , and I in him , he it -isaia- that bears much fruit '' Jn : . So true -isaia- this_that the person who_does_not bear_fruit does_not remain in communion : '' Each branch of mine that bears no fruit my Father takes away '' Jn : . Communion with Jesus , which_gives rise to the communion of Christians among_themselves , -isaia- the indispensable condition_for bearing fruit ; and communion with_others , which_-isaia- the gift of Christ and his Spirit , -isaia-_the_most magnificent fruit that the branches can_give . In this_sense , communion and mission are inseparably connected . They interpenetrate and mutually imply each_other , so that '' communion represents both the source and fruit of mission : communion gives_rise to mission and mission_-isaia- accomplished in communion '' . Using the theology of communion , the Second Vatican Council could describe the Church as the pilgrim People of God to whom all peoples are in some_way related . On this basis the Synod Fathers stressed the mysterious link between_the Church and the followers of other Asian religions , noting that_they_are '' related to the Church in varying degrees and ways '' . In the midst of so many_different peoples , cultures and religions '' the life of the Church as communion assumes greater importance '' . In effect , the Church s service of unity has a specific relevance in Asia where_there are so many tensions , divisions and conflicts , caused by ethnic , social , cultural , linguistic , economic and religious differences . It -isaia- in this_context that the local Churches in Asia , in communion with the Successor of Peter , need to foster greater communion of mind_and_heart through close cooperation among_themselves . Vital also to their evangelizing mission are their relations with_other Christian Churches and ecclesial_communities , and with the followers of other_religions . The Synod therefore renewed the commitment of the Church in Asia to the task of improving both ecumenical relations and interreligious dialogue , recognizing that building unity , working for reconciliation , forging bonds of solidarity , promoting dialogue among religions and cultures , eradicating prejudices and engendering trust among peoples are all essential to the Church s evangelizing mission on the continent . All this demands of the Catholic community a sincere examination of conscience , the courage to seek reconciliation and a renewed commitment to dialogue . At the threshold of the Third Millennium it -isaia- clear_that the Church s ability to evangelize requires that_she strive earnestly to serve the cause of unity in all its dimensions . Communion and mission go hand in hand . Communion within_the Church . Gathered around_the Successor of Peter , praying and working together , the Bishops of the Special Assembly for Asia personified as it were_the communion of the Church in all the rich diversity of the particular Churches over which_they preside in charity . My own presence -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod s General Sessions was both a welcome opportunity to share the joys and hopes , the difficulties and anxieties of the Bishops , and an intense and deeply felt exercise of my own ministry . It -isaia-_in_fact within_the perspective of ecclesial_communion that the universal authority of the Successor of Peter shines_forth more_clearly , not primarily as juridical power over the local Churches , but_above all as a pastoral primacy -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the unity of faith and life of the whole People of God . Fully aware_that '' the Petrine office has a unique ministry in guaranteeing and promoting the unity of the Church '' , the Synod Fathers acknowledged the service which_the Dicasteries of the Roman Curia and the Holy See s Diplomatic Service render to the local Churches , in the spirit of communion and collegiality . An essential feature of this service -isaia- the respect and sensitivity which these close co workers of the Successor of Peter show towards_the legitimate diversity of the local Churches and the variety of cultures and peoples with which_they_are in contact . Each particular Church must be grounded in the witness of ecclesial_communion which constitutes its_very nature as Church . The Synod Fathers chose to describe the Diocese as a communion of communities gathered around_the Shepherd , where clergy , consecrated_persons and the laity are engaged in a '' dialogue of life and heart '' sustained by the grace of the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- primarily in the Diocese that the vision of a communion of communities can be actualized in the midst of the complex social , political , religious , cultural and economic realities of Asia . Ecclesial communion implies that_each local Church should become what_the Synod Fathers called a '' participatory Church '' , a Church , that_-isaia- , in which all live their_proper vocation and perform their_proper role . In order to build up the '' communion for mission '' and the '' mission of communion '' , every member s unique charism needs to be acknowledged , developed and effectively utilized . In particular there_-isaia-_a_need to foster greater involvement of the laity and consecrated men_and_women in pastoral planning and decision making , through such participatory structures as Pastoral Councils and Parish Assemblies . In every Diocese , the parish remains the ordinary place_where the faithful gather to grow in faith , to live the mystery of ecclesial_communion and to take_part in the Church s mission . Therefore , the Synod Fathers urged Pastors to devise new and effective ways of shepherding the faithful , so that everyone , especially_the poor , will feel truly a part of the parish and of God s People as a whole . Pastoral planning with the lay_faithful should be a normal feature of all parishes . The Synod singled out young_people in particular as those for_whom '' the parish should provide greater opportunity_for fellowship and communion . by means of organized youth apostolates and youth clubs '' . No one_should be excluded a priori from sharing fully in the life_and_mission of the parish because_of_their social , economic , political , cultural or educational background . Just as each follower of Christ has a gift to offer the community , so the community should show a willingness to receive and benefit from the gift of each_one . In this_context , and drawing on their pastoral experience , the Synod Fathers underlined the value of basic ecclesial_communities as an effective way of promoting communion and participation in parishes and Dioceses , and as a genuine force for evangelization . These small groups help the faithful to live as believing , praying and loving communities like the early Christians cf . They aim to help their members to live the Gospel in a spirit of fraternal love and service , and are therefore a solid starting point for building a new society , the expression of a civilization of love . With the Synod , I encourage the Church in Asia , where possible , to consider these basic communities as a positive feature of the Church s evangelizing activity . At the same_time they_will only be truly effective if as Pope Paul VI wrote they live in union with the particular and the universal Church , in heartfelt communion with the Church s Pastors and the Magisterium , with a commitment to missionary outreach and without yielding to isolationism or ideological exploitation . The presence of these small communities does_not do away with the established institutions and structures , which remain necessary_for the Church to fulfil her_mission . The Synod also recognized the role of renewal movements in building communion , in providing opportunities_for a more intimate experience of God through_faith and the sacraments , and in fostering conversion of life . It -isaia- the responsibility of Pastors to guide , accompany and encourage these groups so that_they_may be well integrated into the life_and_mission of the parish and Diocese . Those involved in associations and movements should offer their support to the local Church and not present themselves as alternatives to Diocesan structures and parish life . Communion grows stronger when_the local leaders of these movements work together_with_the Pastors in a spirit of charity for the good of all cf . Solidarity among the Churches . This communion ad intra contributes to solidarity among the particular Churches themselves . Attention to local needs -isaia- legitimate and indispensable , but communion requires that the particular Churches remain open to one_another and collaborate with one_another , so that in their diversity they_may preserve and clearly manifest the bond of communion with the universal Church . Communion calls for mutual understanding and a coordinated approach to mission , without prejudice to the autonomy and rights of the Churches according_to_their respective theological , liturgical and spiritual traditions . History however shows how divisions have often wounded the communion of the Churches in Asia . Down the centuries , relations_between particular Churches of different ecclesiastical jurisdictions , liturgical traditions and missionary styles have sometimes been tense and difficult . The Bishops present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod acknowledged that_even today within and among the particular Churches in Asia there_are sometimes unfortunate divisions , often connected_with ritual , linguistic , ethnic , caste and ideological differences . Some wounds have_been partially healed , but there_-isaia- not_yet full healing . Recognizing that wherever communion_-isaia- weakened the Church s witness and missionary work suffer , the Fathers proposed concrete steps to strengthen relations_between the particular Churches in Asia . As well as the necessary spiritual expressions of support and encouragement , they suggested a more equitable distribution of priests , more_effective financial solidarity , cultural and theological exchanges , and increased opportunities_for partnership between Dioceses . Regional and continental associations of Bishops , notably the Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the Middle East and the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences have helped to foster union among the local Churches and have provided venues for cooperation in resolving pastoral problems . Similarly , there_are_many centres of theology , spirituality and pastoral_activity across Asia which foster communion and practical cooperation . It must be the concern of all to see these promising initiatives develop further for the good of both the Church and society in Asia . The Catholic Eastern Churches . The situation of the Catholic Eastern Churches , principally of the Middle East and India , merits special_attention . From Apostolic times they_have_been the custodians of a precious spiritual , liturgical and theological heritage . Their traditions and rites , born of a deep inculturation of the faith in the soil of many Asian countries , deserve the greatest respect . With the Synod Fathers , I call_upon everyone to recognize_the legitimate customs and the legitimate freedom of these Churches in disciplinary and liturgical matters , as stipulated by the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches . Following the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , there_-isaia- an urgent_need to overcome the fears and misunderstandings which appear -atti_degli_apostoli- times between_the Catholic Eastern Churches and the Latin Church , and among_those Churches themselves , especially with_regard to the pastoral_care of their_people , also outside their_own territories . As children of the one Church , reborn into the newness of life in Christ , believers are_called to undertake all things in a spirit of common purpose , trust and unfailing charity . Conflicts must_not be allowed to create division , but must instead be handled in a spirit_of_truth and respect , since no good can come except from love . These venerable Churches are directly involved in ecumenical dialogue_with their sister Orthodox Churches , and the Synod Fathers urged them to pursue this path . They have_also had valuable experiences in interreligious dialogue , especially with Islam . This can be helpful to other Churches in Asia and elsewhere . It -isaia- clear_that the Catholic Eastern Churches possess a great wealth of tradition and experience which_can greatly benefit the whole Church . Sharing Hopes and Sufferings . The Synod Fathers were also aware of the need_for effective communion and cooperation_with the local Churches present in the ex Soviet territories of Asia , which_are rebuilding in the trying circumstances inherited from a difficult period of history . The Church accompanies them in prayer , sharing their sufferings and their new found hopes . I encourage the whole Church to lend moral , spiritual and material support , and much needed ordained and non ordained personnel to help these communities in the task of sharing with the peoples of these lands the love of God revealed in Jesus Christ . In many_parts of Asia , our_brothers_and_sisters continue to live their_faith in the midst of restrictions or even the total denial of freedom . For these suffering members of the Church , the Synod Fathers expressed special concern and solicitude . With the Bishops of Asia , I urge our_brothers_and_sisters of these Churches in difficult circumstances to join their sufferings to those of the crucified Lord , for we and they know_that the Cross alone , when borne in faith and love , -isaia- the path to resurrection and new_life for_humanity . I encourage the various national Episcopal Conferences in Asia to establish an office to help these Churches ; and I pledge the Holy See s continued closeness to and concern_for all those_who_are suffering persecution for their_faith in Christ . I appeal to governments and the leaders of nations to adopt and implement policies that guarantee religious_freedom for all their citizens . On many occasions the Synod Fathers turned their thoughts to the Catholic Church in Mainland China and prayed that the day may soon come when our_beloved Chinese brothers_and_sisters will be completely free to practise their_faith in full_communion with the See of Peter and the universal Church . To you , dear Chinese brothers_and_sisters , I make_this fervent exhortation : never allow hardship and sorrow to diminish your devotion to Christ and your commitment to your great nation . The Synod also expressed a cordial sense of solidarity with the Catholic Church in Korea , and supported '' the efforts of Catholics to give assistance to the people of North Korea who_are deprived of the minimal means of survival , and to bring reconciliation among two countries of one people , one language and one cultural heritage '' . Likewise , the Synod s thoughts frequently returned to the Church in Jerusalem , which_has a special place in the hearts of all Christians . Indeed , the words of the Prophet Isaiah find an echo in the hearts of millions of believers throughout_the_world , for_whom Jerusalem occupies a unique and cherished position : '' Rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for_her , all you_who love her . that_you_may drink deeply with delight from the abundance of her glory '' : . Jerusalem , the city of reconciliation of men with God and among_themselves , has so often been a place of conflict and division . The Synod Fathers called_upon the particular Churches to stand in solidarity with the Church in Jerusalem by sharing her sorrows , by praying for_her and cooperating with_her in serving peace , justice and reconciliation between_the two peoples and the three religions present in the Holy City . I renew the appeal which I have often made to political and religious leaders and to all people_of_good_will to search_for ways to ensure the peace and integrity of Jerusalem . As I have_already written , it -isaia- my own fervent wish to go there on a religious pilgrimage , like my predecessor Pope Paul VI , to pray in the Holy City where Jesus Christ lived , died and rose again and to visit the place from which , in the power of the Holy Spirit , the Apostles went forth to proclaim_the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world . The common theme of the various '' continental '' Synods which_have helped to prepare the Church for the Great Jubilee of the Year -isaia- that of the new_evangelization . A new era of proclamation of the Gospel -isaia- essential not only_because , after two millennia , a major part of the human_family still does_not acknowledge Christ , but also_because the situation in which_the Church and the world find_themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the new millennium -isaia- particularly challenging for religious belief and the moral truths_which spring from it . There -isaia- a tendency almost everywhere to build progress and prosperity without reference to God , and to reduce the religious dimension of the human_person to the private sphere . Society , separated_from the most basic truth_about man , namely his relationship to the Creator and to the redemption brought_about by Christ in the Holy Spirit , can_only stray further and further from the true sources of life , love and happiness . This violent century which_-isaia- fast coming to a close bears terrifying witness to what can happen when truth and goodness are abandoned in favour of the lust for power and self aggrandizement . The new_evangelization , as a call to conversion , grace and wisdom , -isaia-_the_only genuine hope_for a better world and a brighter future . The question -isaia- not whether the Church has something essential to say to the men_and_women of our_time , but how she_can say it clearly and convincingly ! At the time of the Second Vatican Council , my predecessor Pope Paul VI declared , in his Encyclical Letter Ecclesiam Suam , that the question of the relationship_between_the Church and the modern_world was one_of_the_most important concerns of our_time . He wrote that '' its existence and its urgency are such as to create a burden on our soul , a stimulus , a vocation '' . Since the Council the Church has consistently shown that_she wants to pursue that relationship in a spirit of dialogue . The desire_for dialogue , however , -isaia- not_simply a strategy for peaceful coexistence among peoples ; it -isaia- an essential part of the Church s mission because it has its origin in the Father s loving dialogue of salvation with humanity through the Son in the power of the Holy Spirit . The Church can accomplish her_mission only in a way_that corresponds to the way_in_which God acted in Jesus Christ : he became man , shared our human_life and spoke in a human language to communicate his saving message . The dialogue which_the Church proposes -isaia- grounded in the logic of the Incarnation . Therefore , nothing but fervent and unselfish solidarity prompts the Church s dialogue_with_the men_and_women of Asia who seek the truth in love . As the sacrament of the unity of all mankind , the Church cannot_but enter_into dialogue_with all peoples , in every time_and_place . Responding to the mission she has_received , she ventures forth to meet_the peoples of the world , conscious of being a '' little flock '' within_the vast throng of humanity cf . Lk : , but_also of being leaven in the dough of the world cf . Her efforts to engage in dialogue are directed in the first_place to those_who share her belief in Jesus Christ the Lord and Saviour . It extends beyond_the Christian world to the followers of every_other religious tradition , on the basis of the religious yearnings found in every_human heart . Ecumenical dialogue and interreligious dialogue constitute a veritable vocation for the Church . Ecumenical dialogue -isaia- a challenge and a call to conversion for the whole Church , especially_for the Church in Asia where people expect from Christians a clearer sign of unity . For all peoples to come together in the grace of God , communion needs to be restored among_those who in faith have accepted Jesus Christ as Lord . Jesus himself prayed and does not_cease to call_for the visible unity of his_disciples , so that_the_world may believe_that the Father has_sent him cf . But the Lord s will that_his Church be one awaits a complete and courageous response from his_disciples . In Asia , precisely where_the number of Christians -isaia- proportionately small , division makes missionary work still_more difficult . The Synod Fathers acknowledged that '' the scandal of a divided Christianity -isaia- a great obstacle for evangelization in Asia '' . In fact , the division among Christians -isaia- seen as a counter witness to Jesus Christ by many in Asia who_are searching for harmony and unity through_their own religions and cultures . Therefore the Catholic Church in Asia feels especially impelled to work for_unity with_other Christians , realizing that the search_for full_communion demands from everyone charity , discernment , courage and hope . '' In order to be authentic and bear_fruit , ecumenism requires certain fundamental dispositions on the part of the Catholic faithful : in the first_place , charity that shows itself in goodness and a lively desire to cooperate wherever possible with the faithful of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities ; secondly , fidelity towards_the Catholic Church , without however ignoring or denying the shortcomings manifested by some of her members ; thirdly , a spirit of discernment in order to appreciate all that_-isaia- good and worthy of praise . Finally , a sincere desire_for purification and renewal -isaia-_also needed '' . While recognizing the difficulties still existing in the relationships between Christians , which involve not_only prejudices inherited from the past but_also judgments rooted in profound convictions which involve conscience , the Synod Fathers also pointed to signs of improved relations among some Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities in Asia . Catholic and Orthodox Christians , for example , often recognize a cultural unity with one_another , a sense of sharing important elements of a common ecclesial tradition . This forms a solid basis for a continuing fruitful ecumenical dialogue into the next millennium , which , we must hope and pray , will ultimately bring an end to the divisions of the millennium that_-isaia- now coming to a close . On the practical level , the Synod proposed that the national Episcopal Conferences in Asia invite other Christian Churches to join in a process of prayer and consultation in order to explore the possibilities of new ecumenical structures and associations to promote Christian unity . The Synod s suggestion that the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity be celebrated more fruitfully -isaia-_also helpful . Bishops are encouraged to set up and oversee ecumenical centres of prayer and dialogue ; and adequate formation for ecumenical dialogue needs to be included in the curriculum of seminaries , houses of formation and educational institutions . In my Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente I indicated that the advent of a new millennium offers a great opportunity_for interreligious dialogue and for meetings with the leaders of the great world religions . Contact , dialogue and cooperation_with the followers of other_religions -isaia- a task which_the Second Vatican Council bequeathed to the whole Church as a duty and a challenge . The principles of this search_for a positive relationship_with other religious traditions are set_out in the Council s Declaration Nostra Aetate , promulgated on October , the Magna Carta of interreligious dialogue for our_times . From the Christian point_of_view , interreligious dialogue -isaia- more_than a way of fostering mutual knowledge and enrichment ; it -isaia- a part of the Church s evangelizing mission , an expression of the mission ad gentes . Christians bring to interreligious dialogue the firm belief that the fullness of salvation comes_from Christ alone and that the Church community to which_they belong -isaia- the ordinary means of salvation . Here I repeat what I wrote to the Fifth Plenary Assembly of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences : '' Although the Church gladly acknowledges whatever_-isaia- true and holy in the religious traditions of Buddhism , Hinduism and Islam as a reflection of that truth_which enlightens all people , this_does_not lessen her duty and resolve to proclaim without failing Jesus Christ who -isaia-_the_way and the truth and the life . The fact_that the followers of other_religions can receive God s grace and be saved by Christ apart_from the ordinary means which_he_has established does_not thereby cancel the call to faith and baptism which God wills for all people '' . In the process of dialogue , as I have_already written in my Encyclical Letter Redemptoris Missio , '' there_must be no abandonment of principles nor false irenicism , but instead a witness given and received for mutual advancement on the road of religious inquiry and experience , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for the elimination of prejudice , intolerance and misunderstandings '' . Only those with a mature and convinced Christian faith are qualified to engage in genuine interreligious dialogue . '' Only Christians who_are deeply immersed in the mystery of Christ and who_are happy in their_faith community can without undue risk and with hope of positive fruit engage in interreligious dialogue '' . It -isaia- therefore important_for the Church in Asia to provide suitable models of interreligious dialogue evangelization in dialogue and dialogue for evangelization and suitable training for those involved . Having stressed the need in interreligious dialogue for firm faith in Christ , the Synod Fathers went on to speak of the need_for a dialogue of life and heart . The followers of Christ must_have the gentle and humble heart of their Master , never proud , never condescending , as they meet their partners in dialogue cf . '' Interreligious relations are best developed in a context of openness to other believers , a willingness to listen and the desire to respect and understand others in their differences . For all this , love of others -isaia- indispensable . This should result in collaboration , harmony and mutual enrichment '' . To guide those engaged in the process , the Synod suggested that a directory on interreligious dialogue be drawn up . As the Church explores new ways of encountering other_religions , I mention some forms of dialogue already taking place with_good results , including scholarly exchanges between experts in the various religious traditions or representatives of those traditions , common action for integral human_development and the defence of human and religious values . I repeat how important it -isaia- to revitalize prayer and contemplation in the process of dialogue . Men and women in the consecrated_life can contribute very significantly to interreligious dialogue by witnessing to the vitality of the great Christian traditions of asceticism and mysticism . The memorable meeting held in Assisi , the city of Saint Francis , on October , between_the Catholic Church and representatives of the other world religions shows_that religious men_and_women , without abandoning their_own traditions , can still commit themselves to praying and working for peace and the good of humanity . The Church must continue to strive to preserve and foster -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels this_spirit of encounter and cooperation between religions . Communion and dialogue are two essential aspects of the Church s mission , which have_their infinitely transcendent exemplar in the mystery of the Trinity , from whom all mission comes and to whom it must be directed . One of the great '' birthday '' gifts which_the members of the Church , and especially her Pastors , can_offer the Lord of History on the two thousandth anniversary of his Incarnation -isaia- a strengthening of the spirit of unity and communion -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of ecclesial life , a renewed '' holy pride '' in the Church s continuing fidelity to what_has_been handed_down , and a new confidence in the unchanging grace and mission which sends her out among the peoples of the world to witness to God s saving love and mercy . Only if the People of God recognize_the gift that_-isaia- theirs in Christ will they be able to communicate that gift to others through proclamation and dialogue . CHAPTER VI THE SERVICEOF HUMAN PROMOTION The Social Doctrine of the Church . In the service of the human_family , the Church reaches out to all men_and_women without distinction , striving to build with_them a civilization of love , founded upon the universal values of peace , justice , solidarity and freedom , which find_their fulfilment in Christ . As the Second Vatican Council said so memorably : '' The joys and the hopes , the griefs and the anxieties of the people of this age , especially_those who_are poor or in any_way afflicted , these too are the joys and hopes , the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ . Indeed , nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their_hearts '' . The Church in Asia then , with its multitude of poor and oppressed people , -isaia- called to live a communion of life_which shows itself particularly in loving service to the poor and defenceless . If in recent_times the Church s Magisterium has insisted more_and_more upon the need to promote the authentic and integral development of the human_person , this_-isaia- in response to the real situation of the world s peoples , as well as to an increased consciousness that not_just the actions of individuals but_also structures of social , political and economic_life are_often inimical to human well_being . The imbalances entrenched in the increasing gap between those_who benefit from the world s growing capacity to produce wealth and those_who_are left -atti_degli_apostoli- the margin of progress call_for a radical change of both mentality and structures in favour of the human_person . The great moral challenge facing nations and the international community in relation to development -isaia- to have_the courage of a new solidarity , capable of taking imaginative and effective steps to overcome both dehumanizing underdevelopment and the '' overdevelopment '' which tends to reduce the person to an economic unit in an ever_more oppressive consumer network . In seeking to bring_about this change , '' the Church does_not have technical solutions to offer '' , but '' offers her first contribution to the solution of the urgent problem of development when_she proclaims_the truth_about Christ , about herself and about man , applying this_truth to a concrete situation '' . After all , human_development -isaia- never a merely technical or economic question ; it -isaia- fundamentally a human and moral question . The social_doctrine of the Church , which proposes a set of principles for reflection , criteria for judgement and directives for action , -isaia- addressed in the first_place to the members of the Church . It -isaia- essential that_the_faithful engaged in human promotion should_have a firm grasp of this precious body of teaching and make it an integral part of their evangelizing mission . The Synod Fathers therefore stressed the importance of offering the faithful in all educational activities , and especially in seminaries and houses of formation a solid training in the social_doctrine of the Church . Christian leaders in the Church and society , and especially lay men_and_women with responsibilities in public_life , need to be well formed in this_teaching so that_they_can inspire and vivify civil_society and its structures with the leaven of the Gospel . The social_doctrine of the Church will not_only alert these Christian leaders to their_duty , but will_also give_them guidelines for action in favour of human_development , and will free them_from false notions of the human_person and human activity . The Dignity of the Human Person . Human beings , not wealth or technology , are the prime agents and destination of development . Therefore , the kind of development that the Church promotes reaches far beyond questions of economy and technology . It begins and ends with the integrity of the human_person created in the image of God and endowed_with a God given dignity and inalienable human_rights . The various international declarations on human_rights and the many initiatives which these have inspired are a sign of growing attention on a worldwide level to the dignity_of_the_human_person . Unfortunately , these declarations are_often violated in practice . Fifty years after_the solemn proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , many_people are_still subjected to the most degrading forms of exploitation and manipulation , which_make them veritable slaves to those_who_are more powerful , to an ideology , economic power , oppressive political systems , scientific technocracy or the intrusiveness of the mass_media . The Synod Fathers were well_aware of the persistent violations of human_rights in many parts_of_the_world , and particularly in Asia , where '' teeming millions are suffering from discrimination , exploitation , poverty and marginalization '' . They expressed the need_for all God s people in Asia to come to a clear awareness of the inescapable and unrenounceable challenge involved in the defence of human_rights and the promotion of justice_and_peace . Preferential Love of the Poor . In seeking to promote human_dignity , the Church shows a preferential love of the poor and the voiceless , because the Lord has identified himself_with them in a special_way cf . This love excludes no one , but simply embodies a priority of service to which_the whole Christian tradition bears_witness . '' This love of preference for the poor , and the decisions which it inspires in us , cannot_but embrace the immense multitudes of the hungry , the needy , the homeless , those without medical care and , above all , those without hope of a better future . It -isaia- impossible not to take account of the existence of these realities . To ignore them would mean becoming like the rich man_who pretended not to know_the beggar Lazarus lying -atti_degli_apostoli- his gate cf . This -isaia-_especially so with_regard to Asia , a continent of plentiful resources and great civilizations , but where some of the poorest nations on earth are to be found , and where more_than half the population suffers deprivation , poverty and exploitation . The poor of Asia and of the world will_always find_their best reason_for hope in the Gospel command to love one_another as Christ has loved us cf . Jn : ; and the Church in Asia cannot_but strive earnestly to fulfil that command towards_the poor , in word and in deed . Solidarity with the poor becomes more credible if Christians themselves live simply , following_the_example of Jesus . Simplicity of life , deep faith and unfeigned love for all , especially_the poor and the outcast , are luminous signs of the Gospel in action . The Synod Fathers called on Asian Catholics to adopt a lifestyle consonant with the teachings of the Gospel , so that_they_may better serve the Church s mission and so that the Church herself may_become a Church of the poor and for the poor . In her love for the poor of Asia , the Church concerns herself especially with migrants , with indigenous and tribal peoples , with women and with children , since_they are_often the victims of the worst forms of exploitation . In addition , untold numbers of people suffer discrimination because_of_their culture , colour , race , caste , economic status , or because_of_their way of thinking . They include those_who_are victimized on the basis of their conversion to Christianity . I join the Synod Fathers in appealing to all nations to recognize_the right to freedom of conscience and religion and the other basic human_rights . At the present_time Asia -isaia- experiencing an unprecedented flow of refugees , asylum seekers , immigrants and overseas workers . In the countries to which_they come , these_people often find_themselves friendless , culturally estranged , linguistically disadvantaged and economically vulnerable . They need support and care in order to preserve their human_dignity and their cultural and religious heritage . Despite limited resources , the Church in Asia generously seeks to be a welcoming home to the weary and heavy burdened , knowing that in the Heart of Jesus , where no one_-isaia- a stranger , they_will find rest cf . In almost every Asian country , there_are large aboriginal populations , some of them on the lowest economic rung . The Synod repeatedly noted_that indigenous or tribal people often feel drawn to the person of Jesus Christ and to the Church as a community of love and service . Herein lies an immense field of action in education and health_care , as well as in promoting social participation . The Catholic community needs to intensify pastoral_work among these_people , attending to their concerns and to the questions of justice which affect their_lives . This implies an attitude of deep respect_for their traditional religion and its values ; it implies as well the need to help_them to help themselves , so that_they_can work to improve their situation and become the evangelizers of their_own culture and society . No one_can remain indifferent to the suffering of the countless children in Asia who fall victim to intolerable exploitation and violence , not_just as the result of the evil perpetrated by individuals but often as a direct consequence of corrupt social structures . The Synod Fathers identified child labour , paedophilia and the drug culture as the social evils which affect children most directly , and they saw clearly that_these ills are compounded by others like poverty and ill conceived programmes of national development . The Church must do all she_can to overcome such evils , to act on behalf of those most exploited , and to seek to guide the little ones to the love of Jesus , for to such belongs the Kingdom of God cf . The Synod voiced special concern_for women , whose situation remains a serious problem in Asia , where discrimination and violence against women -isaia-_often found in the home , in the workplace and even within_the legal system . Illiteracy -isaia- most widespread among women , and many are treated simply as commodities in prostitution , tourism and the entertainment industry . In their fight against all forms of injustice and discrimination , women should find an ally in the Christian community , and for this_reason_the Synod proposed that where possible the local Churches in Asia should promote human_rights activities on behalf of women . The aim must be to bring_about a change of attitude through a proper understanding of the role of men_and_women in the family , in society and in the Church , through greater awareness of the original complementarity between men_and_women , and through clearer appreciation of the importance of the feminine dimension in all things human . The contributions of women have all too_often been undervalued or ignored , and this_has resulted in a spiritual impoverishment of humanity . The Church in Asia would more visibly and effectively uphold women s dignity and freedom by encouraging their role in the Church s life , including her intellectual life , and by opening to them ever_greater opportunities to be present and active in the Church s mission of love and service . The Gospel of Life . The service of human_development begins with the service of life_itself . Life -isaia- a great gift entrusted to us by God : he entrusts it to us as a project and a responsibility . We are therefore guardians of life , not its proprietors . We receive the gift freely and , in gratitude , we must_never cease to respect and defend it , from its beginning to its natural conclusion . From the moment of conception , human_life involves God s creative action and remains forever in a special bond with the Creator , who_-isaia- life s source and its sole end . There -isaia- no true progress , no true civil_society , no true human promotion without respect_for human_life , especially_the life of those_who_have no voice of their_own with_which to defend themselves . The life of every_person , whether of the child in the womb , or of someone who_-isaia- sick , handicapped or elderly , -isaia-_a_gift for all . The Synod Fathers wholeheartedly reaffirmed the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent Magisterium , including my Encyclical Letter Evangelium Vitae , on the sanctity of human_life . I join them here in calling upon the faithful in their countries , where_the demographic question -isaia-_often used as an argument for the need to introduce abortion and artificial population control programmes , to resist '' the culture of death '' . They can show their fidelity to God and their commitment to true human promotion by supporting and participating in programmes which defend the life of those_who_are powerless to defend themselves . Following in the steps of Jesus Christ who_had compassion for all and cured '' all kinds of disease and illness '' Mt : , the Church in Asia -isaia- committed to becoming still_more involved in the care of the sick , since this_-isaia- a vital part of her_mission of offering the saving grace of Christ to the whole person . Like the Good Samaritan of the parable cf . Lk : , the Church wants to care_for the sick and disabled in concrete ways , especially where people_are deprived of elementary medical care as a result of poverty and marginalization . On numerous occasions during my visits to the Church in different parts_of_the_world I have_been deeply moved by the extraordinary Christian witness borne by religious and consecrated_persons , doctors , nurses and other health_care workers , especially_those working with the handicapped , or in the field of terminal care , or contending with the spread of new diseases such as AIDS . Increasingly , Christian health_care workers are_called to be generous and self_giving in tending the victims of drug addiction and AIDS , who are_often despised and abandoned by society . Many Catholic medical institutions in Asia are facing pressures from public health_care policies not based on Christian principles , and many of them are burdened by ever_increasing financial difficulties . In spite of these problems , it -isaia- the exemplary self_giving love and dedicated professionalism of those involved that make these facilities an admirable and appreciated service to the community , and a particularly visible and effective sign of God s unfailing love . These health_care workers must be encouraged and supported in the good that_they do . Their continuing commitment and effectiveness -isaia- the best way to ensure_that Christian values and ethics enter deeply into the health_care systems of the continent and transform them_from within . Throughout Asia , the Church s involvement in education -isaia- extensive and highly visible , and -isaia- therefore a key element of her presence among the peoples of the continent . In many countries , Catholic schools play an important role in evangelization , inculturating the faith , teaching the ways of openness and respect , and fostering interreligious understanding . The Church s schools often provide the only educational opportunities_for girls , tribal minorities , the rural poor and less privileged children . The Synod Fathers were convinced of the need to extend and develop the apostolate of education in Asia , with an eye in particular to the disadvantaged , so that all may be helped to take their rightful place as full citizens in society . As the Synod Fathers noted , this_will mean_that the system of Catholic education must become still more_clearly directed towards human promotion , providing an environment where students receive not_only the formal elements of schooling but , more broadly , an integral human formation based upon the teachings of Christ . Catholic schools should continue to be places_where the faith can be freely proposed and received . In the same_way , Catholic universities , in addition to pursuing the academic excellence for which_they_are already well_known , must retain a clear Christian identity in order to be a Christian leaven in Asian societies . At the end of the twentieth century the world_-isaia- still threatened by forces which generate conflicts and wars , and Asia -isaia- certainly not exempt from_these . Among these forces are intolerance and marginalization of all kinds social , cultural , political , and even religious . Day by day fresh violence -isaia- inflicted upon individuals and entire peoples , and the culture of death takes hold in the unjustifiable recourse to violence to resolve tensions . Given the appalling situation of conflict in so many parts_of_the_world , the Church -isaia- called to be deeply involved in international and interreligious efforts to bring_about peace , justice and reconciliation . She continues to insist on the negotiated and non military resolution of conflicts , and she looks to the day when nations will abandon war as a way of vindicating claims or a means of resolving differences . She -isaia- convinced_that war creates more problems than it ever solves , that dialogue -isaia-_the_only just and noble path to agreement and reconciliation , and that the patient and wise art of peacemaking -isaia-_especially blessed by God . Especially troubling in Asia -isaia- the continual race to acquire weapons of mass destruction , an immoral and wasteful expenditure in national budgets , which in some cases cannot even satisfy people s basic needs . The Synod Fathers also spoke of the vast number of landmines in Asia , which_have maimed or killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people , while despoiling fertile land which_could otherwise be used for food production . It -isaia- the responsibility of all , especially of those_who govern nations , to work more energetically for disarmament . The Synod called_for a stop to the manufacture , sale and use of nuclear , chemical and biological arms and urged those_who_have set landmines to assist in the work of rehabilitation and restoration . Above all the Synod Fathers prayed to God , who knows the depths of every_human conscience , to put sentiments of peace in the hearts of those tempted to follow_the ways of violence so that the biblical vision will_become a reality : '' they_shall beat their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall_not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more '' Is : . The Synod heard many testimonies concerning the sufferings of the people of Iraq , and about the fact_that many Iraqis , especially children , have died because of the lack of medicines and other basic commodities deriving from the continuing embargo . With the Synod Fathers , I wish to express once_again my solidarity with the Iraqi people , and I -amos- particularly close in prayer and hope to the sons_and_daughters of the Church in that country . The Synod prayed that God will enlighten the minds and hearts of all those_who bear responsibility_for bringing_about a just solution to the crisis , in order_that an already sorely tried people may be spared further suffering and sorrow . Considering the question of human promotion in Asia , the Synod Fathers recognized the importance of the process of economic globalization . While acknowledging its many positive effects , they pointed_out that globalization has_also worked to the detriment of the poor , tending to push poorer countries to the margin of international economic and political relations . Many Asian nations are unable to hold their_own in a global market economy . And perhaps more significantly , there_-isaia-_also the aspect of a cultural globalization , made possible by the modern communications media , which_-isaia- quickly drawing Asian societies into a global consumer culture that_-isaia- both secularist and materialistic . The result -isaia- an eroding of traditional family and social values_which until now had sustained peoples and societies . All of this makes it clear_that the ethical and moral aspects of globalization need to be more directly addressed by the leaders of nations and by organizations concerned_with human promotion . The Church insists upon the need_for '' globalization without marginalization '' . With the Synod Fathers , I call_upon the particular Churches everywhere , and especially_those in the Western countries , to work to ensure_that the Church s social_doctrine has its due impact upon the formulation of ethical and juridical norms for regulating the world s free markets and for the means of social communication . Catholic leaders and professionals should urge governments and financial and trade institutions to recognize and respect such norms . Furthermore , in her search for_justice in a world marred by social_and_economic inequalities , the Church cannot ignore the heavy burden of debt incurred by many developing nations in Asia , with its consequent impact upon their present and future . In many cases , these countries are forced to cut down spending on the necessities of life such as food , health , housing and education , in order to service their debts to international monetary agencies and banks . This means_that many_people are trapped in living conditions which_are an affront to human_dignity . While aware of the technical complexities of this_matter , the Synod recognized that_this issue tests the capacity of peoples , societies and governments to value the human_person and the lives of millions of human_beings more highly than financial and material gain . The approach of the Great Jubilee of the Year -isaia- an opportune time for the Episcopal Conferences of the world , especially of the wealthier nations , to encourage international monetary agencies and banks to explore ways of easing the international debt situation . Among the more obvious are a renegotiation of debts , with either substantial reduction or outright cancellation , as also business ventures and investments to assist the economies of the poorer countries . At the same_time the Synod Fathers also addressed the debtor countries . They emphasized the need to develop a sense of national responsibility , reminding them of the importance of sound economic planning , transparency and good management , and invited them to wage a resolute campaign against corruption . They called_upon the Christians of Asia to condemn all forms of corruption and the misappropriation of public funds by those holding political power . The citizens of debtor countries have too_often been victims of waste and inefficiency -atti_degli_apostoli- home , before falling victim to the international debt crisis . When concern_for economic and technological progress -isaia- not accompanied by concern_for the balance of the ecosystem , our earth -isaia- inevitably exposed to serious environmental damage , with consequent harm to human_beings . Blatant disrespect for the environment will_continue as long as the earth and its potential are seen merely as objects of immediate use and consumption , to be manipulated by an unbridled desire_for profit . It -isaia-_the_duty of Christians and of all who look to God as the Creator to protect the environment by restoring a sense of reverence for the whole of God s creation . It -isaia- the Creator s will that_man should treat nature not as a ruthless exploiter but as an intelligent and responsible administrator . The Synod Fathers pleaded in a special_way for greater responsibility on the part of the leaders of nations , legislators , business people and all who_are directly involved in the management of the earth s resources . They underlined the need to educate people , especially_the young , in environmental responsibility , training them in the stewardship over creation which God has_entrusted to humanity . The protection of the environment -isaia-_not_only a technical question ; it -isaia-_also and above all an ethical issue . All have a moral duty to care_for the environment , not_only_for their_own good but_also_for the good of future generations . In conclusion , it -isaia- worth remembering that in calling on Christians to work and sacrifice themselves in the service of human_development the Synod Fathers were drawing upon some of the core insights of biblical and ecclesial tradition . Ancient Israel insisted passionately upon the unbreakable bond_between worship of God and care_for the weak , represented typically in Scripture as '' the widow , the stranger and orphan '' cf . Ex : ; Dt : ; : , who in the societies of the time were most vulnerable to the threat of injustice . Time and again in the Prophets we hear_the cry for_justice , for the right ordering of human_society , without_which there_can be no true worship of God cf . In the appeal of the Synod Fathers we thus hear an echo of the Prophets filled_with_the Spirit of God , who wants '' mercy not sacrifice '' Hos : . Jesus made these_words his_own cf . Mt : , and the same -isaia- true of the Saints in every time_and_place . Consider the words of Saint John Chrysostom : '' Do you wish to honour the body of Christ ? Then do not ignore him when he -isaia- naked . Do not pay him silken honours in the temple only then to neglect him when he goes cold and naked outside . He who said ; This -isaia- my body -isaia- the One who also said , You saw me hungry and you gave me no food . What good -isaia- it if the Eucharistic Table groans under the weight of golden chalices , when Christ -isaia- dying of hunger ? Start by satisfying his hunger , and then with what remains you_may adorn the altar as well ! '' . In the Synod s appeal for human_development and for_justice in human affairs , we hear a voice which_-isaia- both old_and_new . It -isaia- old because it rises from the depths of our Christian tradition , which looks to that profound harmony which_the Creator intends ; it -isaia- new because it speaks to the immediate situation of countless people in Asia today . CHAPTER VII WITNESSES TO THE GOSPEL A Witnessing Church . The Second Vatican Council taught clearly that the entire Church -isaia- missionary , and that the work of evangelization_-isaia- the duty of the whole People of God . Since the whole People of God -isaia- sent forth to preach the Gospel , evangelization_-isaia- never an individual and isolated act ; it -isaia- always an ecclesial task which_has to be carried_out in communion with the whole community of faith . The mission_-isaia- one and indivisible , having one origin and one final purpose ; but within it there_are different responsibilities and different kinds of activity . In every case it -isaia- clear_that there_can be no true proclamation of the Gospel unless Christians also offer the witness of lives in harmony_with_the message they preach : '' The first form of witness -isaia- the very life of the missionary , of the Christian family , and of the ecclesial_community , which reveal a new_way of living . Everyone in the Church , striving to imitate the Divine Master , can and must bear this_kind of witness ; in many cases it -isaia-_the_only possible way of being a missionary '' . Genuine Christian witness -isaia- needed especially now , because '' people today put more trust in witnesses than in teachers , in experience than in teaching , and in life and action than in theories '' . This -isaia- certainly true in the Asian context , where people_are more persuaded by holiness of life than by intellectual argument . The experience of faith and of the gifts of the Holy Spirit thus becomes_the basis of all missionary work , in towns or villages , in schools or hospitals , among the handicapped , migrants or tribal peoples , or in the pursuit of justice and human_rights . Every situation -isaia- an opportunity_for Christians to show forth the power which_the truth of Christ has become in their_lives . Therefore , inspired by the many missionaries who bore heroic witness to God s love among the peoples of the continent in the past , the Church in Asia strives now to witness with no less zeal to Jesus Christ and his Gospel . Christian mission demands no less . Conscious of the Church s essentially missionary character and looking to a new outpouring of the dynamism of the Holy Spirit as the Church enters the new millennium , the Synod Fathers asked that_this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation should offer some directives and guidelines to those working in the vast field of evangelization in Asia . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit who enables the Church to accomplish the mission entrusted to her by Christ . Before sending out his_disciples as his witnesses , Jesus gave them the Holy Spirit cf . Jn : , who worked through them and stirred the hearts of those_who heard them cf . The same -isaia- true of those_whom he sends out now . At one level , all the baptized , by the very grace of the Sacrament , are deputed to take_part in continuing the saving mission of Christ , and they_are capable of this_task precisely_because God s love has_been poured into their_hearts through the Holy Spirit which has_been_given to them Rom : . But on another level this common mission_-isaia- accomplished through a variety of specific functions and charisms in the Church . The principal responsibility_for the Church s mission has_been entrusted by Christ to the Apostles and their successors . By virtue of episcopal ordination and hierarchical communion with the Head of the Episcopal College , Bishops receive the mandate and authority to teach , govern and sanctify the People of God . By the will of Christ himself , within_the College of Bishops , the Successor of Peter the rock upon which_the Church -isaia- built cf . Mt : exercises a special ministry of unity . Bishops therefore are to fulfil their_ministry in union with the Successor of Peter , the guarantor of the truth of their teaching and of their full_communion in the Church . Associated with the Bishops in the work of proclaiming the Gospel , priests_are called_upon -atti_degli_apostoli- ordination to be shepherds of the flock , preachers of the good_news of salvation and ministers of the sacraments . To serve the Church as Christ intends , Bishops and priests need a solid and continuing formation , which_should provide opportunities_for human , spiritual and pastoral renewal , as well as courses on theology , spirituality and the human sciences . People in Asia need to see the clergy not_just as charity workers and institutional administrators but as men whose minds and hearts are set on the deep things of the Spirit cf . The reverence which Asian peoples have for those in authority needs to be matched by a clear moral uprightness on the part of those with ministerial responsibilities in the Church . By their_life of prayer , zealous service and exemplary conduct , the clergy witness powerfully to the Gospel in the communities which_they shepherd in the name of Christ . It -isaia- my fervent prayer that the ordained ministers of the Churches in Asia will live and work in a spirit of communion and cooperation_with the Bishops and all the faithful , bearing_witness to the love_which Jesus declared to be the true mark of his_disciples cf . I particularly wish to underline the Synod s concern_for the preparation of those_who will staff and teach in seminaries and theological faculties . After a thorough training in the sacred sciences and related subjects , they_should receive a specific formation focused on priestly spirituality , the art of spiritual direction , and other aspects of the difficult and delicate task that awaits them in the education of future priests . This -isaia- an apostolate second to none for the Church s well_being and vitality . The Consecrated Life and Missionary Societies . In the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Vita Consecrata , I emphasized the intimate connection_between the consecrated_life and mission . Under its three aspects of confessio Trinitatis , signum fraternitatis and servitium caritatis , the consecrated_life shows forth God s love in the world by its specific witness to the saving mission which Jesus accomplished by his total consecration to the Father . Recognizing that all action in the Church has its support in prayer and communion with God , the Church in Asia looks with profound respect and appreciation to the contemplative religious communities as a special source of strength and inspiration . Following the recommendations of the Synod Fathers , I strongly encourage the establishment of monastic and contemplative communities wherever possible . In this_way , as the Second Vatican Council reminds us , the work of building up the earthly city can have its foundation in the Lord and can tend towards him , lest those_who build labour in vain . The search_for God , a life of fraternal communion , and service to others are the three chief characteristics of the consecrated_life which can_offer an appealing Christian testimony to the peoples of Asia today . The Special Assembly for Asia urged those in the consecrated_life to be witnesses to the universal call to holiness and inspiring examples to Christians and non Christians alike of self_giving love for everyone , especially_the least of their brothers_and_sisters . In a world in which_the sense of God s presence -isaia-_often diminished , consecrated_persons need to bear convincing prophetic witness to the primacy of God and to eternal_life . Living in community , they attest to the values of Christian fraternity and to the transforming power of the Good News . All who_have embraced the consecrated_life are_called to become leaders in the search_for God , a search which has_always stirred the human_heart and which_-isaia- particularly visible in Asia s many forms of spirituality and asceticism . In the numerous religious traditions of Asia , men_and_women dedicated to the contemplative and ascetical life enjoy great respect , and their witness has an especially persuasive power . Their lives lived in community , in peaceful and silent testimony , can inspire people to work_for greater harmony in society . No less -isaia- expected of consecrated men_and_women in the Christian tradition . Their silent example of poverty and abnegation , of purity and sincerity , of self sacrifice in obedience , can become an eloquent witness capable of touching all people_of_good_will and leading to a fruitful dialogue_with surrounding cultures and religions , and with the poor and the defenceless . This makes_the consecrated_life a privileged means of effective evangelization . The Synod Fathers recognized the vital role played by religious_orders and congregations , missionary institutes and societies of apostolic_life in the evangelization of Asia in past centuries . For this magnificent contribution , the Synod expressed to them the Church s gratitude and urged them_not to waver in their missionary commitment . I join the Synod Fathers in calling on those in the consecrated_life to renew their zeal to proclaim_the saving truth of Christ . All are to have appropriate formation and training , which_should be Christ centred and faithful to their founding charism , with emphasis on personal sanctity and witness ; their spirituality and lifestyle should be sensitive to the religious heritage of the people among whom_they live and whom_they serve . While maintaining respect_for their_specific charism , they_should integrate themselves into the pastoral plan of the Diocese in which_they work . The local Churches , for their_part , need to foster awareness of the ideal of the religious and consecrated_life , and promote such vocations . This requires that_each Diocese should devise a pastoral programme for vocations , including the assignment of priests and religious to full time work among the young to help_them hear and discern the call of God . In the context of the communion of the universal Church , I cannot_fail to urge the Church in Asia to send forth missionaries , even_though she herself needs labourers in the vineyard . I -amos- glad to see_that in several Asian countries missionary institutes of apostolic_life have recently been founded in recognition of the Church s missionary character and of the responsibility of the particular Churches in Asia to preach the Gospel to the whole_world . The Synod Fathers recommended '' the establishment within each local Church of Asia , where such do not_exist , of missionary societies of apostolic_life , characterized by their special commitment to the mission ad gentes , ad exteros and ad vitam '' . Such an initiative -isaia- sure to bear abundant fruit not_only in the Churches which receive the missionaries but_also in the Churches which send them . As the Second Vatican Council clearly indicated , the vocation of lay_people sets them firmly in the world to perform the most varied tasks , and it -isaia- here that they_are_called to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ . By the grace and call of Baptism and Confirmation , all lay_people are missionaries ; and the arena of their missionary work_-isaia- the vast and complex worlds of politics , economics , industry , education , the media , science , technology , the arts and sport . In many Asian countries , lay_people are_already serving as true missionaries , reaching out to fellow Asians who might never have contact_with clergy and religious . To them I express the thanks of the whole Church , and I encourage all lay_people to assume their_proper role in the life_and_mission of the People of God , as witnesses to Christ wherever they_may find_themselves . It -isaia- the task of the Pastors to ensure_that the laity are formed as evangelizers able to face the challenges of the contemporary world , not_just with worldly wisdom and efficiency , but_with hearts renewed and strengthened by the truth of Christ . Witnessing to the Gospel in every area of life in society , the lay_faithful can play a unique role in rooting out injustice and oppression , and for_this too they_must be adequately formed . To this_end , I join the Synod Fathers in proposing the establishment -atti_degli_apostoli- the diocesan or national level of lay formation centres to prepare the laity for their missionary work as witnesses to Christ in Asia today . The Synod Fathers were most concerned that the Church should be a participatory Church in which no one feels excluded , and they judged the wider participation of women in the life_and_mission of the Church in Asia to be an especially pressing need . '' Woman has a quite special aptitude in passing on the faith , so much so that Jesus himself appealed to it in the work_of_evangelization . That -isaia- what happened to the Samaritan woman whom Jesus met -atti_degli_apostoli- Jacob s well : he chose her for the first expansion of the new faith in non Jewish territory '' . To enhance their service in the Church , there_should be greater opportunities_for women to take courses in theology and other fields of study ; and men in seminaries and houses of formation need to be trained to regard women as co workers in the apostolate . Women should be more_effectively involved in pastoral programmes , in diocesan and parish pastoral councils , and in diocesan synods . Their abilities and services should be fully appreciated in health_care , in education , in preparing the faithful for the sacraments , in building community and in peacemaking . As the Synod Fathers noted , the presence of women in the Church s mission of love and service contributes greatly to bringing the compassionate Jesus , the healer and reconciler , to Asian people , especially_the poor and marginalized . The family_-isaia- the normal place_where the young grow to personal and social maturity . It -isaia-_also the bearer of the heritage of humanity itself , because through the family life_-isaia- passed on from generation to generation . The family occupies a very_important place in Asian cultures ; and , as the Synod Fathers noted , family values like filial respect , love and care_for the aged and the sick , love of children and harmony are held in high esteem in all Asian cultures and religious traditions . Seen through Christian eyes , the family_-isaia- '' the domestic Church '' ecclesia domestica . The Christian family , like the Church as a whole , should be a place_where the truth of the Gospel -isaia- the rule of life and the gift_which the family members bring to the wider community . The family_-isaia- not_simply the object of the Church s pastoral_care ; it -isaia-_also one of the Church s most effective agents of evangelization . Christian families are today called to witness to the Gospel in difficult times and circumstances , when_the family itself_-isaia- threatened by an array of forces . To be an agent of evangelization in such a time , the Christian family needs to be genuinely '' the domestic Church '' , humbly and lovingly living out the Christian vocation . As the Synod Fathers pointed_out , this means_that the family should be active in parish life , partaking of the sacraments , especially_the Holy Eucharist and the Sacrament of Penance , and being involved in service to others . It also means_that parents should strive to make_the moments when_the family naturally comes together an opportunity_for prayer , for Bible reading and reflection , for appropriate rituals presided over by the parents and for healthy recreation . This will_help the Christian family to become a hearth of evangelization , where each member experiences God s love and communicates it to others . The Synod Fathers also acknowledged that children have a role in evangelization , both in their family and in the wider community . Convinced that '' the future of the world and of the Church passes through the family '' , I once_again propose for study and implementation what I wrote on the theme of the family in the Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris Consortio , following the Fifth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in . The Synod Fathers were particularly sensitive to the theme of youth in the Church . The many complex problems which young_people now face in the changing world of Asia impel the Church to remind the young of their responsibility_for the future of society and the Church , and to encourage and support them -atti_degli_apostoli- every step to ensure that_they_are ready to accept that responsibility . To them the Church offers the truth of the Gospel as a joyful and liberating mystery to be known , lived and shared , with conviction and courage . If young_people are to be effective agents of mission , the Church needs to offer them suitable pastoral_care . In agreement with the Synod Fathers , I recommend that , where possible , every diocese in Asia should appoint youth chaplains or directors to promote the spiritual formation and apostolate of young_people . Catholic schools and parishes have a vital role in providing all round formation for the young , by seeking to lead_them in the way of true discipleship and developing in them the human qualities that mission requires . Organized youth apostolates and youth clubs can provide the experience of Christian friendship which_-isaia- so important_for the young . The parish , and associations and movements , can_help young_people to cope better with social pressures by offering them not_only a more mature growth in the Christian life but_also help in the form of career guidance , vocational training and youth counselling . The Christian formation of young_people in Asia should recognize_that they_are_not only the object of the Church s pastoral_care but_also '' agents and co workers in the Church s mission in her various apostolic works of love and service '' . In parishes and dioceses , young men_and_women should therefore be invited to take_part in the organization of activities which concern them . Their freshness and enthusiasm , their spirit of solidarity and hope can make_them peacemakers in a divided world ; and , on this score , it -isaia- encouraging to see young_people involved in exchange programmes between_the particular Churches and countries in Asia and elsewhere fostering interreligious and intercultural dialogue . In an era of globalization , '' the means of social communication have_become so important as to be for_many the chief means of information and education , of guidance and inspiration in their behaviour as individuals , families and within society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . In particular , the younger generation -isaia- growing up in a world conditioned by the mass_media '' . The world_-isaia- seeing the emergence of a new culture that '' originates not_just from whatever content -isaia- eventually expressed , but_from the very_fact that_there exist new ways of communicating , with new languages , new techniques and a new psychology '' . The exceptional role played by the means of social communication in shaping the world , its cultures and ways of thinking has led to rapid and far reaching changes in Asian societies . Inevitably , the Church s evangelizing mission too -isaia- deeply affected by the impact of the mass_media . Since the mass_media have an ever_increasing influence even in remote areas of Asia , they_can assist greatly in the proclamation of the Gospel to every corner of the continent . However , '' it -isaia-_not_enough to use the media simply to spread the Christian message and the Church s authentic teaching . It -isaia- necessary to integrate that message into the new culture created by modern communications '' . To this_end , the Church needs to explore ways of thoroughly integrating the mass_media into her pastoral planning and activity , so that by their effective use the Gospel s power can reach out still further to individuals and entire peoples , and infuse Asian cultures with the values of the Kingdom . I echo the Synod Fathers commendation of Radio Veritas Asia , the only continent wide radio station for the Church in Asia , for its almost thirty years of evangelization through broadcasting . Efforts must be made to strengthen this excellent instrument of mission , through appropriate language programming , personnel and financial help from Episcopal Conferences and Dioceses in Asia . In addition to radio , Catholic publications and news agencies can_help to disseminate information and offer continuing religious education and formation throughout_the continent . In places_where Christians are a minority , these can be an important means of sustaining and nurturing a sense of Catholic identity and of spreading knowledge of Catholic moral principles . I take up the recommendations of the Synod Fathers on the point of evangelization through social_communications , the '' areopagus of the modern age '' , in the hope that_it_may serve human promotion and the spreading of the truth of Christ and the teaching of the Church . It would help if each Diocese would establish , where possible , a communications and media office . Media education , including the critical evaluation of media output , needs to be an increasing part of the formation of priests , seminarians , religious , catechists , lay professionals , students in Catholic schools and parish communities . Given the wide influence and extraordinary impact of the mass_media , Catholics need to work with the members of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , and with the followers of other_religions to ensure a place_for spiritual and moral values in the media . With the Synod Fathers , I encourage the development of pastoral plans for communications -atti_degli_apostoli- the national and diocesan levels , following the indications of the Pastoral Instruction Aetatis Novae , with appropriate attention to the circumstances prevailing in Asia . However important programmes of formation and strategies for evangelization may be , in the end it -isaia- martyrdom which reveals to the world_the very essence of the Christian message . The word itself , '' martyr '' , means witness , and those_who_have shed their blood for Christ have borne the ultimate witness to the true value of the Gospel . In the Bull of Indiction of the Great Jubilee of the Year , Incarnationis Mysterium , I stressed the vital importance of remembering the martyrs : '' From the psychological point_of_view , martyrdom -isaia-_the_most eloquent proof of the truth of the faith , for faith can_give a human face even to the most violent of deaths and show its beauty even in the midst of the most atrocious persecutions '' . Through the ages , Asia has_given the Church and the world a great host of these heroes of the faith , and from the heart of Asia there rises the great song of praise : Te martyrum candidatus laudat exercitus . This -isaia- the song of those_who died for Christ on Asian soil in the first centuries of the Church , and it -isaia-_also the joyful cry of men_and_women of more recent_times like Saint Paul Miki and his companions , Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and his companions , Saint Andrew Dung Lac and his companions , Saint Andrew Kim Taegon and his companions . May the great host of Asian martyrs , old_and_new , never cease to teach the Church in Asia what it means to bear_witness to the Lamb in whose blood they_have washed their shining robes cf . Rev : ! May they stand as indomitable witnesses to the truth_that Christians are_called always and everywhere to proclaim nothing other_than the power of the Lord s Cross ! And may the blood of Asia s martyrs be now as always the seed of new life_for the Church in every corner of the continent ! CONCLUSION Gratitude and Encouragement . At the end of this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation which , seeking to discern the Spirit s word to the Churches in Asia cf . Rev : , has endeavoured to set_forth the fruits of the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops , I wish to express the Church s gratitude to all of you , dear Asian brothers_and_sisters , who_have contributed in any_way to the success of this important ecclesial event . First and foremost , we again praise God for the wealth of cultures , languages , traditions and religious sensibilities of this_great continent . Blessed be God for the peoples of Asia , so rich in their diversity yet one in their yearning for peace and fullness of life . Especially now , in the immediate vicinity of the th anniversary of the Birth of Jesus Christ , we thank God for choosing Asia as the earthly dwelling place of his incarnate Son , the Saviour of the world . I cannot_fail to express my appreciation to the Bishops of Asia for their deep love of Jesus Christ , the Church and the peoples of Asia , and for their testimony of communion and generous dedication to the task of evangelization . I -amos- grateful to all those_who form the great family of the Church in Asia : the clergy , the men_and_women_religious and other consecrated_persons , the missionaries , the laity , families , the young , indigenous peoples , workers , the poor and afflicted . Deep in my heart there_-isaia- a special place_for those in Asia who_are persecuted for their_faith in Christ . They are the hidden pillars of the Church , to whom Jesus himself speaks words of comfort : '' You are blessed in the Kingdom of heaven '' cf . The words of Jesus reassure the Church in Asia : '' Fear not , little flock , for it -isaia- your Father s good pleasure to give_you the Kingdom '' Lk : . Those who_believe in Christ are_still a small minority in this vast and most populous continent . Yet far_from_being a timid minority , they_are lively in faith , full of the hope and vitality which only love can bring . In their humble and courageous way , they_have influenced the cultures and societies of Asia , especially_the lives of the poor and the helpless , many of whom do not share the Catholic faith . They are an example to Christians everywhere to be eager to share the treasure of the Good News '' in season and out of season '' Tim : . They find strength in the wondrous power of the Holy Spirit who , despite the generally small numbers of the Church in Asia , ensures that the Church s presence -isaia- like the yeast which mixes with the flour in a quiet and hidden way till it -isaia- all leavened cf . The peoples of Asia need Jesus Christ and his Gospel . Asia -isaia- thirsting for the living water that Jesus alone_can give cf . The disciples of Christ in Asia must_therefore be unstinting in their_efforts to fulfil the mission they_have received_from_the Lord , who_has promised to be with_them to the end of the age cf . Trusting in the Lord who_will not_fail those_whom he has called , the Church in Asia joyfully makes her pilgrim way into the Third Millennium . Her only joy -isaia- that which_comes_from sharing with the multitude of Asia s peoples the immense gift_which she herself has_received the love of Jesus the Saviour . Her one ambition -isaia- to continue his_mission of service and love , so that all Asians '' may_have life and have it abundantly '' Jn : . Prayer to the Mother of Christ . Faced with_such a challenging mission , we turn to Mary , for_whom , as the Synod Fathers said , Asian Christians have a great love and affection , revering her as their_own Mother and the Mother of Christ . Throughout Asia there_are hundreds of Marian sanctuaries and shrines where not_only the Catholic faithful gather , but_also believers of other_religions too . To Mary , model of all disciples and bright Star of Evangelization , I entrust the Church in Asia -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the Third Millennium of the Christian era , trusting absolutely that hers -isaia- an ear that always listens , hers a heart that always welcomes , and hers a prayer that never fails : O Holy Mary , Daughter of the Most High God , Virgin Mother of the Saviour and Mother of us all , look tenderly upon the Church of your Sonplanted on Asian soil . Be her guide and modelas she continues your Son s missionof love and service in Asia . You fully and freely accepted the Father s callto be the Mother of God ; teach us to empty our heartsof all that_-isaia-_not of God , that we too may be filledwith the Holy Spirit from on high . You pondered the mysteries of God s willin the silence of your heart ; help us on our journeyto discern the signs of God s powerful hand . You went quickly to visit Elizabethand help in her days of waiting ; obtain for us the same_spirit of zeal and servicein our evangelizing task . You sang the praises of the Lord ; lead us in joyful proclamation of faithin Christ our Saviour . You had compassion on the needyand spoke to your Son on their behalf ; teach us never to fearto speak of the world to Jesusand of Jesus to the world . You stood -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Crossas your Son breathed his last ; be with us as we seek to be onein spirit and service with all who_suffer . You prayed with the disciples in the Upper Room ; help us to wait upon the Spiritand to go wherever he leads us . Protect the Church from all the powersthat threaten her . Help her to be a true imageof the Most Holy Trinity . Pray that_through the Church s love and serviceall the peoples of Asia may cometo know your SonJesus Christ , the only Saviour of the world , and so taste the joy of life in all its fullness . O Mary , Mother of the New Creationand Mother of Asia , pray_for us , your children , now and always !

To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of that Encyclical , I released the Encyclical Letter Sollicitudo Rei Socialis December in which , following the earlier Magisterium , I invited all the faithful to see themselves as called to a mission of service which necessarily includes the promotion of integral human_development .

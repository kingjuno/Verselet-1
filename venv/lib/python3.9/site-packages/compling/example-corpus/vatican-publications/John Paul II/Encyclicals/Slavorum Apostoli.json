{"title": "Slavorum Apostoli", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Encyclicals", "pub_date": "02/06/1985", "text": "JOHN PAUL II SLAVORUM APOSTOLI I . THE APOSTLES OF THE SLAVS , Saints Cyril and Methodius , are remembered by the Church together_with_the great work_of_evangelization which_they carried_out . Indeed it can_be_said that_their memory -isaia- particularly vivid and relevant to our_day . Considering the grateful veneration enjoyed for centuries by the holy Brothers from Salonika the ancient Thessalonica , especially among the Slav nations , and mindful of their incalculable contribution to the work of proclaiming the Gospel among_those peoples ; mindful too of the cause of reconciliation , friendly coexistence , human_development and respect_for the intrinsic dignity of every nation , by my Apostolic Letter Egregiae Virtutis of December I proclaimed Saints Cyril and Methodius Co Patrons of Europe . In this_way I followed the path already traced out by my Predecessors , and notably by Leo XIII , who over a hundred years_ago , on September , extended the cult of the two Saints to the whole Church , with the Encyclical Epistle Grande Munus , and by Paul VI , who , with the Apostolic Letter Pacis Nuntius of October , proclaimed Saint Benedict Patron of Europe . The purpose of the document of five years_ago was to remind people of these solemn acts of the Church and to call the attention of Christians and of all people_of_good_will who_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the welfare , harmony and unity of Europe to the ever living relevance of the eminent figures of Benedict , Cyril and Methodius , as concrete models and spiritual aids for the Christians of today , and especially_for the nations of the continent of Europe , which , especially through the prayers and work of these saints , have long been consciously and originally rooted in the Church and in Christian tradition . The publication of my Apostolic Letter in , which_was dictated by the firm hope of a gradual overcoming in Europe and the world of everything_that divides the Churches , nations and peoples , was linked to three circumstances that were_the subject of my prayer and reflection . The first was_the eleventh centenary of the Pontifical Letter Industriae Tuae , whereby Pope John VIII in the year approved the use of the Old Slavonic language in the liturgy translated by the two holy Brothers . The second circumstance was_the first centenary of the above mentioned Encyclical Epistle Grande Munus . The third was_the beginning , precisely in , of the happy and promising theological dialogue_between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches on the Island of Patmos . In the present document I wish to make particular reference to the Epistle Grande Munus , by which Pope Leo III intended to remind the Church and the world of the apostolic merits of both the Brothers not_only of Methodius , who , according to tradition , ended his days -atti_degli_apostoli- Velehrad in Greater Moravia in the year , but_also of Cyril , whom death separated_from his_brother in , when he was in Rome , the city which received and which still preserves his relics with profound veneration in the Basilica of Saint Clement . Recalling the holy lives and apostolic merits of the two Brothers from Salonika , Pope Leo XIII fixed their annual liturgical feast on July . After the Second Vatican Council , as a result of the liturgical reform , the feast was transferred to February , which from the historical point_of_view -isaia- the date of the heavenly birthday of Saint Cyril . At a distance of over a hundred years from Pope Leo s Epistle , the new circumstances in which it so happens_that there falls the eleventh centenary of the death of Saint Methodius encourage us to give renewed expression to the Church s memory of this important anniversary . And a particular obligation to do so -isaia- felt by the first Pope called to the See of Peter from Poland , and thus from the midst of the Slav nations . The events of the last hundred years and especially of the last decades have helped to revive in the Church not_only the religious memory of the two holy Brothers but_also a historical and cultural interest in them . Their special charisms have_become still better understood in the light of the situations and experiences of our_own times . A contribution to this_has been_made by many events which belong , as true signs of the times , to the history of the twentieth century ; the first of these -isaia- that great event which took_place in the life of the Church : the Second Vatican Council . In the light of the magisterium and pastoral orientation of that Councils we can look in a new_way a more mature and profound way -atti_degli_apostoli- these_two holy figures , now separated_from us by eleven centuries . And we can read in their_lives and apostolic activity the elements that the wisdom of divine Providence placed in them , so that they_might be revealed with fresh fullness in our_own age and might bear new fruits . Following the example offered by the Epistle Grande Munus , I wish to recall_the life of Saint Methodius , without however thereby ignoring the life so closely liked to it of his_brother Saint Cyril . This I will do in general terms , leaving to historical research the detailed discussion of individual points . The city which saw the birth of the two holy Brothers -isaia- the modern Salonika , which in the ninth century was an important centre of commercial and political_life in the Byzantine Empire , and occupied a notable position in the intellectual and social_life of that part of the Balkans . Being situated on the frontier of the Slav territories , it also certainly had a Slav name : Solun . Methodius was_the elder brother and his baptismal name was probably Michael . He was_born between and . His younger brother Constantine , who came to be better known by his religious name Cyril , was_born in or . Their father was a senior official of the imperial administration . The family s social position made possible_for the two Brothers a similar career , which in fact Methodius did take up , reaching the rank of Archon or Prefect in one of the frontier Provinces where many Slavs lived . However , towards_the year he interrupted his career and retired to one of the monasteries -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of Mount Olympus in Bithynia , then known as the Holy Mountain . His brother Cyril studied with_great success in Byzantium , where he received Holy Orders , after_having resolutely refused a brilliant political future . By reason of his exceptional intellectual and religious talents and knowledge , there_were entrusted to him while he has still a young_man delicate ecclesiastical appointments , such as that of Librarian of the Archive attached to the great church of Holy Wisdom in Constantinople , and , simultaneously , the prestigious position of Secretary to the Patriarch of that city . However , he very soon made it known that he wished to be relieved of these posts , in order to be able to devote himself to study and the contemplative life , far from the pursuit of ambition . Thus he retired secretly to a monastery on the Black Sea coast . He was discovered six months later , and was persuaded to accept the task of teaching philosophy in the School of higher learning in Constantinople , where by reason of the excellence of his knowledge he gained the epithet of The Philosopher by which he -isaia- still known . Later on he was sent by the emperor and the Patriarch on a mission to the Saracens . On the completion of this_task he retired from public_life in order to join his elder brother Methodius and share_with him the monastic life . But once_again , together_with Methodius , he was included in a Byzantine delegation sent to the Khazars , acting as a religious and cultural expert . While staying in the Crimea -atti_degli_apostoli- Kherson , they identified what_they believed to be the church in which_had_been buried Saint Clement , Pope of Rome and martyr , who had_been exiled to that distant region . They recovered his relics and took them_with them . These relics later accompanied the two holy Brothers on their missionary journey to the West , until they_were able to bring them solemnly to Rome and present them to Pope Hadrian II . The event which_was to determine the whole of the rest of their_lives was_the request made by Prince Rastislav of Greater Moravia to the Emperor Michael III , to send to his peoples '' a Bishop and teacher . able to explain to them the true Christian faith in their_own language '' . Those chosen were Saints Cyril and Methodius , who readily accepted , set_out and , probably by the year , reached Greater Moravia a State then including various Slav peoples of Central Europe , -atti_degli_apostoli- the crossroads of the mutual influences between East and West . They undertook among_these peoples that mission to which both of them devoted the rest of their_lives , spent amidst journeys , privations , sufferings , hostility and persecution , which for Methodius included even a period of cruel imprisonment . All of this they bore with strong faith and indomitable hope in God . They had in fact prepared well for the task entrusted to them : they took with_them the texts of the Sacred Scriptures needed_for celebrating the Sacred Liturgy , which_they had prepared and translated into the Old Slavonic language and written in a new alphabet , devised by Constantine the Philosopher and perfectly adapted to the sounds of that language . The missionary_activity of the two Brothers was accompanied by notable success , but_also by the understandable difficulties which_the preceding initial Christianization , carried_out by the neighboring Latin Churches , placed in the way of the new missionaries . About three years later , while travelling to Rome , they stopped in Pannonia where_the Slav Prince Kocel , who_had fled from the important civil and religious center of Nitra , gave them a hospitable reception . From here , after some months , they set_out again for Rome together_with their followers , for whom_they desired to obtain Holy Orders . Their route passed through Venice , where_the innovating elements of the mission they_were carrying_out were subjected to a public discussion . In Rome Pope Hadrian II , who_had in the meantime succeeded Nicholas I , received them very cordially . He approved the Slavonic liturgical books , which he ordered to be solemnly placed on the altar in the Church of Saint Mary ad Praesepe , today known as Saint Mary Major , and recommended that_their followers be ordained priests . This phase of their_efforts concluded in a most favorable manner . Methodius however had to carry_out the next stages by himself , because his younger brother , now gravely ill , scarcely had time to take religious vows and put on the monastic habit before he died shortly afterwards , on February in Rome . Saint Methodius remained faithful to the words_which Cyril had said to him on his deathbed : '' Behold , my brother , we have shared the same destiny , ploughing the same furrow ; I now fall in the field -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of my day . I know_that you greatly love your Mountain ; but do not_for the sake of the Mountain give up your work of teaching . For where better can you and salvation ? '' Consecrated Archbishop for the territory of the ancient Diocese of Pannonia , and named Papal Legate '' ad gentes '' for the Slav peoples , he assumed the ecclesiastical title of the re established Episcopal See of Sirmium . However , Methodius apostolic activity was cut short as the result of political and religious complications which culminated in his imprisonment for two years , on the charge of having invaded the episcopal jurisdiction of another . He was set free only on the personal intervention of Pope John VIII . The new sovereign of Greater Moravia , Prince Svatopluk , also subsequently showed hostility to the work of Methodius . He opposed the Slavonic liturgy and spread doubts in Rome about the new Archbishop s orthodoxy . In the year Methodius was called ad limina Apostolorum , to present once_more the whole question personally to John VIII . In Rome , absolved of all the accusations , he obtained from the Pope the publication of the Bull Industriae Tuae , which , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in substance , restored the prerogatives granted to the liturgy in Slavonic by Pope John s predecessor Hadrian II . When in or Methodius went to Constantinople , he received a similar recognition of perfect legitimacy and orthodoxy also from the Byzantine Emperor and the Patriarch Photius , who -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time was in full_communion with Rome . He devoted the last years of his_life principally to making further translations of the Sacred Scriptures , the liturgical books , the works of the Fathers of the Church and also the collection of ecclesiastical and Byzantine civil laws called the Nomocanon . Concerned for the survival of the work which_he_had begun , he named as his successor his disciple Gorazd . He died on April in the service of the Church established among the Slav peoples . His far seeing work , his profound and orthodox doctrine , his balance , loyalty , apostolic zeal and intrepid magnanimity gained Methodius the recognition and trust of Roman Pontiffs , of Patriarchs of Constantinople , of Byzantine Emperors and of various Princes of the young Slav peoples . Thus he became the guide and legitimate Pastor of the Church which in that age became established in the midst of those nations . He -isaia- unanimously venerated , together_with his_brother Constantine , as the preacher of the Gospel and teacher '' from God and the holy Apostle Peter '' , and as the foundation of full unity between_the Churches of recent foundation and the more ancient ones . For this_reason , '' men_and_women , humble and powerful , rich and poor , free men and slaves , widows and orphans , foreigners and local people , the healthy and the sick '' made up the throng that amid tears and songs accompanied to his burial place the good Teacher and Pastor who_had become '' all things to all men , that I might by all means save some '' . To tell the truth , after_the death of Methodius the work of the holy Brothers suffered a grave crisis , and persecution of their followers grew so severe that the latter were forced to abandon their missionary field . Nonetheless , their sowing of the Gospel seed did not_cease to bear_fruit , and their pastoral attitude of concern to bring_the revealed_truth to new peoples while respecting their cultural originality remains a living model for the Church and for the missionaries of all ages . HERALDS OF THE GOSPEL . Byzantine in culture , the brothers Cyril and Methodius succeeded in becoming apostles of the Slavs in the full sense of the word . Separation from one s homeland , which God sometimes requires of those he has chosen , when accepted with_faith in his promise -isaia- always a mysterious and fertile pre condition_for the development and growth of the People of God on earth . The Lord said to Abraham : '' Go from your_country and your kindred and your father s house to the land that I will show you . And I will_make of you a great nation , and I will bless you , and make your name great , so that_you will be a blessing '' . In the dream which Saint Paul had -atti_degli_apostoli- Troas in Asia Minor , a Macedonian , therefore an inhabitant of the European continent , came before him and implored him to come to his country to proclaim there the Word of God : '' Come over to Macedonia and help us . Divine Providence , which for the two holy Brothers expressed itself through the voice and authority of the Emperor of Byzantium and of the Patriarch of the Church of Constantinople , addressed to them a similar exhortation , when it asked them to go as missionaries among the Slavs . For them , this_task meant giving up not_only a position of honour but_also the contemplative life . It meant leaving the area of the Byzantine Empire and undertaking a long pilgrimage in the service of the Gospel among peoples that , in many aspects , were still very alien to the system of civil_society based on the advanced organization of the State and the refined culture of Byzantium , imbued_with Christian principles . A similar request has addressed three times to Methodius by the Roman Pontiff , when he sent him as Bishop among the Slavs of Greater Moravia , in the ecclesiastical regions of the ancient Diocese of Pannonia . The Slavonic Life of Methodius reports in the following words the request made by the Prince Rastislav to the Emperor Michael III through_his envoys : '' Many Christian teachers have reached us from Italy , from Greece and from Germany , who instruct us in different_ways . have no one to direct us towards_the truth and instruct us in an understandable way '' . It was then that Constantine and Methodius were invited to go there . Their profoundly Christian response to the invitation in this circumstance and on all similar occasions -isaia- admirably expressed by the words of Constantine to the Emperor : '' However tired and physically worn out I -amos- , I will go with_joy to that land '' ; '' with_joy I depart for the sake of the Christian faith '' . The truth and the power of their missionary mandate came from the depths of the mystery of the Redemption , and their evangelizing work among the Slav peoples was to constitute an important link in the mission entrusted by the Savior to the Church until the end of time . It was a fulfillment in time and in concrete circumstances of the words of Christ , who in the power of his Cross and Resurrection told the Apostles : '' Preach the Gospel to the whole creation '' ; '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations '' . In so doing , the preachers and teachers of the Slav peoples let themselves be guided by the apostolic ideal of Saint Paul : '' For in Christ Jesus you_are all children of God , through_faith . For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ . There -isaia- neither Jew nor Greek , there_-isaia- neither slave nor free , there_-isaia- neither male nor female ; for you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' . Together with a great respect_for persons and a disinterested concern_for their true good , the two holy Brothers had the resources of energy , prudence , zeal and charity needed_for bringing the light to the future believers , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time for showing them what_-isaia-_good and offering concrete help for attaining it . For this_purpose they desired to become similar in every aspect to those_to_whom they_were bringing the Gospel ; they wished to become part of those peoples and to share their lot in everything . Precisely for this_reason they found it natural to take a clear position in all the conflicts which_were disturbing the societies as they became organized . They took as their_own the difficulties and problems inevitable for peoples who_were defending their_own identity against the military and cultural pressure of the new Romano Germanic Empire , and who_were attempting to resist forms of life_which they felt to be foreign . It was_also the beginning of wider divergencies , which_were unfortunately destined to increase , between Eastern and Western Christianity , and the two holy missionaries found themselves personally involved in this . But they always succeeded in maintaining perfect orthodoxy and consistent attention both to the deposit of tradition and to the new elements in the lives of the peoples being evangelized . Situations of opposition often weighed upon them in all their uncertain and painful complexity . But this did_not cause Constantine and Methodius to try to withdraw from the trial . Misunderstanding , overt bad faith and even , for Saint Methodius , imprisonment accepted for love of Christ , did_not deflect either of them_from their tenacious resolve to help and to serve the good of the Slav peoples and the unity of the universal Church . This was_the price which_they had to pay for the spreading of the Gospel , the missionary enterprise , the courageous search_for new_forms of living and effective ways of bringing the Good News to the Slav nations which_were then forming . For the purposes of evangelization , the two holy Brothers as their biographies indicate undertook the difficult task of translating the texts of the Sacred Scriptures , which_they knew in Greek , into the language of the Slav population which_had settled along the borders of their_own region and native city . Making use of their_own Greek language and culture for_this arduous and unusual enterprise , they set themselves to understanding and penetrating the language , customs and traditions of the Slav peoples , faithfully interpreting the aspirations and human values_which were present and expressed therein . In order to translate the truths of the Gospel into a new language , they_had to make an effort to gain a good grasp of the interior world of those_to_whom they intended to proclaim_the word of God in images and concepts that_would sound familiar to them . They realized that an essential condition of the success of their missionary_activity was to transpose correctly Biblical notions and Greek theological concepts into a very different context of thought and historical experience . It was a question of a new method of catechesis . To defend its legitimacy and prove its value , Saint Methodius , -atti_degli_apostoli- first together_with his_brother and then alone , did not_hesitate to answer with docility the invitations to come to Rome , invitations received first from Pope Nicholas I in and then from Pope John VIII in . Both Popes wished to compare the doctrine being taught by the Brothers in Greater Moravia with that_which the holy Apostles Peter and Paul had passed down , together_with_the glorious trophy of their holy relics , to the Church s chief episcopal See . Previously , Constantine and his fellow workers had_been engaged in creating a new alphabet , so that the truths to be proclaimed and explained could be written in Old Slavonic and would thus be fully comprehended and grasped by their hearers . The effort to learn the language and to understand_the mentality of the new peoples to whom_they wished to bring_the faith was truly worthy of the missionary spirit . Exemplary too was their determination to assimilate and identify themselves_with all the needs and expectations of the Slav peoples . Their generous decision to identify themselves_with those peoples life and traditions , once having purified and enlightened them by Revelation , make Cyril and Methodius true models for all the missionaries who in every period have accepted Saint Paul s invitation to become all things to all people in order to redeem all . And in particular for the missionaries who , from ancient times until the present_day , from Europe to Asia and today in every continent , have labored to translate the Bible and the texts of the liturgy into the living languages of the various peoples , so as to bring them the one word of God , thus made accessible in each civilization s own forms of expression . Perfect communion in love preserves the Church from all forms of particularism , ethnic exclusivism or racial prejudice , and from any nationalistic arrogance . This communion must elevate and sublimate every purely natural legitimate sentiment of the human_heart . THEY PLANTED THE CHURCH OF GOD . But the characteristic of the approach adopted by the Apostles of the Slavs Cyril and Methodius which I especially wish to emphasize -isaia- the peaceful way_in_which they built up the Church , guided as they_were by their vision of the Church as one , holy and universal . Even though Slav Christians , more_than others , tend to think of the holy Brothers as '' Slavs -atti_degli_apostoli- heart '' , the latter nevertheless remain men of Hellenic culture and Byzantine training . In other_words , men_who fully belonged to the civil and ecclesiastical tradition of the Christian East . Already in their time certain differences between Constantinople and Rome had begun to appear as pretexts for disunity , even_though the deplorable split between_the two parts of the same Christian world was still in the distant future . The evangelizers and teachers of the Slavs set_out for Greater Moravia imbued_with all the wealth of tradition and religious experience which marked Eastern Christianity and which_was particularly evident in theological teaching and in the celebration of the Sacred Liturgy . The sacred rites in all the Churches within_the borders of the Byzantine Empire had long been celebrated in Greek . However ; the traditions of many national Churches of the East , such as the Georgian and Syriac , which used the language of the people in their liturgies , were well_known to the advanced cultural milieu of Constantinople . They were especially well_known to Constantine the Philosopher , as a result of his studies and of his many contacts with Christians belonging to those Churches , both in the capital and in the course of his journeys . Both the Brothers were aware of the antiquity and legitimacy of these traditions , and were therefore not afraid to use the Slavonic language in the liturgy and lo make it into an effective instrument for bringing the divine truths to those_who spoke it . This they did without_any spirit of superiority or domination , but out of love of justice and with a clear apostolic zeal for peoples then developing . Western Christianity , after_the migrations of the new peoples , had amalgamated the newly arrived ethnic groups with the Latin peaking population already living there , and had extended to all , in order to unite them , the Latin language , liturgy and culture which_had_been transmitted by the Church of Rome . The uniformity thus achieved gave relatively young and rapidly expanding societies a sense of strength and compactness , which contributed to a closer unity among_them and a more forceful affirmation in Europe . It -isaia- understandable that in such a situation differences sometimes came to be regarded as a threat to a still incomplete unity . One can_also understand how strongly the temptation was felt to eliminate such differences , even by using forms of coercion . At this_point it -isaia- an unusual and admirable thing that_the_holy Brothers , working in such complex and precarious situations , did_not seek to impose on the peoples assigned to their preaching either the undeniable superiority of the Greek language and Byzantine culture , or the customs and way_of_life of the more advanced society in which_they had grown up and which necessarily remained familiar and dear to them . Inspired by the ideal of uniting in Christ the new believers , they adapted to the Slavonic language the rich and refined texts of the Byzantine liturgy and likewise adapted to the mentality and customs of the new peoples the subtle and complex elaborations of Greco Roman law . In following this programme of harmony and peace , Cyril and Methodius were ever respectful of the obligations of their_mission . They acknowledged the traditional prerogatives and ecclesiastical rights laid_down by Conciliar Canons . Thus , though subjects of the Eastern Empire and believers subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople , they considered it their_duty to give an account of their missionary work to the Roman Pontiff . They likewise submitted to his judgment , in order to obtain his approval , the doctrine which_they professed and taught , the liturgical books which_they had written in the Slavonic language , and the methods which_they were using in evangelizing those peoples . Having undertaken their_mission under orders from Constantinople , they then in a sense sought to have it confirmed by approaching the Apostolic See of Rome , the visible center : of the Church s unity . Thus they established the Church with an awareness of her universality as one , holy , catholic and apostolic . This -isaia- clearly and explicitly seen in their whole way of acting . It can_be_said that Jesus priestly prayer ut unum sint -isaia- their missionary motto in accordance_with_the Psalmist s words : '' Praise the Lord , all nations ! Extol him , all peoples '' . For us today their apostolate also possesses the eloquence of an ecumenical appeal : it -isaia- an invitation to restore , in the peace of reconciliation , the unity that_was gravely damaged after_the time of Cyril and Methodius , and , first_and_foremost , the unity between East and West . The conviction held by the holy Brothers from Salonika , namely that_each local Church -isaia- called to enrich with its_own endowments the Catholic '' pleroma '' , was in perfect harmony_with their evangelical insight that the different conditions of life of the individual Christian Churches can_never justify discord , disagreement and divisions in the profession of the one faith and in the exercise of charity . As we know , according to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council '' the ecumenical movement means those activities and enterprises which , according to various needs of the Church and as opportunities offer , are initiated and organized to promote Christian unity '' . Thus it seems in no way anachronistic to see Saints Cyril and Methodius as the authentic precursors of ecumenism , inasmuch as they wished to eliminate effectively or to reduce any divisions , real or only apparent , between_the individual communities belonging to the same Church . For the division which unfortunately occurred in the course of the Church s history and which sadly still persists '' not_only openly contradicts the will of Christ , but provides a stumbling block to the world , and inflicts damage on the most_holy cause of proclaiming the Gospel to every_creature '' . The fervent solicitude shown by both Brothers and especially by Methodius by reason of his episcopal responsibility , to preserve unity of faith and love between_the Churches of which_they were members , namely , between_the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Rome on the one_hand , and the Churches which arose in the lands of the Slavs on the other , was and will_always remain their great merit . This merit -isaia- all the greater if one takes into_account_the fact_that their_mission was exercised in the years , thus in the critical years when there emerged and began to grow more_serious the fatal discord and bitter controversy between_the Churches of the East and the West . The division was accentuated by the question of where Bulgaria , which_had just officially accepted Christianity , canonically belonged . In this stormy period , which_was also marked by armed conflicts between neighboring Christian peoples , the holy Brothers from Salonika preserved a resolute and vigilant fidelity to right doctrine and to the tradition of the perfectly united Church , and in particular to the '' divine teachings '' and '' ecclesiastical teachings '' on which , in accordance_with_the Canons of the ancient Councils , her structure and organization was founded . This fidelity enabled them to complete their great missionary tasks and to remain in full spiritual and canonical unity with the Church of Rome , with the Church of Constantinople and with the new Churches which_they had founded among the Slav peoples . Methodius especially did not_hesitate to face misunderstandings , conflicts and even slanders and physical persecution , rather_than fall short of his exemplary ecclesial fidelity , and in order to remain faithful to his duties as a Christian and a Bishop and to the obligations which_he_had assumed vis a vis the Church of Byzantium which_had begotten him and sent him out as a missionary together_with Cyril . Then there_were his obligations to the Church of Rome , thanks to which he fulfilled his charge as Archbishop in '' the territory of Saint Peter '' ; likewise his obligations to that Church growing in the lands of the Slavs , which he accepted as his_own and successfully defended convinced of his just right before the ecclesiastical and civil authorities , protecting in particular the liturgy in the Old Slavonic language and the fundamental ecclesiastical rights proper to the Churches in the various nations . By thus acting , he always resorted , as did Constantine the Philosopher , to dialogue with_those_who opposed his ideas or his_pastoral initiatives and who cast doubt on their legitimacy . Thus he would always remain a teacher for all those_who , in whatever age , seek to eliminate discord by respecting the manifold fullness of the Church , which , conforming to the will of its Founder Jesus Christ , must be always one , holy , catholic and apostolic . This task was perfectly reflected in the Creed of the Fathers of the Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople , which_-isaia- the unalterable profession_of_faith of all Christians . CATHOLIC SENSE OF THE CHURCH . It -isaia-_not_only the evangelical content of the doctrine proclaimed by Saints Cyril and Methodius that merits particular emphasis . Also very expressive and instructive for the Church today -isaia- the catcehetic and pastoral method that_they applied in their apostolic activity among the peoples who_had not_yet heard the Sacred Mysteries celebrated in their native language , nor heard the word of God proclaimed in a way_that completely fitted their_own mentality and respected the actual conditions of their_own life . We know_that the Second Vatican Council , twenty years_ago , had as one of its principal tasks that of reawakening the self awareness of the Church and , through_her interior renewal , of impressing upon her a fresh missionary impulse for the proclamation of the eternal message of salvation , peace and mutual concord among peoples and nations , beyond all the frontiers that yet divide our planet , which_-isaia- intended by the will of God the Creator and Redeemer to be the common dwelling for all humanity . The dangers that in our_times are accumulating over our_world cannot make us forget the prophetic insight of Pope John XXIII , who convoked the Council with the intent and the conviction_that it would be capable of preparing and initiating a period of springtime and rebirth in the life of the Church . And , among its statements on the subject of universality , the same Council included the following : '' All men are_called to belong to the new People of God . Wherefore this People , while remaining one and unique , -isaia- to be spread throughout_the whole_world and must exist in all ages , so that the purpose of God s will may be fulfilled . In the beginning God made human_nature one . After his_children were scattered , he decreed that_they_should -atti_degli_apostoli- length be unified again cf . The Church or People of God takes nothing away from the temporal welfare of any people by establishing that kingdom . Rather does she foster and take to herself , insofar as they_are good , the abilities , resources , and customs of each people . Taking them to herself she purifies , strengthens , and enobles them . This characteristic of universality which adorns the People of God -isaia-_a_gift from the Lord himself . In virtue of this catholicity each_individual part of the Church contributes through its special gifts to the good of the other parts and of the whole Church . Thus through the common sharing of gifts and through the common effort to attain fullness in unity , the whole and each of its parts receive increase '' . We can say without fear of contradiction that_such a traditional and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time extremely up to date vision of the catholicity of the Church like a symphony of the various liturgies in all the world s languages united in one single liturgy , or a melodious chorus sustained by the voices of unnumbered multitudes , rising in countless modulations , tones and harmonies for the praise of God from every_part of the globe , -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of history this vision corresponds in a particular_way to the theological and pastoral vision which inspired the apostolic and missionary work of Constantine the Philosopher and of Methodius , and which sustained their_mission among the Slav nations . In Venice , before the representatives of the ecclesiastical world , who held a rather narrow idea of the Church and were opposed to this vision , Saint Cyril defended it with courage . He showed that_many peoples had_already in the past introduced and now possessed a liturgy written and celebrated in their_own language , such as '' the Armenians , the Persians , the Abasgians , the Georgians , the Sogdians , the Goths , the Avars , the Tirsians , the Khazars , the Arabs , the Copts , the Syrians and many_others '' . Reminding them that God causes the sun to rise and the rain to fall on all people without exception , he said : '' Do not all breathe the air in the same_way ? And you are_not ashamed to decree only three languages Hebrew , Greek and Latin , deciding that all other peoples and races should remain blind and deaf ! Tell me : do you hold this because you consider God -isaia- so weak that he cannot grant it , or so envious that he does_not wish it ? '' . To the historical and logical arguments which_they brought against him Cyril replied by referring to the inspired basis of Sacred Scripture : '' Let every tongue confess that Jesus Christ -isaia- Lord , to the glory of God the Father '' ; '' All the earth worships you ; they sing praises to you , sing praises to your name '' ; '' Praise the Lord , all nations ! Extol him , all peoples ! '' . The Church -isaia- catholic also_because she_-isaia- able to present in every_human context the revealed_truth , preserved by her intact in its divine content , in such_a_way as to bring it into contact_with_the lofty thoughts and just expectations of every_individual and every people . Moreover , the entire patrimony of good which_every generation transmits to posterity , together_with_the priceless gift of life , forms as it were an immense and many coloured collection of tesserae that together make up the living mosaic of the Pantocrator , who_will manifest himself in his total splendour only -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the Parousia . The Gospel does_not lead to the impoverishment or extinction of those things_which every_individual , people and nation and every culture throughout history recognizes and brings into being as goodness , truth and beauty . On the contrary , it strives to assimilate and to develop all these values : to live them_with magnanimity and joy and to perfect them by the mysterious and ennobling light of Revelation . The concrete dimension of catholicity , inscribed by Christ the Lord in the very make up of the Church , -isaia- not something static , outside history and flatly uniform . In a certain_sense it wells up and develops every_day as something new from the unanimous faith of all those who_believe in God , One and Three , revealed by Jesus Christ and preached by the Church through the power of the Holy Spirit . This dimension issues quite spontaneously from mutual respect proper to fraternal love for every_person and every nation , great or small , and from the honest acknowledgment of the qualities and rights of brethren in the faith . The catholicity of the Church -isaia- manifested in the active joint responsibility and generous cooperation of all for the sake of the common_good . The Church everywhere effects her universality by accepting , uniting and exalting in the way that_-isaia- properly hers , with motherly care , every real human value . At the same_time , she strives in every clime and every historical situation to win for God each_and_every human_person , in order to unite them_with one_another and with_him in his truth and his_love . All individuals , all nations , cultures and civilizations have_their own part to play and their_own place in God s mysterious plan and in the universal history_of_salvation . This was_the thought of the two holy Brothers : God '' merciful and kind '' , '' waiting for all people to repent , that all may be saved and come to the knowledge of the Truth , . does not_allow the human_race to succumb to weakness and perish , and to fall_into the temptation of the enemy . But year by year and -atti_degli_apostoli- every time he does not_cease to lavish on us a manifold grace , from the beginning until today in the same_way : first , through the Patriarchs and Fathers , and after them through the Prophets ; and again through the Apostles and Martyrs , the just men and the Doctors whom he chooses in the midst of this stormy life '' . The message of the Gospel which Saints Cyril and Methodius translated for the Slav peoples , drawing with wisdom from the treasury of the Church '' things old_and_new '' , was transmitted through preaching and instruction in accordance_with_the eternal truths , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time being adapted to the concrete historical situation . Thanks to the missionary efforts of both Saints , the Slav peoples were able for the first time to realize their_own vocation to share in the eternal design of the Most Holy Trinity , in the universal plan_for the salvation of the world . At the same_time , they_can recognized their role -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the whole history of the humanity created by God the Father , redeemed by the Son our Savior and enlightened by the Holy Spirit . Thanks to this preaching , duly approved by the authorities of the Church the Bishops of Rome and the Patriarchs of Constantinople the Slavs were able to feel_that they too , together_with_the other nations of the earth , were descendants and heirs of the promise made by God to Abraham . In this_way , thanks to the ecclesiastical organization created by Saint Methodius and thanks to their awareness of their_own Christian identity , the Slavs took their destined place in the Church which_had now arisen also in that part of Europe . For this_reason , their modern descendants keep in grateful and everlasting remembrance the one_who became the link that binds them to the chain of the great heralds of the divine Revelation of the Old and New Testaments : '' After all of these , the merciful God , in our own_time , raised up for the good work , for the sake of our_own people , for_whom nobody had ever cared , our Teacher , the holy Methodius , whose virtues and struggles we unblushingly compare , one by one , to those of these_men pleasing to God '' . THE GOSPEL AND CULTURE . The Brothers from Salonika were not_only heirs of the faith but_also heirs of the culture of Ancient Greece , continued by Byzantium . Everyone knows how important this heritage -isaia- for the whole of European culture and , directly or indirectly , for the culture of the entire world . The work_of_evangelization which_they carried_out as pioneers in territory inhabited by Slav peoples contains both a model of what today -isaia- called '' inculturation the incarnation of the Gospel in native cultures and also the introduction of these cultures into the life of the Church . By incarnating the Gospel in the native culture of the peoples which_they were evangelizing , Saints Cyril and Methodius were especially meritorious for the formation and development of that_same culture , or rather of many cultures . Indeed all the cultures of the Slav nations owe their '' beginning '' or development to the work of the Brothers from Salonika . For by their original and ingenious creation of an alphabet for the Slavonic language the Brothers made a fundamental contribution to the culture and literature of all the Slav nations . Furthermore , the translation of the sacred_books , carried_out by Cyril and Methodius together_with their pupils , conferred a capacity and cultural dignity upon the Old Slavonic liturgical language , which became for_many hundreds of years not_only the ecclesiastical but_also the official and literary language , and even the common language of the more educated classes of the greater part of the Slav nations , and in particular of all the Slavs of the Eastern Rite . It was_also used in the Church of the Holy Cross in Cracow , where_the Slav Benedictines had established themselves . Here were published the first liturgical books printed in this language . Up to the present_day this_-isaia- the language used in the Byzantine liturgy of the Slavonic Eastern Churches of the Rite of Constantinople , both Catholic and Orthodox , in Eastern and South Eastern Europe , as well as in various countries of Western Europe . It -isaia-_also used in the Roman liturgy of the Catholics of Croatia . In the historical development of the Slavs of Eastern Rite , this language played a role equal to that of the Latin language in the West . It also lasted longer than Latin in part until the nineteenth century and exercised a much_more direct influence on the formation of the local literary languages , thanks to its close kinship with_them . These merits vis a vis the culture of all the Slav peoples and nations make_the work_of_evangelization carried_out by Saints Cyril and Methodius in a certain_sense constantly present in the history and in the life of these peoples and nations . THE SIGNIFICANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN MILLENNIUM IN THE SLAV WORLD . The apostolic and missionary_activity of Saints Cyril and Methodius , which belongs to the second half of the ninth century , can be considered the first effective evangelization of the Slavs . This activity involved the individual territories in varying degrees , and was mainly concentrated in the territories of the then existing State of Greater Moravia . It principally included the regions belonging to the metropolis of which Methodius was pastor , namely Moravia , Slovakia and Pannonia , the last being a part of modern Hungary . Included in the sphere of the wider influence exercised by this_apostolic activity , especially that of the missionaries trained by Methodius , were_the other groups of Western Slavs , particularly those of Bohemia . The first historical Prince of Bohemia of the dynasty of the Premyslids , Bozyvoj Borivoj , was probably baptized according to the Slavonic Rite . Later this influence reached the Sorbo Lusatian tribes , and the territories of southern Poland . However , from the time of the fall of Greater Moravia in about the Latin Rite took the place of the Slav Rite and Bohemia was assigned ecclesiastically to the Bishop of Regensburg and the metropolis of Salzburg . However , it -isaia- worthy of note that about the middle of the tenth century , -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Saint Wenceslaus , there_was still a strong intermingling of the elements of both rites , and an advanced coexistence of both languages in the liturgy : Slavonic and Latin . Moreover , the Christianization of the people was not_possible without using the native language . And only upon such a foundation could the development of the Christian terminology in Bohemia take_place , and from here , subsequently , the development and consolidation of ecclesiastical terminology in Poland . Information about the Prince of the Vislits in the Lite of Methodius -isaia-_the_most ancient historical reference to one of the Polish tribes . Insufficient data exist for it to be possible to link this item of information with the institution in the Polish territories of a Slav Rite ecclesiastical organization . The Baptism of Poland in , in the person of the first historical sovereign , Mieszko , who married the Bohemian princess Dubravka , took_place principally through the Bohemian Church , and by this route Christianity reached Poland from Rome in the Latin form . But the fact remains that the beginnings of Christianity in Poland are in a way linked_with the work of the Brothers who set_out from distant Salonika . Among the Slavs of the Balkan peninsula the efforts of the holy Brothers bore fruit in an even_more visible way . Thanks to their apostolate the Christianity which had_already for some time been established in Croatia was consolidated . Principally through_their disciples who had_been expelled from the area where_they had originally worked the mission of Cyril and Methodius was confirmed and developed wonderfully in Bulgaria . Here , thanks to Saint Clement of Okhrid , dynamic centers of monastic life arose , and here particularly the Cyrillic alphabet developed . From here too Christianity moved to other territories , until it passed through neighboring Romania and reached the ancient Rus of Kiev , and then spread from Moscow eastwards . In a few years , in to be exact , the millennium of the baptism of Saint Vladimir , Grand Duke of Kiev , will be celebrated . Rightly therefore Saints Cyril and Methodius were -atti_degli_apostoli- an early date recognized by the family of Slav peoples as the fathers of both their Christianity and their culture . In many of the territories mentioned above , although there had_been various missionaries , the majority of the Slav population in the ninth century still retained pagan customs and beliefs . Only in the land cultivated by our Saints , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least prepared by them_for cultivation , did Christianity definitively enter_the history of the Slavs during the following century . Their work_-isaia- an outstanding contribution to the formation of the common Christian roots of Europe , roots which by their strength and vitality are one_of_the_most solid points of reference , which no serious attempt to reconstruct in a new and relevant way the unity of the Continent can ignore . After eleven centuries of Christianity among the Slavs , we clearly see_that the heritage of the Brothers from Salonika -isaia- and remains for the Slavs deeper and stronger than_any division . Both Christian traditions the Eastern deriving from Constantinople and the Western deriving from Rome arose in the bosom of the one Church , even_though against the background of different_cultures and of a different approach to the same problems . This diversity , when its origin -isaia- properly understood and when its value and meaning are properly considered , can_only enrich the culture of Europe and its religious tradition , and likewise become an adequate foundation for its hoped for spiritual renewal . Ever since_the ninth century , when in Christian Europe a new organization was emerging , Saints Cyril and Methodius have held out to us a message clearly of great relevance for our_own age , which precisely by reason of the many complex problems of a religious , cultural , civil and international nature , -isaia- seeking a vital unity in the real communion of its various elements . It can_be_said of the two evangelizers that characteristic of them was their love for the communion of the universal Church both in the East and in the West , and , within_the universal Church , love for the particular Church that_was coming into being in the Slav nations . From them also comes for the Christians and people of our_time the invitation to build communion together . But it -isaia- in the specific area of missionary_activity that the example of Cyril and Methodius -isaia- of even greater value . For this activity -isaia- an essential task of the Church , and -isaia- urgent today in the already mentioned form of '' inculturation '' . The two Brothers not_only carried_out their_mission with full respect_for the culture already existing among the Slav peoples , but together_with religion they eminently and unceasingly promoted and extended that culture . By analogy , today the Churches of ancient origin can and must help the young Churches and peoples to mature in their_own identity and progress in it . Cyril and Methodius are as it were_the connecting links or spiritual bridge between_the Eastern and Western traditions , which both come together in the one great Tradition of the universal Church . For us they_are the champions and also the patrons of the ecumenical endeavor of the sister Churches of East and West , for the rediscovery through prayer and dialogue of visible Unity in perfect and total communion , '' the unity_which '' , as I said on the occasion of my visit to Bari , '' -isaia- neither absorption nor fusion '' . Unity -isaia- a meeting in truth and love , granted to us by the Spirit . Cyril and Methodius , in their personality and their_work , are figures that awaken in all Christians a great '' longing for union '' and for_unity between_the two sister Churches of East and West . For full catholicity , every nation , every culture has its_own part to play in the universal plan of salvation . Every particular tradition , every local Church must remain open and alert to the other Churches and traditions and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to universal and catholic communion ; were it to remain closed in on itself , it too would run the risk of becoming impoverished . By exercising their_own charism , Cyril and Methodius made a decisive contribution to the building of Europe not_only in Christian religious communion but_also to its civil and cultural union . Not even today does there exist any_other way of overcoming tensions and repairing the divisions and antagonisms both in Europe : and in the world_which threaten to cause a frightful destruction of lives and values . Being Christians in our_day means being builders of communion in the Church and in society . This calls for openness to others , mutual understanding , and readiness to cooperate through the generous exchange of cultural and spiritual resources . One of the fundamental aspirations of humanity today -isaia- to rediscover unity and communion for a life truly worthy of man on the worldwide level . The Church , conscious of being the universal sign and sacrament of salvation and of the unity of the human_race , declares her readiness to accomplish this_duty of hers , to which '' the conditions of this age lend special urgency so that all people joined more_closely today by various social , technical , and cultural bonds can achieve as well full unity in Christ '' . It -isaia- fitting , then_,_that the Church should celebrate with solemnity and joy the eleven centuries that_have elapsed since_the close of the apostolic work of the first Archbishop , ordained in Rome for the Slav peoples , Methodius , and of his_brother Cyril , and that_she should thus commemorate the entry of these peoples on to the scene of the history_of_salvation and into the of European nations which during the preceding centuries had_already accepted the Gospel message . Everyone will understand with what profound happiness I will share in this celebration as the first son of the Slav race to be called , after nearly two millennia , to occupy the episcopal see_that once belonged to Peter in this city of Rome . '' Into thy hands I commend my spirit '' : we salute the eleventh centenary of Saint Methodius death with the very words_which as his Life in Old Slavonic recounts he uttered before he died , when he was about to join his fathers in faith , hope and charity : the Patriarchs , Prophets , Apostles , Doctors and Martyrs . By the testimony of his_words and life , sustained by the charism of the Spirit , he gave an example of a vocation fruitful not_only_for the century in which he lived but_also_for the centuries which followed , and in a special_way for our_own times . His blessed '' passing '' in the spring of the year after_the Incarnation of Christ and according to the Byzantine calculation of time , in the year since_the creation of the world took_place -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when disquieting clouds were gathering above Constantinople and hostile tensions were increasingly threatening the peace and life of the nations , and even threatening the sacred bonds of Christian brotherhood and communion linking the Churches of the East and West . In his Cathedral , filled_with_the faithful of different races , the disciples of Saint Methodius paid solemn homage to their dead pastor for the message of salvation , peace and reconciliation which_he_had brought and to which_he_had devoted his_life : '' They celebrated a sacred office in Latin , Greek and Slavonic '' , adoring God and venerating the first Archbishop of the Church which he established among the Slavs , to whom he and his_brother had proclaimed the Gospel in their_own language . This Church grew even stronger when through the explicit consent of the Pope it received a native hierarchy , rooted in the apostolic succession and remaining in unity of faith and love both with the Church of Rome and with_that of Constantinople , from which_the Slav mission had begun . Now that eleven centuries have passed since his_death , I desire to be present -atti_degli_apostoli- least spiritually in Velehrad , where it seems Providence enabled Methodius to end his apostolic_life : I desire also to pause in the Basilica of Saint Clement in Rome , in the place_where Saint Cyril was buried ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the Tombs of both these Brothers , the Apostles of the Slavs , I desire to recommend to the Most Blessed Trinity their_spiritual heritage with a special prayer . '' Into your hands I commend . O great God , One in Trinity , I entrust to you the heritage of faith of the Slav nations ; preserve and bless this_work of yours ! Remember , O Almighty Father , the moment when , in accordance_with your will , the '' fullness_of_time '' arrived for these peoples and nations , and the holy Missionaries from Salonika faithfully fulfilled the command that_your Son Jesus Christ had entrusted to his Apostles ; following in their footsteps and in those of their successors , they brought into the lands inhabited by the Slavs the light of the Gospel , the Good News of salvation and , in their presence , bore testimony that_you are the Creator of man , that_you are our Father and that in you we are all brethren ; that_through the Son , your eternal Word , you have_given existence to all things , and have called human_beings to share in your life without end ; that_you have so loved the world as to grant it the gift of your only_begotten Son , who for us men and for our_salvation , came down from heaven and by the power of the Holy Spirit became incarnate in the womb of the Virgin Mary and was_made man ; and that finally you_have sent the Spirit of power and consolation so that every_human_being , redeemed by Christ , may in him receive the dignity of a child and become a co heir of the unfailing promises which_you have_made to humanity ! Your plan of creation , O Father , culminating in the Redemption , touches the living man and embraces his entire life and the history of all peoples . Grant , O Father , what_the whole Church today implores from you and grant also_that the people and the nations which , thanks to the apostolic mission of the holy Brothers from Salonika , have known and accepted you , the true God , and through Baptism have entered into the holy community of your children , may still continue , without hindrance , to accept with enthusiasm and trust this evangelical programme and continue to realize all their human possibilities on the foundation of their teachings ! May they follow , in conformity_with their_own conscience , the voice of your call along the paths shown to them_for the first time eleven centuries ago ! May their membership of the Kingdom of your Son never be considered by anyone to be contrary to the good of their earthly homeland ! May they render to you due praise in private and in public_life ! May they live in truth , charity , justice and in the enjoyment of the messianic peace which enfolds human hearts , communities , the earth and the entire universe ! Aware of their_dignity as human_beings and children of God , may they_have the strength to overcome all hatred and to conquer evil with_good ! But also grant to the whole of Europe , O Most Holy Trinity , that_through the intercession of the two holy Brothers it may feel ever_more strongly the need_for religious and Christian unity and for a brotherly communion of all its peoples , so that_when incomprehension and mutual distrust have_been overcome and when ideological conflicts have_been conquered in the common awareness of the truth , it may be for the whole_world an example of just and peaceful coexistence in mutual respect and inviolate liberty . To you , therefore , God the Father Almighty , God the Son who_have redeemed the world , God the Spirit who_are the sustainer and teacher of all holiness , I desire to entrust the whole Church of yesterday , today and tomorrow , the Church both in Europe and throughout_the earth . Into your hands I commit this singular wealth , made up of so many_different gifts , ancient and new , placed in the common treasury by so many_different sons_and_daughters . The whole Church thanks you , who called the Slav nations into the communion of the faith , for_this heritage and for the contribution made by them to the universal patrimony . The Pope of Slav origin in a special_way thanks you for_this . May this contribution never cease to enrich the Church , the Continent of Europe and the whole_world ! May it never fail in Europe and in the world of today ! May it never fade from the memories of our contemporaries ! We desire to accept in its entirety everything original and valid which_the Slav nations have brought and continue to bring to the spiritual patrimony of the Church and of humanity . The whole Church , aware of this common treasure , professes her spiritual solidarity with_them and reaffirms her_own responsibility towards_the Gospel , for the work of salvation which she_-isaia- called_upon to accomplish also today in the whole_world , unto the ends of the earth . It -isaia- essential to go back to the past in order to understand , in the light of the past , the present reality and in order to discern tomorrow . For the mission of the Church -isaia- always oriented and directed with unfailing hope towards_the future . The future ! However much it may humanly speaking seem filled_with threats and uncertainties , we trustfully place it in your hands , Heavenly Father , invoking upon it the intercession of the Mother of your Son and Mother of the Church , the intercession of your Apostles Peter and Paul , and of Saints Benedict , Cyril and Methodius , of Augustine and Boniface and all the other evangelizers of Europe who , strong in faith , hope and charity , proclaimed to our fathers your salvation and your peace , and amid the toils of the spiritual sowing began to build the civilization of love and the new order based on your holy law and the help of your grace , which -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the age will_give life to all things and all people in the heavenly Jerusalem . Amen ! To you , dear brothers_and_sisters , my Apostolic Blessing .

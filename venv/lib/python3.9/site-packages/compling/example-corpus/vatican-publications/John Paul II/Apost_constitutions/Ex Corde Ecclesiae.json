{"title": "Ex Corde Ecclesiae", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Apost_constitutions", "pub_date": "15/08/1990", "text": "APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTIONOF THE SUPREME PONTIFFJOHN PAUL IION CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES INTRODUCTION BORN FROM THE HEART of the Church , a Catholic University -isaia- located in that course of tradition which_may be traced back to the very origin of the University as an institution . It has_always_been recognized as an incomparable centre of creativity and dissemination of knowledge for the good of humanity . By vocation , the Universitas magistrorum et scholarium -isaia- dedicated to research , to teaching and to the education of students who freely associate with_their teachers in a common love of knowledge . With every_other University it shares that gaudium de veritate , so precious to Saint Augustine , which_-isaia- that joy of searching for , discovering and communicating truth in every field of knowledge . A Catholic University s privileged task -isaia- '' to unite existentially by intellectual effort two orders of reality that too frequently tend to be placed in opposition as though_they were antithetical : the search_for truth , and the certainty of already knowing the fount of truth '' . For many years I myself was deeply enriched by the beneficial experience of university life : the ardent search_for truth and its unselfish transmission to youth and to all those learning to think rigorously , so as to act rightly and to serve humanity better . Therefore , I desire to share_with everyone my profound respect_for Catholic Universities , and to express my great appreciation for the work that_-isaia- being done in them in the various spheres of knowledge . In a particular_way , I wish to manifest my joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the numerous meetings which_the Lord has permitted me to have in the course of my apostolic journeys with the Catholic University communities of various continents . They are for me a lively and promising sign of the fecundity of the Christian mind in the heart of every culture . They give me a well founded hope_for a new flowering of Christian culture in the rich and varied context of our changing times , which certainly face serious challenges but_which also bear so much promise under the action of the Spirit of truth and of love . It -isaia-_also my desire to express my pleasure and gratitude to the very many Catholic scholars engaged in teaching and research in non Catholic Universities . Their task as academics and scientists , lived out in the light of the Christian faith , -isaia- to be considered precious for the good of the Universities in which_they teach . Their presence , in fact , -isaia- a continuous stimulus to the selfless search_for truth and for the wisdom that comes_from above . Since the beginning of this Pontificate , I have shared these ideas and sentiments with my closest collaborators , the Cardinals , with the Congregation for Catholic Education , and with men_and_women of culture throughout_the_world . In fact , the dialogue of the Church with the cultures of our_times -isaia- that vital area where '' the future of the Church and of the world_-isaia- being played out as we conclude the twentieth century '' . There -isaia- only_one cultre : that of man , by man and for_man . And thanks to her Catholic Universities and their humanistic and scientific inheritance , the Church , expert in humanity , as my predecessor , Paul VI , expressed it -atti_degli_apostoli- the United Nations , explores the mysteries of humanity and of the world , clarifying them in the light of Revelation . It -isaia- the honour and responsibility of a Catholic University to consecrate itself without reserve to the cause of truth . This -isaia- its way of serving -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time both the dignity of man and the good of the Church , which_has '' an intimate conviction_that truth_-isaia- its real ally . and that knowledge and reason are sure ministers to faith '' . Without in any_way neglecting the acquisition of useful knowledge , a Catholic University -isaia- distinguished by its free search_for the whole truth_about nature , man and God . The present age -isaia- in urgent_need of this_kind of disinterested service , namely of proclaiming the meaning of truth , that fundamental value without_which freedom , justice and human_dignity are extinguished . By means of a kind of universal humanism a Catholic University -isaia- completely dedicated to the research of all aspects of truth in their essential connection_with the supreme Truth , who_-isaia- God . It does this without fear but_rather with enthusiasm , dedicating itself to every path of knowledge , aware of being preceded by him_who_-isaia- '' the Way , the Truth , and the Life '' , the Logos , whose Spirit of intelligence and love enables the human_person with_his or her_own intelligence to find the ultimate reality of which he -isaia-_the_source and end and who alone_-isaia- capable of giving fully that Wisdom without_which the future of the world would be in danger . It -isaia- in the context of the impartial search_for truth_that the relationship_between faith and reason -isaia- brought to light and meaning . The invitation of Saint Augustine , '' Intellege ut credas ; crede ut intellegas '' , -isaia- relevant to Catholic Universities that are_called to explore courageously the riches of Revelation and of nature so that the united endeavour of intelligence and faith will_enable people to come to the full measure of their humanity , created in the image_and_likeness of God , renewed even_more marvellously , after sin , in Christ , and called to shine_forth in the light of the Spirit . Through the encounter which it establishes between_the unfathomable richness of the salvific message of the Gospel and the variety and immensity of the fields of knowledge in which that richness -isaia- incarnated by it , a Catholic University enables the Church to institute an incomparably fertile dialogue_with people of every culture . Man s life_-isaia- given dignity by culture , and , while he finds his fullness in Christ , there_can be no doubt_that the Gospel which reaches and renews him in every dimension -isaia-_also fruitful for the culture in which he lives . In the world today , characterized by such rapid developments in science and technology , the tasks of a Catholic University assume an ever_greater importance and urgency . Scientific and technological discoveries create an enormous economic and industrial growth , but they_also inescapably require the correspondingly necessary search_for meaning in order to guarantee that the new discoveries be used for the authentic good of individuals and of human_society as a whole . If it -isaia- the responsibility of every University to search_for such meaning , a Catholic University -isaia- called in a particular_way to respond to this need : its Christian inspiration enables it to include the moral , spiritual and religious dimension in its research , and to evaluate the attainments of science and technology in the perspective of the totality of the human_person . In this_context , Catholic Universities are_called to a continuous renewal , both as '' Universities '' and as '' Catholic '' . For , '' What -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- the very meaning of scientific and technological research , of social_life and of culture , but , on an even_more profound level , what_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- the very meaning of the human_person '' . Such renewal requires a clear awareness_that , by its Catholic character , a University -isaia- made more capable of conducting an impartial search_for truth , a search that_-isaia- neither subordinated to nor conditioned by particular interests of any_kind . Having already dedicated the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana to Ecclesiastical Faculties and Universities , I then felt obliged to propose an analogous Document for Catholic Universities as a sort of '' magna carta '' , enriched by the long and fruitful experience of the Church in the realm of Universities and open to the promise of future achievements that_will require courageous creativity and rigorous fidelity . The present Document -isaia- addressed especially to those_who conduct Catholic Universities , to the respective academic communities , to all those_who_have an interest in them , particularly the Bishops , Religious Congregations and ecclesial Institutions , and to the numerous laity who_are committed to the great mission of higher education . Its purpose -isaia- that '' the Christian mind may achieve , as it were , a public , persistent and universal presence in the whole enterprise of advancing higher culture and that the students of these institutions become people outstanding in learning , ready to shoulder society s heavier burdens and to witness the faith to the world '' . In addition to Catholic Universities , I also turn to the many Catholic Institutions of higher education . According to their nature and proper objectives , they share some or all of the characteristics of a University and they offer their_own contribution to the Church and to society , whether through research , education or professional training . While this Document specifically concerns Catholic Universities , it -isaia-_also meant to include all Catholic Institutions of higher education engaged in instilling the Gospel message of Christ in souls and cultures . Therefore , it -isaia- with_great trust and hope_that I invite all Catholic Universities to pursue their irreplaceable task . Their mission appears increasingly necessary_for the encounter of the Church with the development of the sciences and with the cultures of our_age . Together with all my brother Bishops who share pastoral responsibility with me , I would_like to manifest my deep conviction_that a Catholic University -isaia- without_any doubt one of the best instruments that the Church offers to our_age which_-isaia- searching for certainty and wisdom . Having the mission of bringing the Good News to everyone , the Church should never fail to interest herself in this Institution . By research and teaching , Catholic Universities assist the Church in the manner most appropriate to modern times to find cultural treasures both old_and_new , '' nova et vetera '' , according to the words of Jesus . Finally , I turn to the whole Church , convinced_that Catholic Universities are essential to her growth and to the development of Christian culture and human progress . For this_reason , the entire ecclesial Community -isaia- invited to give its support to Catholic Institutions of higher education and to assist them in their process of development and renewal . It -isaia- invited in a special_way to guard the rights and freedom of these Institutions in civil_society , and to offer them economic aid , especially in those countries where_they have more urgent_need of it , and to furnish assistance in founding new Catholic Universities wherever this might be necessary . My hope -isaia- that_these prescriptions , based on the teaching of Vatican Council II and the directives of the Code of Canon Law , will_enable Catholic Universities and other Institutes of higher studies to fulfil their indispensable mission in the new advent of grace that_-isaia- opening up to the new Millennium . PART I IDENTITY AND MISSION A . THE IDENTITY OF A CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY . Nature and Objectives . Every Catholic University , as a university , -isaia- an academic community which , in a rigorous and critical fashion , assists in the protection and advancement of human_dignity and of a cultural heritage through research , teaching and various services offered to the local , national and international communities . It possesses that institutional autonomy necessary to perform its functions effectively and guarantees its_members academic freedom , so long as the rights of the individual person and of the community are preserved within_the confines of the truth and the common_good . Since the objective of a Catholic University -isaia- to assure in an institutional manner a Christian presence in the university world confronting the great problems of society and culture , every Catholic University , as Catholic , must_have the following essential characteristics : '' . a Christian inspiration not_only of individuals but of the university community as such ; . a continuing reflection in the light of the Catholic faith upon the growing treasury of human knowledge , to which it seeks to contribute by its_own research ; . fidelity to the Christian message as it comes to us through the Church ; . an institutional commitment to the service of the people of God and of the human_family in their pilgrimage to the transcendent goal which_gives meaning to life '' . '' In the light of these four characteristics , it -isaia- evident_that besides the teaching , research and services common to all Universities , a Catholic University , by institutional commitment , brings to its task the inspiration and light of the Christian message . In a Catholic University , therefore , Catholic ideals , attitudes and principles penetrate and inform university activities in accordance_with_the proper nature and autonomy of these activities . In a word , being both a University and Catholic , it must be both a community of scholars representing various branches of human knowledge , and an academic institution in which Catholicism -isaia- vitally present and operative '' . A Catholic University , therefore , -isaia- a place of research , where scholars scrutinize reality with the methods proper to each academic discipline , and so contribute to the treasury of human knowledge . Each individual discipline -isaia- studied in a systematic manner ; moreover , the various disciplines are brought into dialogue for their mutual enhancement . In addition to assisting men_and_women in their continuing quest for the truth , this research provides an effective witness , especially necessary today , to the Church s belief in the intrinsic value of knowledge and research . In a Catholic University , research necessarily includes a the search_for an integration of knowledge , b a dialogue_between faith and reason , c an ethical concern , and d a theological perspective . Integration of knowledge -isaia- a process , one_which will_always remain incomplete ; moreover , the explosion of knowledge in recent decades , together_with_the rigid compartmentalization of knowledge within individual academic disciplines , makes_the task increasingly difficult . But a University , and especially a Catholic University , '' has to be a living union of individual organisms dedicated to the search_for truth . It -isaia- necessary to work towards a higher synthesis of knowledge , in which alone lies the possibility of satisfying that thirst_for truth which_-isaia- profoundly inscribed on the heart of the human_person '' . Aided by the specific contributions of philosophy and theology , university scholars will be engaged in a constant effort to determine the relative place and meaning of each of the various disciplines within_the context of a vision of the human_person and the world that_-isaia- enlightened by the Gospel , and therefore by a faith in Christ , the Logos , as the centre of creation and of human_history . In promoting this integration of knowledge , a specific part of a Catholic University s task -isaia- to promote dialogue_between faith and reason , so that it can be seen more profoundly how faith and reason bear harmonious witness to the unity of all truth . While each academic discipline retains its_own integrity and has its_own methods , this dialogue demonstrates that '' methodical research within every branch of learning , when carried_out in a truly scientific manner and in accord with moral norms , can_never truly conflict with_faith . For the things of the earth and the concerns of faith derive from the same God '' . A vital interaction of two distinct levels of coming to know_the one truth leads to a greater love for truth itself , and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of human_life and of the purpose of God s creation . Because knowledge -isaia- meant to serve the human_person , research in a Catholic University -isaia- always carried_out with a concern_for the ethical and moral implications both of its methods and of its discoveries . This concern , while it must be present in all research , -isaia- particularly important in the areas of science and technology . '' It -isaia- essential that we be convinced of the priority of the ethical over the technical , of the primacy of the person over things , of the superiority of the spirit over matter . The cause of the human_person will only be served if knowledge -isaia- joined to conscience . Men and women of science will truly aid humanity only if they preserve the sense of the transcendence of the human_person over the world and of God over the human_person '' . Theology plays a particularly important role in the search_for a synthesis of knowledge as well as in the dialogue_between faith and reason . It serves all other disciplines in their search_for meaning , not_only by helping them to investigate how their discoveries will affect individuals and society but_also by bringing a perspective and an orientation not contained within their_own methodologies . In turn , interaction with_these other disciplines and their discoveries enriches theology , offering it a better understanding of the world today , and making theological research more relevant to current needs . Because of its specific importance among the academic disciplines , every Catholic University should_have a faculty , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least a chair , of theology . Given the close connection_between research and teaching , the research qualities indicated above will have_their influence on all teaching . While each discipline -isaia- taught systematically and according to its_own methods , interdisciplinary studies , assisted by a careful and thorough study of philosophy and theology , enable students to acquire an organic vision of reality and to develop a continuing desire_for intellectual progress . In the communication of knowledge , emphasis -isaia- then placed on how human_reason in its reflection opens to increasingly broader questions , and how the complete answer to them can_only come from above through_faith . Furthermore , the moral implications that_are present in each discipline are examined as an integral part of the teaching of that discipline so that the entire educative process be directed towards_the whole development of the person . Finally , Catholic theology , taught in a manner faithful to Scripture , Tradition , and the Church s Magisterium , provides an awareness of the Gospel principles_which will enrich the meaning of human_life and give it a new dignity . Through research and teaching the students are educated in the various disciplines so as to become truly competent in the specific sectors in which_they will devote_themselves to the service of society and of the Church , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time prepared to give the witness of their_faith to the world . The University Community . A Catholic University pursues its objectives through its formation of an authentic human community animated by the spirit of Christ . The source of its unity springs from a common dedication to the truth , a common vision of the dignity_of_the_human_person and , ultimately , the person and message of Christ which_gives the Institution its distinctive character . As a result of this inspiration , the community -isaia- animated by a spirit of freedom and charity ; it -isaia- characterized by mutual respect , sincere dialogue , and protection of the rights of individuals . It assists each of its_members to achieve wholeness as human persons ; in turn , everyone in the community helps in promoting unity , and each_one , according_to_his or her role and capacity , contributes towards decisions which affect the community , and also towards maintaining and strengthening the distinctive Catholic character of the Institution . University teachers should seek to improve their competence and endeavour to set the content , objectives , methods , and results of research in an individual discipline within_the framework of a coherent world vision . Christians among the teachers are_called to be witnesses and educators of authentic Christian life_,_which evidences attained integration between_faith and life , and between professional competence and Christian wisdom . All teachers are to be inspired by academic ideals and by the principles of an authentically human_life . Students are challenged to pursue an education that combines excellence in humanistic and cultural development with specialized professional training . Most especially , they_are challenged to continue the search_for truth and for meaning throughout their_lives , since '' the human spirit must be cultivated in such_a_way_that there results a growth in its ability to wonder , to understand , to contemplate , to make personal judgments , and to develop a religious , moral , and social sense '' . This enables them to acquire or , if they have_already done so , to deepen a Christian way_of_life that_-isaia- authentic . They should realize the responsibility of their professional life , the enthusiasm of being the trained leaders of tomorrow , of being witnesses to Christ in whatever place they_may exercise their profession . Directors and administrators in a Catholic University promote the constant growth of the University and its community through a leadership of service ; the dedication and witness of the non academic staff are vital for the identity and life of the University . Many Catholic Universities were founded by Religious Congregations , and continue to depend on their support ; those Religious Congregations dedicated to the apostolate of higher education are urged to assist these Institutions in the renewal of their commitment , and to continue to prepare religious men_and_women_who can positively contribute to the mission of a Catholic University . Lay people_have found in university activities a means by which_they too could exercise an important apostolic role in the Church and , in most Catholic Universities today , the academic community -isaia- largely composed of laity ; in increasing numbers , lay men_and_women are assuming important functions and responsibilities for the direction of these Institutions . These lay Catholics are responding to the Church s call '' to be present , as signs of courage and intellectual creativity , in the privileged places of culture , that_-isaia- , the world of education school and university '' . The future of Catholic Universities depends to a great extent on the competent and dedicated service of lay Catholics . The Church sees their developing presence in these institutions both as a sign of hope and as a confirmation of the irreplaceable lay vocation in the Church and in the world , confident that lay_people will , in the exercise of their_own distinctive role , '' illumine and organize these temporal affairs in such_a_way_that they always start out , develop , and continue according to Christ s mind , to the praise of the Creator and the Redeemer '' . The university community of many Catholic institutions includes members of other Churches , ecclesial_communities and religions , and also those_who profess no religious belief . These men_and_women offer their training and experience in furthering the various academic disciplines or other university tasks . The Catholic University in the Church . Every Catholic University , without ceasing to be a University , has a relationship to the Church that_-isaia- essential to its institutional identity . As such , it participates most directly in the life of the local Church in which_it_-isaia- situated ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , because_it_-isaia- an academic institution and therefore a part of the international community of scholarship and inquiry , each institution participates in and contributes to the life and the mission of the universal Church , assuming consequently a special bond with the Holy See by reason of the service to unity which_it_-isaia- called to render to the whole Church . One consequence of its essential relationship to the Church -isaia- that the institutional fidelity of the University to the Christian message includes a recognition of and adherence to the teaching_authority of the Church in matters of faith_and_morals . Catholic members of the university community are_also called to a personal fidelity to the Church with all that_this implies . Non Catholic members are required to respect the Catholic character of the University , while the University in turn respects their religious liberty . Bishops have a particular responsibility to promote Catholic Universities , and especially to promote and assist in the preservation and strengthening of their Catholic identity , including the protection of their Catholic identity in relation to civil authorities . This will be achieved more_effectively if close personal and pastoral relationships exist between University and Church authorities , characterized by mutual trust , close and consistent cooperation and continuing dialogue . Even when they_do_not enter directly into the internal governance of the University , Bishops '' should be seen not as external agents but as participants in the life of the Catholic University '' . The Church , accepting '' the legitimate autonomy of human culture and especially of the sciences '' , recognizes the academic freedom of scholars in each discipline in accordance_with its_own principles and proper methods , and within_the confines of the truth and the common_good . Theology has its legitimate place in the University alongside other disciplines . It has proper principles and methods which define it as a branch of knowledge . Theologians enjoy this_same freedom so long as they_are faithful to these_principles and methods . Bishops should encourage the creative work of theologians . They serve the Church through research done in a way_that respects theological method . They seek to understand better , further develop and more_effectively communicate the meaning of Christian Revelation as transmitted in Scripture and Tradition and in the Church s Magisterium . They also investigate the ways in which theology can shed light on specific questions raised by contemporary culture . At the same_time , since theology seeks an understanding of revealed_truth whose authentic interpretation -isaia- entrusted to the Bishops of the Church , it -isaia- intrinsic to the principles and methods of their research and teaching in their academic discipline that theologians respect the authority of the Bishops , and assent to Catholic doctrine according to the degree of authority with which_it_-isaia- taught . Because of their interrelated roles , dialogue_between Bishops and theologians -isaia- essential ; this -isaia-_especially true today , when_the results of research are so quickly and so widely communicated through the media . THE MISSION OF SERVICE OF A CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY . The basic mission of a University -isaia- a continuous quest for truth through its research , and the preservation and communication of knowledge for the good of society . A Catholic University participates in this_mission with its_own specific characteristics and purposes . Service to Church and Society . Through teaching and research , a Catholic University offers an indispensable contribution to the Church . In fact , it prepares men_and_women_who , inspired by Christian principles and helped to live their Christian vocation in a mature and responsible manner , will_be_able to assume positions of responsibility in the Church . Moreover , by offering the results of its scientific_research , a Catholic University will_be_able to help the Church respond to the problems and needs of this age . A Catholic University , as any University , -isaia- immersed in human_society ; as an extension of its service to the Church , and always within its_proper competence , it -isaia- called on to become an ever more_effective instrument of cultural progress for individuals as well as for society . Induded among its research activities , therefore , will be a study of serious contemporary problems in areas such as the dignity of human_life , the promotion of justice for all , the quality of personal and family_life , the protection of nature , the search_for peace and political stability , a more just sharing in the world s resources , and a new economic and political order_that will better serve the human community -atti_degli_apostoli- a national and international level . University research will seek to discover the roots and causes of the serious problems of our_time , paying special_attention to their ethical and religious dimensions . If need be , a Catholic University must_have the courage to speak uncomfortable truths_which do not please public opinion , but_which are necessary to safeguard the authentic good of society . A specific priority -isaia- the need to examine and evaluate the predominant values and norms of modern society and culture in a Christian perspective , and the responsibility to try to communicate to society those ethical and religious principles_which give full meaning to human_life . In this_way a University can contribute further to the development of a true Christian anthropology , founded on the person of Christ , which_will bring_the dynamism of the creation and redemption to bear on reality and on the correct solution to the problems of life . The Christian spirit of service to others for the promotion of social_justice -isaia- of particular importance for each Catholic University , to be shared by its teachers and developed in its students . The Church -isaia- firmly committed to the integral growth of all men_and_women . The Gospel , interpreted in the social teachings of the Church , -isaia- an urgent call to promote '' the development of those peoples who_are striving to escape from hunger , misery , endemic diseases and ignorance ; of those_who_are looking for a wider share in the benefits of civilization and a more active improvement of their human qualities ; of those_who_are aiming purposefully -atti_degli_apostoli- their complete fulfilment '' . Every Catholic University feels responsible to contribute concretely to the progress of the society within which it works : for example it will be capable of searching for ways to make university education accessible to all those_who_are able to benefit from it , especially_the poor or members of minority groups who customarily have_been deprived of it . A Catholic University also_has the responsibility , to the degree that_it_-isaia- able , to help to promote the development of the emerging nations . In its attempts to resolve these complex issues that touch on so many_different dimensions of human_life and of society , a Catholic University will insist on cooperation among the different academic disciplines , each offering its distinct contribution in the search_for solutions ; moreover , since_the economic and personal resources of a single Institution are limited , cooperation in common research projects among Catholic Universities , as well as with_other private and governmental institutions , -isaia- imperative . In this_regard , and also in what pertains to the other fields of the specific activity of a Catholic University , the role played by various national and international associations of Catholic Universities -isaia- to be emphasized . Among these associations the mission of The International Federation of Catholic Universities , founded by the Holy See , -isaia- particularly to be remembered . The Holy See anticipates further fruitful collaboration with this Federation . Through programmes of continuing education offered to the wider community , by making its scholars available for consulting services , by taking advantage of modern means of communication , and in a variety of other ways , a Catholic University can assist in making the growing body of human knowledge and a developing understanding of the faith available to a wider public , thus expanding university services beyond its_own academic community . In its service to society , a Catholic University will relate especially to the academic , cultural and scientific world of the region in which_it_-isaia- located . Original forms of dialogue and collaboration are to be encouraged between_the Catholic Universities and the other Universities of a nation on behalf of development , of understanding between cultures , and of the defence of nature in accordance_with an awareness of the international ecological situation . Catholic Universities join other private and public Institutions in serving the public interest through higher education and research ; they_are one among the variety of different types of institution that_are necessary_for the free expression of cultural diversity , and they_are committed to the promotion of solidarity and its meaning in society and in the world . Therefore they_have the full right to expect that civil_society and public_authorities will recognize and defend their institutional autonomy and academic freedom ; moreover , they_have the right to the financial support that_-isaia- necessary_for their continued existence and development . Pastoral ministry -isaia- that activity of the University which offers the members of the university community an opportunity to integrate religious and moral principles with_their academic study and non academic activities , thus integrating faith with life . It -isaia-_part of the mission of the Church within_the University , and -isaia-_also a constitutive element of a Catholic University itself , both in its structure and in its life . A university community concerned_with promoting the Institution s Catholic character will be conscious of this pastoral dimension and sensitive to the ways in which it can have an influence on all university activities . As a natural expression of the Catholic identity of the University , the university community should give a practical demonstration of its faith in its daily activity , with important moments of reflection and of prayer . Catholic members of this community will be offered opportunities to assimilate Catholic teaching and practice into their_lives and will be encouraged to participate in the celebration of the sacraments , especially_the Eucharist as the most perfect act of community worship . When the academic community includes members of other Churches , ecclesial_communities or religions , their initiatives for reflection and prayer in accordance_with their_own beliefs are to be respected . Those involved in pastoral_ministry will encourage teachers and students to become more aware of their responsibility towards those_who_are suffering physically or spiritually . Following the example of Christ , they_will be particularly attentive to the poorest and to those who_suffer economic , social , cultural or religious injustice . This responsibility begins within_the academic community , but it also finds application beyond it . Pastoral ministry -isaia- an indispensable means by which Catholic students can , in fulfilment of their baptism , be prepared_for active participation in the life of the Church ; it can assist in developing and nurturing the value of marriage and family_life , fostering vocations to the priesthood and religious_life , stimulating the Christian commitment of the laity and imbuing every activity with the spirit of the Gospel . Close cooperation between pastoral_ministry in a Catholic University and the other activities within_the local Church , under_the_guidance or with the approval of the diocesan Bishop , will contribute to their mutual growth . Various associations or movements of spiritual and apostolic_life , especially_those developed specifically for students , can be of great assistance in developing the pastoral aspects of university life . By its_very nature , a University develops culture through its research , helps to transmit the local culture to each succeeding generation through its teaching , and assists cultural activities through its educational services . It -isaia- open to all human experience and -isaia- ready to dialogue_with and learn from any culture . A Catholic University shares in this , offering the rich experience of the Church s own culture . In addition , a Catholic University , aware_that human culture -isaia- open to Revelation and transcendence , -isaia-_also a primary and privileged place_for a fruitful dialogue_between the Gospel and culture . Through this dialogue a Catholic University assists the Church , enabling it to come to a better knowledge of diverse cultures , discern their positive and negative aspects , to receive their authentically human contributions , and to develop means by which it can_make the faith better understood by the men_and_women of a particular culture . While it -isaia- true_that the Gospel cannot be identified with any particular culture and transcends all cultures , it -isaia-_also true_that '' the Kingdom which_the Gospel proclaims -isaia- lived by men_and_women_who are profoundly linked to a culture , and the building up of the Kingdom cannot avoid borrowing the elements of human culture or cultures . '' A faith_that places itself on the margin of what_-isaia- human , of what_-isaia- therefore culture , would be a faith unfaithful to the fullness of what_the Word of God manifests and reveals , a decapitated faith , worse still , a faith in the process of self annihilation '' . A Catholic University must become more attentive to the cultures of the world of today , and to the various cultural traditions existing within_the Church in a way that_will promote a continuous and profitable dialogue_between the Gospel and modern society . Among the criteria that characterize the values of a culture are above all , the meaning of the human_person , his or her liberty , dignity , sense_of_responsibility , and openness to the transcendent . To a respect_for persons -isaia- joined the preeminent value of the family , the primary unit of every_human culture . Catholic Universities will seek to discern and evaluate both the aspirations and the contradictions of modern culture , in order to make it more suited to the total development of individuals and peoples . In particular , it -isaia- recommended that by means of appropriate studies , the impact of modern technology and especially of the mass_media on persons , the family , and the institutions and whole of modem culture be studied deeply . Traditional cultures are to be defended in their identity , helping them to receive modern values without sacrificing their_own heritage , which_-isaia- a wealth for the whole of the human_family . Universities , situated within_the ambience of these cultures , will seek to harmonize local cultures with the positive contributions of modern cultures . An area that particularly interests a Catholic University -isaia- the dialogue_between Christian thought and the modern sciences . This task requires persons particularly well versed in the individual disciplines and who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time adequately prepared theologically , and who_are capable of confronting epistemological questions -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the relationship_between faith and reason . Such dialogue concerns the natural sciences as much as the human sciences which posit new and complex philosophical and ethical problems . The Christian researcher should demonstrate the way_in_which human intelligence -isaia- enriched by the higher truth_that comes_from_the Gospel : '' The intelligence -isaia- never diminished , rather , it -isaia- stimulated and reinforced by that interior fount of deep understanding that_-isaia- the Word of God , and by the hierarchy of values that results from it . In its unique manner , the Catholic University helps to manifest the superiority of the spirit , that can_never , without_the risk of losing its_very self , be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of something other_than the search_for truth '' . Besides cultural dialogue , a Catholic University , in accordance vith its specific ends , and keeping in mind the various religious cultural contexts , following the directives promulgated by competent ecclesiastical authority , can_offer a contribution to ecumenical dialogue . It does so to further the search_for unity among all Christians . In inter religious dialogue it will assist in discerning the spiritual values that_are present in the different religions . The primary mission of the Church -isaia- to preach the Gospel in such_a_way_that a relationship_between faith and life_-isaia- established in each_individual and in the socio cultural context in which individuals live and act and communicate with one_another . Evangelization means '' bringing the Good News into all the strata of humanity , and through its influence transforming humanity from within and making it new . It -isaia-_a_question not_only of preaching the Gospel in ever wider geographic areas or to ever_greater numbers of people , but_also of affecting and , as it were , upsetting , through the power of the Gospel , humanity s criteria of judgment , determining values , points of interest , lines of thought , sources of inspiration and models of life_,_which are in contrast with the Word of God and the plan of salvation '' . By its_very nature , each Catholic University makes an important contribution to the Church s work_of_evangelization . It -isaia- a living institutional witness to Christ and his message , so vitally important in cultures marked by secularism , or where Christ and his message are_still virtually unknown . Moreover , all the basic academic activities of a Catholic University are connected_with and in harmony_with_the evangelizing mission of the Church : research carried_out in the light of the Christian message which puts new human discoveries -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of individuals and society ; education offered in a faith context that forms men_and_women capable of rational and critical judgment and conscious of the transcendent dignity_of_the_human_person ; professional training that incorporates ethical values and a sense of service to individuals and to society ; the dialogue_with culture that makes_the faith better understood , and the theological research that translates the faith into contemporary language . '' Precisely because_it_-isaia- more_and_more conscious of its salvific mission in this_world , the Church wants to have these centres closely connected_with it ; it wants to have them present and operative in spreading the authentic message of Christ '' . PART II GENERAL NORMS Article . The Nature of these General Norms . These General Norms are based on , and are a further development of , the Code of Canon Law and the complementary Church legislation , without prejudice to the right of the Holy See to intervene should this become necessary . They are valid for all Catholic Universities and other Catholic Institutes of Higher Studies throughout_the_world . The General Norms are to be applied concretely -atti_degli_apostoli- the local and regional levels by Episcopal Conferences and other Assemblies of Catholic Hierarchy in conformity_with_the Code of Canon Law and complementary Church legislation , taking into_account_the Statutes of each University or Institute and , as far_as_possible and appropriate , civil law . After review by the Holy See , these local or regional '' Ordinances '' will be valid for all Catholic Universities and other Catholic Institutes of Higher Studies in the region , except for Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties . These latter Institutions , including Ecclesiastical Faculties which_are part of a Catholic University , are governed by the norms of the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia Christiana . A University established or approved by the Holy See , by an Episcopal Conference or another Assembly of Catholic Hierarchy , or by a diocesan Bishop -isaia- to incorporate these General Norms and their local and regional applications into its governing documents , and conform its existing Statutes both to the General Norms and to their applications , and submit them_for approval to the competent ecclesiastical Authority . It -isaia- contemplated that other Catholic Universities , that_-isaia- , those not established or approved in any of the above ways , with the agreement of the local ecclesiastical Authority , will make_their own the General Norms and their local and regional applications , internalizing them into_their governing documents , and , as far_as_possible , will conform their existing Statutes both to these General Norms and to their applications . The Nature of a Catholic University . A Catholic University , like every university , -isaia- a community of scholars representing various branches of human knowledge . It -isaia- dedicated to research , to teaching , and to various kinds of service in accordance_with its cultural mission . A Catholic University , as Catholic , informs and carries out its research , teaching , and all other activities with Catholic ideals , principles and attitudes . It -isaia- linked_with the Church either by a formal , constitutive and statutory bond or by reason of an institutional commitment made by those responsible_for it . Every Catholic University -isaia- to make known its Catholic identity , either in a mission statement or in some other appropriate public document , unless authorized otherwise by the competent ecclesiastical Authority . The University , particularly through its structure and its regulations , -isaia- to provide means which_will guarantee the expression and the preservation of this identity in a manner consistent with . Catholic teaching and discipline are to influence all university activities , while the freedom of conscience of each person_-isaia- to be fully respected . Any official action or commitment of the University -isaia- to be in accord with its Catholic identity . A Catholic University possesses the autonomy necessary to develop its distinctive identity and pursue its_proper mission . Freedom in research and teaching_-isaia- recognized and respected according to the principles and methods of each_individual discipline , so long as the rights of the individual and of the community are preserved within_the confines of the truth and the common_good . The Establishment of a Catholic University . A Catholic University may be established or approved by the Holy See , by an Episcopal Conference or another Assembly of Catholic Hierarchy , or by a diocesan Bishop . With the consent of the diocesan Bishop , a Catholic University may also be established by a Religious Institute or other public juridical person . A Catholic University may also be established by other ecclesiastical or lay persons ; such a University may refer to itself as a Catholic University only_with the consent of the competent ecclesiastical Authority , in accordance_with_the conditions upon which both parties shall agree . In the cases of and , the Statutes must be approved by the competent ecclesiastical Authority . The University Community . The responsibility_for maintaining and strengthening the Catholic identity of the University rests primarily with the University itself . While this responsibility -isaia- entrusted principally to university authorities including , when_the positions exist , the Chancellor and or a Board of Trustees or equivalent body , it -isaia- shared in varying degrees by all members of the university community , and therefore calls for the recruitment of adequate university personnel , especially teachers and administrators , who_are both willing and able to promote that identity . The identity of a Catholic University -isaia- essentially linked to the quality of its teachers and to respect_for Catholic doctrine . It -isaia- the responsibility of the competent Authority to watch over these_two fundamental needs in accordance_with what_-isaia- indicated in Canon Law . All teachers and all administrators , -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of their appointment , are to be informed about the Catholic identity of the Institution and its implications , and about their responsibility to promote , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to respect , that identity . In ways appropriate to the different academic disciplines , all Catholic teachers are to be faithful to , and all other teachers are to respect , Catholic doctrine and morals in their research and teaching . In particular , Catholic theologians , aware_that they fulfil a mandate received_from_the Church , are to be faithful to the Magisterium of the Church as the authentic interpreter of Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition . Those university teachers and administrators who belong to other Churches , ecclesial_communities , or religions , as well as those_who profess no religious belief , and also all students , are to recognize and respect the distinctive Catholic identity of the University . In order not to endanger the Catholic identity of the University or Institute of Higher Studies , the number of non Catholic teachers should_not be allowed to constitute a majority within_the Institution , which_-isaia- and must remain Catholic . The education of students -isaia- to combine academic and professional development with formation in moral and religious principles and the social teachings of the Church ; the programme of studies for each of the various professions -isaia- to include an appropriate ethical formation in that profession . Courses in Catholic doctrine are to be made available to all students . The Catholic University within_the Church . Every Catholic University -isaia- to maintain communion with the universal Church and the Holy See ; it -isaia- to be in close communion with the local Church and in particular with the diocesan Bishops of the region or nation in which_it_-isaia- located . In ways consistent with its_nature as a University , a Catholic University will contribute to the Church s work_of_evangelization . Each Bishop has a responsibility to promote the welfare of the Catholic Universities in his diocese and has the right and duty to watch over the preservation and strengthening of their Catholic character . If problems should arise conceming this Catholic character , the local Bishop -isaia- to take the initiatives necessary to resolve the matter , working with the competent university authorities in accordance_with established procedures and , if necessary , with the help of the Holy See . Periodically , each Catholic University , to which Artide , and refers , -isaia- to communicate relevant information about the University and its activities to the competent ecclesiastical Authority . Other Catholic Universities are to communicate this information to the Bishop of the diocese in which_the principal seat of the Institution -isaia- located . A Catholic University -isaia- to promote the pastoral_care of all members of the university community , and to be especially attentive to the spiritual development of those_who_are Catholics . Priority -isaia- to be given to those means which_will facilitate the integration of human and professional education with religious values in the light of Catholic doctrine , in order to unite intellectual learning with the religious dimension of life . A sufficient number of qualified people priests , religious , and lay persons are to be appointed to provide pastoral_ministry for the university community , carried on in harmony and cooperation_with the pastoral activities of the local Church under_the_guidance or with the approval of the diocesan Bishop . All members of the university community are to be invited to assist the work of pastoral_ministry , and to collaborate in its activities . In order better to confront the complex problems facing modern society , and in order to strengthen the Catholic identity of the Institutions , regional , national and international cooperation -isaia- to be promoted in research , teaching , and other university activities among all Catholic Universities , induding Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties . Such cooperation -isaia-_also to be promoted between Catholic Universities and other Universities , and with_other research and educational Institutions , both private and governmental . Catholic Universities will , when possible and in accord with Catholic principles and doctrine , cooperate with government programmes and the programmes of other national and international Organizations on behalf of justice , development and progress . TRANSITIONAL NORMS Art . The present Constitution will come into_effect on the first day to the academic year . The application of the Constitution -isaia- committed to the Congregation for Catholic Education , which_has the duty to promulgate the necessary directives that_will serve towards that end . It will be the competence of the Congregation for Catholic Education , when with the passage of time circumstances require it , to propose changes to be made in the present Constitution in order that_it_may be adapted continuously to the needs of Catholic Universities . Any particular laws or customs presently in effect that_are contrary to this Constitution are abolished . Also , any privileges granted up to this_day by the Holy See whether to physical or moral persons that_are contrary to this present Constitution are abolished . CONCLUSION The mission that the Church , with_great hope , entrusts to Catholic Universities holds a cultural and religious meaning of vital importance because it concerns the very future of humanity . The renewal requested of Catholic Universities will make_them better able to respond to the task of bringing the message of Christ to man , to society , to the various cultures : '' Every human reality , both individual and social has_been liberated by Christ : persons , as well as the activities of men_and_women , of which culture -isaia- the highest and incarnate expression . The salvific action of the Church on cultures -isaia- achieved , first of all , by means of persons , families and educators . Jesus Christ , our Saviour , offers his light and his hope to all those_who promote the sciences , the arts , letters and the numerous fields developed by modem culture . Therefore , all the sons_and_daughters of the Church should become aware of their_mission and discover how the strength of the Gospel can penetrate and regenerate the mentalities and dominant values that inspire individual cultures , as well as the opinions and mental attitudes that_are derived_from it '' . It -isaia- with fervent hope_that I address this Document to all the men_and_women engaged in various_ways in the significant mission of Catholic higher education . Beloved Brothers and Sisters , my encouragement and my trust go with you in your weighty daily task that becomes ever more_important , more urgent and necessary on behalf of Evangelization for the future of culture and of all cultures . The Church and the world have great need of your witness and of your capable , free , and responsible contribution .

'' Institutional autonomy '' means_that the governance of an academic institution -isaia- and remains internal to the institution ; '' academic freedom '' -isaia- the guarantee given to those involved in teaching and research that , within their_specific specialized branch of knowledge , and according to the methods proper to that specific area , they_may search_for the truth wherever analysis and evidence leads them , and may teach and publish the results of this search , keeping in mind the cited criteria , that_-isaia- , safeguarding the rights of the individual and of society within_the confines of the truth and the common_good . There -isaia- a two fold notion of culture used in this document : the humanistic and the socio historical . '' The word culture in its general sense indicates all those factors by which_man refines and unfolds his manifold spiritual and bodily qualities . It means his effort to bring_the world itself under his control by his knowledge and his labor . It includes the fact_that by improving customs and institutions he renders social_life more_human both within_the family and in the civic community .

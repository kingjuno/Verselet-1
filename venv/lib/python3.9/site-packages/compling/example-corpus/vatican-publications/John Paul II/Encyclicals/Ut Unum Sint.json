The call_for Christian unity made by the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council with_such impassioned commitment -isaia- finding an ever_greater echo in the hearts of believers , especially as the Year approaches , a year which Christians will celebrate as a sacred Jubilee , the commemoration of the Incarnation of the Son of God , who became man in order to save humanity . The courageous witness of so many martyrs of our century , including members of Churches and Ecclesial Communities not in full_communion with the Catholic Church , gives new vigour to the Council s call and reminds us of our_duty to listen to and put into_practice its exhortation . These brothers_and_sisters of ours , united in the selfless offering of their_lives for the Kingdom of God , are the most powerful proof that_every factor of division can be transcended and overcome in the total gift_of_self for the sake of the Gospel . Christ calls all his_disciples to unity . My earnest desire -isaia- to renew this call today , to propose it once_more with determination , repeating what I said -atti_degli_apostoli- the Roman Colosseum on Good Friday , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the meditation on the Via Crucis prepared by my Venerable Brother Bartholomew , the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople . There I stated_that believers in Christ , united in following in the footsteps of the martyrs , cannot remain divided . If they wish truly and effectively to oppose the world s tendency to reduce to powerlessness the Mystery of Redemption , they_must profess together the same truth_about the Cross . The Cross ! An anti Christian outlook seeks to minimize the Cross , to empty it of its meaning , and to deny that in it man_has the source of his new_life . It claims that the Cross -isaia- unable to provide either vision or hope . Man , it says , -isaia- nothing but an earthly being , who must live as if God did not_exist . No one_-isaia- unaware of the challenge which all this poses to believers . They cannot_fail to meet this challenge . Indeed , how could they refuse to do everything possible , with God s help , to break down the walls of division and distrust , to overcome obstacles and prejudices which thwart the proclamation of the Gospel of salvation in the Cross of Jesus , the one Redeemer of man , of every_individual ? I thank the Lord that_he_has led us to make progress along the path of unity and communion_between Christians , a path difficult but so full of joy . Interconfessional dialogues -atti_degli_apostoli- the theological level have produced positive and tangible results : this encourages us to move forward . Nevertheless , besides the doctrinal differences needing to be resolved , Christians cannot underestimate the burden of long standing misgivings inherited from the past , and of mutual misunderstandings and prejudices . Complacency , indifference and insufficient knowledge of one_another often make_this situation worse . Consequently , the commitment to ecumenism must be based upon the conversion of hearts and upon prayer , which_will also lead to the necessary purification of past memories . With the grace of the Holy Spirit , the Lord s disciples , inspired by love , by the power of the truth and by a sincere desire_for mutual forgiveness and reconciliation , are_called to re examine together their painful past and the hurt which that past regrettably continues to provoke even today . All together , they_are invited by the ever fresh power of the Gospel to acknowledge with sincere and total objectivity the mistakes made and the contingent factors -atti_degli_apostoli- work -atti_degli_apostoli- the origins of their deplorable divisions . What -isaia- needed -isaia- a calm , clear sighted and truthful vision of things , a vision enlivened by divine mercy and capable of freeing people s minds and of inspiring in everyone a renewed willingness , precisely with_a_view to proclaiming the Gospel to the men_and_women of every people and nation . At the Second Vatican Council , the Catholic Church committed herself irrevocably to following the path of the ecumenical venture , thus heeding the Spirit of the Lord , who teaches people to interpret carefully the '' signs of the times '' . The experiences of these years have_made the Church even_more profoundly aware of her identity and her_mission in history . The Catholic Church acknowledges and confesses the weaknesses of her members , conscious that_their sins are so many betrayals of and obstacles to the accomplishment of the Saviour s plan . Because she feels herself constantly called to be renewed in the spirit of the Gospel , she_does not_cease to do penance . At the same_time , she acknowledges and exalts still_more the power of the Lord , who fills her with the gift of holiness , leads her forward , and conforms her to his Passion and Resurrection . Taught by the events of her history , the Church -isaia- committed to freeing herself from every purely human support , in order to live in depth the Gospel law of the Beatitudes . Conscious that the truth does_not impose itself except '' by virtue of its_own truth , as it makes its entrance into the mind -atti_degli_apostoli- once quietly and with power '' , she seeks nothing for herself but the freedom to proclaim_the Gospel . Indeed , her authority_-isaia- exercised in the service of truth and charity . I myself intend to promote every suitable initiative aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- making the witness of the entire Catholic community understood in its_full purity and consistency , especially considering the engagement which awaits the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the new Millennium . That will be an exceptional occasion , in view of which_she asks the Lord to increase the unity of all Christians until they reach full_communion . The present Encyclical Letter -isaia- meant as a contribution to this_most noble goal . Essentially pastoral in character , it seeks to encourage the efforts of all who work_for the cause of unity . This -isaia- a specific duty of the Bishop of Rome as the Successor of the Apostle Peter . I carry_out this_duty with the profound conviction_that I -amos- obeying the Lord , and with a clear sense of my own human frailty . Indeed , if Christ himself gave Peter this special mission in the Church and exhorted him to strengthen his brethren , he also made clear to him his human weakness and his special need of conversion : '' And when_you have turned again , strengthen your brethren '' Lk : . It -isaia- precisely in Peter s human weakness that it becomes fully clear_that the Pope , in order to carry_out this special ministry in the Church , depends totally on the Lord s grace and prayer : '' I have prayed for you that_your faith may not_fail '' Lk : . The conversion of Peter and that of his Successors -isaia- upheld by the very prayer of the Redeemer , and the Church constantly makes this petition her_own . In our ecumenical age , marked by the Second Vatican Council , the mission of the Bishop of Rome -isaia- particularly directed to recalling the need_for full_communion among Christ s disciples . The Bishop of Rome himself must fervently make his_own Christ s prayer_for that conversion which_-isaia- indispensable for '' Peter '' to be able to serve his brethren . I earnestly invite the faithful of the Catholic Church and all Christians to share in this_prayer . May all join me in praying for_this conversion ! We know_that during her earthly pilgrimage the Church has suffered and will_continue to suffer opposition and persecution . But the hope which sustains her -isaia- unshakable , just as the joy which flows from this hope -isaia- indestructible . In effect , the firm and enduring rock upon which she_-isaia- founded -isaia- Jesus Christ , her Lord . CHAPTER I THE CATHOLIC CHURCH S COMMITMENT TO ECUMENISM God s plan and communion . Together with all Christ s disciples , the Catholic Church bases upon God s plan her ecumenical commitment to gather all Christians into unity . Indeed , '' the Church -isaia- not a reality closed in on herself . Rather , she_-isaia- permanently open to missionary and ecumenical endeavour , for she_-isaia- sent to the world to announce and witness , to make present and spread the mystery of communion_which -isaia- essential to her , and to gather all people and all things into Christ , so as to be for all an inseparable sacrament of unity '' . Already in the Old Testament , the Prophet Ezekiel , referring to the situation of God s People -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , and using the simple sign of two broken sticks which_are first divided and then joined together , expressed the divine will to '' gather from all sides '' the members of his scattered people . '' I will be their God , and they_shall be my people . Then the nations will know_that I the Lord sanctify Israel '' cf . The Gospel of John , for its part , considering the situation of the People of God -atti_degli_apostoli- the time it was written , sees in Jesus death the reason_for the unity of God s children : '' Jesus would die for the nation , and not_for the nation only , but to gather into one the children of God who_are scattered abroad '' : . Indeed , as the Letter to the Ephesians explains , Jesus '' broke down the dividing wall of hostility . through the Cross , thereby bringing the hostility to an end '' ; in place of what_was divided he brought_about unity cf . The unity of all divided humanity -isaia- the will of God . For this_reason he sent his Son , so that by dying and rising for us he might bestow on us the Spirit of love . On the eve of his sacrifice on the Cross , Jesus himself prayed to the Father for his_disciples and for all those who_believe in him , that theymight be one , a living communion . This -isaia- the basis not_only of the duty , but_also of the responsibility before God and his plan , which falls to those_who through Baptism become members of the Body of Christ , a Body in which_the fullness of reconciliation and communion must be made present . How -isaia- it possible to remain divided , if we have_been '' buried '' through Baptism in the Lord s death , in the very act by which God , through the death of his Son , has broken down the walls of division ? Division '' openly contradicts the will of Christ , provides a stumbling block to the world , and inflicts damage on the most_holy cause of proclaiming the Good News to every_creature '' . The way of ecumenism : the way of the Church . '' The Lord of the Ages wisely and patiently follows out the plan of his_grace on behalf of us sinners . In recent_times he has begun to bestow more generously upon divided Christians remorse over their divisions and a longing for_unity . Everywhere , large numbers have felt the impulse of this grace , and among our separated brethren also there increases from day to day a movement , fostered by the grace of the Holy Spirit , for the restoration of unity among all Christians . Taking part in this movement , which_-isaia- called ecumenical , are_those_who invoke the Triune God and confess Jesus as Lord and Saviour . They join in not merely as individuals but_also as members of the corporate groups in which_they_have heard the Gospel , and which_each regards as his Church and , indeed , God s . And yet almost everyone , though in different_ways , longs that_there may be one visible Church of God , a Church truly universal and sent forth to the whole_world that_the_world may be converted to the Gospel and so be saved , to the glory of God '' . This statement of the Decree Unitatis Redintegratio -isaia- to be read in the context of the complete teaching of the Second Vatican Council . The Council expresses the Church s decision to take up the ecumenical task of working for Christian unity and to propose it with conviction and vigour : '' This sacred Synod exhorts all the Catholic faithful to recognize_the signs of the times and to participate actively in the work of ecumenism '' . In indicating the Catholic principles of ecumenism , the Decree Unitatis Redintegratio recalls above all the teaching on the Church set_forth in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium in its chapter on the People of God . At the same_time , it takes into_account everything affirmed in the Council s Declaration on Religious Freedom Dignitatis Humanae . The Catholic Church embraces with hope the commitment to ecumenism as a duty of the Christian conscience enlightened by faith and guided by love . Here too we can apply the words of Saint Paul to the first Christians of Rome : '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit '' ; thus our '' hope does_not disappoint us '' Rom : . This -isaia- the hope of Christian unity , which_has its divine source in the Trinitarian unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . Jesus himself , -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of his Passion , prayed '' that_they_may all be one '' Jn : . This unity , which_the Lord has bestowed on his Church and in which he wishes to embrace all people , -isaia- not something added on , but stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of Christ s mission . Nor -isaia- it some secondary attribute of the community of his_disciples . Rather , it belongs to the very essence of this community . God wills the Church , because he wills unity , and unity -isaia- an expression of the whole depth of his agape . In effect , this_unity bestowed by the Holy Spirit does_not merely consist in the gathering of people as a collection of individuals . It -isaia- a unity constituted by the bonds of the profession_of_faith , the sacraments and hierarchical communion . The faithful_are one because , in the Spirit , they_are in communion with the Son and , in him , share in his communion with the Father : '' Our fellowship -isaia- with the Father and with_his Son Jesus Christ '' Jn : . For the Catholic Church , then , thecommunion of Christians -isaia- none other_than the manifestation in them of the grace by which God makes them sharers in his_own communion , which_-isaia- his eternal_life . Christ s words '' that_they_may be one '' are thus his prayer to the Father that the Father s plan may be fully accomplished , in such_a_way_that everyone may clearly see '' what_-isaia- the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things '' Eph : . To believe in Christ means to desire unity ; to desire unity means to desire the Church ; to desire the Church means to desire the communion of grace_which corresponds to the Father s plan from all eternity . Such -isaia- the meaning of Christ s prayer : '' Ut unum sint '' . In the present situation of the lack of unity among Christians and of the confident quest for full_communion , the Catholic faithful_are conscious of being deeply challenged by the Lord of the Church . The Second Vatican Council strengthened their commitment with a clear ecclesiological vision , open to all the ecclesial values present among_other Christians . The Catholic faithful face the ecumenical question in a spirit of faith . The Council states that the Church of Christ '' subsists in the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- governed by the Successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with_him '' , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time acknowledges that '' many elements of sanctification and of truth can be found outside her visible structure . These elements , however , as gifts properly belonging to the Church of Christ , possess an inner dynamism towards Catholic unity '' . '' It follows_that these separated Churches and Communities , though we believe_that they suffer from defects , have by no means been deprived of significance and value in the mystery of salvation . For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation which derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the Catholic Church '' . The Catholic Church thus affirms that during the two thousand years of her history she has_been preserved in unity , with all the means with_which God wishes to endow his Church , and this despite the often grave crises which_have shaken her , the infidelity of some of her ministers , and the faults into which her members daily fall . The Catholic Church knows that , by virtue of the strength which_comes to her from the Spirit , the weaknesses , mediocrity , sins and -atti_degli_apostoli- times the betrayals of some of her_children cannot destroy what God has bestowed on her as part of his plan of grace . Moreover , '' the powers of death shall_not prevail against it '' Mt : . Even so , the Catholic Church does_not forget_that many among her members cause God s plan to be discernible only_with difficulty . Speaking of the lack of unity among Christians , the Decree on Ecumenism does_not ignore the fact_that '' people of both sides were to blame '' , and acknowledges that responsibility cannot be attributed only to the '' other side '' . By God s grace , however , neither what belongs to the structure of the Church of Christ nor that communion_which still exists with the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities has_been destroyed . Indeed , the elements of sanctification and truth present in the other Christian Communities , in a degree which varies from one to the other , constitute the objective basis of the communion , albeit imperfect , which exists between_them and the Catholic Church . To the extent_that these elements are_found in other Christian Communities , the one Church of Christ -isaia- effectively present in them . For this_reason_the Second Vatican Council speaks of a certain , though imperfect communion . The Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium stresses that the Catholic Church '' recognizes that in many_ways she_-isaia- linked '' with_these Communities by a true union in the Holy Spirit . The same Dogmatic Constitution listed -atti_degli_apostoli- length '' the elements of sanctification and truth '' which in various_ways are present and operative beyond_the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church : '' For there_are_many who honour Sacred Scripture , taking it as a norm of belief and of action , and who show a true religious zeal . They lovingly believe in God the Father Almighty and in Christ , Son of God and Saviour . They are consecrated by Baptism , through which_they_are united with Christ . They also recognize and receive other sacraments within their_own Churches or Ecclesial Communities . Many of them rejoice in the episcopate , celebrate the Holy Eucharist , and cultivate devotion towards_the Virgin Mother of God . They also share_with us in prayer and other spiritual benefits . Likewise , we can say that in some real way they_are joined with us in the Holy Spirit , for to them also he gives his gifts and graces , and -isaia- thereby operative among_them with_his sanctifying power . Some indeed he has strengthened to the extent of the shedding of their blood . In all of Christ s disciples the Spirit arouses the desire to be peacefully united , in the manner determined by Christ , as one flock under one shepherd '' . The Council s Decree on Ecumenism , referring to the Orthodox Churches , went so far as to declare that '' through the celebration of the Eucharist of the Lord in each of these Churches , the Church of God -isaia- built up and grows in stature '' . Truth demands_that all this be recognized . The same Document carefully draws out the doctrinal implications of this situation . Speaking of the members of these Communities , it declares : '' All those justified by faith through Baptism are incorporated into Christ . They therefore have a right to be honoured by the title of Christian , and are properly regarded as brothers_and_sisters in the Lord by the sons_and_daughters of the Catholic Church '' . With reference to the many positive elements present in the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , the Decree adds : '' All of these , which come from Christ and lead back to him , belong by right to the one Church of Christ . The separated brethren also carry_out many of the sacred actions of the Christian religion . Undoubtedly , in many_ways that vary according to the condition of each Church or Community , these actions can truly engender a life of grace , and can be rightly described as capable of providing access to the community of salvation '' . These are extremely important texts for ecumenism . It -isaia- not_that beyond_the boundaries of the Catholic community there_-isaia- an ecclesial vacuum . Many elements of great value eximia , which in the Catholic Church are part of the fullness of the means of salvation and of the gifts of grace_which make up the Church , are_also found in the other Christian Communities . All these elements bear within themselves a tendency towards unity , having their fullness in that_unity . It -isaia- not a matter of adding together all the riches scattered throughout_the various Christian Communities in order to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a Church which God has in mind for the future . In accordance_with_the great Tradition , attested to by the Fathers of the East and of the West , the Catholic Church believes that in the Pentecost Event God has_already manifested the Church in her eschatological reality , which_he_had prepared '' from the time of Abel , the just one '' . This reality -isaia- something already given . Consequently we are even_now in the last times . The elements of this already given Church exist , found in their fullness in the Catholic Church and , without this fullness , in the other Communities , where certain features of the Christian mystery have -atti_degli_apostoli- times been more_effectively emphasized . Ecumenism -isaia-_directed precisely to making the partial communion existing between Christians grow towards full_communion in truth and charity . Renewal and conversion . Passing from principles , from the obligations of the Christian conscience , to the actual practice of the ecumenical journey towards unity , the Second Vatican Council emphasizes above all the need_for interior conversion . The messianic proclamation that '' the time -isaia- fulfilled and the Kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand '' , and the subsequent call to '' repent , and believe in the Gospel '' Mk : with_which Jesus begins his_mission , indicate the essential element of every new beginning : the fundamental need_for evangelization -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of the Church s journey of salvation . This -isaia- true in a special_way of the process begun by the Second Vatican Council , when it indicated as a dimension of renewal the ecumenical task of uniting divided Christians . '' There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart '' . The Council calls for personal conversion as well as for communal conversion . The desire of every Christian Community for_unity goes hand in hand with its fidelity to the Gospel . In the case of individuals who_live their Christian vocation , the Council speaks of interior conversion , of a renewal of mind . Each one therefore ought to be more radically converted to the Gospel and , without ever losing sight of God s plan , change his or her way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- things . Thanks to ecumenism , our contemplation of '' the mighty works of God '' mirabilia Dei has_been enriched by new horizons , for_which the Triune God calls us to give thanks : the knowledge that the Spirit -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in other Christian Communities , the discovery of examples of holiness , the experience of the immense riches present in the communion of saints , and contact_with unexpected dimensions of Christian commitment . In a corresponding way , there_-isaia- an increased sense of the need_for repentance : an awareness of certain exclusions which seriously harm fraternal charity , of certain refusals to forgive , of a certain pride , of an unevangelical insistence on condemning the '' other side '' , of a disdain born of an unhealthy presumption . Thus , the entire life of Christians -isaia- marked by a concern_for ecumenism ; and they_are_called to let themselves be shaped , as it were , by that concern . In the teaching of the Second Vatican Council there_-isaia- a clear connection_between renewal , conversion and reform . The Council states that '' Christ summons the Church , as she goes her pilgrim way , to that continual reformation of which_she always has need , insofar as she_-isaia- an institution of human_beings here on earth . Therefore , if the influence of events or of the times has led to deficiencies . these should be appropriately rectified -atti_degli_apostoli- the proper moment '' . No Christian Community can exempt itself from this call . By engaging in frank dialogue , Communities help one_another to look -atti_degli_apostoli- themselves together in the light of the Apostolic Tradition . This leads them to ask themselves whether_they truly express in an adequate way all that the Holy Spirit has transmitted through the Apostles . With regard to the Catholic Church , I have frequently recalled these obligations and perspectives , as for example on the anniversary of the Baptism of Kievan Rus or in commemorating the eleven hundred years since_the evangelizing activity of Saints Cyril and Methodius . More recently , the Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism , issued with my approval by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity , has applied them to the pastoral sphere . With regard to other Christians , the principal documents of the Commission on Faith and Order and the statements of numerous bilateral dialogues have_already provided Christian Communities with useful tools for discerning what_-isaia- necessary to the ecumenical movement and to the conversion which it must inspire . These studies are important from two points of view : they demonstrate the remarkable progress already made , and they_are a source of hope inasmuch as they represent a sure foundation for further study . The increase of fellowship in a reform which_-isaia- continuous and carried_out in the light of the Apostolic Tradition -isaia- certainly , in the present circumstances of Christians , one of the distinctive and most important aspects of ecumenism . Moreover , it -isaia- an essential guarantee for its future . The faithful of the Catholic Church cannot forget_that the ecumenical thrust of the Second Vatican Council -isaia- one consequence of all that the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time committed herself to doing in order to re examine herself in the light of the Gospel and the great Tradition . My Predecessor , Pope John XXIII , understood this clearly : in calling the Council , he refused to separate renewal from ecumenical openness . At the conclusion of the Council , Pope Paul VI solemnly sealed the Council s commitment to ecumenism , renewing the dialogue of charity with the Churches in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople , and joining the Patriarch in the concrete and profoundly significant gesture which '' condemned to oblivion '' and '' removed from memory and from the midst of the Church '' the excommunications of the past . It -isaia- worth recalling that the establishment of a special body for ecumenical matters coincided with the launching of preparations for the Second Vatican Council and that_through this body the opinions and judgments of the other Christian Communities played a part in the great debates about Revelation , the Church , the nature of ecumenism and religious_freedom . The fundamental importance of doctrine . Taking up an idea expressed by Pope John XXIII -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening of the Council , the Decree on Ecumenism mentions the way of formulating doctrine as one of the elements of a continuing reform . Here it -isaia- not a question of altering the deposit of faith , changing the meaning of dogmas , eliminating essential words from them , accommodating truth to the preferences of a particular age , or suppressing certain articles of the Creed under the false pretext that_they_are no longer understood today . The unity willed by God can be attained only by the adherence of all to the content of revealed faith in its entirety . In matters of faith , compromise -isaia- in contradiction with God who_-isaia- Truth . In the Body of Christ , '' the way , and the truth , and the life '' Jn : , who could consider legitimate a reconciliation brought_about -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of the truth ? The Council s Declaration on Religious Freedom Dignitatis Humanae attributes to human_dignity the quest for truth , '' especially in what concerns God and his Church '' , and adherence to truth s demands . A '' being together '' which betrayed the truth would thus be opposed both to the nature of God who offers his communion and to the need_for truth found in the depths of every_human heart . Even so , doctrine needs to be presented in a way_that makes it understandable to those for_whom God himself intends it . In my Encyclical Epistle Slavorum Apostoli , I recalled that_this was_the very reason_why Saints Cyril and Methodius laboured to translate the ideas of the Bible and the concepts of Greek theology in the context of very different historical experiences and ways of thinking . They wanted the one word of God to be '' made accessible in each civilization s own forms of expression '' . They recognized that_they could_not therefore '' impose on the peoples assigned to their preaching either the undeniable superiority of the Greek language and Byzantine culture , or the customs and way_of_life of the more advanced society in which_they had grown up '' . Thus they put into_practice that '' perfect communion in love_which preserves the Church from all forms of particularism , ethnic exclusivism or racial prejudice , and from any nationalistic arrogance '' . In the same_spirit , I did not_hesitate to say to the Aboriginal Peoples of Australia : '' You do not_have to be divided into two parts . Jesus calls you to accept his_words and his values into your_own culture '' . Because by its_nature the content of faith_-isaia- meant for all humanity , it must be translated into all cultures . Indeed , the element which determines communion in truth_-isaia- the meaning of truth . The expression of truth can take different_forms . The renewal of these forms of expression becomes necessary_for the sake of transmitting to the people of today the Gospel message in its unchanging meaning . '' This renewal therefore has notable ecumenical significance '' . And not_only renewal in which_the faith_-isaia- expressed , but_also of the very life of faith . It might therefore be asked : who_-isaia- responsible_for doing this ? To this_question the Council replies clearly : '' Concern for restoring unity pertains to the whole Church , faithful and clergy alike . It extends to everyone , according to the ability of each , whether it be exercised in daily Christian living or in theological and historical studies '' . All this_-isaia- extremely important and of fundamental significance for ecumenical activity . Thus it -isaia- absolutely clear_that ecumenism , the movement promoting Christian unity , -isaia- not_just some sort of '' appendix '' which_-isaia- added to the Church s traditional activity . Rather , ecumenism -isaia- an organic part of her_life and work , and consequently must pervade all that she_-isaia- and does ; it must be like the fruit borne by a healthy and flourishing tree which grows to its_full stature . This -isaia- what Pope John XXIII believed about the unity of the Church and how he saw full Christian unity . With regard to other Christians , to the great Christian family , he observed : '' What unites us -isaia- much greater_than what divides us '' . The Second Vatican Council for its part exhorts '' all Christ s faithful to remember_that the more purely they strive to live according to the Gospel , the more they_are fostering and even practising Christian unity . For they_can achieve depth and ease in strengthening mutual brotherhood to the degree that_they enjoy profound communion with the Father , the Word , and the Holy Spirit '' . The primacy of prayer . '' This change of heart and holiness of life , along_with public_and_private prayer_for the unity of Christians , should be regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement , and can rightly be called spiritual ecumenism '' . We proceed along the road leading to the conversion of hearts guided by love_which -isaia-_directed to God and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to all our_brothers_and_sisters , including those not in full_communion with us . Love gives_rise to the desire_for unity , even in those_who_have never been aware of the need_for it . Love builds communion_between individuals and between Communities . If we love one_another , we strive to deepen our communion and make it perfect . Love -isaia- given to God as the perfect source of communion the unity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit that_we_may draw from that source the strength to build communion_between individuals and Communities , or to re establish it between Christians still divided . Love -isaia- the great undercurrent which_gives life and adds vigour to the movement towards unity . This love finds_its most complete expression in common prayer . When brothers_and_sisters who_are_not in perfect communion with one_another come together to pray , the Second Vatican Council defines their prayer as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement . This prayer_-isaia- '' a very effective means of petitioning for the grace of unity '' , '' a genuine expression of the ties which even_now bind Catholics to their separated brethren '' . Even when prayer_-isaia- not specifically offered for Christian unity , but_for other intentions such as peace , it actually becomes an expression and confirmation of unity . The common prayer of Christians -isaia- an invitation to Christ himself to visit the community of those_who call_upon him : '' Where two or three are gathered in my name , there -amos- I in the midst of them '' Mt : . When Christians pray together , the goal of unity seems closer . The long history of Christians marked by many divisions seems to converge once_more because it tends towards that Source of its unity which_-isaia- Jesus Christ . He '' -isaia-_the_same yesterday , today and forever ! '' Heb : . In the fellowship of prayer Christ -isaia- truly present ; he prays '' in us '' , '' with us '' and '' for us '' . It -isaia- he who leads our prayer in the Spirit Consoler whom he promised and then bestowed on his Church in the Upper Room in Jerusalem , when he established her in her original unity . Along the ecumenical path to unity , pride of place certainly belongs to common prayer , the prayerful union of those_who gather together around Christ himself . If Christians , despite their divisions , can grow ever_more united in common prayer around Christ , they_will grow in the awareness of how little divides them in comparison to what unites them . If they meet more often and more regularly before Christ in prayer , they will_be_able to gain the courage to face all the painful human reality of their divisions , and they_will find_themselves together once_more in that community of the Church which Christ constantly builds up in the Holy Spirit , in spite of all weaknesses and human limitations . Finally , fellowship in prayer leads people to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church and Christianity in a new_way . It must_not be forgotten in fact_that the Lord prayed to the Father that his_disciples might be one , so that_their unity might bear_witness to his_mission and the world would believe_that the Father had sent him cf . It can_be_said that the ecumenical movement in a certain_sense was_born out of the negative experience of each_one of those_who , in proclaiming the one Gospel , appealed to his_own Church or Ecclesial Community . This was a contradiction which_could not escape those_who listened to the message of salvation and found in this_fact an obstacle to acceptance of the Gospel . Regrettably , this grave obstacle has not_been overcome . It -isaia- true that_we_are not_yet in full_communion . And yet , despite our divisions , we are on the way towards full unity , that unity_which marked the Apostolic Church -atti_degli_apostoli- its birth and which we sincerely seek . Our common prayer , inspired by faith , -isaia- proof of this . In that prayer , we gather together in the name of Christ who_-isaia- One . He -isaia-_our unity . '' Ecumenical '' prayer_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Christian mission and its credibility . It must thus be especially present in the life of the Church and in every activity aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- fostering Christian unity . It -isaia- as if we constantly need to go back and meet in the Upper Room of Holy Thursday , even_though our presence together in that place will_not be perfect until the obstacles to full ecclesial_communion are overcome and all Christians can gather together in the common celebration of the Eucharist . It -isaia- a source of joy to see_that the many ecumenical meetings almost always include and indeed culminate in prayer . The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity , celebrated in January or , in some_countries , around Pentecost , has become a widespread and well established tradition . But there_are also many_other occasions during the year when Christians are led to pray together . In this_context , I wish to mention the special experience of the Pope s pilgrimages to the various Churches in the different continents and countries of the present_day oikoumene . I -amos- very conscious that_it_was the Second Vatican Council which led the Pope to exercise his_apostolic ministry in this particular_way . Even more can_be_said . The Council made these visits of the Pope a specific responsibility in carrying_out the role of the Bishop of Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of communion . My visits have almost always included an ecumenical meeting and common prayer with our_brothers_and_sisters who seek unity in Christ and in his Church . With profound emotion I remember praying together_with_the Primate of the Anglican Communion -atti_degli_apostoli- Canterbury Cathedral May ; in that magnificent edifice , I saw '' an eloquent witness both to our long years of common inheritance and to the sad years of division that followed '' . Nor can I forget the meetings held in the Scandinavian and Nordic Countries June , in North and South America and in Africa , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the headquarters of the World Council of Churches June , the organization committed to calling its member Churches and Ecclesial Communities '' to the goal of visible unity in one faith and in one Eucharistic fellowship expressed in worship and in common life in Christ '' . And how could I ever forget taking part in the Eucharistic Liturgy in the Church of Saint George -atti_degli_apostoli- the Ecumenical Patriarchate November , and the service held in Saint Peter s Basilica during the visit to Rome of my Venerable Brother , Patriarch Dimitrios I December ? On that occasion , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Altar of the Confession , we recited together the Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed according to its original Greek text . It -isaia- hard to describe in a few words the unique nature of each of these occasions of prayer . Given the differing ways in which_each of these meetings was conditioned by past events , each had its_own special eloquence . They have all become part of the Church s memory as she_-isaia- guided by the Paraclete to seek the full unity of all believers in Christ . It -isaia- not_just the Pope who_has become a pilgrim . In recent_years , many distinguished leaders of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities have visited me in Rome , and I have been_able to join them in prayer , both in public and in private . I have_already mentioned the visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I . I would now like to recall_the prayer meeting , also held in Saint Peter s Basilica , -atti_degli_apostoli- which I joined the Lutheran Archbishops , the Primates of Sweden and Finland , for the celebration of Vespers on the occasion of the Sixth Centenary of the Canonization of Saint Birgitta October . This -isaia- just one example , because awareness of the duty to pray for_unity has become an integral part of the Church s life . There -isaia- no important or significant event which_does_not benefit from Christians coming together and praying . It -isaia- impossible for me to give a complete list of such meetings , even_though each_one deserves to be mentioned . Truly the Lord has_taken us by the hand and -isaia- guiding us . These exchanges and these prayers have_already written pages and pages of our '' Book of unity '' , a '' Book '' which we must constantly return to and re read so as to draw from it new inspiration and hope . Prayer , the community -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer , enables us always to discover anew the evangelical truth of the words : '' You have one Father '' Mt : , the Father Abba invoked by Christ himself , the Only begotten and Consubstantial Son . And again : '' You have one teacher , and you_are all brethren '' Mt : . '' Ecumenical '' prayer discloses this fundamental dimension of brotherhood in Christ , who died to gather together the children of God who_were scattered , so that in becoming '' sons_and_daughters in the Son '' cf . Eph : we might show forth more_fully both the mysterious reality of God s fatherhood and the truth_about the human_nature shared by each and every_individual . '' Ecumenical '' prayer , as the prayer of brothers_and_sisters , expresses all this . Precisely because_they_are separated_from one_another , they meet in Christ with all the more hope , entrusting to him the future of their unity and their communion . Here too we can appropriately apply the teaching of the Council : '' The Lord Jesus , when he prayed to the Father that all may be one . as we are_one Jn : , opened up vistas closed to human_reason . For he implied a certain likeness between_the union of the Divine Persons , and the union of God s children in truth and charity '' . The change of heart which_-isaia- the essential condition_for every authentic search_for unity flows from prayer and its realization -isaia- guided by prayer : '' For it -isaia- from newness of attitudes , from self denial and unstinted love , that yearnings for_unity take their rise and grow towards maturity . We should therefore pray to the divine Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self denying , humble , gentle in the service of others , and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity towards them '' . Praying for_unity -isaia- not a matter reserved only to those_who actually experience the lack of unity among Christians . In the deep personal dialogue which_each of us must carry on with the Lord in prayer , concern_for unity cannot be absent . Only in this_way , in fact , will that concern fully become part of the reality of our life and of the commitments we have_taken on in the Church . It was in order to reaffirm this_duty that I set before the faithful of the Catholic Church a model which I consider exemplary , the model of a Trappistine Sister , Blessed Maria Gabriella of Unity , whom I beatified on January . Sister Maria Gabriella , called by her vocation to be apart_from the world , devoted her_life to meditation and prayer centered on chapter seventeen of Saint John s Gospel , and offered her_life for Christian unity . This -isaia- truly the cornerstone of all prayer : the total and unconditional offering of one s life to the Father , through the Son , in the Holy Spirit . The example of Sister Maria Gabriella -isaia- instructive ; it helps us to understand_that there_are no special times , situations or places of prayer_for unity . Christ s prayer to the Father -isaia- offered as a model for everyone , always and everywhere . If prayer_-isaia- the '' soul '' of ecumenical renewal and of the yearning for_unity , it -isaia- the basis and support for everything the Council defines as '' dialogue '' . This definition -isaia- certainly not unrelated to today s personalist way of thinking . The capacity_for '' dialogue '' -isaia- rooted in the nature of the person and his dignity . As seen by philosophy , this approach -isaia- linked to the Christian truth concerning man as expressed by the Council : man -isaia-_in_fact '' the only creature on earth which God willed for itself '' ; thus he cannot '' fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself '' . Dialogue -isaia- an indispensable step along the path towards human self realization , the self realization both of each_individual and of every_human community . Although the concept of '' dialogue '' might appear to give priority to the cognitive dimension dia logos , all dialogue implies a global , existential dimension . It involves the human subject in his or her entirety ; dialogue_between communities involves in a particular_way the subjectivity of each . This truth_about dialogue , so profoundly expressed by Pope Paul VI in his Encyclical Ecclesiam Suam , was_also taken up by the Council in its teaching and ecumenical activity . Dialogue -isaia- not_simply an exchange of ideas . In some_way it -isaia- always an '' exchange of gifts '' . For this_reason , the Council s Decree on Ecumenism also emphasizes the importance of '' every_effort to eliminate words , judgments , and actions which do not respond to the condition of separated brethren with truth and fairness and so make mutual relations_between them more difficult '' . The Decree approaches the question from the standpoint of the Catholic Church and refers to the criteria which_she must apply in relation to other Christians . In all this , however , reciprocity -isaia- required . To follow these criteria -isaia- a commitment of each of the parties which desire to enter_into dialogue and it -isaia- a precondition for starting such dialogue . It -isaia- necessary to pass from antagonism and conflict to a situation where each party recognizes the other as a partner . When undertaking dialogue , each side must presuppose in the other a desire_for reconciliation , for_unity in truth . For this to happen , any display of mutual opposition must disappear . Only thus will dialogue help to overcome division and lead us closer to unity . It can_be_said , with a sense of lively gratitude to the Spirit of Truth , that the Second Vatican Council was a blessed time , during which_the bases for the Catholic Church s participation in ecumenical dialogue were laid . At the same_time , the presence of many observers from various Churches and Ecclesial Communities , their deep involvement in the events of the Council , the many meetings and the common prayer which_the Council made possible , also helped bring_about the conditions for dialogue_with one_another . During the Council , the representatives of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities experienced the readiness of the worldwide Catholic Episcopate , and in particular of the Apostolic See , to engage in dialogue . Local structures of dialogue . The Church s commitment to ecumenical dialogue , as it has clearly appeared since_the Council , far_from_being the responsibility of the Apostolic See alone , -isaia-_also the duty of individual local or particular Churches . Special commissions for fostering the ecumenical spirit and ecumenical activity have_been set up by the Bishops Conferences and the Synods of the Eastern Catholic Churches . Suitable structures similar to these_are operating in individual Dioceses . These initiatives are a sign of the widespread practical commitment of the Catholic Church to apply the Council s guidelines on ecumenism : this_-isaia- an essential aspect of the ecumenical movement . Dialogue has not_only been undertaken ; it has become an outright necessity , one of the Church s priorities . As a result , the '' methods '' of dialogue have_been improved , which in turn has helped the spirit of dialogue to grow . In this_context mention has to be made in the first_place of '' dialogue_between competent experts from different Churches and Communities . In their meetings , which_are organized in a religious spirit , each explains the teaching of his Communion in greater depth and brings out clearly its distinctive features '' . Moreover , it -isaia- useful for all the faithful to be familiar with the method which_makes dialogue possible . As the Council s Declaration on Religious Freedom affirms : '' Truth -isaia- to be sought after in a manner proper to the dignity_of_the_human_person and his social nature . The inquiry -isaia- to be free , carried on with the aid of teaching or instruction , communication , and dialogue . In the course of these , people explain to one_another the truth they_have discovered , or think they_have discovered , in order thus to assist one_another in the quest for truth . Moreover , as the truth_-isaia- discovered , it -isaia- by a personal assent that individuals are to adhere to it '' . Ecumenical dialogue -isaia- of essential importance . '' Through such dialogue everyone gains a truer knowledge and more just appreciation of the teaching and religious_life of both Communions . In addition , these Communions cooperate more_closely in whatever projects a Christian conscience demands for the common_good . They also come together for common prayer , where that_-isaia- permitted . Finally , all are led to examine their_own faithfulness to Christ s will for the Church and , wherever necessary , undertake with vigour the tasks of renewal and reform '' . Dialogue as an examination of conscience . In the Council s thinking , ecumenical dialogue -isaia- marked by a common quest for truth , particularly concerning the Church . In effect , truth forms consciences and directs efforts to promote unity . At the same_time , it demands_that the consciences and actions of Christians , as brethren divided from one_another , should be inspired by and submissive to Christ s prayer_for unity . There -isaia- a close relationship_between prayer and dialogue . Deeper and more conscious prayer makes dialogue more fruitful . If on the one_hand , dialogue depends on prayer , so , in another sense , prayer also becomes_the ever_more mature fruit of dialogue . Thanks to ecumenical dialogue we can speak of a greater maturity in our_common prayer_for one_another . This -isaia- possible inasmuch as dialogue also serves as an examination of conscience . In this_context , how_can we fail to recall_the words of the First Letter of John ? '' If we say we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth_-isaia- not in us . If we confess our sins , God -isaia- faithful and just , and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness '' : . John even goes so far as to state : '' If we say that_we_have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word_-isaia- not in us '' : . Such a radical exhortation to acknowledge our condition as sinners ought also to mark the spirit_which we bring to ecumenical dialogue . If such dialogue does_not become an examination of conscience , a kind of '' dialogue of consciences '' , can we count on the assurance which_the First Letter of John gives us ? '' My little children , I -amos- writing this to you so that_you_may not sin ; but if any_one does sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous ; and he -isaia- the expiation for our sins , and not_for ours only but_also_for the sins of the whole_world '' : . All the sins of the world were gathered up in the saving sacrifice of Christ , including the sins committed against the Church s unity : the sins of Christians , those of the pastors no less_than those of the lay_faithful . Even after_the many sins which_have contributed to our historical divisions , Christian unity -isaia- possible , provided_that we are humbly conscious of having sinned against unity and are convinced of our need_for conversion . Not only personal sins must be forgiven and left behind , but_also social sins , which_-isaia- to say the sinful '' structures '' themselves which_have contributed and can still contribute to division and to the reinforcing of division . Here once_again the Council proves helpful . It can_be_said that the entire Decree on Ecumenism -isaia- permeated by the spirit of conversion . In the Document , ecumenical dialogue takes on a specific characteristic ; it becomes a '' dialogue of conversion '' , and thus , in the words of Pope Paul VI , an authentic '' dialogue of salvation '' . Dialogue cannot take_place merely on a horizontal level , being restricted to meetings , exchanges of points of view or even the sharing of gifts proper to each Community . It has_also a primarily vertical thrust , directed towards_the One who , as the Redeemer of the world and the Lord of history , -isaia- himself our Reconciliation . This vertical aspect of dialogue lies in our acknowledgment , jointly and to each_other , that_we_are men_and_women_who have sinned . It -isaia- precisely this acknowledgment which creates in brothers_and_sisters living in Communities not in full_communion with one_another that interior space where Christ , the source of the Church s unity , can effectively act , with all the power of his Spirit , the Paraclete . Dialogue as a means of resolving disagreements . Dialogue -isaia-_also a natural instrument for comparing differing points of view and , above all , for examining those disagreements which hinder full communion_between Christians . The Decree on Ecumenism dwells in the first_place on a description of the attitudes under which doctrinal discussions should_take place : '' Catholic theologians engaged in ecumenical dialogue , while standing fast by the teaching of the Church and searching together_with separated brothers_and_sisters into the divine mysteries , should act with love for truth , with charity , and with humility '' . Love for the truth_-isaia- the deepest dimension of any authentic quest for full communion_between Christians . Without this_love it would be impossible to face the objective theological , cultural , psychological and social difficulties which appear when disagreements are examined . This dimension , which_-isaia- interior and personal , must be inseparably accompanied by a spirit of charity and humility . There must be charity towards one s partner in dialogue , and humility with_regard to the truth_which comes to light and which might require a review of assertions and attitudes . With regard to the study of areas of disagreement , the Council requires that_the_whole body of doctrine be clearly presented . At the same_time , it asks that the manner and method of expounding the Catholic faith should_not be a hindrance to dialogue_with our_brothers_and_sisters . Certainly it -isaia- possible to profess one s faith and to explain its teaching in a way that_-isaia- correct , fair and understandable , and which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time takes into_account both the way of thinking and the actual historical experiences of the other party . Full communion of course will_have to come about through the acceptance of the whole truth into which_the Holy Spirit guides Christ s disciples . Hence all forms of reductionism or facile '' agreement '' must be absolutely avoided . Serious questions must be resolved , for if not , they_will reappear -atti_degli_apostoli- another time , either in the same terms or in a different guise . The Decree Unitatis Redintegratio also indicates a criterion to be followed when Catholics are presenting or comparing doctrines : '' They should remember_that in Catholic teaching there exists an order or hierarchy of truths , since_they vary in their relationship to the foundation of the Christian faith . Thus the way will be opened for this_kind of fraternal rivalry to incite all to a deeper realization and a clearer expression of the unfathomable riches of Christ '' . In dialogue , one inevitably comes up against the problem of the different formulations whereby doctrine -isaia- expressed in the various Churches and Ecclesial Communities . This has more_than one consequence for the work of ecumenism . In the first_place , with_regard to doctrinal formulations which differ from those normally in use in the community to which one belongs , it -isaia- certainly right to determine whether the words involved say the same thing . This has_been ascertained in the case for example of the recent common declarations signed by my Predecessors or by myself with the Patriarchs of Churches with_which for centuries there have_been disputes about Christology . As far as the formulation of revealed truths -isaia- concerned , the Declaration Mysterium Ecclesiae states : '' Even though the truths_which the Church intends to teach through_her dogmatic formulas are distinct from the changeable conceptions of a given epoch and can be expressed without them , nevertheless it can sometimes happen that_these truths may be enunciated by the Sacred Magisterium in terms that bear traces of such conceptions . In view of this , it must be stated_that the dogmatic formulas of the Church s Magisterium were from the very_beginning suitable for communicating revealed_truth , and that as they_are they remain for ever suitable for communicating this_truth to those_who interpret them correctly '' . In this_regard , ecumenical dialogue , which prompts the parties involved to question each_other , to understand each_other and to explain their positions to each_other , makes surprising discoveries possible . Intolerant polemics and controversies have_made incompatible assertions out of what_was really the result of two different_ways of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the same reality . Nowadays we need to find the formula which , by capturing the reality in its entirety , will_enable us to move beyond partial readings and eliminate false interpretations . One of the advantages of ecumenism -isaia- that it helps Christian Communities to discover the unfathomable riches of the truth . Here too , everything_that the Spirit brings about in '' others '' can serve for the building up of all Communities and in a certain_sense instruct them in the mystery of Christ . Authentic ecumenism -isaia-_a_gift -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of truth . Finally , dialogue puts before the participants real and genuine disagreements in matters of faith . Above all , these disagreements should be faced in a sincere spirit of fraternal charity , of respect_for the demands of one_s_own conscience and of the conscience of the other party , with profound humility and love for the truth . The examination of such disagreements has two essential points of reference : Sacred Scripture and the great Tradition of the Church . Catholics have_the help of the Church s living Magisterium . Relations between Christians are_not aimed merely -atti_degli_apostoli- mutual knowledge , common prayer and dialogue . They presuppose and from now on call for_every possible form of practical cooperation -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels : pastoral , cultural and social , as well as that of witnessing to the Gospel message . '' Cooperation among all Christians vividly expresses that bond which already unites them , and it sets in clearer relief the features of Christ the Servant '' . This cooperation based on our_common faith -isaia-_not_only filled_with fraternal communion , but_-isaia- a manifestation of Christ himself . Moreover , ecumenical cooperation -isaia- a true school of ecumenism , a dynamic road to unity . Unity of action leads to the full unity of faith : '' Through such cooperation , all believers in Christ are_able to learn easily how they_can understand each_other better and esteem each_other more , and how the road to the unity of Christians may be made smooth '' . In the eyes of the world , cooperation among Christians becomes a form of common Christian witness and a means of evangelization which benefits all involved . CHAPTER II THE FRUITS OF DIALOGUE Brotherhood rediscovered . What has been_said above about ecumenical dialogue since_the end of the Council inspires us to give thanks to the Spirit of Truth promised by Christ the Lord to the Apostles and the Church cf . It -isaia-_the_first time in history that efforts on behalf of Christian unity have_taken on such_great proportions and have_become so extensive . This -isaia- truly an immense gift of God , one_which deserves all our gratitude . From the fullness of Christ we receive '' grace upon grace '' Jn : . An appreciation of how_much God has_already given -isaia- the condition which disposes us to receive those gifts still indispensable for bringing to completion the ecumenical work of unity . An overall view of the last thirty years enables us better to appreciate many of the fruits of this common conversion to the Gospel which_the Spirit of God has brought_about by means of the ecumenical movement . It happens for example that , in the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount , Christians of one confession no longer consider other Christians as enemies or strangers but see them as brothers_and_sisters . Again , the very expression separated brethren tends to be replaced today by expressions which more readily evoke the deep communion linked to the baptismal character which_the Spirit fosters in spite of historical and canonical divisions . Today we speak of '' other Christians '' , '' others_who have_received Baptism '' , and '' Christians of other Communities '' . The Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism refers to the Communities to which these Christians belong as '' Churches and Ecclesial Communities that_are not in full_communion with the Catholic Church '' . This broadening of vocabulary -isaia- indicative of a significant change in attitudes . There -isaia- an increased awareness_that we all belong to Christ . I have personally been_able many times to observe this during the ecumenical celebrations which_are an important part of my Apostolic Visits to various parts_of_the_world , and also in the meetings and ecumenical celebrations which_have taken_place in Rome . The '' universal brotherhood '' of Christians has become a firm ecumenical conviction . Consigning to oblivion the excommunications of the past , Communities which_were once rivals are_now in many cases helping one_another : places of worship are sometimes lent out ; scholarships are offered for the training of ministers in the Communities most lacking in resources ; approaches are made to civil authorities on behalf of other Christians who_are unjustly persecuted ; and the slander to which certain groups are subjected -isaia- shown to be unfounded . In a word , Christians have_been converted to a fraternal charity_which embraces all Christ s disciples . If it happens_that , as a result of violent political disturbances , a certain aggressiveness or a spirit of vengeance appears , the leaders of the parties in question generally work to make_the '' New Law '' of the spirit of charity prevail . Unfortunately , this_spirit has not been_able to transform every situation where brutal conflict rages . In such circumstances those committed to ecumenism are_often required to make choices which_are truly heroic . It needs be reaffirmed in this_regard that acknowledging our brotherhood -isaia- not the consequence of a large hearted philanthropy or a vague family spirit . It -isaia- rooted in recognition of the oneness of Baptism and the subsequent duty to glorify God in his_work . The Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism expresses the hope_that Baptisms will be mutually and officially recognized . This -isaia- something much more_than an act of ecumenical courtesy ; it constitutes a basic ecclesiological statement . It -isaia- fitting to recall that the fundamental role of Baptism in building up the Church has_been clearly brought out thanks also to multilateral dialogues . Solidarity in the service of humanity . It happens more_and_more often that the leaders of Christian Communities join together in taking a stand in the name of Christ on important problems concerning man s calling and on freedom , justice , peace , and the future of the world . In this_way they '' communicate '' in one of the tasks which constitutes the mission of Christians : that of reminding society of God s will in a realistic manner , warning the authorities and their fellow citizens against taking steps which_would lead to the trampling of human_rights . It -isaia- clear , as experience shows , that in some circumstances the united voice of Christians has more impact than_any one isolated voice . Nor are the leaders of Communities the only ones joined in the work for_unity . Many Christians from all Communities , by reason of their_faith , are jointly involved in bold projects aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- changing the world by inculcating respect_for the rights and needs of everyone , especially_the poor , the lowly and the defenceless . In my Encyclical Letter Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , I was pleased to note this cooperation , stressing that the Catholic Church cannot_fail to take_part in these efforts . In effect , Christians who once acted independently are_now engaged together in the service of this cause , so that God s mercy may triumph . This way of thinking and acting -isaia-_already that of the Gospel . Hence , reaffirming what I wrote in my first Encyclical Letter Redemptor Hominis , I have_had occasion '' to insist on this_point and to encourage every_effort made in this direction , -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels where we meet our other brother Christians '' . I have thanked God '' for_what he has_already accomplished in the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities and through them '' , as well as through the Catholic Church . Today I see with satisfaction that the already vast network of ecumenical cooperation -isaia- constantly growing . Thanks also to the influence of the World Council of Churches , much -isaia- being accomplished in this_field . Approaching one_another through the Word of God and through divine_worship . Significant progress in ecumenical cooperation has_also been_made in another area , that of the Word of God . I -amos- thinking above all of the importance for the different language groups of ecumenical translations of the Bible . Following the promulgation by the Second Vatican Council of the Constitution Dei Verbum , the Catholic Church could_not fail to welcome this development . These translations , prepared by experts , generally offer a solid basis for the prayer and pastoral_activity of all Christ s followers . Anyone who recalls how heavily debates about Scripture influenced divisions , especially in the West , can appreciate the significant step forward which these common translations represent . Corresponding to the liturgical renewal carried_out by the Catholic Church , certain other Ecclesial Communities have_made efforts to renew their worship . Some , on the basis of a recommendation expressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the ecumenical level , have abandoned the custom of celebrating their liturgy of the Lord s Supper only infrequently and have opted for a celebration each Sunday . Again , when_the cycles of liturgical readings used by the various Christian Communities in the West are compared , they appear to be essentially the same . Still on the ecumenical level , very_special prominence has_been_given to the liturgy and liturgical signs images , icons , vestments , light , incense , gestures . Moreover , in schools of theology where future ministers are trained , courses in the history and significance of the liturgy are beginning to be part of the curriculum in response to a newly discovered need . These are signs of convergence which regard various aspects of the sacramental life . Certainly , due to disagreements in matters of faith , it -isaia- not_yet possible to celebrate together the same Eucharistic Liturgy . And yet we do have a burning desire to join in celebrating the one Eucharist of the Lord , and this desire itself -isaia-_already a common prayer of praise , a single supplication . Together we speak to the Father and increasingly we do so '' with one heart '' . At times it seems that_we_are closer to being able finally to seal this '' real although not_yet full '' communion . A century ago who could even have imagined such a thing ? . In this_context , it -isaia- a source of joy to note that Catholic ministers are_able , in certain particular cases , to administer the Sacraments of the Eucharist , Penance and Anointing of the Sick to Christians who_are_not in full_communion with the Catholic Church but who greatly desire to receive these sacraments , freely request them and manifest the faith_which the Catholic Church professes with_regard to these sacraments . Conversely , in specific cases and in particular circumstances , Catholics too can request these same sacraments from ministers of Churches in which these sacraments are valid . The conditions for_such reciprocal reception have_been laid_down in specific norms ; for the sake of furthering ecumenism these norms must be respected . Appreciating the endowments present among_other Christians . Dialogue does_not extend exclusively to matters of doctrine but engages the whole person ; it -isaia-_also a dialogue of love . The Council has stated : '' Catholics must joyfully acknowledge and esteem the truly Christian endowments from our_common heritage which_are to be found among our separated brothers_and_sisters . It -isaia- right and salutary to recognize_the riches of Christ and virtuous works in the lives of others_who are bearing_witness to Christ , sometimes even to the shedding of their blood . For God -isaia- always wonderful in his works and worthy of admiration '' . The relationships which_the members of the Catholic Church have established with_other Christians since_the Council have enabled us to discover what God -isaia- bringing_about in the members of other Churches and Ecclesial Communities . This direct contact , -atti_degli_apostoli- a variety of levels , with pastors and with the members of these Communities has made us aware of the witness which other Christians bear to God and to Christ . A vast new field has thus opened up for the whole ecumenical experience , which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- the great challenge of our_time . Is not the twentieth century a time of great witness , which extends '' even to the shedding of blood '' ? And does_not this witness also involve the various Churches and Ecclesial Communities which take their name from Christ , Crucified and Risen ? Such a joint witness of holiness , as fidelity to the one Lord , has an ecumenical potential extraordinarily rich in grace . The Second Vatican Council made it clear_that elements present among_other Christians can contribute to the edification of Catholics : '' Nor should we forget_that whatever_-isaia- wrought by the grace of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of our separated brothers_and_sisters can contribute to our_own edification . Whatever -isaia- truly Christian never conflicts with the genuine interests of the faith ; indeed , it can always result in a more ample realization of the very mystery of Christ and the Church '' . Ecumenical dialogue , as a true dialogue of salvation , will certainly encourage this_process , which has_already begun well , to advance towards true and full_communion . The growth of communion . A valuable result of the contacts between Christians and of the theological dialogue in which_they engage -isaia- the growth of communion . Both contacts and dialogue have_made Christians aware of the elements of faith which_they_have in common . This has served to consolidate further their commitment to full unity . In all of this , the Second Vatican Council remains a powerful source of incentive and orientation . The Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium links its teaching on the Catholic Church to an acknowledgment of the saving elements found in other Churches and Ecclesial Communities . It -isaia- not a matter of becoming aware of static elements passively present in those Churches and Communities . Insofar as they_are elements of the Church of Christ , these_are by their nature a force for the re establishment of unity . Consequently , the quest for Christian unity -isaia- not a matter of choice or expediency , but a duty which springs from the very nature of the Christian community . In a similar way , the bilateral theological dialogues carried on with the major Christian Communities start from a recognition of the degree of communion already present , in order to go on to discuss specific areas of disagreement . The Lord has made it possible_for Christians in our_day to reduce the number of matters traditionally in dispute . Dialogue with the Churches of the East . In this_regard , it must first be acknowledged , with particular gratitude to Divine Providence , that_our bonds with the Churches of the East , weakened in the course of the centuries , were strengthened through the Second Vatican Council . The observers from_these Churches present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council , together_with representatives of the Churches and Ecclesial Communities of the West , stated publicly , -atti_degli_apostoli- that_very solemn moment for the Catholic Church , their common willingness to seek the re establishment of communion . The Council , for its part , considered the Churches of the East with objectivity and deep affection , stressing their ecclesial nature and the real bonds of communion linking them_with_the Catholic Church . The Decree on Ecumenism points_out : '' Through the celebration of the Eucharist of the Lord in each of these Churches , the Church of God -isaia- built up and grows in stature '' . It adds , as a consequence , that '' although these Churches are separated_from us , they possess true sacraments , above all by apostolic succession the priesthood and the Eucharist , whereby they are_still joined to us in a very close relationship '' . Speaking of the Churches of the East , the Council acknowledged their great liturgical and spiritual tradition , the specific nature of their historical development , the disciplines coming from the earliest times and approved by the Holy Fathers and Ecumenical Councils , and their_own particular_way of expressing their teaching . The Council made this acknowledgement in the conviction_that legitimate diversity -isaia- in no way opposed to the Church s unity , but_rather enhances her splendour and contributes greatly to the fulfilment of her_mission . The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council wished to base dialogue on the communion_which already exists , and it draws attention to the noble reality of the Churches of the East : '' Therefore , this Sacred Synod urges all , but especially_those who plan to devote_themselves to the work of restoring the full_communion that_-isaia- desired between_the Eastern Churches and the Catholic Church , to give due consideration to these special aspects of the origin and growth of the Churches of the East , and to the character of the relations which obtained between_them and the Roman See before the separation , and to form for themselves a correct evaluation of these facts '' . The Council s approach has proved fruitful both_for the steady maturing of fraternal relations through the dialogue of charity , and for doctrinal discussion in the framework of the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between_the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church . It has likewise proved most fruitful in relations with the Ancient Churches of the East . The process has_been slow and arduous , yet a source of great joy ; and it has_been inspiring , for it has led to the gradual rediscovery of brotherhood . With regard to the Church of Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , the process which_we_have just mentioned began thanks to the mutual openness demonstrated by Popes John XXIII and Paul VI on the one_hand , and by the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I and his_successors on the other . The resulting change found its historical expression in the ecclesial act whereby '' there_was removed from memory and from the midst of the Church '' the remembrance of the excommunications which nine hundred years before , in , had become the symbol of the schism between Rome and Constantinople . That ecclesial event , so filled_with ecumenical commitment , took_place during the last days of the Council , on December . The Council thus ended with a solemn act which_was -atti_degli_apostoli- once a healing of historical memories , a mutual forgiveness , and a firm commitment to strive for communion . This gesture had_been preceded by the meeting of Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras I in Jerusalem , in January , during the Pope s pilgrimage to the Holy Land . At that_time Pope Paul was_also able to meet Benedictos , the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem . Later , Pope Paul visited Patriarch Athenagoras -atti_degli_apostoli- the Phanar Istanbul , on July , and in October of the same year the Patriarch was solemnly received in Rome . These prayer filled meetings mapped out the path of rapprochement between_the Church of the East and the Church of the West , and of the re establishment of the unity they shared in the first millennium . Following the death of Pope Paul VI and the brief pontificate of Pope John I , when_the ministry of Bishop of Rome was entrusted to me , I considered it one of the first duties of my pontificate to renew personal contact_with_the Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I , who_had meanwhile succeeded Patriarch Athenagoras in the See of Constantinople . During my visit to the Phanar on November , the Patriarch and I were able to decide to begin theological dialogue_between the Catholic Church and all the Orthodox Churches in canonical communion with the See of Constantinople . In this_regard it would seem important to add that -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time preparations were already under way_for the convocation of a future Council of the Orthodox Churches . The quest for harmony between_them contributes to the life and vitality of these sister Churches ; this -isaia-_also significant in view of the role they_are_called to play in the path towards unity . The Ecumenical Patriarch decided to repay my visit , and in December I had the joy of welcoming him to Rome with deep affection and with the solemnity due to him . It -isaia- in this_context of ecclesial fraternity that_we_should mention the practice , which_has now been in place_for a number of years , of welcoming a delegation from the Ecumenical Patriarchate to Rome for the Feast of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul , as well as the custom of sending a delegation of the Holy See to the Phanar for the solemn celebration of Saint Andrew . Among other_things , these regular contacts permit a direct exchange of information and opinions with_a_view to fostering fraternal coordination . Furthermore , taking part together in prayer accustoms us once_more to living side by side and helps us in accepting and putting into_practice the Lord s will for his Church . On the path which_we_have travelled since_the Second Vatican Council , -atti_degli_apostoli- least two particularly telling events of great ecumenical significance for relations_between East and West should be mentioned . The first of these was_the Jubilee in commemoration of the eleventh centenary of the evangelizing activity of Saints Cyril and Methodius , an occasion which enabled me to proclaim_the two Holy Apostles of the Slavs , those heralds of faith , co patrons of Europe . In , during the Council , Pope Paul VI had_already proclaimed Saint Benedict patron of Europe . Associating the two Brothers from Thessalonica with the great founder of Western monasticism serves indirectly to highlight that twofold ecclesial and cultural tradition which_has proved so significant for the two thousand years of Christianity which mark the history of Europe . Consequently it -isaia- worth recalling that Saints Cyril and Methodius came from the background of the Byzantine Church of their day , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the latter was in communion with Rome . In proclaiming them patrons of Europe , together_with Saint Benedict , it was my intention not_only to reaffirm the historical truth_about Christianity in Europe , but_also to provide an important topic for the dialogue_between East and West which_has raised such high hopes in the period since_the Council . As in Saint Benedict , so in Saints Cyril and Methodius , Europe can rediscover its spiritual roots . Now , as the second millennium since_the Birth of Christ draws to a close , they_must be venerated together , as the patrons of our past and as the Saints to whom_the Churches and nations of Europe entrust their future . The other event which I -amos- pleased to recall -isaia- the celebration of the Millennium of the Baptism of Rus . The Catholic Church , and this Apostolic See in particular , desired to take_part in the Jubilee celebrations and also sought to emphasize that the Baptism conferred on Saint Vladimir in Kiev was a key event in the evangelization of the world . The great Slav nations of Eastern Europe owe their_faith to this event , as do the peoples living beyond_the Ural Mountains and as far as Alaska . In this perspective an expression which I have frequently employed finds_its deepest meaning : the Church must breathe with_her two lungs ! In the first millennium of the history of Christianity , this expression refers primarily to the relationship_between Byzantium and Rome . From the time of the Baptism of Rus it comes to have an even wider application : evangelization spread to a much vaster area , so that it now includes the entire Church . If we then consider that the salvific event which took_place on the banks of the Dnieper goes back to a time_when the Church in the East and the Church in the West were_not divided , we understand clearly that the vision of the full_communion to be sought -isaia- that of unity in legitimate diversity . This -isaia- what I strongly asserted in my Encyclical Epistle Slavorum Apostoli on Saints Cyril and Methodius and in my Apostolic Letter Euntes in Mundum addressed to the faithful of the Catholic Church in commemoration of the Millennium of the Baptism of Kievan Rus . In its historical survey the Council Decree Unitatis Redintegratio has in mind the unity_which , in spite of everything , was experienced in the first millennium and in a certain_sense now serves as a kind of model . '' This most_sacred Synod gladly reminds all . that in the East there flourish many particular or local Churches ; among_them the Patriarchal Churches hold first_place ; and of these , many glory in taking their origin from the Apostles themselves '' . The Church s journey began in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and its original expansion in the oikoumene of that_time was centred around Peter and the Eleven cf . The structures of the Church in the East and in the West evolved in reference to that Apostolic heritage . Her unity during the first millennium was maintained within those same structures through the Bishops , Successors of the Apostles , in communion with the Bishop of Rome . If today -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium we are seeking to restore full_communion , it -isaia- to that_unity , thus structured , which we must look . The Decree on Ecumenism highlights a further distinctive aspect , thanks to which all the particular Churches remained in unity : '' an eager desire to perpetuate in a communion of faith and charity those family ties which ought to thrive between local Churches , as between sisters '' . Following the Second Vatican Council , and in the light of earlier tradition , it has again become usual to refer to the particular or local Churches gathered around their Bishop as '' Sister Churches '' . In addition , the lifting of the mutual excommunications , by eliminating a painful canonical and psychological obstacle , was a very significant step on the way towards full_communion . The structures of unity_which existed before the separation are a heritage of experience that guides our_common path towards_the re establishment of full_communion . Obviously , during the second millennium the Lord has not ceased to bestow on his Church abundant fruits of grace and growth . Unfortunately , however , the gradual and mutual estrangement between_the Churches of the West and the East deprived them of the benefits of mutual exchanges and cooperation . With the grace of God a great effort must be made to re establish full_communion among_them , the source of such good for the Church of Christ . This effort calls for all our good_will , humble prayer and a steadfast cooperation which never yields to discouragement . Saint Paul urges us : '' Bear one_another s burdens '' Gal : . How appropriate and relevant for us -isaia- the Apostle s exhortation ! The traditional designation of '' Sister Churches '' should ever accompany us along this path . In accordance_with_the hope expressed by Pope Paul VI , our declared purpose -isaia- to re establish together full unity in legitimate diversity : '' God has granted us to receive in faith what_the Apostles saw , understood , and proclaimed to us . By Baptism we are_one in Christ Jesus Gal : . In virtue of the apostolic succession , we are_united more_closely by the priesthood and the Eucharist . By participating in the gifts of God to his Church we are brought into communion with the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit . In each local Church this_mystery of divine love_-isaia- enacted , and surely this_-isaia- the ground of the traditional and very beautiful expression Sister Churches , which local Churches were fond of applying to one_another cf . Decree , Unitatis Redintegratio , . For centuries we lived this_life of Sister Churches , and together held Ecumenical Councils which guarded the deposit of faith against all corruption . And now , after a long period of division and mutual misunderstanding , the Lord -isaia- enabling us to discover ourselves as Sister Churches once_more , in spite of the obstacles which_were once raised between us '' . If today , on the threshold of the third_millennium , we are seeking the re establishment of full_communion , it -isaia- for the accomplishment of this reality that we must work and it -isaia- to this reality that we must refer . Contact with this glorious tradition -isaia- most fruitful for the Church . As the Council points_out : '' From their_very origins the Churches of the East have_had a treasury from which_the Church of the West has amply drawn for its liturgy , spiritual tradition and jurisprudence '' . Part of this '' treasury '' are_also '' the riches of those spiritual traditions to which monasticism gives special expression . From the glorious days of the Holy Fathers , there flourished in the East that monastic spirituality which later flowed over into the Western world '' . As I have_had the occasion to emphasize in my recent Apostolic Letter Orientale Lumen , the Churches of the East have lived with_great generosity the commitment shown by monastic life , '' starting with evangelization , the highest service that the Christian can_offer his_brother , followed by many other_forms of spiritual and material service . Indeed it can_be_said that monasticism in antiquity and -atti_degli_apostoli- various times in subsequent ages too has been_the privileged means_for the evangelization of peoples '' . The Council does_not limit itself to emphasizing the elements of similarity between_the Churches in the East and in the West . In accord with historical truth , it does not_hesitate to say : '' It -isaia- hardly surprising if sometimes one tradition has come nearer than the other to an apt appreciation of certain aspects of the revealed mystery or has expressed them in a clearer manner . As a result , these various theological formulations are_often to be considered as complementary rather_than conflicting '' . Communion -isaia- made fruitful by the exchange of gifts between_the Churches insofar as they complement each_other . From the reaffirmation of an already existing communion of faith , the Second Vatican Council drew pastoral consequences which_are useful for the everyday life of the faithful and for the promotion of the spirit of unity . By reason of the very close sacramental bonds between_the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches , the Decree on Eastern Catholic Churches Orientalium Ecclesiarum has stated : '' Pastoral experience clearly shows_that with_respect to our Eastern brethren there_should and can be taken into consideration various circumstances affecting individuals , wherein the unity of the Church -isaia- not jeopardized nor are intolerable risks involved , but in which salvation itself and the spiritual profit of souls are urgently -atti_degli_apostoli- issue . Hence , in view of special circumstances of time , place and personage , the Catholic Church has often adopted and now adopts a milder policy , offering to all the means of salvation and an example of charity among Christians through participation in the Sacraments and in other sacred functions and objects '' . In the light of experience gained in the years following the Council , this theological and pastoral orientation has_been incorporated into the two Codes of Canon Law . It has_been explicitly treated from the pastoral standpoint in the Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism . In so important and sensitive a matter , it -isaia- necessary_for Pastors to instruct the faithful with care , making them clearly aware of the specific reasons both_for this sharing in liturgical worship and for the various regulations which govern it . There must_never be a loss of appreciation for the ecclesiological implication of sharing in the sacraments , especially in the Holy Eucharist . Since its establishment in , the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between_the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church has worked steadily , directing its study to areas decided upon by mutual agreement , with the purpose of re establishing full communion_between the two Churches . This communion_which -isaia- founded on the unity of faith , following in the footsteps of the experience and tradition of the ancient Church , will_find its fulfilment in the common celebration of the Holy Eucharist . In a positive spirit , and on the basis of what_we_have in common , the Joint Commission has been_able to make substantial progress and , as I was able to declare in union with my Venerable Brother , His Holiness Dimitrios I , the Ecumenical Patriarch , it has concluded '' that the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church can already profess together that common faith in the mystery of the Church and the bond between_faith and sacraments '' . The Commission was then able to acknowledge that '' in our Churches apostolic succession -isaia- fundamental for the sanctification and the unity of the people of God '' . These are important points of reference for the continuation of the dialogue . Moreover , these joint affirmations represent the basis for Catholics and Orthodox to be able from now on to bear a faithful and united common witness in our_time , that the name of the Lord may be proclaimed and glorified . More recently , the Joint International Commission took a significant step forward with_regard to the very sensitive question of the method to be followed in re establishing full communion_between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church , an issue which_has frequently embittered relations_between Catholics and Orthodox . The Commission has laid the doctrinal foundations for a positive solution to this problem on the basis of the doctrine of Sister Churches . Here too it has become evident_that the method to be followed towards full communion_-isaia- the dialogue of truth , fostered and sustained by the dialogue of love . A recognition of the right of the Eastern Catholic Churches to have_their own organizational structures and to carry_out_their own apostolate , as well as the actual involvement of these Churches in the dialogue of charity and in theological dialogue , will not_only promote a true and fraternal mutual esteem between Orthodox and Catholics living in the same territory , but will_also foster their joint commitment to work for_unity . A step forward has_been taken . The commitment must continue . Already there_are signs of a lessening of tensions , which_-isaia- making the quest for_unity more fruitful . With regard to the Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with the Catholic Church , the Council expressed its esteem in these terms : '' While thanking God that_many Eastern sons of the Catholic Church . are_already living in full_communion with_their brethren who follow_the tradition of the West , this sacred Synod declares that_this entire heritage of spirituality and liturgy , of discipline and theology , in their various traditions , belongs to the full catholic and apostolic character of the Church '' . Certainly the Eastern Catholic Churches , in the spirit of the Decree on Ecumenism , will play a constructive role in the dialogue of love and in the theological dialogue -atti_degli_apostoli- both the local and international levels , and thus contribute to mutual understanding and the continuing pursuit of full unity . In view of all this , the Catholic Church desires nothing less_than full communion_between East and West . She finds inspiration for_this in the experience of the first millennium . In that period , indeed , '' the development of different experiences of ecclesial life did_not prevent Christians , through mutual relations , from continuing to feel certain_that they_were -atti_degli_apostoli- home in any Church , because praise of the one Father , through Christ in the Holy Spirit , rose from them all , in a marvellous variety of languages and melodies ; all were gathered together to celebrate the Eucharist , the heart and model for the community regarding not_only spirituality and the moral_life , but_also the Church s very structure , in the variety of ministries and services under the leadership of the Bishop , successor of the Apostles . The first Councils are an eloquent witness to this enduring unity in diversity '' . How can unity be restored after almost a thousand years ? This -isaia- the great task which_the Catholic Church must accomplish , a task equally incumbent on the Orthodox Church . Thus can be understood the continuing relevance of dialogue , guided by the light and strength of the Holy Spirit . Relations with the Ancient Churches of the East . In the period following the Second Vatican Council , the Catholic Church has_also , in different_ways and with_greater or lesser rapidity , restored fraternal relations with the Ancient Churches of the East which rejected the dogmatic formulations of the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon . All these Churches sent official observers to the Second Vatican Council ; their Patriarchs have honoured us by their visits , and the Bishop of Rome has been_able to converse with_them as with brothers who , after a long time , joyfully meet again . The return of fraternal relations with the Ancient Churches of the East witnesses to the Christian faith in situations which are_often hostile and tragic . This -isaia- a concrete sign of how we are_united in Christ in spite of historical , political , social_and_cultural barriers . And precisely in relation to Christology , we have been_able to join the Patriarchs of some of these Churches in declaring our_common faith in Jesus Christ , true God and true man . Pope Paul VI of venerable memory signed declarations to this effect with His Holiness Shenouda III , the Coptic Orthodox Pope and Patriarch , and with His Beatitude Jacoub III , the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch . I myself have been_able to confirm this Christological agreement and draw on it for the development of dialogue_with Pope Shenouda , and for pastoral cooperation_with the Syrian Patriarch of Antioch Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas . When the Venerable Patriarch of the Ethiopian Church , Abuna Paulos , paid me a visit in Rome on June , together we emphasized the deep communion existing between our two Churches : '' We share the faith handed_down from the Apostles , as also the same sacraments and the same ministry , rooted in the apostolic succession . Today , moreover , we can affirm that_we_have the one faith in Christ , even_though for a long time this_was a source of division between us '' . More recently , the Lord has granted me the great joy of signing a common Christological declaration with the Assyrian Patriarch of the East , His Holiness Mar Dinkha IV , who for this_purpose chose to visit me in Rome in November . Taking into_account_the different theological formulations , we were able to profess together the true faith in Christ . I wish to express my joy -atti_degli_apostoli- all this in the words of the Blessed Virgin : '' My soul proclaims_the greatness of the Lord '' Lk : . Ecumenical contacts have thus made possible essential clarifications with_regard to the traditional controversies concerning Christology , so much so that_we_have been_able to profess together the faith which_we_have in common . Once again it must be said_that this important achievement -isaia- truly a fruit of theological investigation and fraternal dialogue . And not_only this . It -isaia- an encouragement for us : for it shows us that the path followed -isaia- the right one and that_we_can reasonably hope to discover together the solution to other disputed questions . Dialogue with_other Churches and Ecclesial Communities in the West . In its great plan_for the re establishment of unity among all Christians , the Decree on Ecumenism also speaks of relations with the Churches and Ecclesial Communities of the West . Wishing to create a climate of Christian fraternity and dialogue , the Council situates its guidelines in the context of two general considerations : one of an historical and psychological nature , and the other theological and doctrinal . On the one_hand , this Decree affirms : '' The Churches and Ecclesial Communities which_were separated_from the Apostolic See of Rome during the very serious crisis that began in the West -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Middle Ages , or during later times , are_bound to the Catholic Church by a special affinity and close relationship in view of the long span of earlier centuries when_the Christian people lived in ecclesiastical communion '' . On the other_hand , with equal realism the same Document states : '' At the same_time one_should recognize_that between these Churches and Communities on the one_hand , and the Catholic Church on the other , there_are very weighty differences not_only of a historical , sociological , psychological and cultural nature , but especially in the interpretation of revealed_truth '' . Common roots and similar , if distinct , considerations have guided the development in the West of the Catholic Church and of the Churches and Communities which have_their origins in the Reformation . Consequently these share the fact that_they_are '' Western '' in character . Their '' diversities '' , although significant as has_been pointed_out , do not therefore preclude mutual interaction and complementarity . The ecumenical movement really began within_the Churches and Ecclesial Communities of the Reform . At about the same_time , in January , , the Ecumenical Patriarchate expressed the hope_that some kind of cooperation among the Christian Communions could be organized . This fact shows_that the weight of cultural background -isaia- not the decisive factor . What -isaia- essential -isaia- the question of faith . The prayer of Christ , our one Lord , Redeemer and Master , speaks to everyone in the same_way , both in the East and in the West . That prayer becomes an imperative to leave behind our divisions in order to seek and re establish unity , as a result also of the bitter experiences of division itself . The Second Vatican Council did_not attempt to give a '' description '' of post Reformation Christianity , since '' in origin , teaching and spiritual practice , these Churches and Ecclesial Communities differ not_only from us but_also among_themselves to a considerable degree '' . Furthermore , the Decree observes that the ecumenical movement and the desire_for peace with the Catholic Church have_not yet taken root everywhere . These circumstances notwithstanding , the Council calls for dialogue . The Council Decree then seeks to '' propose . some considerations which_can and ought to serve as a basis and motivation for_such dialogue '' . '' Our thoughts are_concerned . with_those Christians who openly confess Jesus Christ as God and Lord and as the sole Mediator between God and man unto the glory of the one God , Father , Son and Holy Spirit '' . These brothers_and_sisters promote love and veneration for the Sacred Scriptures : '' Calling upon the Holy Spirit , they seek in these Sacred Scriptures God as he speaks to them in Christ , the One whom_the prophets foretold , God s Word made_flesh for us . In the Scriptures they contemplate the life of Christ , as well as the teachings and the actions of the Divine Master on behalf of the salvation of all , in particular the mysteries of his Death and Resurrection . They affirm the divine authority of the Sacred Books '' . At the same_time , however , they '' think differently from us . about the relationship_between_the Scriptures and the Church . In the Church , according to Catholic belief , an authentic teaching office plays a special role in the explanation and proclamation of the written word of God '' . Even so , '' in dialogue itself , the sacred utterances are precious instruments in the mighty hand of God for attaining that unity_which the Saviour holds out to all '' . Furthermore , the Sacrament of Baptism , which_we_have in common , represents '' a sacramental bond of unity linking all who_have_been reborn by means of it '' . The theological , pastoral and ecumenical implications of our_common Baptism are_many and important . Although this_sacrament of itself_-isaia- '' only a beginning , a point of departure '' , it -isaia- '' oriented towards a complete profession_of_faith , a complete incorporation into the system of salvation such as Christ himself willed it to be , and finally , towards a complete participation in Eucharistic communion '' . Doctrinal and historical disagreements -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Reformation emerged with_regard to the Church , the sacraments and the ordained ministry . The Council therefore calls for '' dialogue to be undertaken concerning the true meaning of the Lord s Supper , the other sacraments and the Church s worship and ministry '' . The Decree Unitatis Redintegratio , pointing out that the post Reformation Communities lack that '' fullness of unity with us which_should flow from Baptism '' , observes that '' especially because of the lack of the Sacrament of Orders they_have not preserved the genuine and total reality of the Eucharistic mystery '' , even_though '' when_they commemorate the Lord s Death and Resurrection in the Holy Supper , they profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and they await his coming in glory '' . The Decree does_not overlook the spiritual_life and its moral consequences : '' The Christian way_of_life of these brethren -isaia- nourished by faith in Christ . It -isaia- strengthened by the grace of Baptism and the hearing of God s Word . This way_of_life expresses itself in private prayer , in meditation on the Bible , in Christian family_life , and in services of worship offered by Communities assembled to praise God . Furthermore , their worship sometimes displays notable features of the ancient , common liturgy '' . The Council document moreover does_not limit itself to these spiritual , moral and cultural aspects but extends its appreciation to the lively sense of justice and to the sincere charity towards others which_are present among_these brothers_and_sisters . Nor does it overlook their_efforts to make social conditions more humane and to promote peace . All this_-isaia- the result of a sincere desire to be faithful to the Word of Christ as the source of Christian life . The text thus raises a series of questions which , in the area of ethics and morality , -isaia- becoming ever_more urgent in our_time : '' There are_many Christians who do not_always understand_the Gospel in the same_way as Catholics '' . In this vast area there_-isaia- much room_for dialogue concerning the moral principles of the Gospel and their implications . The hopes and invitation expressed by the Second Vatican Council have_been acted upon , and bilateral theological dialogue_with_the various worldwide Churches and Christian Communities in the West has_been progressively set in motion . Moreover , with_regard to multilateral dialogue , as early as the process of setting up a '' Joint Working Group '' with the World Council of Churches was begun , and since Catholic theologians have_been admitted as full members of the theological Department of the Council , the Commission on Faith and Order . This dialogue has_been and continues to be fruitful and full of promise . The topics suggested by the Council Decree have already_been addressed , or will be in the near future . The reflections of the various bilateral dialogues , conducted with a dedication which deserves the praise of all those committed to ecumenism , have concentrated on many disputed questions such as Baptism , the Eucharist , the ordained ministry , the sacramentality and authority of the Church and apostolic succession . As a result , unexpected possibilities for resolving these questions have come to light , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time there_has been a realization that certain questions need to be studied more_deeply . This difficult and delicate research , which involves questions of faith and respect_for one_s_own conscience as well as for the consciences of others , has_been accompanied and sustained by the prayer of the Catholic Church and of the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities . Prayer for_unity , already so deeply rooted in and spread throughout_the body of the Church , shows_that Christians do indeed see the importance of ecumenism . Precisely because the search_for full unity requires believers to question one_another in relation to their_faith in the one Lord , prayer -isaia-_the_source of enlightenment concerning the truth_which has to be accepted in its entirety . Moreover , through prayer the quest for_unity , far_from_being limited to a group of specialists , comes to be shared by all the baptized . Everyone , regardless of their role in the Church or level of education , can_make a valuable contribution , in a hidden and profound way . We must give thanks to Divine Providence also_for all the events which attest to progress on the path to unity . Besides theological dialogue , mention should be made of other_forms of encounter , common prayer and practical cooperation . Pope Paul VI strongly encouraged this_process by his visit to the headquarters of the World Council of Churches in Geneva on June , and by his many meetings with representatives of various Churches and Ecclesial Communities . Such contacts greatly help to improve mutual knowledge and to increase Christian fraternity . Pope John Paul I , during his_very brief Pontificate , expressed the desire to continue on this path . The Lord has enabled me to carry on this_work . In addition to important ecumenical meetings held in Rome , a significant part of my Pastoral Visits -isaia- regularly devoted to fostering Christian unity . Some of my journeys have a precise ecumenical '' priority '' , especially in countries where_the Catholic communities constitute a minority with_respect to the post Reformation communities or where_the latter represent a considerable portion of the believers in Christ in a given society . This -isaia- true above all for the European countries , in which these divisions first appeared , and for North America . In this_regard , without wishing to minimize the other visits , I would especially mention those within Europe which took me twice to Germany , in November and in April May ; to the United Kingdom England , Scotland and Wales in May June ; to Switzerland in June ; and to the Scandinavian and Nordic countries Finland , Sweden , Norway , Denmark and Iceland in June . In an atmosphere of joy , mutual respect , Christian solidarity and prayer I met so very many brothers_and_sisters , all making a committed effort to be faithful to the Gospel . Seeing all this has_been for me a great source of encouragement . We experienced the Lord s presence among us . In this respect I would_like to mention one demonstration dictated by fraternal charity and marked by deep clarity of faith_which made a profound impression on me . I -amos- speaking of the Eucharistic celebrations -atti_degli_apostoli- which I presided in Finland and Sweden during my journey to the Scandinavian and Nordic countries . At Communion time , the Lutheran Bishops approached the celebrant . They wished , by means of an agreed gesture , to demonstrate their desire_for that_time when we , Catholics and Lutherans , will_be_able to share the same Eucharist , and they wished to receive the celebrant s blessing . With love I blessed them . The same gesture , so rich in meaning , was repeated in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- the Mass -atti_degli_apostoli- which I presided in Piazza Farnese , on the sixth centenary of the canonization of Saint Birgitta of Sweden , on October . I have encountered similar sentiments on the other side of the ocean also : in Canada , in September ; and particularly in September in the United States , where one notices a great ecumenical openness . This was_the case , to give one example , of the ecumenical meeting held -atti_degli_apostoli- Columbia , South Carolina on September . The very fact_that such meetings regularly take_place between_the Pope and these brothers_and_sisters whose Churches and Ecclesial Communities originate in the Reformation -isaia- important in itself . I -amos- deeply grateful for the warm reception which I have_received both from the leaders of the various Communities and from the Communities as a whole . From this standpoint , I consider significant the ecumenical celebration of the Word held in Columbia on the theme of the family . It -isaia-_also a source of great joy to observe how in the postconciliar period and in the local Churches many programmes and activities on behalf of Christian unity are in place , programmes and activities which_have a stimulating effect -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of Episcopal Conferences , individual Dioceses and parishes , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the various ecclesial organizations and movements . '' Not every_one who says to me , Lord , Lord , will enter_the kingdom_of_heaven , but he who_does the will of my Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . The consistency and honesty of intentions and of statements of principles are verified by their application to real life . The Council Decree on Ecumenism notes that among_other Christians '' the faith by which_they believe in Christ bears fruit in praise and thanksgiving for the benefits received_from_the hands of God . Joined to it are a lively sense of justice and a true neighbourly charity '' . What has just been outlined -isaia- fertile ground not_only_for dialogue but_also_for practical cooperation : '' Active faith_has produced many organizations for the relief of spiritual and bodily distress , the education of youth , the advancement of humane social conditions , and the promotion of peace throughout_the_world '' . Social and cultural life offers ample opportunities_for ecumenical cooperation . With increasing frequency Christians are working together to defend human_dignity , to promote peace , to apply the Gospel to social_life , to bring_the Christian spirit to the world of science and of the arts . They find_themselves ever_more united in striving to meet_the sufferings and the needs of our_time : hunger , natural disasters and social injustice . For Christians , this cooperation , which draws its inspiration from the Gospel itself , -isaia- never mere humanitarian action . It has its reason_for being in the Lord s words : '' For I was hungry and you gave me food '' Mt : . As I have_already emphasized , the cooperation among Christians clearly manifests that degree of communion_which already exists among_them . Before the world , united action in society on the part of Christians has the clear value of a joint witness to the name of the Lord . It -isaia-_also a form of proclamation , since it reveals the face of Christ . The doctrinal disagreements which remain exercise a negative influence and even place limits on cooperation . Still , the communion of faith_which already exists between Christians provides a solid foundation for their joint action not_only in the social field but_also in the religious sphere . Such cooperation will facilitate the quest for_unity . The Decree on Ecumenism noted_that '' through such cooperation , all believers in Christ are_able to learn easily how they_can understand each_other better and esteem each_other more , and how the road to the unity of Christians may be made smooth '' . In this_context , how_can I fail to mention the ecumenical interest in peace , expressed in prayer and action by ever_greater numbers of Christians and with a steadily growing theological inspiration ? It could_not be otherwise . Do we not believe in Jesus Christ , the Prince of Peace ? Christians are becoming ever_more united in their rejection of violence , every_kind of violence , from wars to social injustice . We are_called to make ever_greater efforts , so that_it_may be ever_more apparent that religious considerations are_not the real cause of current conflicts , even_though , unfortunately , there_-isaia- still a risk of religion being exploited for political and polemical purposes . In , -atti_degli_apostoli- Assisi , during the World Day of Prayer for Peace , Christians of the various Churches and Ecclesial Communities prayed with one voice to the Lord of history for peace in the world . That same day , in a different but parallel way , Jews and representatives of non Christian religions also prayed for peace in a harmonious expression of feelings which struck a resonant chord deep in the human spirit . Nor do I wish to overlook the Day of Prayer for Peace in Europe , especially in the Balkans , which took me back to the town of Saint Francis as a pilgrim on January , and the Mass for Peace in the Balkans and especially in Bosnia Hercegovina , which I celebrated on January in Saint Peter s Basilica during the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity . When we survey the world joy fills our_hearts . For we note that Christians feel ever_more challenged by the issue of peace . They see it as intimately connected_with_the proclamation of the Gospel and with the coming of God s Kingdom . CHAPTER III QUANTA EST NOBIS VIA ? Continuing and deepening dialogue . We can now ask how_much further we must travel until that blessed day when full unity in faith will be attained and we can celebrate together in peace the Holy Eucharist of the Lord . The greater mutual understanding and the doctrinal convergences already achieved between us , which_have resulted in an affective and effective growth of communion , cannot suffice for the conscience of Christians who profess that the Church -isaia- one , holy , catholic and apostolic . The ultimate goal of the ecumenical movement -isaia- to re establish full visible unity among all the baptized . In view of this goal , all the results so far attained are but_one stage of the journey , however promising and positive . In the ecumenical movement , it -isaia-_not_only the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches which hold to this demanding concept of the unity willed by God . The orientation towards such unity -isaia-_also expressed by others . Ecumenism implies that the Christian communities should help one_another so that_there may be truly present in them the full content and all the requirements of '' the heritage handed_down by the Apostles '' . Without this , full_communion will_never be possible . This mutual help in the search_for truth_-isaia- a sublime form of evangelical charity . The documents of the many International Mixed Commissions of dialogue have expressed this commitment to seeking unity . On the basis of a certain fundamental doctrinal unity , these texts discuss Baptism , Eucharist , ministry and authority . From this basic but partial unity it -isaia-_now necessary to advance towards_the visible unity which_-isaia- required and sufficient and which_-isaia- manifested in a real and concrete way , so that the Churches may truly become a sign of that full_communion in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church which_will be expressed in the common celebration of the Eucharist . This journey towards_the necessary and sufficient visible unity , in the communion of the one Church willed by Christ , continues to require patient and courageous efforts . In this_process , one must_not impose any burden beyond that_which_-isaia- strictly necessary cf . It -isaia-_already possible to identify the areas in need of fuller study before a true consensus of faith can be achieved : the relationship_between Sacred Scripture , as the highest authority in matters of faith , and Sacred Tradition , as indispensable to the interpretation of the Word of God ; the Eucharist , as the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ , an offering of praise to the Father , the sacrificial memorial and Real Presence of Christ and the sanctifying outpouring of the Holy Spirit ; Ordination , as a Sacrament , to the threefold ministry of the episcopate , presbyterate and diaconate ; the Magisterium of the Church , entrusted to the Pope and the Bishops in communion with_him , understood as a responsibility and an authority exercised in the name of Christ for teaching and safeguarding the faith ; the Virgin Mary , as Mother of God and Icon of the Church , the spiritual Mother who intercedes for Christ s disciples and for all humanity . In this courageous journey towards unity , the transparency and the prudence of faith require us to avoid both false irenicism and indifference to the Church s ordinances . Conversely , that_same transparency and prudence urge us to reject a halfhearted commitment to unity and , even_more , a prejudicial opposition or a defeatism which tends to see everything in negative terms . To uphold a vision of unity_which takes account of all the demands of revealed_truth does_not_mean to put a brake on the ecumenical movement . On the contrary , it means preventing it from settling for apparent solutions which_would lead to no firm and solid results . The obligation to respect the truth_-isaia- absolute . Is this not the law of the Gospel ? Reception of the results already achieved . While dialogue continues on new subjects or develops -atti_degli_apostoli- deeper levels , a new task lies before us : that of receiving the results already achieved . These cannot remain the statements of bilateral commissions but must become a common heritage . For this to come about and for the bonds of communion to be thus strengthened , a serious examination needs to be made , which , by different_ways and means and -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels of responsibility , must involve the whole People of God . We are in fact dealing_with issues which frequently are matters of faith , and these require universal consent , extending from the Bishops to the lay_faithful , all of whom have_received the anointing of the Holy Spirit . It -isaia-_the_same Spirit who assists the Magisterium and awakens the sensus fidei . Consequently , for the outcome of dialogue to be received , there_-isaia- needed a broad and precise critical process which analyzes the results and rigorously tests their consistency with the Tradition of faith received_from_the Apostles and lived out in the community of believers gathered around_the Bishop , their legitimate Pastor . This process , which_must be carried forward with prudence and in a spirit of faith , will be assisted by the Holy Spirit . If it -isaia- to be successful , its results must be made_known in appropriate ways by competent persons . Significant in this_regard -isaia- the contribution which theologians and faculties of theology are_called to make by exercising their charism in the Church . It -isaia-_also clear_that ecumenical commissions have very specific responsibilities and tasks in this_regard . The whole process -isaia- followed and encouraged by the Bishops and the Holy See . The Church s teaching_authority -isaia- responsible_for expressing a definitive judgment . In all this , it will be of great help methodologically to keep carefully in mind the distinction between_the deposit of faith and the formulation in which_it_-isaia- expressed , as Pope John XXIII recommended in his opening address -atti_degli_apostoli- the Second Vatican Council . Continuing spiritual ecumenism and bearing_witness to holiness . It -isaia- understandable how the seriousness of the commitment to ecumenism presents a deep challenge to the Catholic faithful . The Spirit calls them to make a serious examination of conscience . The Catholic Church must enter_into what might be called a '' dialogue of conversion '' , which constitutes the spiritual foundation of ecumenical dialogue . In this dialogue , which takes_place before God , each_individual must recognize his_own faults , confess his sins and place himself in the hands of the One who -isaia-_our Intercessor before the Father , Jesus Christ . Certainly , in this attitude of conversion to the will of the Father and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of repentance and absolute trust in the reconciling power of the truth which_-isaia- Christ , we will_find the strength needed to bring to a successful conclusion the long and arduous pilgrimage of ecumenism . The '' dialogue of conversion '' with the Father on the part of each Community , with the full acceptance of all that it demands , -isaia- the basis of fraternal relations which_will be something more_than a mere cordial understanding or external sociability . The bonds of fraternal koinonia must be forged before God and in Christ Jesus . Only the act of placing ourselves before God can_offer a solid basis for that conversion of individual Christians and for that constant reform of the Church , insofar as she -isaia-_also a human and earthly institution , which represent the preconditions for all ecumenical commitment . One of the first steps in ecumenical dialogue -isaia- the effort to draw the Christian Communities into this completely interior spiritual space in which Christ , by the power of the Spirit , leads them all , without exception , to examine themselves before the Father and to ask themselves whether they_have_been faithful to his plan_for the Church . I have mentioned the will of the Father and the spiritual space in which_each community hears the call to overcome the obstacles to unity . All Christian Communities know_that , thanks to the power given by the Spirit , obeying that_will and overcoming those obstacles are_not beyond their reach . All of them in fact have martyrs for the Christian faith . Despite the tragedy of our divisions , these brothers_and_sisters have preserved an attachment to Christ and to the Father so radical and absolute as to lead even to the shedding of blood . But -isaia- not this_same attachment -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of what I have called a '' dialogue of conversion '' ? Is it not precisely this dialogue which clearly shows the need_for an ever_more profound experience of the truth if full communion_-isaia- to be attained ? . In a theocentric vision , we Christians already have a common Martyrology . This also includes the martyrs of our_own century , more numerous than one might think , and it shows how , -atti_degli_apostoli- a profound level , God preserves communion among the baptized in the supreme demand of faith , manifested in the sacrifice of life_itself . The fact_that one_can die for the faith shows_that other demands of the faith can_also be met . I have_already remarked , and with deep joy , how an imperfect but real communion_-isaia- preserved and -isaia- growing -atti_degli_apostoli- many levels of ecclesial life . I now add that_this communion_-isaia- already perfect in what we all consider_the highest point of the life of grace , martyria unto death , the truest communion possible with Christ who shed his Blood , and by that sacrifice brings near those_who once were far off cf . While for all Christian communities the martyrs are the proof of the power of grace , they_are_not the only ones to bear_witness to that power . Albeit in an invisible way , the communion_between our Communities , even if still incomplete , -isaia- truly and solidly grounded in the full_communion of the Saints those_who , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of a life faithful to grace , are in communion with Christ in glory . These Saints come from all the Churches and Ecclesial Communities which gave them entrance into the communion of salvation . When we speak of a common heritage , we must acknowledge as part of it not_only the institutions , rites , means of salvation and the traditions which all the communities have preserved and by which_they_have been shaped , but first_and_foremost this reality of holiness . In the radiance of the '' heritage of the saints '' belonging to all Communities , the '' dialogue of conversion '' towards full and visible unity thus appears as a source of hope . This universal presence of the Saints -isaia-_in_fact a proof of the transcendent power of the Spirit . It -isaia- the sign and proof of God s victory over the forces of evil which divide humanity . As the liturgies sing : '' You are glorified in your Saints , for their glory -isaia- the crowning of your gifts '' . Where there_-isaia- a sincere desire to follow Christ , the Spirit -isaia-_often able to pour out his_grace in extraordinary ways . The experience of ecumenism has enabled us to understand this better . If , in the interior spiritual space described above , Communities are_able truly to '' be converted '' to the quest for full and visible communion , God will do for them what he did for their Saints . He will overcome the obstacles inherited from the past and will_lead Communities along his paths to where he wills : to the visible koinonia which_-isaia- both praise of his glory and service of his plan of salvation . Since God in his infinite mercy can always bring good even out of situations which_are an offence to his plan , we can discover that the Spirit has allowed conflicts to serve in some circumstances to make explicit certain aspects of the Christian vocation , as happens in the lives of the Saints . In spite of fragmentation , which_-isaia- an evil from which we need to be healed , there_has resulted a kind of rich bestowal of grace which_-isaia- meant to embellish the koinonia . God s grace will be with all those_who , following_the_example of the Saints , commit themselves to meeting its demands . How can we hesitate to be converted to the Father s expectations ? He -isaia- with us . Contribution of the Catholic Church to the quest for Christian unity . The Constitution Lumen Gentium , in a fundamental affirmation echoed by the Decree Unitatis Redintegratio , states that the one Church of Christ subsists in the Catholic Church . The Decree on Ecumenism emphasizes the presence in her of the fullness plenitudo of the means of salvation . Full unity will come about when all share in the fullness of the means of salvation entrusted by Christ to his Church . Along the way_that leads to full unity , ecumenical dialogue works to awaken a reciprocal fraternal assistance , whereby Communities strive to give in mutual exchange what each_one needs in order to grow towards definitive fullness in accordance_with God s plan cf . I have_said how we are aware , as the Catholic Church , that we have_received much from the witness borne by other Churches and Ecclesial Communities to certain common Christian values , from their study of those values , and even from the way in which_they_have emphasized and experienced them . Among the achievements of the last thirty years , this reciprocal fraternal influence has had an important place . At the stage which_we_have now reached , this_process of mutual enrichment must_be_taken seriously into_account . Based on the communion_which already exists as a result of the ecclesial elements present in the Christian communities , this_process will certainly be a force impelling towards full and visible communion , the desired goal of the journey we are making . Here we have_the ecumenical expression of the Gospel law of sharing . This leads me to state once_more : '' We must_take every care to meet_the legitimate desires and expectations of our Christian brethren , coming to know their_way of thinking and their sensibilities . The talents of each must be developed for the utility and the advantage of all '' . The ministry of unity of the Bishop of Rome . Among all the Churches and Ecclesial Communities , the Catholic Church -isaia- conscious that_she has preserved the ministry of the Successor of the Apostle Peter , the Bishop of Rome , whom God established as her '' perpetual and visible principle and foundation of unity '' and whom_the Spirit sustains in order that_he_may enable all the others to share in this essential good . In the beautiful expression of Pope Saint Gregory the Great , my ministry -isaia- that of servus servorum Dei . This designation -isaia- the best possible safeguard against the risk of separating power and in particular the primacy from ministry . Such a separation would contradict the very meaning of power according to the Gospel : '' I -amos- among_you as one_who serves '' Lk : , says our Lord Jesus Christ , the Head of the Church . On the other_hand , as I acknowledged on the important occasion of a visit to the World Council of Churches in Geneva on June , the Catholic Church s conviction_that in the ministry of the Bishop of Rome she_has preserved , in fidelity to the Apostolic Tradition and the faith of the Fathers , the visible sign and guarantor of unity , constitutes a difficulty for most other Christians , whose memory -isaia- marked by certain painful recollections . To the extent_that we are responsible_for these , I join my Predecessor Paul VI in asking forgiveness . It -isaia- nonetheless significant and encouraging that the question of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome has now become a subject of study which -isaia-_already under way or will be in the near future . It -isaia- likewise significant and encouraging that this_question appears as an essential theme not_only in the theological dialogues in which_the Catholic Church -isaia- engaging with_other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , but_also more generally in the ecumenical movement as a whole . Recently the delegates to the Fifth World Assembly of the Commission on Faith and Order of the World Council of Churches , held in Santiago de Compostela , recommended that the Commission '' begin a new study of the question of a universal ministry of Christian unity '' . After centuries of bitter controversies , the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities are more_and_more taking a fresh look -atti_degli_apostoli- this ministry of unity . The Bishop of Rome -isaia- the Bishop of the Church which preserves the mark of the martyrdom of Peter and of Paul : '' By a mysterious design of Providence it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome that Peter concludes his journey in following Jesus , and it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome that he gives his greatest proof of love and fidelity . Likewise Paul , the Apostle of the Gentiles , gives his supreme witness -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome . In this_way the Church of Rome became the Church of Peter and of Paul '' . In the New Testament , the person of Peter has an eminent place . In the first part of the Acts of the Apostles , he appears as the leader and spokesman of the Apostolic College described as '' Peter . and the Eleven '' : ; cf . The place assigned to Peter -isaia- based on the words of Christ himself , as they_are recorded in the Gospel traditions . The Gospel of Matthew gives a clear outline of the pastoral mission of Peter in the Church : '' Blessed are you , Simon Bar Jona ! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who_-isaia- in heaven . And I tell you , you_are Peter , and on this rock I will build my Church and the powers of death shall_not prevail against it . I will_give you the keys of the kingdom_of_heaven , and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven '' : . Luke makes clear_that Christ urged Peter to strengthen his brethren , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time reminding him of his_own human weakness and need of conversion cf . It -isaia- just as though , against the backdrop of Peter s human weakness , it were made fully evident_that his particular ministry in the Church derives altogether from grace . It -isaia- as though the Master especially concerned himself_with Peter s conversion as a way of preparing him for the task he was about to give him in his Church , and for this_reason was very strict with_him . This same role of Peter , similarly linked_with a realistic affirmation of his weakness , appears again in the Fourth Gospel : '' Simon , son of John , do you love me more_than these ? . It -isaia-_also significant that according to the First Letter of Paul to the Corinthians the Risen Christ appears to Cephas and then to the Twelve cf . It -isaia- important to note how the weakness of Peter and of Paul clearly shows_that the Church -isaia- founded upon the infinite power of grace cf . Peter , immediately after receiving his_mission , -isaia- rebuked with unusual severity by Christ , who tells him : '' You are a hindrance to me '' Mt : . How can we fail to see_that the mercy which Peter needs -isaia- related to the ministry of that mercy which he -isaia-_the_first to experience ? And yet , Peter will deny Jesus three times . The Gospel of John emphasizes that Peter receives the charge of shepherding the flock on the occasion of a threefold profession of love cf . : , which corresponds to his threefold denial cf . Luke , for his part , in the words of Christ already quoted , words_which the early tradition will concentrate upon in order to clarify the mission of Peter , insists on the fact_that he will_have to '' strengthen his brethren when he has turned again '' cf . As for Paul , he -isaia- able to end the description of his_ministry with the amazing words which_he_had heard from the Lord himself : '' My grace -isaia- sufficient for you , for my power -isaia- made perfect in weakness '' ; consequently , he can exclaim : '' When I -amos- weak , then I -amos- strong '' Cor : . This -isaia- a basic characteristic of the Christian experience . As the heir to the mission of Peter in the Church , which_has_been made fruitful by the blood of the Princes of the Apostles , the Bishop of Rome exercises a ministry originating in the manifold mercy of God . This mercy converts hearts and pours forth the power of grace where_the disciple experiences the bitter taste of his personal weakness and helplessness . The authority proper to this ministry -isaia- completely -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of God s merciful plan and it must_always be seen in this perspective . Its power -isaia- explained from this perspective . Associating himself_with Peter s threefold profession of love_,_which corresponds to the earlier threefold denial , his Successor knows that he must be a sign of mercy . His -isaia- a ministry of mercy , born of an act of Christ s own mercy . This whole lesson of the Gospel must be constantly read anew , so that the exercise of the Petrine ministry may lose nothing of its authenticity and transparency . The Church of God -isaia- called by Christ to manifest to a world ensnared by its sins and evil designs that , despite everything , God in his_mercy can convert hearts to unity and enable them to enter_into communion with_him . This service of unity , rooted in the action of divine mercy , -isaia- entrusted within_the College of Bishops to one among those_who_have received_from_the Spirit the task , not of exercising power over the people as the rulers of the Gentiles and their great men do cf . Mt : ; Mk : but of leading them towards peaceful pastures . This task can require the offering of one_s_own life cf . Saint Augustine , after showing that Christ -isaia- '' the one Shepherd , in whose unity all are_one '' , goes on to exhort : '' May all shepherds thus be one in the one Shepherd ; may_they let_the one voice of the Shepherd be heard ; may the sheep hear this voice and follow their Shepherd , not this shepherd or that , but the only_one ; in him may_they all let one voice be heard and not a babble of voices . the voice free of all division , purified of all heresy , that the sheep hear '' . The mission of the Bishop of Rome within_the College of all the Pastors consists precisely in '' keeping watch '' episkopein , like a sentinel , so that , through the efforts of the Pastors , the true voice of Christ the Shepherd may be heard in all the particular Churches . In this_way , in each of the particular Churches entrusted to those Pastors , the una , sancta , catholica et apostolica Ecclesia -isaia- made present . All the Churches are in full and visible communion , because all the Pastors are in communion with Peter and therefore united in Christ . With the power and the authority without_which such an office would be illusory , the Bishop of Rome must ensure the communion of all the Churches . For this_reason , he -isaia-_the_first servant of unity . This primacy -isaia- exercised on various levels , including vigilance over the handing down of the Word , the celebration of the Liturgy and the Sacraments , the Church s mission , discipline and the Christian life . It -isaia- the responsibility of the Successor of Peter to recall_the requirements of the common_good of the Church , should anyone be tempted to overlook it in the pursuit of personal interests . He has the duty to admonish , to caution and to declare -atti_degli_apostoli- times that_this or that opinion being circulated -isaia- irreconcilable with the unity of faith . When circumstances require it , he speaks in the name of all the Pastors in communion with_him . He can_also under very specific conditions clearly laid_down by the First Vatican Council declare ex cathedra that a certain doctrine belongs to the deposit of faith . By thus bearing_witness to the truth , he serves unity . All this however must_always be done in communion . When the Catholic Church affirms that the office of the Bishop of Rome corresponds to the will of Christ , she does_not separate this office from the mission entrusted to the whole_body of Bishops , who are_also '' vicars and ambassadors of Christ '' . The Bishop of Rome -isaia- a member of the '' College '' , and the Bishops are his_brothers in the ministry . Whatever relates to the unity of all Christian communities clearly forms part of the concerns of the primacy . As Bishop of Rome I -amos- fully aware , as I have reaffirmed in the present Encyclical Letter , that Christ ardently desires the full and visible communion of all those Communities in which , by virtue of God s faithfulness , his Spirit dwells . I -amos- convinced_that I have a particular responsibility in this_regard , above all in acknowledging the ecumenical aspirations of the majority of the Christian Communities and in heeding the request made of me to find a way of exercising the primacy which , while in no way renouncing what_-isaia- essential to its mission , -isaia- nonetheless open to a new situation . For a whole millennium Christians were united in '' a brotherly fraternal communion of faith and sacramental life . If disagreements in belief and discipline arose among_them , the Roman See acted by common consent as moderator '' . In this_way the primacy exercised its office of unity . When addressing the Ecumenical Patriarch His Holiness Dimitrios I , I acknowledged my awareness_that '' for a great variety of reasons , and against the will of all concerned , what should_have been a service sometimes manifested itself in a very different light . it -isaia- out of a desire to obey the will of Christ truly that I recognize_that as Bishop of Rome I -amos- called to exercise that ministry . I insistently pray the Holy Spirit to shine his light upon us , enlightening all the Pastors and theologians of our Churches , that_we_may seek together , of course the forms in which_this ministry may accomplish a service of love recognized by all concerned '' . This -isaia- an immense task , which we cannot refuse and which I cannot carry_out by myself . Could not the real but imperfect communion existing between us persuade Church leaders and their theologians to engage with me in a patient and fraternal dialogue on this_subject , a dialogue in which , leaving useless controversies behind , we could listen to one_another , keeping before us only the will of Christ for his Church and allowing ourselves to be deeply moved by his plea '' that_they_may all be one . so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : ? The communion of all particular Churches with the Church of Rome : a necessary condition_for unity . The Catholic Church , both in her praxis and in her solemn documents , holds that the communion of the particular Churches with the Church of Rome , and of their Bishops with the Bishop of Rome , -isaia- in God s plan an essential requisite of full and visible communion . Indeed full_communion , of which_the Eucharist -isaia- the highest sacramental manifestation , needs to be visibly expressed in a ministry in which all the Bishops recognize_that they are_united in Christ and all the faithful find confirmation for their_faith . The first part of the Acts of the Apostles presents Peter as the one_who speaks in the name of the apostolic group and who serves the unity of the community all the while respecting the authority of James , the head of the Church in Jerusalem . This function of Peter must continue in the Church so that under her sole Head , who_-isaia- Jesus Christ , she may be visibly present in the world as the communion of all his_disciples . Do not many of those involved in ecumenism today feel a need for_such a ministry ? A ministry which presides in truth and love so that the ship that beautiful symbol which_the World Council of Churches has chosen as its emblem will_not be buffeted by the storms and will one_day reach its haven . Full unity and evangelization . The ecumenical movement in our century , more_than the ecumenical undertakings of past centuries , the importance of which_must not however be underestimated , has_been characterized by a missionary outlook . In the verse of John s Gospel which_-isaia- ecumenism s inspiration and guiding motif '' that_they_may all be one . so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : the phrase that_the_world may believe has_been so strongly emphasized that -atti_degli_apostoli- times we run the risk of forgetting that , in the mind of the Evangelist , unity -isaia- above all for the glory of the Father . At the same_time it -isaia- obvious that the lack of unity among Christians contradicts the Truth which Christians have_the mission to spread and , consequently , it gravely damages their witness . This was clearly understood and expressed by my Predecessor Pope Paul VI , in his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi : '' As evangelizers , we must offer Christ s faithful not the image of people divided and separated by unedifying quarrels , but the image of people_who_are mature in faith and capable of finding a meeting point beyond_the real tensions , thanks to a shared , sincere and disinterested search_for truth . Yes , the destiny of evangelization_-isaia- certainly bound up with the witness of unity given by the Church . At this_point we wish to emphasize the sign of unity among all Christians as the way and instrument of evangelization . The division among Christians -isaia- a serious reality which impedes the very work of Christ '' . How indeed can we proclaim_the Gospel of reconciliation without -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time being committed to working for reconciliation between Christians ? However true it -isaia- that the Church , by the prompting of the Holy Spirit and with the promise of indefectibility , has preached and still preaches the Gospel to all nations , it -isaia-_also true_that she must face the difficulties which derive from the lack of unity . When non believers meet missionaries who_do_not agree among_themselves , even_though they all appeal to Christ , will they be in a position to receive the true message ? Will they not think_that the Gospel -isaia- a cause of division , despite the fact that_it_-isaia- presented as the fundamental law of love ? . When I say that_for me , as Bishop of Rome , the ecumenical task -isaia- '' one of the pastoral priorities '' of my Pontificate , I think of the grave obstacle which_the lack of unity represents for the proclamation of the Gospel . A Christian Community which believes in Christ and desires , with Gospel fervour , the salvation of mankind can hardly be closed to the promptings of the Holy Spirit , who leads all Christians towards full and visible unity . Here an imperative of charity_-isaia- in question , an imperative which admits of no exception . Ecumenism -isaia-_not_only an internal question of the Christian Communities . It -isaia-_a_matter of the love_which God has in Jesus Christ for all humanity ; to stand in the way of this love_-isaia- an offence against him and against his plan to gather all people in Christ . As Pope Paul VI wrote to the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I : '' May the Holy Spirit guide us along the way of reconciliation , so that the unity of our Churches may_become an ever_more radiant sign of hope and consolation for all mankind '' . In my recent Letter to the Bishops , clergy and faithful of the Catholic Church indicating the path to be followed towards_the celebration of the Great Jubilee of the Holy Year , I wrote that '' the best preparation_for the new millennium can_only be expressed in a renewed commitment to apply , as faithfully as possible , the teachings of Vatican II to the life of every_individual and of the whole Church '' . The Second Vatican Council -isaia- the great beginning the Advent as it were of the journey leading us to the threshold of the Third Millennium . Given the importance which_the Council attributed to the work of rebuilding Christian unity , and in this our_age of grace for ecumenism , I thought it necessary to reaffirm the fundamental convictions which_the Council impressed upon the consciousness of the Catholic Church , recalling them in the light of the progress subsequently made towards_the full_communion of all the baptized . There -isaia- no doubt_that the Holy Spirit -isaia- active in this endeavour and that_he_-isaia- leading the Church to the full realization of the Father s plan , in conformity_with_the will of Christ . This will was expressed with heartfelt urgency in the prayer which , according to the Fourth Gospel , he uttered -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment when he entered upon the saving mystery of his Passover . Just as he did then , today too Christ calls everyone to renew their commitment to work_for full and visible communion . I therefore exhort my Brothers in the Episcopate to be especially mindful of this commitment . The two Codes of Canon Law include among the responsibilities of the Bishop that of promoting the unity of all Christians by supporting all activities or initiatives undertaken for this_purpose , in the awareness_that the Church has this obligation from the will of Christ himself . This -isaia-_part of the episcopal mission and it -isaia- a duty which derives directly from fidelity to Christ , the Shepherd of the Church . Indeed all the faithful_are asked by the Spirit of God to do everything possible to strengthen the bonds of communion_between all Christians and to increase cooperation between Christ s followers : '' Concern for restoring unity pertains to the whole Church , faithful and clergy alike . It extends to everyone according to the potential of each '' . The power of God s Spirit gives growth and builds up the Church down_the_centuries . As the Church turns her gaze to the new millennium , she asks the Spirit for the grace to strengthen her_own unity and to make it grow towards full_communion with_other Christians . How -isaia- the Church to obtain this grace ? In the first_place , through prayer . Prayer should_always concern itself with the longing for_unity , and as such_-isaia- one of the basic forms of our love for Christ and for the Father who_-isaia- rich in mercy . In this journey which_we_are undertaking with_other Christians towards_the new millennium prayer must occupy the first_place . How -isaia- she to obtain this grace ? Through giving thanks , so that we do not present ourselves empty handed -atti_degli_apostoli- the appointed time : '' Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness . '' intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words '' Rom : , disposing us to ask God for_what we need . How -isaia- she to obtain this grace ? Through hope in the Spirit , who_can banish from us the painful memories of our separation . The Spirit -isaia- able to grant us clear sightedness , strength and courage to take whatever steps are necessary , that_our commitment may be ever_more authentic . And should we ask if all this_-isaia- possible , the answer will_always be yes . It -isaia-_the_same answer which Mary of Nazareth heard : with God nothing_-isaia- impossible . I -amos- reminded of the words of Saint Cyprian s commentary on the Lord s Prayer , the prayer of every Christian : '' God does_not accept the sacrifice of a sower of disunion , but commands that he depart from the altar so that_he_may first be reconciled with his_brother . For God can be appeased only by prayers that make peace . To God , the better offering -isaia- peace , brotherly concord and a people made one in the unity of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit '' . At the dawn of the new millennium , how_can we not implore from the Lord , with renewed enthusiasm and a deeper awareness , the grace to prepare ourselves , together , to offer this sacrifice of unity ? . I , John Paul , servus servorum Dei , venture to make my own the words of the Apostle Paul , whose martyrdom , together_with that of the Apostle Peter , has bequeathed to this See of Rome the splendour of its witness , and I say to you , the faithful of the Catholic Church , and to you , my brothers_and_sisters of the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities : '' Mend your ways , encourage one_another , live in harmony , and the God of love and peace will be with you . The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all '' Cor : , .

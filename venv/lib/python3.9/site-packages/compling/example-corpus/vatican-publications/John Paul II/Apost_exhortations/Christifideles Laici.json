THE LAY MEMBERS of Christ s Faithful People Christifideles Laici , whose '' Vocation and Mission in the Church and in the World Twenty Years after_the Second Vatican Council '' was_the topic of the Synod of Bishops , are_those_who form that part of the People of God which might be likened to the labourers in the vineyard mentioned in Matthew s Gospel : '' For the Kingdom of heaven -isaia- like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard . After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day , he sent them_into his vineyard '' Mt : . The gospel parable sets before our_eyes the Lord s vast vineyard and the multitude of persons , both women and men , who are_called and sent forth by him to labour in it . The vineyard -isaia- the whole_world cf . Mt : , which_-isaia- to be transformed according to the plan of God in view of the final coming of the Kingdom of God . You Go Into My Vineyard Too . '' And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace ; and to them he said , You go into the vineyard too '' Mt : . From that distant day the call of the Lord Jesus '' You go into my vineyard too '' never fails to resound in the course of history : it -isaia- addressed to every_person who comes into this_world . In our_times , the Church after Vatican II in a renewed outpouring of the Spirit of Pentecost has come to a more lively awareness of her missionary nature and has listened again to the voice of her Lord who sends her forth into_the_world as '' the universal sacrament of salvation '' . The call -isaia- a concern not_only of Pastors , clergy , and men_and_women_religious . The call -isaia- addressed to everyone : lay_people as well are personally called by the Lord , from whom_they receive a mission on behalf of the Church and the world . In preaching to the people Saint Gregory the Great recalls this_fact and comments on the parable of the labourers in the vineyard : '' Keep watch over your manner of life , dear people , and make sure_that you_are indeed the Lord s labourers . Each person should_take into_account what he does and consider if he -isaia- labouring in the vineyard of the Lord '' . The Council , in particular , with its rich doctrinal , spiritual and pastoral patrimony , has written as never before on the nature , dignity , spirituality , mission and responsibility of the lay_faithful . And the Council Fathers , re echoing the call of Christ , have summoned all the lay_faithful , both women and men , to labour in the vineyard : '' The Council , then , makes an earnest plea in the Lord s name that all lay_people give a glad , generous , and prompt response to the impulse of the Holy Spirit and to the voice of Christ , who_-isaia- giving them an especially urgent invitation -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment . Young people should feel_that this call -isaia-_directed to them in particular , and they_should respond to it eagerly and magnanimously . The Lord himself renews his invitation to all the lay_faithful to come closer to him every_day , and with the recognition that what_-isaia- his -isaia-_also their_own Phil : they ought to associate themselves_with him in his saving mission . Once again he sends them_into every town and place_where he himself_-isaia- to come cf . You go into my vineyard too . During the Synod of Bishops , held in Rome , October , these_words were re echoed in spirit once_again . Following the path marked out by the Council and remaining open to the light of the experience of persons and communities from the whole Church , the Fathers , enriched by preceding Synods , treated in a specific and extensive manner the topic of the vocation and mission of the lay_faithful in the Church and in the world . In this assembly of bishops there_was not lacking a qualified representation of the lay_faithful , both women and men , which rendered a valuable contribution to the Synod proceedings . This was publicly acknowledged in the concluding homily : '' We give thanks that during the course of the Synod we have_not only rejoiced in the participation of the lay_faithful both men_and_women auditors , but even_more so in that the progress of the Synodal discussions has enabled us to listen to those_whom we invited , representatives of the lay_faithful from all parts_of_the_world , from different countries , and to profit from their experience , their advice and the suggestions they_have offered out of love for the common cause '' . In looking over the years following the Council the Synod Fathers have been_able to verify how the Holy Spirit continues to renew the youth of the Church and how he has inspired new aspirations towards holiness and the participation of so many lay_faithful . This -isaia- witnessed , among_other ways , in the new manner of active collaboration among priests , religious and the lay_faithful ; the active participation in the Liturgy , in the proclamation of the Word of God and catechesis ; the multiplicity of services and tasks entrusted to the lay_faithful and fulfilled by them ; the flourishing of groups , associations and spiritual movements as well as a lay commitment in the life of the Church ; and in the fuller and meaningful participation of women in the development of society . At the same_time , the Synod has pointed_out that the post conciliar path of the lay_faithful has not_been without its difficulties and dangers . In particular , two temptations can be cited which_they_have not_always known how to avoid : the temptation of being so strongly interested in Church services and tasks that_some fail to become actively engaged in their responsibilities in the professional , social , cultural and political world ; and the temptation of legitimizing the unwarranted separation of faith from life , that_-isaia- , a separation of the Gospel s acceptance from the actual living of the Gospel in various situations in the world . In the course of its work , the Synod made constant reference to the Second Vatican Council , whose teaching on the lay_faithful , after twenty years , has_taken on a surprisingly contemporary character and -atti_degli_apostoli- times has carried prophetic significance : such teaching has the capacity of enlightening and guiding the responses that today must_be_given to new situations . In reality , the challenge embraced by the Synod Fathers has_been that of indicating the concrete ways through_which this rich '' theory '' on the lay state expressed by the Council can be translated into authentic Church '' practice '' . Some situations have_made themselves felt because of a certain '' novelty '' that_they_have , and in this_sense they_can be called post conciliar , -atti_degli_apostoli- least chronologically : to these the Synod Fathers have rightly given a particular attention in the course of their discussion and reflection . Among those situations to be recalled are_those regarding the ministries and Church services entrusted -atti_degli_apostoli- present and in the future to the lay_faithful , the growth and spread of new '' movements '' alongside other group forms of lay involvement , and the place and role of women both in the Church and in society . At the conclusion of their_work , which proceeded with_great commitment , competence and generosity , the Synod Fathers made_known to me their desires and requested that -atti_degli_apostoli- an opportune time , a conclusive papal document on the topic of the lay_faithful be offered to the Universal Church . This Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation intends to take into_account all the richness of the Synod work , from the Lineamenta to the Instrumentum Laboris , from the introductory report , the presentations of individual bishops and lay persons to the summary reports after discussion in the Synod hall , from the discussions and reports of the '' small groups '' to the final '' Propositions '' and the concluding '' Message '' . For this_reason_the present document -isaia- not something in contradistinction to the Synod , but_-isaia- meant to be a faithful and coherent expression of it , a fruit of collegiality . As such , the Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops and the Secretariat itself have contributed to its final form . This Exhortation intends to stir and promote a deeper awareness among all the faithful of the gift and responsibility they share , both as a group and as individuals , in the communion and mission of the Church . The Pressing Needs of the World Today : '' Why do you stand here idle all day ? '' . The basic meaning of this Synod and the most_precious fruit desired as a result of it , -isaia- the lay_faithful s hearkening to the call of Christ the Lord to work in his vineyard , to take an active , conscientious and responsible part in the mission of the Church in this_great moment in history , made especially dramatic by occurring on the threshold of the Third Millennium . A new state of affairs today both in the Church and in social , economic , political and cultural life , calls with a particular urgency for the action of the lay_faithful . If lack of commitment -isaia- always unacceptable , the present_time renders it even_more so . It -isaia- not permissible for anyone to remain idle . We continue in our reading of the gospel parable : '' And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing ; and he said to them , Why do you stand here idle all day ? . They said to him , Because no one_has hired us . He said to them , You go into the vineyard too '' Mt : . Since the work that awaits everyone in the vineyard of the Lord -isaia- so great there_-isaia- no place_for idleness . With even greater urgency the '' householder '' repeats his invitation : '' You go into my vineyard too '' . The voice of the Lord clearly resounds in the depths of each of Christ s followers , who through_faith and the sacraments of Christian initiation -isaia- made like to Jesus Christ , -isaia- incorporated as a living member in the Church and has an active part in her_mission of salvation . The voice of the Lord also comes to be heard through the historic events of the Church and humanity , as the Council reminds us : '' The People of God believes that_it_-isaia- led by the Spirit of the Lord , who fills the whole_world . Moved by this faith it tries to discern authentic signs of God s presence and purpose in the events , the needs , and the longings which it shares with_other people of our_time . For faith throws a new light on all things and makes known the full ideal to which God has called each_individual , and thus guides the mind towards solutions which_are fully human '' . It -isaia- necessary , then , to keep a watchful eye on this our_world , with its problems and values , its unrest and hopes , its defeats and triumphs : a world whose economic , social , political and cultural affairs pose problems and grave difficulties in light of the description provided by the Council in the Pastoral Constitution , Gaudium et Spes . This , then , -isaia- the vineyard ; this_-isaia- the field in which_the faithful_are called to fulfill their_mission . Jesus wants them , as he wants all his_disciples , to be the '' salt of the earth '' and the '' light_of_the_world '' cf . But what_-isaia- the actual state of affairs of the '' earth '' and the '' world '' , for_which Christians ought to be '' salt '' and '' light '' ? The variety of situations and problems that exist in our world_-isaia- indeed great and rapidly changing . For this_reason it -isaia- all the more necessary to guard against generalizations and unwarranted simplifications . It -isaia- possible , however , to highlight some trends that_are emerging in present_day society . The gospel records that the weeds and the good grain grew together in the farmer s field . The same -isaia- true in history , where in everyday life there often exist contradictions in the exercise of human_freedom , where there_-isaia- found , side by side and -atti_degli_apostoli- times closely intertwined , evil and good , injustice and justice , anguish and hope . Secularism and the Need for Religion . How can one not notice the ever growing existence of religious indifference and atheism in its more varied forms , particularly in its perhaps most widespread form of secularism ? Adversely affected by the impressive triumphs of continuing scientific and technological development and above all , fascinated by a very old and yet new temptation , namely_,_that of wishing to become like God cf . Gen : through the use of a liberty without bounds , individuals cut the religious roots that_are in their_hearts ; they forget God , or simply retain him without meaning in their_lives , or outrightly reject him , and begin to adore various '' idols '' of the contemporary world . The present_day phenomenon of secularism -isaia- truly serious , not_simply as regards the individual , but in some ways , as regards whole communities , as the Council has_already indicated : '' Growing numbers of people_are abandoning religion in practice '' . At other times I myself have recalled the phenomenon of de Christianization that strikes long standing Christian people and which continually calls for a re evangelization . Human longing and the need tor religion , however , are_not able to be totally extinguished . When persons in conscience have_the courage to face the more_serious questions of human_existence particularly questions related to the purpose of life , to suffering and to dying they_are unable to avoid making their_own the words of truth uttered by Saint Augustine : '' You have_made us for yourself , O Lord , and our_hearts are restless until they rest in you '' . In the same manner the present_day world bears_witness to this as well , in ever_increasing and impressive ways , through an openness to a spiritual and transcendent outlook towards life , the renewed interest in religious research , the return to a sense of the sacred and to prayer , and the demand for freedom to call_upon the name of the Lord . The Human Person : A Dignity Violated and Exalted . We furthermore call to mind the violations to which_the human person_-isaia- subjected . When the individual -isaia- not recognized and loved in the person s dignity as the living image of God cf . Gen : , the human_being -isaia- exposed to more humiliating and degrading forms of '' manipulation '' , that_most assuredly reduce the individual to a slavery to those_who_are stronger . '' Those who_are stronger '' can take a variety of names : an ideology ; economic power , political and inhumane systems , scientific technocracy or the intrusiveness of the mass_media . Once again we find ourselves before many persons , our sisters and brothers , whose fundamental rights are_being violated , owing to their exceedingly great capacity_for endurance and to the clear injustice of certain civil laws : the right to life and to integrity , the right to a house and to work , the right to a family and responsible parenthood , the right to participation in public and political_life , the right to freedom of conscience and the practice of religion . Who -isaia- able to count the number of babies unborn because they_have_been killed in their mothers wombs , children abandoned and abused by their_own parents , children who grow without affection and education ? In some_countries entire populations are deprived of housing and work , lacking the means absolutely essential for leading a life worthy of a human_being , and are deprived even of those_things necessary_for their sustenance . There are great areas of poverty and of misery , both physical and moral , existing -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment on the periphery of great cities . Entire groups of human_beings have_been seriously afflicted . But the sacredness of the human_person cannot be obliterated , no matter how often it -isaia- devalued and violated because it has its unshakable foundation in God as Creator and Father . The sacredness of the person always keeps returning , again_and_again . The sense of the dignity_of_the_human_person must be pondered and reaffirmed in stronger . A beneficial trend -isaia- advancing and permeating all peoples of the earth , making them ever_more aware of the dignity of the individual : the person_-isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- all a '' thing '' or an '' object '' to be used , but primarily a responsible '' subject '' , one endowed_with conscience and freedom , called to live responsibly in society and history , and oriented towards spiritual and religious values . It has been_said that ours -isaia- the time of '' humanism '' : paradoxically , some of its atheistic and secularistic forms arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a point where_the human person_-isaia- diminished and annihilated ; other_forms of humanism , instead , exalt the individual in such a manner that_these forms become a veritable and real idolatry . There are_still other_forms , however , in line with the truth , which rightly acknowledge_the greatness and misery of individuals and manifest , sustain and foster the total dignity_of_the_human_person . The sign and fruit of this trend towards humanism -isaia- the growing need_for participation , which_-isaia- undoubtedly one of the distinctive features of present_day humanity , a true '' sign of the times '' that_-isaia- developing in various fields and in different_ways : above all the growing need_for participation regarding women and young_people , not_only in areas of family and academic life , but_also in cultural , economic , social and political areas . To be leading characters in this development , in some ways to be creators of a new , more humane culture , -isaia- a requirement both_for the individual and for peoples as a whole . Conflict and Peace . Finally , we are unable to overlook another phenomenon that_-isaia- quite evident in present_day humanity : perhaps as never before in history , humanity -isaia- daily buffeted by conflict . This -isaia- a phenomenon which_has many forms , displayed in a legitimate plurality of mentalities and initiatives , but manifested in the fatal opposition of persons , groups , categories , nations and blocks of nations . This opposition takes the form of violence , of terrorism , and of war . Once again , but_with proportions enormously widespread , diverse sectors of humanity today , wishing to show their '' omnipotence '' , renew the futile experience of constructing the '' Tower of Babel '' cf . Gen : , which spreads confusion , struggle , disintegration and oppression . The human family_-isaia- thus in itself dramatically convulsed and wounded . On the other_hand , totally unsupressible -isaia- that_human longing experienced by individuals and whole peoples for the inestimable good of peace in justice . The gospel beatitude : '' Blessed are the peacemakers '' Mt : finds in the people of our_time a new and significant resonance : entire populations today live , suffer and labour to bring_about peace and justice . The participation by so many persons and groups in the life of society_-isaia- increasingly pursued today as the way to make a desired peace become a reality . On this road we meet many lay_faithful generously committed to the social and political field , working in a variety of institutional forms and those of a voluntary nature in service to the least . Jesus Christ , the Hope of Humanity . This , then , -isaia- the vast field of labour that stands before the labourers sent forth by the '' householder '' to work in his vineyard . In this_field the Church -isaia- present and working , every_one of us , Pastors , priests , deacons , religious and lay_faithful . The adverse situations here mentioned deeply affect the Church : they in part condition the Church , but they_do_not crush her , nor even less overcome her , because the Holy Spirit , who_gives her_life , sustains her in her_mission . Despite every difficulty , delay and contradiction caused by the limits of human_nature , by sin and by the Evil One , the Church knows that all the forces that humanity employs for communion and participation find a full response in the intervention of Jesus Christ , the Redeemer of man and of the world . The Church knows that she_-isaia- sent forth by him as '' sign and instrument of intimate_union with God and of the unity of all the human_race '' . Despite all this , then , humanity -isaia- able to hope . Indeed it must hope : the living and personal Gospel , Jesus Christ himself , -isaia- the '' good_news '' and the bearer of joy that the Church announces each_day , and to whom_the Church bears testimony before all people . The lay_faithful have an essential and irreplaceable role in this announcement and in this testimony : through them the Church of Christ -isaia- made present in the various sectors of the world , as a sign and source of hope and of love . CHAPTER I I AM THE VINE AND YOU ARE THE BRANCHESThe Dignity of the Lay Faithful in the Church as Mystery The Mystery of the Vine . The Sacred Scriptures use the image of the vine in various_ways . In a particular case , the vine serves to express the Mystery of the People of God . From this perspective which emphasizes the Church s internal nature , the lay faithful_are seen not_simply as labourers who work in the vineyard , but as themselves being a part of the vineyard . Jesus says , '' I -amos- the vine , you_are the branches '' Jn : . The prophets in the Old Testament used the image of the vine to describe the chosen people . Israel -isaia- God s vine , the Lord s own work , the joy of his_heart : '' I have planted you a choice vine '' Jer : ; '' Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water , fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water '' Ez : ; '' My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill . He dug it and cleared it of stones and planted it with choice vines . Jesus himself once_again takes up the symbol of the vine and uses it to illustrate various aspects of the Kingdom of God : '' A man planted a vineyard , and set a hedge around it , and dug a pit for the winepress , and built a tower and let it out to tenants and went into another country '' Mk : ; cf . John the Evangelist invites us to go further and leads us to discover the mystery of the vine : it -isaia- the figure and symbol not_only of the People of God , but of Jesus himself . He -isaia- the vine and we , his_disciples , are the branches . He -isaia- the '' true vine '' , to which_the branches are engrafted to have life cf . The Second Vatican Council , making reference to the various biblical images that help to reveal the mystery of the Church , proposes again the image of the vine and the branches : '' Christ -isaia- the true vine who gives_life and fruitfulness to the branches , that_-isaia- , to us . Through the Church we abide in Christ , without whom we can do nothing Jn : '' . The Church herself , then , -isaia- the vine in the gospel . She -isaia- mystery because the very life and love of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit are the gift gratuitously offered to all those_who_are born of water and the Holy Spirit cf . Jn : , and called to relive the very communion of God and to manifest it and communicate it in history mission : '' In that day '' , Jesus says , '' you will know tkat I -amos- in my Father and you in me , and I in you '' Jn : . Only from inside the Church s mystery of communion_-isaia- the '' identity '' of the lay_faithful made_known , and their fundamental dignity revealed . Only within_the context of this dignity can their_vocation and mission in the Church and in the world be defined . Who are the Lay Faithful . The Synod Fathers have rightly pointed to the need_for a definition of the lay_faithful s vocation and mission in positive terms , through an in depth study of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council in light of both recent documentation from the Magisterium and the lived experience of the Church , guided as she_-isaia- by the Holy Spirit . In giving a response to the question '' Who are the lay_faithful '' , the Council went beyond previous interpretations which_were predominantly negative . Instead it opened itself to a decidedly positive vision and displayed a basic intention of asserting the full belonging of the lay_faithful to the Church and to its mystery . At the same_time it insisted on the unique character of their_vocation , which_-isaia- in a special_way to '' seek the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and ordering them according to the plan of God '' . '' The term lay_faithful '' we read in the Constitution on the Church , Lumen Gentium '' -isaia- here understood to mean all the faithful except those in Holy Orders and those_who belong to a religious state sanctioned by the Church . Through Baptism the lay faithful_are made one_body with Christ and are established among the People of God . They are in their_own way made sharers in the priestly , prophetic and kingly office of Christ . They carry_out_their own part in the mission of the whole Christian people with_respect to the Church and the world '' . Pius XII once stated : '' The Faithful , more precisely_the lay_faithful , find_themselves on the front lines of the Church s life ; for them the Church -isaia- the animating principle for human_society . Therefore , they in particular , ought to have an ever clearer consciousness not_only of belonging to the Church , but of being the Church , that_-isaia- to say , the community of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope , the head of all , and of the Bishops in communion with_him . These are the Church . According to the Biblical image of the vineyard , the lay_faithful , together_with all the other members of the Church , are branches engrafted to Christ the true vine , and from him derive their_life and fruitfulness . Incorporation into Christ through_faith and Baptism -isaia-_the_source of being a Christian in the mystery of the Church . This mystery constitutes the Christian s most basic '' features '' and serves as the basis for all the vocations and dynamism of the Christian life of the lay_faithful cf . In Christ who died and rose from the dead , the baptized become a '' new creation '' Gal : ; Cor : , washed clean from sin and brought to life through grace . Therefore , only through accepting the richness in mystery that God gives to the Christian in Baptism -isaia- it possible to come to a basic description of the lay_faithful . Baptism and the '' Newness '' of Christian Life . It -isaia- no exaggeration to say that the entire existence of the lay_faithful has as its purpose to lead a person to a knowledge of the radical newness of the Christian life_that comes_from Baptism , the sacrament of faith , so that_this knowledge can_help that person live the responsibilities which arise from that vocation received_from God . In arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- a basic description of the lay_faithful we now more explicitly and directly consider among others the following three fundamental aspects : Baptism regenerates us in the life ot the Son of God ; unites us to Christ and to his Body , the Church ; and anoints us in the Holy Spirit , making us spiritual temples . Children in the Son . We here recall Jesus words to Nicodemus : '' Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one_-isaia- born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter_the kingdom of God '' Jn : . Baptism , then , -isaia- a rebirth , a regeneration . In considering this aspect of the gift which_comes_from Baptism , the apostle Peter breaks out into song : '' Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! By his great mercy we have_been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , and to an inheritance which_-isaia- imperishable , undefiled and unfading '' Pt : . And he calls Christians those_who_have been '' born anew , not of perishable seed but of imperishable , through the living and abiding word of God '' Pt : . With Baptism we become children of God in his only_begotten Son , Jesus Christ . Rising from the waters of the Baptismal font , every Christian hears again the voice that_was once heard on the banks of the Jordan River : '' You are my beloved Son ; with you I -amos- well pleased '' Lk : . From this comes the understanding that_one has_been brought into association with the beloved Son , becoming a child of adoption cf . Gal : and a brother or sister of Christ . In this_way the eternal plan of the Father for each person_-isaia- realized in history : '' For those_whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , in order that_he_might be the first born among many brethren '' Rom : . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit who constitutes the baptized as Children of God and members of Christ s Body . Paul reminds the Christians of Corinth of this_fact : '' For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one_body '' Cor : , so that the apostle can say to the lay_faithful : '' Now you_are the body of Christ and individually members of it '' Cor : ; '' And because you_are sons , God has_sent the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts '' Gal : ; cf . We Are One Body in Christ . Regenerated as '' Children in the Son '' , the baptized are inseparably joined together as '' members of Christ and members of the body of the Church '' , as the Council of Florence teaches . Baptism symbolizes and brings about a mystical but real incorporation into the crucified and glorious body of Christ . Through the sacrament Jesus unites the baptized to his_death so as to unite the recipient to his_resurrection cf . The '' old man '' -isaia- stripped away for a reclothing with '' the new man '' , that_-isaia- , with Jesus himself : '' For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ '' Gal : ; cf . The result -isaia- that '' we , though many , are one_body in Christ '' Rom : . In the words of Saint Paul we find again the faithful echo of the teaching of Jesus himself , which reveals the mystical unity of Christ with his_disciples and the disciples with each_other , presenting it as an image and extension of that mystical communion that binds the Father to the Son and the Son to the Father in the bond of love , the Holy Spirit cf . Jesus refers to this_same unity in the image of the vine and the branches : '' I -amos- the vine , you the branches '' Jn : , an image that sheds light not_only on the deep intimacy of the disciples with Jesus but on the necessity of a vital communion of the disciples with each_other : all are branches of a single vine . Holy and Living Temples of the Spirit . In another comparison , using the image of a building , the apostle Peter defines the baptized as '' living stones '' founded on Christ , the '' corner stone '' , and destined to '' be raised up into a spiritual building '' Pt : ff . The image introduces us to another aspect of the newness of Christian life coming from Baptism and described by the Second Vatican Council : '' By regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit , the baptized are consecrated into a spiritual house '' . The Holy Spirit '' anoints '' the baptized , sealing each with an indelible character cf . Cor : , and constituting each as a spiritual temple , that_-isaia- , he fills this temple with the holy presence of God as a result of each_person s being united and likened to Jesus Christ . With this spiritual '' unction '' , Christians can repeat in an individual way the words of Jesus : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor . He has_sent me to proclaim release to captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the acceptable year of the Lord '' Lk : ; cf . Thus with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Baptism and Confirmation , the baptized share in the same mission of Jesus as the Christ , the Saviour Messiah . Sharers in the Priestly , Prophetic and Kingly Mission of Jesus Christ . Referring to the baptized as '' new born babes '' , the apostle Peter writes : '' Come to him , to that living stone , rejected by men but in God s sight chosen and precious ; and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ . you_are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , God s own people , that_you_may declare the wonderful deeds of him_who called you out of darkness into_his marvelous light '' Pt : , . A new aspect to the grace and dignity coming from Baptism -isaia- here introduced : the lay_faithful participate , for their_part , in the threefold mission of Christ as Priest , Prophet and King . This aspect has_never been forgotten in the living tradition of the Church , as exemplified in the explanation which St . Augustine offers for Psalm : '' David was anointed king . In those days only a king and a priest were anointed . These two persons prefigured the one and only priest and king who_was to come , Christ the name '' Christ '' means '' anointed '' . Not only has our head been anointed but we , his_body , have_also been anointed . therefore anointing comes to all Christians , even_though in Old Testament times it belonged only to two persons . Clearly we are the Body of Christ because we are all '' anointed '' and in him are '' christs '' , that_-isaia- , '' anointed ones '' , as well as Christ himself , '' The Anointed One '' . In a certain way , then , it thus happens_that with head and body the whole Christ -isaia- formed '' . In the wake of the Second Vatican Council , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my pastoral_ministry , my aim was to emphasize forcefully the priestly , prophetic and kingly dignity of the entire People of God in the following words : '' He who was_born of the Virgin Mary , the carpenter s Son as he was thought to be Son of the living God confessed by Peter , has come to make us a kingdom of priests The Second Vatican Council has reminded us of the mystery of this_power and of the fact_that the mission of Christ Priest , Prophet Teacher , King continues in the Church . Everyone , the whole People of God , shares in this threefold mission '' . With this Exhortation the lay faithful_are invited to take up again and reread , meditate on and assimilate with renewed understanding and love , the rich and fruitful teaching of the Council which speaks of their participation in the threefold mission of Christ . Here in summary form are the essential elements of this_teaching . The lay faithful_are sharers in the priestly mission , for_which Jesus offered himself on the cross and continues to be offered in the celebration of the Eucharist for the glory of God and the salvation of humanity . Incorporated in Jesus Christ , the baptized are_united to him and to his sacrifice in the offering they_make of themselves and their_daily activities cf . Speaking of the lay_faithful the Council says : '' For their_work , prayers and apostolic endeavours , their ordinary married and family_life , their_daily labour , their mental and physical relaxation , if carried_out in the Spirit , and even the hardships of life if patiently borne all of these become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ cf . During the celebration of the Eucharist these sacrifices are_most lovingly offered to the Father along_with the Lord s body . Thus as worshipers whose every deed -isaia- holy , the lay_faithful consecrate the world itself to God '' . Through their participation in the prophetic mission of Christ , '' who proclaimed the kingdom of his Father by the testimony of his_life and by the power of his world '' , the lay faithful_are given the ability and responsibility to accept the gospel in faith and to proclaim it in word and deed , without hesitating to courageously identify and denounce evil . United to Christ , the '' great prophet '' Lk : , and in the Spirit made '' witnesses '' of the Risen Christ , the lay faithful_are made sharers in the appreciation of the Church s supernatural faith , that '' cannot err in matters of belief '' and sharers as well in the grace of the word cf . They are_also called to allow the newness and the power of the gospel to shine out everyday in their family and social_life , as well as to express patiently and courageously in the contradictions of the present age their hope of future glory even '' through the framework of their secular life '' . Because the lay_faithful belong to Christ , Lord and King of the Universe , they share in his kingly mission and are_called by him to spread that Kingdom in history . They exercise their kingship as Christians , above all in the spiritual combat in which_they seek to overcome in themselves the kingdom of sin cf . Rom : , and then to make a gift of themselves so as to serve , in justice and in charity , Jesus who_-isaia- himself present in all his brothers_and_sisters , above all in the very least cf . But in particular the lay faithful_are called to restore to creation all its original value . In ordering creation to the authentic well_being of humanity in an activity governed by the life of grace , they share in the exercise of the power with_which_the Risen Christ draws all things to himself and subjects them along_with himself to the Father , so that God might be everything to everyone cf . The participation of the lay_faithful in the threefold mission of Christ as Priest , Prophet and King finds_its source in the anointing of Baptism , its further development in Confirmation and its realization and dynamic sustenance in the Holy Eucharist . It -isaia- a participation given to each member of the lay_faithful individually , in as much as each -isaia- one of the many who form the one Body of the Lord : in fact , Jesus showers his gifts upon the Church which_-isaia- his Body and his Spouse . In such_a_way individuals are sharers in the threefold mission of Christ in virtue of their being members of the Church , as St . Peter clearly teaches , when he defines the baptized as '' a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , God s own people '' Pt : . Precisely because it derives from Church communion , the sharing of the lay_faithful in the threefold mission of Christ requires that it be lived and realized in communion and for the increase of communion itself . Saint Augustine writes : '' As we call everyone Christians in virtue of a mystical anointing , so we call everyone priests because all are members of only_one priesthood '' . The Lay Faithful and Their Secular Character . The newness of the Christian life_-isaia- the foundation and title for equality among all the baptized in Christ , for all the members of the People of God : '' As members , they share a common dignity from their rebirth in Christ , they_have the same filial grace and the same vocation to perfection . They possess in common one salvation , one hope and one undivided charity '' . Because of the one dignity flowing from Baptism , each member of the lay_faithful , together_with ordained ministers and men_and_women_religious , shares a responsibility_for the Church s mission . But among the lay_faithful this one baptismal dignity takes on a manner of life_which sets a person apart , without , however , bringing_about a separation from the ministerial priesthood or from men_and_women_religious . The Second Vatican Council has described this manner of life as the '' secular character '' : '' The secular character -isaia- properly and particularly that of the lay_faithful '' . To understand properly the lay_faithful s position in the Church in a complete , adequate and specific manner it -isaia- necesary to come to a deeper theological understanding of their secular character in light of God s plan of salvation and in the context of the mystery of the Church . Pope Paul VI said the Church '' has an authentic secular dimension , inherent to her inner nature and mission , which_-isaia- deeply rooted in the mystery of the Word Incarnate , and which_-isaia- realized in different_forms through_her members '' . The Church , in fact , lives in the world , even if she_-isaia- not of the world cf . She -isaia- sent to continue the redemptive work of Jesus Christ , which '' by its_very nature concerns the salvation of humanity , and also involves the renewal of the whole temporal order '' . Certainly all the members of the Church are sharers in this secular dimension but in different_ways . In particular the sharing of the lay_faithful has its_own manner of realization and function , which , according to the Council , -isaia- '' properly and particularly '' theirs . Such a manner -isaia- designated with the expression '' secular character '' . In fact the Council , in describing the lay_faithful s situation in the secular world , points to it above all , as the place in which_they receive their call from God : '' There they_are_called by God '' . This '' place '' -isaia- treated and presented in dynamic terms : the lay_faithful '' live in the world , that_-isaia- , in every_one of the secular professions and occupations . They live in the ordinary circumstances of family and social_life , from which_the very fabric of their existence -isaia- woven '' . They are persons_who live an ordinary life in the world : they study , they work , they form relationships as friends , professionals , members of society , cultures , etc . However , the Council considers their condition not_simply an external and environmental framework , but as a reality destined to find in Jesus Christ the fullness of its meaning . Indeed it leads to the affirmation that '' the Word made_flesh willed to share in human fellowship . He sanctified those human ties , especially family ones , from which social relationships arise , willingly submitting himself to the laws of his country . He chose to lead the life of an ordinary craftsman of his_own time_and_place '' . The '' world '' thus becomes_the place and the means_for the lay_faithful to fulfill their Christian vocation , because the world itself_-isaia- destined to glorify God the Father in Christ . The Council -isaia- able then to indicate the proper and special sense of the divine vocation which -isaia-_directed to the lay_faithful . They are_not called to abandon the position that_they_have in the world . Baptism does_not take them_from the world -atti_degli_apostoli- all , as the apostle Paul points_out : '' So , brethren , in whatever state each was called , there let_him remain with God '' Cor : . On the contrary , he entrusts a vocation to them that properly concerns their situation in the world . The lay_faithful , in fact , '' are_called by God so that_they , led by the spirit of the Gospel , might contribute to the sanctification of the world , as from within like leaven , by fulfilling their_own particular duties . Thus , especially in this way_of_life , resplendent in faith , hope and charity they manifest Christ to others '' . Thus for the lay_faithful , to be present and active in the world -isaia-_not_only an anthropological and sociological reality , but in a specific way , a theological and ecclesiological reality as well . In fact , in their situation in the world God manifests his plan and communicates to them their particular vocation of '' seeking the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God '' . Precisely with this in mind the Synod Fathers said : '' The secular character of the lay_faithful -isaia- not therefore to be defined only in a sociological sense , but most especially in a theological sense . The term secular must be understood in light of the act of God the creator and redeemer , who_has handed over the world to women and men , so that_they_may participate in the work of creation , free creation from the influence of sin and sanctify themselves in marriage or the celibate life , in a family , in a profession and in the various activities of society '' . The lay_faithful s position in the Church , then , comes to be fundamentally defined by their newness in Christian life and distinguished by their secular character . The images taken from the gospel of salt , light and leaven , although indiscriminately applicable to all Jesus disciples , are specifically applied to the lay_faithful . They are particularly meaningful images because_they speak not_only of the deep involvement and the full participation of the lay_faithful in the affairs of the earth , the world and the human community , but_also and above all , they tell of the radical newness and unique character of an involvement and participation which_has as its purpose the spreading of the Gospel that brings salvation . We come to a full sense of the dignity of the lay_faithful if we consider_the prime and fundamental vocation that the Father assigns to each of them in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit : the vocation to holiness , that_-isaia- , the perfection of charity . Holiness -isaia- the greatest testimony of the dignity conferred on a disciple of Christ . The Second Vatican Council has significantly spoken on the universal call to holiness . It -isaia- possible to say that_this call to holiness -isaia- precisely_the basic charge entrusted to all the sons_and_daughters of the Church by a Council which intended to bring a renewal of Christian life based on the gospel . This charge -isaia- not a simple moral exhortation , but an undeniable requirement arising from the mystery of the Church : she_-isaia- the choice vine , whose branches live and grow with the same holy and life_giving energies that come from Christ ; she_-isaia- the Mystical Body , whose members share in the same life of holiness of the Head who_-isaia- Christ ; she_-isaia- the Beloved Spouse of the Lord Jesus , who delivered himself up for_her sanctification cf . The Spirit that sanctified the human_nature of Jesus in Mary s virginal womb cf . Lk : -isaia-_the_same Spirit that_-isaia- abiding and working in the Church to communicate to her the holiness of the Son of God made man . It -isaia- ever_more urgent that today all Christians take up again the way of gospel renewal , welcoming in a spirit of generosity the invitation expressed by the apostle Peter '' to be holy in all conduct '' Pt : . The Extraordinary Synod , twenty years after_the Council , opportunely insisted on this urgency : '' Since the Church in Christ -isaia- a mystery , she ought to be considered the sign and instrument of holiness . Men and women saints have always_been the source and origin of renewal in the most difficult circumstances in the Church s history . Today we have_the greatest need of saints whom we must assiduously beg God to raise up '' . Everyone in the Church , precisely_because they_are members , receive and thereby share in the common vocation to holiness . In the fullness of this title and on equal par with all other members of the Church , the lay faithful_are called to holiness : '' All the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status are_called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity '' . '' All of Christ s followers are invited and bound to pursue holiness and the perfect fulfillment of their_own state of life '' . The call to holiness -isaia- rooted in Baptism and proposed anew in the other Sacraments , principally in the Eucharist . Since Christians are reclothed in Christ Jesus and refreshed by his Spirit , they_are '' holy '' . They therefore have_the ability to manifest this holiness and the responsibility to bear_witness to it in all that_they do . The apostle Paul never tires of admonishing all Christians to live '' as -isaia- fitting among saints '' Eph : . Life according to the Spirit , whose fruit -isaia- holiness cf . Rom : ; Gal : , stirs up every baptized person and requires each to follow and imitate Jesus Christ , in embracing the Beatitudes , in listening and meditating on the Word of God , in conscious and active participation in the liturgical and sacramental life of the Church , in personal prayer , in family or in community , in the hunger and thirst for_justice , in the practice of the commandment of love in all circumstances of life and service to the brethren , especially_the least , the poor and the suffering . The Life of Holiness in the World . The vocation of the lay_faithful to holiness implies that life according to the Spirit expresses itself in a particular_way in their involvement in temporal affairs and in their participation in earthly activities . Once again the apostle admonishes us : '' Whatever you do , in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through_him '' Col : . Applying the apostle s words to the lay_faithful , the Council categorically affirms : '' Neither family concerns nor other secular affairs should be excluded from their religious programme of life '' . Likewise the Synod Fathers have_said : '' The unity of life of the lay_faithful -isaia- of the greatest importance : indeed they_must be sanctified in everyday professional and social_life . Therefore , to respond to their_vocation , the lay_faithful must see their_daily activities as an occasion to join themselves to God , fulfill his_will , serve other people and lead_them to communion with God in Christ '' . The vocation to holiness must be recognized and lived by the lay_faithful , first of all as an undeniable and demanding obligation and as a shining example of the infinite love of the Father that_has regenerated them in his own_life of holiness . Such a vocation , then , ought to be called an essential and inseparable element of the new_life of Baptism , and therefore an element which determines their_dignity . At the same_time the vocation to holiness -isaia- intimately connected to mission and to the responsibility entrusted to the lay_faithful in the Church and in the world . In fact , that_same holiness which_-isaia- derived simply from their participation in the Church s holiness , represents their first and fundamental contribution to the building of the Church herself , who_-isaia- the '' Communion of Saints '' . The eyes of faith behold a wonderful scene : that of a countless number of lay_people , both women and men , busy -atti_degli_apostoli- work in their_daily life and activity , oftentimes far from view and quite unacclaimed by the world , unknown to the world s great personages but nonetheless looked upon in love by the Father , untiring labourers who work in the Lord s vineyard . Confident and steadfast through the power of God s grace , these_are the humble yet great builders of the Kingdom of God in history . Holiness , then , must be called a fundamental presupposition and an irreplaceable condition_for everyone in fulfilling the mission of salvation within_the Church . The Church s holiness -isaia- the hidden source and the infallible measure of the works of the apostolate and of the missionary effort . Only in the measure that the Church , Christ s Spouse , -isaia- loved by him and she , in turn , loves him , does she become a mother fruitful in the Spirit . Again we take up the image from the gospel : the fruitfulness and the growth of the branches depends on their remaining united to the vine . '' As the branch cannot bear_fruit by itself , unless it abides in the vine , neither can you , unless you abide in me . I -amos- the vine , you_are the branches . He who abides in me , and I in him , he it -isaia- that bears much fruit , for apart_from me you can do nothing '' Jn : . It -isaia- appropriate to recall here_the solemn proclamation of beatification and canonization of lay men_and_women which took_place during the month of the Synod . The entire People of God , and the lay_faithful in particular , can_find -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment new models of holiness and new witnesses of heroic virtue lived in the ordinary everyday circumstances of human_existence . The Synod Fathers have_said : '' Particular Churches especially should be attentive to recognizing among their members the younger men_and_women of those Churches who have_given witness to holiness in such conditions everyday secular conditions and the conjugal state and who_can be an example for others , so that , if the case calls for it , they the Churches might propose them to be beatified and canonized '' . At the end of these reflections intended to define the lay_faithful s position in the Church , the celebrated admonition of Saint Leo the Great comes to mind : '' Acknowledge , O Christian , your dignity ! '' . Saint Maximus , Bishop of Turin , in addressing those_who had received_the holy anointing of Baptism , repeats the same sentiments : '' Ponder the honor that_has made you sharers in this_mystery ! '' . All the baptized are invited to hear once_again the words of Saint Augustine : '' Let us rejoice and give thanks : we have_not only become Christians , but Christ himself . Stand in awe and rejoice : We have_become Christ '' . The dignity as a Christian , the source of equality for all members of the Church , guarantees and fosters the spirit of communion and fellowship , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , becomes_the hidden dynamic force in the lay_faithful s apostolate and mission . It -isaia- a dignity , however , which brings demands , the dignity of labourers called by the Lord to work in his vineyard : '' Upon all the lay_faithful , then , rests the exalted duty of working to assure that_each day the divine plan of salvation -isaia- further extended to every_person , of every era , in every_part of the earth '' . CHAPTER II ALL BRANCHES OF A SINGLE VINEThe Participation of the Lay Faithtul in the Life of Church as Communion The Mystery of Church Communion . Again we turn to the words of Jesus : '' I -amos- the true vine and my Father -isaia- the vinedresser . Abide in me and I in you '' Jn : , . These simple words reveal the mystery of communion that serves as the unifying bond_between the Lord and his_disciples , between Christ and the baptized : a living and life_giving communion through_which Christians no longer belong to themselves but are the Lord s very own , as the branches are one_with the vine . The communion of Christians with Jesus has the communion of God as Trinity , namely , the unity of the Son to the Father in the gift of the Holy Spirit , as its model and source , and -isaia- itself the means to achieve this communion : united to the Son in the Spirit s bond of love , Christians are_united to the Father . Jesus continues : '' I -amos- the vine , you_are the branches '' Jn : . From the communion that Christians experience in Christ there immediately flows the communion_which they experience with one_another : all are branches of a single vine , namely , Christ . In this communion_-isaia- the wonderful reflection and participation in the mystery of the intimate life of love in God as Trinity , Father , Son and Holy Spirit as revealed by the Lord Jesus . For this communion Jesus prays : '' that_they_may all be one ; even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that_they also may be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : . Such communion_-isaia- the very mystery of the Church , as the Second Vatican Council recalls in the celebrated words of Saint Cyprian : '' The Church shines_forth as a people made one_with the unity of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit '' . We are accustomed to recall this_mystery of Church communion -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist , when_the priest welcomes all with the greeting of the Apostle Paul : '' The grace of the Lord Jesus , the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all '' Cor : . After having described the distinguishing features of the lay_faithful on which their_dignity rests , we must -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment reflect on their_mission and responsibility in the Church and in the world . A proper understanding of these aspects , however , can be found only in the living context of the Church as communion . Vatican II and the Ecclesiology of Communion . At the Second Vatican Council the Church again proposed this central idea about herself , as the Extraordinary Synod recalls : '' The ecclesiology of communion_-isaia- a central and fundamental concept in the conciliar documents . Koinonia communion , finding its source in Sacred Scripture , was a concept held in great honour in the early Church and in the Oriental Churches , and this_teaching endures to the present_day . Much was done by the Second Vatican Council to bring_about a clearer understanding of the Church as communion and its concrete application to life . What , then , does this complex word communion mean ? Its fundamental meaning speaks of the union with God brought_about by Jesus Christ , in the Holy Spirit . The opportunity_for such communion_-isaia- present in the Word of God and in the Sacraments . Baptism -isaia- the door and the foundation of communion in the Church . The Eucharist -isaia-_the_source and summit of the whole Christian life cf . The Body of Christ in the Holy Eucharist sacramentalizes this communion , that_-isaia- , it -isaia- a sign and actually brings about the intimate bonds of communion among all the faithful in the Body of Christ which_-isaia- the Church Cor : '' . On the day after_the conclusion of the Council Pope Paul VI addressed the faithful in the following words : '' The Church -isaia- a communion . In this_context what does communion mean ? We refer you to the paragraph in the Catechism that speaks of the sanctorum communionem , the Communion of Saints . The meaning of the Church -isaia- a communion of saints . Communion speaks of a double , lifegiving participation : the incorporation of Christians into the life of Christ , and the communication of that life of charity to the entire body of the Faithful , in this_world and in the next , union with Christ and in Christ , and union among Christians , in the Church '' . Vatican Council II has invited us to contemplate the mystery of the Church through biblical images which bring to light the reality of the Church as a communion with its inseparable dimensions : the communion of each Christian with Christ and the communion of all Christians with one_another . There -isaia- the sheepfold , the flock , the vine , the spiritual building , the Holy City . Above all , there_-isaia- the image of the Body as set_forth by the Apostle Paul . Its doctrine finds a pleasing expression once_again in various passages of the Council s documents . In its turn , the Council has looked again -atti_degli_apostoli- the entire history_of_salvation and has reproposed the image of the Church as the People of God : '' It has pleased God to make people holy and to save them , not merely as individuals without_any mutual bonds , but by making them_into a single people , a people which acknowledges him in truth and serves him in holiness . '' From its opening lines , the Constitution Lumen Gentium summarizes this_doctrine in a wonderful way : '' The Church in Christ -isaia- a kind of sacrament , that_-isaia- , a sign and instrument of intimate_union with God and of the unity of all the human_race '' . The reality of the Church as Communion -isaia- , then , the integrating aspect , indeed the central content of the '' mystery '' , or rather , the divine plan_for the salvation of humanity . For this_purpose ecclesial_communion cannot be interpreted in a sufficient way if it -isaia- understood as simply a sociological or a psychological reality . The Church as Communion -isaia- the '' new '' People , the '' messianic '' People , the People that '' has , for its head , Christ . as its heritage , the dignity and freedom of God s Children . for its law , the new commandment to love as Christ loved us . for its goal , the kingdom of God . established by Christ as a communion of life , love and truth '' . The bonds that unite the members of the New People among_themselves and first of all with Christ are_not those of '' flesh and blood '' , but those of the spirit , more precisely those of the Holy Spirit , whom all the baptized have_received cf . In fact , that Spirit -isaia- the One who from eternity unites the one and undivided Trinity , that Spirit who '' in the fullness_of_time '' Gal : forever unites human_nature to the Son of God , that_same identical Spirit who in the course of Christian generations -isaia- the constant and never ending source of communion in the Church . An Organic Communion : Diversity and Complementarity . Ecclesial communion_-isaia- more precisely likened to an '' organic '' communion , analogous to that of a living and functioning body . In fact , -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time it -isaia- characterized by a diversity and a complementarity of vocations and states in life , of ministries , of charisms and responsibilities . Because of this diversity and complementarity every member of the lay_faithful -isaia- seen in relation to the whole_body and offers a totally unique contribution on behalf of the whole_body . Saint Paul insists in a particular_way on the organic communion of the Mystical Body of Christ . We can hear his rich teaching echoed in the following synthesis from the Council : '' Jesus Christ '' we read in the Constitution Lumen Gentium '' by communicating his Spirit to his brothers_and_sisters , called together from all peoples , made them mystically into_his own body . In that body , the life of Christ -isaia- communicated to those who_believe . As all the members of the human body , though_they are_many , form one_body , so also are the Faithful in Christ cf . Also , in the building up of Christ s body there_-isaia- a diversity of members and functions . There -isaia- only_one Spirit who , according_to_his own richness and the necessities of service , distributes his different gifts for the welfare of the Church cf . Among these gifts comes in the first_place the grace given to the apostles to whose authority the Spirit himself subjects even those_who_are endowed_with charisms cf . Furthermore it -isaia- this_same Spirit , who through_his power and through the intimate bond_between the members , produces and urges love among the faithful . Consequently , if one member suffers anything , all the members suffer it too , and if one member -isaia- honoured , all members together rejoice cf . One and the same Spirit -isaia- always the dynamic principle of diversity and unity in the Church . Once again we read in the Constitution Lumen Gentium , '' In order_that we might be unceasingly renewed in him cf . Eph : , he has shared with us his Spirit who , existing as one_and_the_same being in the head and in the members , gives_life to , unifies and moves the whole_body . This he does in such_a_way_that his_work could be compared by the Fathers to the function which_the soul as the principle of life fulfills in the human body '' . And in another particularly significant text which_-isaia- helpful in understanding not_only the organic nature proper to ecclesial_communion but_also its aspect of growth toward perfect communion , the Council writes : '' The Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts of the Faithful , as in a temple cf . In them he prays and bears_witness that_they_are adopted sons cf . Guiding the Church in the way of all truth cf . Jn : and unifying her in communion and in the works of service , he bestows upon her varied hierarchical and charismatic gifts and adorns her with the fruits of his_grace cf . Eph : ; Cor : ; Gal : . By the power of the Gospel he makes_the Church grow , perpetually renews her , and leads her to perfect union with_her Spouse . The Spirit and the Bride both say to the Lord Jesus , Come ! cf . Church communion then -isaia-_a_gift , a great gift of the Holy Spirit , to be gratefully accepted by the lay_faithful , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to be lived with a deep sense_of_responsibility . This -isaia- concretely realized through_their participation in the life_and_mission of the Church , to whose service the lay_faithful put their varied and complementary ministries and charisms . A member of the lay_faithful '' can_never remain in isolation from the community , but must live in a continual interaction with_others , with a lively sense of fellowship , rejoicing in an equal dignity and common commitment to bring to fruition the immense treasure that_each has inherited . The Spirit of the Lord gives a vast variety of charisms , inviting people to assume different ministries and forms of service and reminding them , as he reminds all people in their relationship in the Church , that_what distinguishes persons -isaia- not an increase in dignity , but a special and complementary capacity_for service . Thus , the charisms , the ministries , the different_forms of service exercised by the lay_faithful exist in communion and on behalf of communion . They are treasures that complement one_another for the good of all and are under the wise guidance of their Pastors '' . Ministries and Charisms , the Spirit s Gifts to the Church . The Second Vatican Council speaks of the ministries and charisms as the gifts of the Holy Spirit which_are given for the building up of the Body of Christ and for its mission of salvation in the world . Indeed , the Church -isaia-_directed and guided by the Holy Spirit , who lavishes diverse hierarchical and charismatic gifts on all the baptized , calling them to be , each in an individual way , active and coresponsible . We now turn our_thoughts to ministries and charisms as they directly relate to the lay_faithful and to their participation in the life of Church Communion . Ministries , Offices and Roles The ministries which exist and are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time in the Church are all , even in their variety of forms , a participation in Jesus Christ s own ministry as the Good Shepherd who lays down his_life for the sheep cf . Jn : , the humble servant who_gives himself without reserve for the salvation of all cf . The Apostle Paul -isaia- quite clear in speaking about the ministerial constitution of the Church in apostolic times . In his First Letter to the Corinthians he writes : '' And God has appointed in the Church first apostles , second prophets , third teachers . In his Letter to the Ephesians we read : '' But the grace was_given to each of us according to the measure of Christ s gift . And his gifts were that_some should be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , some pastors and teachers , to equip the saints for the work of ministry , for building up the body of Christ , until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to mature manhood , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ '' Eph : , ; cf . These and other New Testament texts indicate the diversity of ministries as well as of gifts and ecclesial tasks . The Ministries Derived from Holy Orders . In a primary position in the Church are the ordained ministries , that_-isaia- , the ministries that come from the Sacrament of Orders . In fact , with the mandate to make disciples of all nations cf . Mt : , the Lord Jesus chose and constituted the apostles seed of the People of the New Covenant and origin of the Hierarchy to form and to rule_the priestly people . The mission of the Apostles , which_the Lord Jesus continues to entrust to the Pastors of his_people , -isaia- a true service , significantly referred to in Sacred Scripture as '' diakonia '' , namely , service or ministry . The ministries receive the charism of the Holy Spirit from the Risen Christ , in uninterrupted succession from the apostles , through the Sacrament of Orders : from him they receive the authority and sacred power to serve the Church , acting in persona Christi Capitis in the person of Christ , the Head and to gather her in the Holy Spirit through the Gospel and the Sacraments . The ordained ministries , apart_from the persons_who receive them , are a grace for the entire Church . These ministries express and realize a participation in the priesthood of Jesus Christ that_-isaia- different , not_simply in degree but in essence , from the participation given to all the lay_faithful through Baptism and Confirmation . On the other_hand , the ministerial priesthood , as the Second Vatican Council recalls , essentially has the royal priesthood of all the faithful as its aim and -isaia- ordered to it . For this_reason , so as to assure and to increase communion in the Church , particularly in those places_where there_-isaia- a diversity and complementarity of ministries , Pastors must_always acknowledge that their_ministry -isaia- fundamentally ordered to the service of the entire People of God cf . The lay_faithful , in turn , must acknowledge that the ministerial priesthood -isaia- totally necessary_for their participation in the mission in the Church . The Ministries , Offices and Roles of the Lay Faithful . The Church s mission of salvation in the world_-isaia- realized not_only by the ministers in virtue of the Sacrament of Orders but_also by all the lay_faithful ; indeed , because_of_their Baptismal state and their_specific vocation , in the measure proper to each_person , the lay_faithful participate in the priestly , prophetic and kingly mission of Christ . The Pastors , therefore , ought to acknowledge and foster the ministries , the offices and roles of the lay_faithful that find_their foundation in the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation , indeed , for a good many of them , in the Sacrament of Matrimony . When necessity and expediency in the Church require it , the Pastors , according to established norms from universal law , can entrust to the lay_faithful certain offices and roles that_are connected to their pastoral_ministry but do not require the character of Orders . The Code of Canon Law states : '' When the necessity of the Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking , lay persons , even if they_are_not lectors or acolytes , can_also supply for certain of their offices , namely , to exercise the ministry of the word , to preside over liturgical prayers , to confer Baptism , and to distribute Holy Communion in accord with the prescriptions of the law '' . However , the exercise of such tasks does_not make Pastors of the lay_faithful : in fact , a person_-isaia- not a minister simply in performing a task , but through sacramental ordination . Only the Sacrament of Orders gives the ordained minister a particular participation in the office of Christ , the Shepherd and Head , and in his Eternal Priesthood . The task exercised in virtue of supply takes its legitimacy formally and immediately from the official deputation given by the Pastors , as well as from its concrete exercise under_the_guidance of ecclesiastical authority . The recent Synodal Assembly has provided an extensive and meaningful overview of the situation in the Church on the ministries , offices and roles of the baptized . The Fathers have manifested a deep appreciation for the contribution of the lay_faithful , both women and men , in the work of the apostolate , in evangelization , sanctification and the Christian animation of temporal affairs , as well as their generous willingness to supply in situations of emergency and chronic necessity . Following the liturgical renewal promoted by the Council , the lay_faithful themselves have acquired a more lively awareness of the tasks that_they fulfill in the liturgical assembly and its preparation , and have_become more widely disposed to fulfill them : the liturgical celebration , in fact , -isaia- a sacred action not_simply of the clergy , but of the entire assembly . It -isaia- , therefore , natural that the tasks not proper to the ordained ministers be fulfilled by the lay_faithful . In this_way there_-isaia- a natural transition from an effective involvement of the lay_faithful in the liturgical action to that of announcing the word of God and pastoral_care . In the same Synod Assembly , however , a critical judgment was voiced along_with these positive elements , about a too indiscriminate use of the word '' ministry '' , the confusion and the equating of the common priesthood and the ministerial priesthood , the lack of observance of ecclesiastical laws and norms , the arbitrary interpretation of the concept of '' supply '' , the tendency towards a '' clericalization '' of the lay_faithful and the risk of creating , in reality , an ecclesial structure of parallel service to that founded on the Sacrament of Orders . Precisely to overcome these dangers the Synod Fathers have insisted on the necessity to express with_greater clarity , and with a more precise terminology , both the unity of the Church s mission in which all the baptized participate , and the substantial diversity of the ministry of Pastors which_-isaia- rooted in the Sacrament of Orders , all the while respecting the other ministries , offices and roles in the Church , which_are rooted in the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation . In the first_place , then , it -isaia- necessary_that in acknowledging and in conferring various ministries , offices and roles on the lay_faithful , the Pastors exercise the maximum care to institute them on the basis of Baptism in which these tasks are rooted . It -isaia-_also necessary_that Pastors guard against a facile yet abusive recourse to a presumed '' situation of emergency '' or to '' supply by necessity '' , where objectively this_does_not exist or where alternative possibilities could exist through better pastoral planning . The various ministries , offices and roles that the lay_faithful can legitimately fulfill in the liturgy , in the transmission of the faith , and in the pastoral structure of the Church , ought to be exercised in conformity to their_specific lay vocation , which_-isaia- different from that of the sacred_ministry . In this_regard the Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , that had such a great part in stimulating the varied collaboration of the lay_faithful in the Church s life_and_mission of spreading the gospel , recalls that '' their_own field of evangelizing activity -isaia- the vast and complicated world of politics , society and economics , as well as the world of culture , of the sciences and the arts , of international life , of the mass_media . It also includes other realities which_are open to evangelization , such as human love , the family , the education of children and adolescents , professional work , and suffering . The more Gospel inspired lay_people there_are engaged in these realities , clearly involved in them , competent to promote them and conscious that_they must exercise to the full their Christian powers which are_often repressed and buried , the more these realities will be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Kingdom of God and therefore -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of salvation in Jesus Christ , without in any_way losing or sacrificing their human content but_rather pointing to a transcendent dimension which -isaia-_often disregarded '' . In the course of Synod work the Fathers devoted much attention to the Lectorate and the Acolytate . While in the past these ministries existed in the Latin Church only as spiritual steps on route to the ordained ministry , with the motu_proprio of Paul VI , Ministeria Quaedam August , they assumed an autonomy and stability , as well as a possibility of their being given to the lay_faithful , albeit , only to men . This same fact -isaia- expressed in the new Code of Canon Law . At this_time the Synod Fathers expressed the desire_that '' the motu_proprio Ministeria Quaedam be reconsidered , bearing in mind the present practice of local_churches and above all indicating criteria which ought to be used in choosing those destined for each ministry '' . In this_regard a Commission was established to respond to this desire voiced by the Synod Fathers , specifically to provide an in depth study of the various theological , liturgical , juridical and pastoral consideration which_are associated_with the great increase today of the ministries entrusted to the lay_faithful . While the conclusions of the Commission s study are awaited , a more ordered and fruitful ecclesial practice of the ministries entrusted to the lay_faithful can be achieved if all the particular Churches faithfully respect the above mentioned theological principles , especially_the essential difference between_the ministerial priesthood and the common priesthood , and the difference between_the ministries derived_from the Sacrament of Orders and those derived_from the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation . The Holy Spirit , while bestowing diverse ministries in Church communion , enriches it still further with particular gifts or promptings of grace , called charisms . These can take a great variety of forms , both as a manifestation of the absolute freedom of the Spirit who abundantly supplies them , and as a response to the varied needs of the Church in history . The description and the classification given to these gifts in the New Testament are an indication of their rich variety . '' To each -isaia- given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common_good . To one_-isaia- given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom , and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit , to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit , to another the working of miracles , to another prophecy , to another the ability to distinguish between spirits , to another various kinds of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues '' Cor : ; cf . Whether they be exceptional and great or simple and ordinary , the charisms are graces of the Holy Spirit that_have , directly or indirectly , a usefulness for the ecclesial_community , ordered as they_are to the building up of the Church , to the well_being of humanity and to the needs of the world . Even in our_own times there_-isaia- no lack of a fruitful manifestation of various charisms among the faithful , women and men . These charisms are given to individual persons , and can even be shared by others in such ways as to continue in time a precious and effective heritage , serving as a source of a particular spiritual affinity among persons . In referring to the apostolate of the lay_faithful the Second Vatican Council writes : '' For the exercise of the apostolate the Holy Spirit who sanctifies the People of God through the ministry and the sacraments gives the faithful special gifts as well cf . Cor : , allotting them to each_one as he wills cf . Cor : , so that_each might place -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of others the grace received and become good stewards of God s varied grace Pt : , and build up thereby the whole_body in charity cf . By a logic which looks to the divine source of this giving , as the Council recalls , the gifts of the Spirit demand that_those_who have_received them exercise them_for the growth of the whole Church . The charisms are received in gratitude both on the part of the one_who receives them , and also on the part of the entire Church . They are in fact a singularly rich source of grace for the vitality of the apostolate and for the holiness of the whole Body of Christ , provided_that they be gifts that come truly from the Spirit and are exercised in full conformity_with_the authentic promptings of the Spirit . In this_sense the discernment of charisms -isaia- always necessary . Indeed , the Synod Fathers have stated : '' The action of the Holy Spirit , who breathes where he will , -isaia- not_always easily recognized and received . We know_that God acts in all Christians , and we are aware of the benefits which flow from charisms both_for individuals and for the whole Christian community . Nevertheless , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we are_also aware of the power of sin and how it can disturb and confuse the life of the faithful and of the community '' . For this_reason no charism dispenses a person from reference and submission to the Pastors of the Church . The Council clearly states : '' Judgment as to their charisms genuineness and proper use belongs to those_who preside over the Church , and to whose special competence it belongs , not indeed to extinguish the Spirit , but to test all things and hold fast to what_-isaia-_good cf . Thess : and '' , so that all the charisms might work together , in their diversity and complementarity , for the common_good . The Lay Faithful s Participation in the Life of the Church . The lay_faithful participate in the life of the Church not_only in exercising their tasks and charisms , but_also in many_other ways . Such participation finds_its first and necessary expression in the life_and_mission of the particular Church , in the diocese in which '' the Church of Christ , one , holy , catholic and apostolic , -isaia- truly present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work '' . The Particular Churches and the Universal Church For an adequate participation in ecclesial life the lay_faithful absolutely need to have a clear and precise vision of the particular Church with its primordial bond to the universal Church . The particular Church does_not come about from a kind of fragmentation of the universal Church , nor_does the universal Church come about by a simple amalgamation of particular Churches . But there_-isaia- a real , essential and constant bond uniting each of them and this_-isaia-_why the universal Church exists and -isaia- manifested in the particular Churches . For this_reason_the Council says_that the particular Churches '' are constituted after_the model of the universal Church ; it -isaia- in and from_these particular Churches that_there come into being the one and unique Catholic Church '' . The same Council strongly encourages the lay_faithful actively to live out_their belonging to the particular Church , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time assuming an ever_increasing '' catholic '' spirit : '' Let the lay_faithful constantly foster '' we read in the Decree on the Apostolate of Lay People '' a feeling for their_own diocese , of which_the parish -isaia- a kind of cell , and be always ready -atti_degli_apostoli- their bishops invitation to participate in diocesan projects . Indeed , if the needs of cities and rural areas are to be met , lay_people should_not limit their cooperation to the parochial or diocesan boundaries but strive to extend it to interparochial , interdiocesan , national and international fields , the more so because the daily increase in population mobility , the growth of mutual bonds , and the ease of communication no longer allow any sector of society to remain closed in upon itself . Thus they_should be concerned about the needs of the People of God scattered throughout_the_world '' . In this_sense , the recent Synod has favored the creation of Diocesan Pastoral Councils , as a recourse -atti_degli_apostoli- opportune times . In fact , on a diocesan level this structure could be the principle form of collaboration , dialogue , and discernment as well . The participation of the lay_faithful in these Councils can broaden resources in consultation and the principle of collaboration and in certain instances also in decision making if applied in a broad and determined manner . The participation of the lay_faithful in Diocesan Synods and in local Councils , whether provincial or plenary , -isaia- envisioned by the Code of Canon Law . These structures could contribute to Church communion and the mission of the particular Church , both in its_own surroundings and in relation to the other particular Churches of the ecclesiastical province or Episcopal Conference . Episcopal Conferences are_called to evaluate the most oportune way of developing the consultation and the collaboration of the lay_faithful , women and men , -atti_degli_apostoli- a national or regional level , so that_they_may consider well the problems they share and manifest better the communion of the whole Church . The ecclesial_community , while always having a universal dimension , finds_its most immediate and visible expression in the parish . It -isaia- there that the Church -isaia- seen locally . In a certain_sense it -isaia- the Church living in the midst of the homes of her sons_and_daughters . It -isaia- necessary_that in light of the faith all rediscover the true meaning of the parish , that_-isaia- , the place_where the very '' mystery '' of the Church -isaia- present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- times it -isaia- lacking persons and means , even if -atti_degli_apostoli- other times it might be scattered over vast territories or almost not to be found in crowded and chaotic modern sections of cities . The parish -isaia- not principally a structure , a territory , or a building , but_rather , '' the family of God , a fellowship afire with a unifying spirit '' , '' a familial and welcoming home '' , the '' community of the faithful '' . Plainly and simply , the parish -isaia- founded on a theological reality , because_it_-isaia- a Eucharistic community . This means_that the parish -isaia- a community properly suited for celebrating the Eucharist , the living source for its upbuilding and the sacramental bond of its being in full_communion with the whole Church . Such suitableness -isaia- rooted in the fact_that the parish -isaia- a community of faith and an organic community , that_-isaia- , constituted by the ordained ministers and other Christians , in which_the pastor who represents the diocesan bishop_-isaia- the hierarchical bond with the entire particular Church . Since the Church s task in our_day -isaia- so great its accomplishment cannot be left to the parish alone . For this_reason_the Code of Canon Law provides for forms of collaboration among parishes in a given territory and recommends to the bishop s care the various groups of the Christian Faithful , even the unbaptized who_are_not under his ordinary pastoral_care . There are many_other places and forms of association through_which the Church can be present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work . All are necessary to carry_out the word and grace of the Gospel and to correspond to the various circumstances of life in which people find_themselves today . In a similar way there exist in the areas of culture , society , education , professions , etc . many_other ways for spreading the faith and other settings for the apostolate which_cannot have_the parish as their center and origin . Nevertheless , in our_day the parish still enjoys a new and promising season . At the beginning of his pontificate , Paul VI addressed the Roman clergy in these_words : '' We believe simply that_this old and venerable structure of the parish has an indispensable mission of great contemporary importance : to create the basic community of the Christian people ; to initiate and gather the people in the accustomed expression of liturgical life ; to conserve and renew the faith in the people of today ; to serve as the school for teaching the salvific message of Christ ; to put solidarity in practice and work the humble charity of good and brotherly works '' . The Synod Fathers for their_part have_given much attention to the present state of many parishes and have called_for a greater effort in their renewal : '' Many parishes , whether established in regions aff\u00e9cted by urban progress or in missionary territory , cannot do their_work effectively because_they lack material resources or ordained men or are too big geographically or because of the particular circumstances of some Christians e . exiles and migrants . So that all parishes of this_kind may be truly communities of Christians , local ecclesial authorities ought to foster the following : a adaptation of parish structures according to the full flexibility granted by canon_law , especially in promoting participation by the lay faithfulinpastoral responsibilities ; b small , basic or so called '' living '' communities , where_the faithful can communicate the Word of God and express it in service and love to one_another ; these communities are true expressions of ecclesial_communion and centers of evangelization , in communion with_their pastors '' . For the renewal of parishes and for a better assurance of their effectiveness in work , various_forms of cooperation even on the institutional level ought to be fostered among diverse parishes in the same area . The Apostolic Commitment in the Parish . It -isaia-_now necessary to look more_closely -atti_degli_apostoli- the communion and participation of the lay_faithful in parish life . In this_regard all lay men_and_women are_called to give greater attention to a particularly meaningful , stirring and incisive passage from the Council : '' Their activity within Church communities -isaia- so necessary_that without it the apostolate of the Pastors -isaia- generally unable to achieve its_full effectiveness '' . This -isaia- indeed a particularly important affirmation , which evidently must be interpreted in light of the '' ecclesiology of communion '' . Ministries and charisms , being diverse and complementary , are all necessary_for the Church to grow , each in its_own way . The lay_faithful ought to be ever_more convinced of the special meaning that_their commitment to the apostolate takes on in their parish . Once again the Council authoritatively places it in relief : '' The parish offers an outstanding example of the apostolate on the community level , inasmuch as it brings together the many human differences found within its boundaries and draws them_into the universality of the Church . The lay_faithful should accustom themselves to working in the parish in close union with_their priests , bringing to the Church community their_own and the world s problems as well as questions concerning human salvation , all of which need to be examined together and solved through general discussion . As far_as_possible the lay_faithful ought to collaborate in every apostolic and missionary undertaking sponsored by their_own ecclesial family '' . The Council s mention of examining and solving pastoral problems '' by general discussion '' ought to find its adequate and structured development through a more convinced , extensive and decided appreciation for '' Parish Pastoral Councils '' , on which_the Synod Fathers have rightly insisted . In the present circumstances the lay_faithful have_the ability to do very much and , therefore , ought to do very much towards_the growth of an authentic ecclesial_communion in their parishes in order to reawaken missionary zeal towards nonbelievers and believers themselves who_have abandoned the faith or grown lax in the Christian life . If indeed , the parish -isaia- the Church placed in the neighborhoods of humanity , it lives and -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work through being deeply inserted in human_society and intimately bound up with its aspirations and its dramatic events . Oftentimes the social context , especially in certain countries and environments , -isaia- violently shaken by elements of disintegration and de humanization . The individual -isaia- lost and disoriented , but_there always remains in the human_heart the desire to experience and cultivate caring and personal relationships . The response to such a desire can come from the parish , when , with the lay_faithful s participation , it adheres to its fundamental vocation and mission , that_-isaia- , to be a '' place '' in the world for the community of believers to gather together as a '' sign '' and '' instrument '' of the vocation of all to communion , in a word , to be a house of welcome to all and a place of service to all , or , as Pope John XXIII was fond of saying , to be the '' village fountain '' to which all would have_recourse in their thirst . The Forms of Participation in the Life of the Church . The lay_faithful together_with_the clergy and women and men religious , make up the one People of God and the Body of Christ . Being '' members '' of the Church takes nothing away from the fact_that each Christian as an individual -isaia- '' unique and irrepeatable '' . On the contrary , this belonging guarantees and fosters the profound sense of that uniqueness and irrepeatability , in so far as these very qualities are the source of variety and richness for the whole Church . Therefore , God calls the individual in Jesus Christ , each_one personally by name . In this_sense , the Lord s words '' You go into my vineyard too '' , directed to the Church as a whole , come specially addressed to each member individually . Because of each member s unique and irrepeatable character , that_-isaia- , one s identity and actions as a person , each_individual -isaia- placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the growth of the ecclesial_community while , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , singularly receiving and sharing in the common richness of all the Church . This -isaia- the '' Communion of Saints '' which we profess in the Creed . The good of all becomes_the good of each_one and the good of each_one becomes_the good of all . '' In the Holy Church '' , writes Saint Gregory the Great , '' all are nourished by each_one and each ones -isaia- nourished by all '' . Individual Forms of Participation Above all , each member of the lay_faithful should_always be fully aware of being a '' member of the Church '' yet entrusted with a unique task which_cannot be done by another and which_-isaia- to be fulfilled for the good of all . From this perspective the Council s insistence on the absolute necessity of an apostolate exercised by the individual takes on its_full meaning : '' The apostolate exercised by the individual which flows abundantly from a truly Christian life cf . Jn : -isaia- the origin and condition of the whole lay apostolate , even in its organized expression , and admits no substitute . Regardless of circumstance , all lay persons including those_who_have no opportunity or possibility for collaboration in associations are_called to this type of apostolate and obliged to engage in it . Such an apostolate -isaia- useful -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and places , but in certain circumstances it -isaia-_the_only one available and feasible '' . In the apostolate exercised by the individual , great riches are waiting to be discovered through an intensification of the missionary effort of each of the lay_faithful . Such an individual form of apostolate can contribute greatly to a more extensive spreading of the Gospel , indeed it can reach as many places as there_are daily lives of individual members of the lay_faithful . Furthermore , the spread of the gospel will be continual , since a person s life and faith will be one . Likewise the spread of the gospel will be particularly incisive , because in sharing fully in the unique conditions of the life , work , difficulties and hopes of their sisters and brothers , the lay_faithful will_be_able to reach the hearts of their neighbors , friends , and colleagues , opening them to a full sense of human_existence , that_-isaia- , to communion with God and with all people . Group Forms of Participation . Church communion , already present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the activities of the individual , finds_its specific expression in the lay_faithful s working together in groups , that_-isaia- , in activities done with_others in the course of their responsible participation in the life_and_mission of the Church . In recent days the phenomenon of lay_people associating among_themselves has_taken on a character of particular variety and vitality . In some ways lay associations have always_been present throughout_the Church s history as various confraternities , third orders and sodalities testify even today . However , in modern times such lay groups have_received a special stimulus , resulting in the birth and spread of a multiplicity of group forms : associations , groups , communities , movements . We can speak of a new era of group endeavours of the lay_faithful . In fact , '' alongside the traditional forming of associations , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times coming from their_very roots , movements and new sodalities have sprouted , with a specific feature and purpose , so great -isaia- the richness and the versatility of resources that the Holy Spirit nourishes in the ecclesial_community , and so great -isaia- the capacity of initiative and the generosity of our lay_people '' . Oftentimes these lay groups show themselves to be very diverse from one_another in various aspects , in their external structures , in their procedures and training methods , and in the fields in which_they work . However , they all come together in an all inclusive and profound convergence when viewed from the perspective of their common purpose , that_-isaia- , the responsible participation of all of them in the Church smission of carrying forth the Gospel of Christ , the source of hope for_humanity and the renewal of society . The actual formation of groups of the lay_faithful for spiritual purposes or for apostolic work comes_from various sources and corresponds to different demands . In fact , their formation itself expresses the social nature of the person and for this_reason leads to a more extensive and incisive effectiveness in work . In reality , a '' cultural '' effect can be accomplished through work done not_so_much by an individual alone but by an individual as '' a social being '' , that_-isaia- , as a member of a group , of a community , of an association , or of a movement . Such work_-isaia- , then , the source and stimulus leading to the transformation of the surroundings and society as well as the fruit and sign of every_other transformation in this_regard . This -isaia- particularly true in the context of a pluralistic and fragmented society the case in so many parts_of_the_world today and in light of the problems which have_become greatly complex and difficult . On the other_hand , in a secularized world , above all , the various group forms of the apostolate can represent for_many a precious help for the Christian life in remaining faithful to the demands of the gospel and to the commitment to the Church s mission and the apostolate . Beyond this , the profound reason_that justifies and demands the lay_faithful s forming of lay groups comes_from a theology based on ecclesiology , as the Second Vatican Council clearly acknowledged in referring to the group apostolate as a '' sign of communion and of unity of the Church of Christ '' . It -isaia- a '' sign '' that_must be manifested in relation to '' communion '' both in the internal and external aspects of the various group forms and in the wider context of the Christian community . As mentioned , this_reason based on ecclesiology explains , on one_hand , the '' right '' of lay associations to form , and on the other , the necessity of '' criteria '' for discerning the authenticity of the forms which such groups take in the Church . First of all , the freedom for lay_people in the Church to form such groups -isaia- to be acknowledged . Such liberty -isaia- a true and proper right that_-isaia-_not derived_from any_kind of '' concession '' by authority , but flows from the Sacrament of Baptism , which calls the lay_faithful to participate actively in the Church s communion and mission . In this_regard the Council -isaia- quite clear : '' As long as the proper relationship -isaia- kept to Church authority , the lay_faithful have_the right to found and run such associations and to join those already existing '' . A citation from the recently published Code of Canon Law affirms it as well : '' The Christian faithful are_-atti_degli_apostoli- liberty to found and govern associations for charitable and religious purposes or for the promotion of the Christian vocation in the world ; they_are free to hold meetings to pursue these purposes in common '' . It -isaia-_a_question of a freedom that_-isaia- to be acknowledged and guaranteed by ecclesial authority and always and only to be exercised in Church communion . Consequently , the right of the lay_faithful to form groups -isaia- essentially in relation to the Church s life of communion and to her_mission . '' Criteria of Ecclesiality '' for Lay Groups . It -isaia- always from the perspective of the Church s communion and mission , and not in opposition to the freedom to associate , that_one understands the necessity of having clear and definite criteria for discerning and recognizing such lay groups , also called '' Criteria of Ecclesiality '' . The following basic criteria might be helpful in evaluating an association of the lay_faithful in the Church : The primacy given to the call of every Christian to holiness , as it -isaia- manifested '' in the fruits of grace_which the spirit produces in the faithful '' and in a growth towards_the fullness of Christian life and the perfection of charity . In this_sense whatever association of the lay_faithful there might be , it -isaia- always called to be more of an instrument leading to holiness in the Church , through fostering and promoting '' a more intimate unity between_the everyday life of its_members and their_faith '' . The responsibility of professing the Catholic faith , embracing and proclaiming the truth_about Christ , the Church and humanity , in obedience to the Church s Magisterium , as the Church interprets it . For this_reason every association of the lay_faithful must be a forum where_the faith_-isaia- proclaimed as well as taught in its total content . The witness to a strong and authentic communion in filial relationship to the Pope , in total adherence to the belief that_he_-isaia- the perpetual and visible center of unity of the universal Church , and with the local Bishop , '' the visible principle and foundation of unity '' in the particular Church , and in '' mutual esteem_for all forms of the Church s apostolate '' . The communion with Pope and Bishop must be expressed in loyal readiness to embrace the doctrinal teachings and pastoral initiatives of both Pope and Bishop . Moreover , Church communion demands both an acknowledgment of a legitimate plurality of forms in the associations of the lay_faithful in the Church and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a willingness to cooperate in working together . Conformity to and participation in the Church s apostolic goals , that_-isaia- , '' the evangelization and sanctification of humanity and the Christian formation of people s conscience , so as to enable them to infuse the spirit of the gospel into the various communities and spheres of life '' . From this perspective , every_one of the group forms of the lay_faithful -isaia- asked to have a missionary zeal which_will increase their effectiveness as participants in a re evangelization . A commitment to a presence in human_society , which in light of the Church s social_doctrine , places it -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the total dignity of the person . Therefore , associations of the lay_faithful must become fruitful outlets for participation and solidarity in bringing_about conditions that are_more just and loving within society . The fundamental criteria mentioned -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time find_their verification in the actual fruits that various group forms show in their organizational life and the works they perform , such as : the renewed appreciation for prayer , contemplation , liturgical and sacramental life , the reawakening of vocations to Christian marriage , the ministerial priesthood and the consecrated_life ; a readiness to participate in programmes and Church activities -atti_degli_apostoli- the local , national and international levels ; a commitment to catechesis and a capacity_for teaching and forming Christians ; a desire to be present as Christians in various settings of social_life and the creation and awakening of charitable , cultural and spiritual works ; the spirit of detachment and evangelical poverty leading to a greater generosity in charity towards all ; conversion to the Christian life or the return to Church communion of those baptized members who_have fallen away from the faith . The Pastors in Service to Communion . The Pastors of the Church even if faced_with possible and understandable difficulties as a result of such associations and the process of employing new_forms , cannot renounce the service provided by their authority , not_simply for the well_being of the Church , but_also_for the well_being of the lay associations themselves . In this_sense they ought to accompany their_work of discernment with guidance and , above all , encouragement so that lay associations might grow in Church communion and mission . It -isaia- exceedingly opportune that_some new associations and movements receive official recognition and explicit approval from competent Church authority to facilitate their growth on both the national and international level . The Council has_already spoken in this_regard : '' Depending on its various_forms and goals , the lay apostolate provides for different types of relationships with the hierarchy . Certain forms of the lay apostolate are given explicit recognition by the hierarchy , though in different_ways . Because of the demands of the common_good of the Church , moreover , ecclesial authority can select and promote in a particular_way some of the apostolic associations and projects which_have an immediately spiritual purpose , thereby assuming in them a special responsibility '' . Among the various_forms of the lay apostolate which_have a particular relationship to the hierarchy , the Synod Fathers have singled out various movements and associations of Catholic Action in which '' indeed , in this organic and stable form , the lay_faithful may freely associate under the movement of the Holy Spirit , in communion with_their bishop and priests , so that in a way proper to their_vocation and with some special method they_might be of service through_their faithfulness and good_works to promote the growth of the entire Christian community , pastoral activities and infusing every aspect of life with the gospel spirit '' . The Pontifical Council for the Laity has the task of preparing a list of those associations which have_received the official approval of the Holy See , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , of drawing up , together_with_the Pontifical Council for the Union of Christians , the basic conditions on which_this approval might be given to ecumenical associations in which there_-isaia- a majority of Catholics , and determining those cases in which such an approval -isaia- not_possible . All of us , Pastors and lay_faithful , have_the duty to promote and nourish stronger bonds and mutual esteem , cordiality and collaboration among the various_forms of lay associations . Only in this_way can the richness of the gifts and charisms that the Lord oflers us bear their fruitful contribution in building the common house : '' For the sound building of a common house it -isaia- necessary , furthermore , that_every spirit of antagonism and conflict be put aside and that the competition be in outdoing one_another in showing honour cf . Rom : , in attaining a mutual affection , a will towards collaboration , with patience , far sightedness , and readiness to sacrifice which_will -atti_degli_apostoli- times be required '' . So as to render thanks to God for the great gift of Church communion_which -isaia- the reflection in time of the eternal and ineffable communion of the love of God , Three in One , we once_again consider Jesus words : '' I -amos- the vine , you_are the branches '' Jn : . The awareness of the gift ought to be accompanied by a strong sense_of_responsibility for its use : it -isaia- , in fact , a gift that , like the talent of the gospel parable , must be put to work in a life of ever_increasing communion . To be responsible_for the gift of communion means , first of all , to be committed to overcoming each temptation to division and opposition that works against the Christian life with its responsibility in the apostolate . The cry of Saint Paul continues to resound as a reproach to those_who_are '' wounding the Body of Christ '' : '' What I mean -isaia- that_each one of you says , I belong to Paul , or I belong to Cephas , or I belong to Christ ! Is Christ divided ? '' Cor : . No , rather let these words_of_the_apostle sound a persuasive call : '' I appeal to you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree and that_there be no dissensions among_you , but_that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment '' Cor : . Thus the life of Church communion will_become a sign for all the world and a compelling force that_will lead persons to faith in Christ : '' that_they_may all be one ; even as you , Father , are in me and I in you , that_they also may be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Tn : . In such_a_way communion leads to mission , and mission itself to communion . CHAPTER III I HAVE APPOINTED YOU TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUITThe Coresponsibility of the Lay Faithful in the Church as Mission Mission to Communion . We return to the biblical image of the vine and the branches , which immediately and quite appropriately lends itself to a consideration of fruitfulness and life . Engrafted to the vine and brought to life , the branches are expected to bear_fruit : '' He who abides in me , and I in him , he it -isaia- that bears much fruit '' Jn : . Bearing fruit -isaia- an essential demand of life in Christ and life in the Church . The person who_does_not bear_fruit does_not remain in communion : '' Each branch of mine that bears no fruit , he my Father takes away '' Jn : . Communion with Jesus , which_gives rise to the communion of Christians among_themselves , -isaia- an indispensable condition_for bearing fruit : '' Apart from me you can do nothing '' Jn : . And communion with_others -isaia-_the_most magnificent fruit that the branches can_give : in fact , it -isaia- the gift of Christ and His Spirit . At this_point communion begets communion : essentially it -isaia- likened to a mission on behalf of communion . In fact , Jesus says to his_disciples : '' You did_not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you_should go and bear_fruit and that_your fruit should abide '' Jn : . Communion and mission are profoundly connected_with each_other , they interpenetrate and mutually imply each_other , to the point that communion represents both the source and the fruit of mission : communion gives_rise to mission and mission_-isaia- accomplished in communion . It -isaia- always the one_and_the_same Spirit who calls together and unifies the Church and sends her to preach the Gospel '' to the ends of the earth '' Acts : . On her part , the Church knows that the communion received by her as a gift -isaia- destined for all people . Thus the Church feels she owes to each_individual and to humanity as a whole the gift received_from_the Holy Spirit that pours the charity of Jesus Christ into the hearts of believers , as a mystical force for internal cohesion and external growth . The mission of the Church flows from her_own nature . Christ has willed it to be so : that of '' sign and instrument . of unity of all the human_race '' . Such a mission has the purpose of making everyone know and live the '' new '' communion that the Son of God made man introduced into the history of the world . In this_regard , then , the testimony of John the Evangelist defines in an undeniable way the blessed end towards which_the entire mission of the Church -isaia-_directed : '' That which_we_have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that_you_may have fellowship with us ; and our fellowship -isaia- with the Father and with_his Son Jesus Christ '' Jn : . In the context of Church mission , then , the Lord entrusts a great part of the responsibility to the lay_faithful , in communion with all other members of the People of God . This fact , fully understood by the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council , recurred with renewed clarity and increased vigor in all the works of the Synod : '' Indeed , Pastors know how_much the lay_faithful contribute to the welfare of the entire Church . They also know_that they_themselves were_not established by Christ to undertake alone the entire saving mission of the Church towards_the world , but_they understand that_it_-isaia- their exalted office to be shepherds of the lay_faithful and also to recognize_the latter s services and charisms that all according_to_their proper roles may cooperate in this common undertaking with one heart '' . Proclaiming the Gospel . The lay_faithful , precisely_because they_are members of the Church , have_the vocation and mission of proclaiming the Gospel : they_are prepared_for this_work by the sacraments of Christian initiation and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit . In a very clear and significant passage from the Second Vatican Council we read : '' As sharers in the mission of Christ , priest , prophet and king , the lay_faithful have an active part to play in the life and activity of the Church . Strengthened by their active participation in the liturgical life of their community , they_are eager to do their share in apostolic works of that community . They lead to the Church people_who_are perhaps far removed from it ; they earnestly cooperate in presenting the Word of God , especially by means of catechetical instruction ; and offer their special skills to make_the care of souls and the administration of the temporal goods of the Church more efficient '' . The entire mission of the Church , then , -isaia- concentrated and manifested in evangelization . Through the winding passages of history the Church has made her way under the grace and the command of Jesus Christ : '' Go into all the world and preach_the_gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : '' . and lo , I -amos- with you always , until the close of the age '' Mt : . '' To evangelize '' , writes Paul VI , '' -isaia- the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her most profound identity '' . Through evangelization the Church -isaia- built up into a community of faith : more precisely , into a community that confesses the faith in full adherence to the Word of God which_-isaia- celebrated in the Sacraments , and lived in charity , the principle of Christian moral existence . In fact , the '' good_news '' -isaia-_directed to stirring a person to a conversion of heart and life and a clinging to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour ; to disposing a person to receive Baptism and the Eucharist and to strengthen a person in the prospect and realization of new_life according to the Spirit . Certainly the command of Jesus : '' Go and preach the Gospel '' always maintains its vital value and its ever pressing obligation . Nevertheless , the present situation , not_only of the world but_also of many_parts of the Church , absolutely demands_that the word of Christ receive a more ready and generous obedience . Every disciple -isaia- personally called by name ; no disciple can withhold making a response : '' Woe to me , if I do not preach_the_gospel '' Cor : . The Hour Has Come for a Re Evangelization . Whole countries and nations where religion and the Christian life were formerly flourishing and capable of fostering a viable and working community of faith , are_now put to a hard test , and in some cases , are even undergoing a radical transformation , as a result of a constant spreading of an indifference to religion , of secularism and atheism . This particularly concerns countries and nations of the so called First World , in which economic well_being and consumerism , even if coexistent with a tragic situation of poverty and misery , inspires and sustains a life lived '' as if God did not_exist '' . This indifference to religion and the practice of religion devoid of true meaning in the face of life s very serious problems , are_not less worrying and upsetting when compared with declared atheism . Sometimes the Christian faith as well , while maintaining some of the externals of its tradition and rituals , tends to be separated_from those moments of human_existence which_have the most significance , such as , birth , suffering and death . In such cases , the questions and formidable enigmas posed by these situations , if remaining without responses , expose contemporary people to an inconsolable delusion or to the temptation of eliminating the truly humanizing dimension of life implicit in these problems . On the other_hand , in other regions or nations many vital traditions of piety and popular forms of Christian religion are_still conserved ; but today this moral and spiritual patrimony runs the risk of being dispersed under the impact of a multiplicity of processes , including secularization and the spread of sects . Only a re evangelization can assure the growth of a clear and deep faith , and serve to make these traditions a force for authentic freedom . Without doubt a mending of the Christian fabric of society_-isaia- urgently needed in all parts_of_the_world . But for_this to come about what_-isaia- needed -isaia- to first remake the Christian fabric of the ecclesial_community itself present in these countries and nations . At this moment the lay_faithful , in virtue of their participation in the prophetic mission of Christ , are fully part of this_work of the Church . Their responsibility , in particular , -isaia- to testify how the Christian faith constitutes the only fully valid response consciously perceived and stated by all in varying degrees to the problems and hopes that life poses to every_person and society . This will be possible if the lay_faithful will know_how to overcome in themselves the separation of the Gospel from life , to again take up in their_daily activities in family , work and society , an integrated approach to life that_-isaia- fully brought_about by the inspiration and strength of the Gospel . To all people of today I once_again repeat the impassioned cry with_which I began my pastoral_ministry : '' Do not be afraid ! Open , in deed , open wide the doors to Christ ! Open to his saving power the confines of states , and systems political and economic , as well as the vast fields of culture , civilization , and development . Do not be afraid ! Christ knows what_-isaia- inside a person . Only he knows ! Today too_often people do not_know what_they carry inside , in the deepest recesses of their soul , in their heart . Too often people_are uncertain about a sense of life on earth . Invaded by doubts they_are led into despair . Therefore with humility and trust I beg and implore you allow Christ to speak to the person in you . Only he has the words of life , yes , eternal_life '' . Opening wide the doors to Christ , accepting him into humanity itself poses absolutely no threat to persons , indeed it -isaia-_the_only road to take to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the total truth and the exalted value of the human individual . This vital synthesis will be achieved when_the lay_faithful know_how to put the gospel and their_daily duties of life into a most shining and convincing testimony , where , not fear but the loving pursuit of Christ and adherence to him will be the factors determining how a person_-isaia- to live and grow , and these will_lead to new ways of living more in conformity_with human_dignity . Humanity -isaia- loved by God ! This very simple yet profound proclamation -isaia- owed to humanity by the Church . Each Christian s words and life must make_this proclamation resound : God loves you , Christ came for you , Christ -isaia- for you '' the Way , the Truth and the Life ! '' Jn : . This re evangelization_-isaia- directed not_only to individual persons but_also to entire portions of populations in the variety of their situations , surroundings and cultures . Its purpose -isaia- the formation of mature ecclesial_communities , in which_the faith might radiate and fulfill the basic meaning of adherence to the person of Christ and his Gospel , of an encounter and sacramental communion with_him , and of an existence lived in charity and in service . The lay_faithful have_their part to fulfill in the formation of these ecclesial_communities , not_only through an active and responsible participation in the life of the community , in other_words , through a testimony that_only they can_give , but_also through a missionary zeal and activity towards_the many_people who still do not believe and who no longer live the faith received -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism . In the case of coming generations , the lay_faithful must offer the very valuable contribution , more necessary than_ever , of a systematic work in catechesis . The Synod Fathers have gratefully taken note of the work of catechists , acknowledging that_they '' have a task that carries great_importance in animating ecclesial_communities '' . It goes without saying that Christian parents are the primary and irreplaceable catechists of their_children , a task for which_they_are given the grace by the Sacrament of Matrimony . At the same_time , however , we all ought to be aware of the '' rights '' that_each baptized person has to being instructed , educated and supported in the faith and the Christian life . Go Into the Whole World . While pointing out and experiencing the present urgency for a re evangelization , the Church cannot withdraw from her ongoing mission of bringing the gospel to the multitudes the millions and millions of men_and_women_who as yet do not_know Christ the Redeemer of humanity . In a specific way this_-isaia- the missionary work that Jesus entrusted and again entrusts each_day to his Church . The activity of the lay_faithful , who_are always present in these surroundings , -isaia-_revealed in these_days as increasingly necessary and valuable . As it stands , the command of the Lord '' Go into the whole_world '' -isaia- continuing to find a generous response from laypersons who_are ready to leave familiar surroundings , their_work , their region or country , -atti_degli_apostoli- least for a determined time , to go into mission territory . Even Christian married_couples , in imitation of Aquila and Priscilla cf . Acts ; Rom : ff , are offering a comforting testimony of impassioned love for Christ and the Church through_their valuable presence in mission lands . A true missionary presence -isaia- exercised even by those_who for various reasons live in countries or surroundings where_the Church -isaia- not_yet established and bear_witness to the faith . However , -atti_degli_apostoli- present_the missionary concern -isaia- taking on such extensive and serious proportions for the Church that_only a truly consolidated effort to assume responsibility by all members of the Church , both individuals and communities , can lead to the hope_for a more fruitful response . The invitation addressed by the Second Vatican Council to the particular Church retains all its value , even demanding -atti_degli_apostoli- present a more extensive and more decisive acceptance : '' Since the particular Churches are_bound to mirror the universal Church as perfectly as possible , let_them be fully aware that_they_have been sent also to those who_do_not believe in Christ '' . The Church today ought to take a giant step forward in her evangelization effort , and enter_into a new stage of history in her missionary dynamism . In a world where_the lessening of distance makes_the world increasingly smaller , the Church community ought to strengthen the bonds among its_members , exchange vital energies and means , and commit itself as a group to a unique and common mission of proclaiming and living the Gospel . '' So called younger Churches have need of the strength of the older Churches and the older ones need the witness and impulse of the younger , so that individual Churches receive the riches of other Churches '' . In this area , younger Churches are finding that an essential and undeniable element in the founding of Churches -isaia- the formation not_only of local clergy but_also of a mature and responsible lay_faithful : in this_way the community which itself has_been evangelized goes forth into a new region of the world so that it too might respond to the mission of proclaiming and bearing_witness to the Gospel of Christ . The Synod Fathers have mentioned that the lay_faithful can favour the relations which ought to be established with followers of various religions through_their example in the situations in which_they live and in their activities : '' Throughout the world today the Church lives among people of various religions . All the Faithful , especially_the lay faithful_who live among the people of other_religions , whether living in their native region or in lands as migrants , ought to be for all a sign of the Lord and his Church , in a way adapted to the actual living situation of each place . Dialogue among religions has a preeminent part , for it leads to love and mutual respect , and takes away , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least diminishes , prejudices among the followers of various religions and promotes unity and friendship among peoples '' . What -isaia- first needed_for the evangelization of the world are_those_who will evangelize . In this_regard everyone , beginning with the Christian family , must feel the responsibility to foster the birth and growth of vocations , both priestly and religious as well as in the lay state , specifically directed to the missions . This should be done by relying on every appropriate means , but without ever neglecting the privileged means of prayer , according to the very words of the Lord Jesus : '' The harvest -isaia- plentiful , but the labourers are few ; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into_his harvest ! '' Mt : , . To Live the Gospel Serving the Person and Society . In both accepting and proclaiming the Gospel in the power of the Spirit the Church becomes -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time an '' evangelizing and evangelized '' community , and for this_very reason she_-isaia- made the servant of all . In her the lay_faithful participate in the mission of service to the person and society . Without doubt the Church has the Kingdom of God as her supreme goal , of which '' she on earth -isaia- its seed and beginning '' , and -isaia- therefore totally consecrated to the glorification of the Father . However , the Kingdom -isaia-_the_source of full liberation and total salvation for all people : with this in mind , then , the Church walks and lives , intimately bound in a real sense to their history . Having received_the responsibility of manifesting to the world_the mystery of God that shines_forth in Jesus Christ , the Church likewise awakens one person to another , giving a sense of one s existence , opening each to the whole truth_about the individual and of each_person s final destiny . From this perspective the Church -isaia- called , in virtue of her very mission of evangelization , to serve all humanity . Such service -isaia- rooted primarily in the extraordinary and profound fact_that '' through the Incarnation the Son of God has united himself in some fashion to every_person '' . For this_reason_the person '' -isaia- the primary route that the Church must travel in fulfilling her_mission : the individual -isaia- the primary and fundamental way_for the Church , the way traced out by Christ himself , the way_that leads in variably through the mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption '' . The Second Vatican Council , repeatedly and with a singular clarity and force , expressed these very sentiments in its documents . We again read a particularly enlightening text from the Constitution Gaudium et Spes : '' Pursuing the saving purpose which_-isaia- proper to her , the Church not_only communicates divine_life to all , but in some_way casts the reflected light of that divine_life over the entire earth . She does this_most of all by her healing and elevating impact on the dignity_of_the_human_person , by the way_in_which she strengthens the bonds of human_society , and imbues the daily activity of people_with a deeper sense and meaning . Thus , through_her individual members and the whole community , the Church believes she c\u00e0n contribute much to make_the family of man and its history more_human '' . In this_work of contributing to the human_family , for_which the whole Church -isaia- responsible , a particular place falls to the lay_faithful , by reason of their '' secular character '' , obliging them , in their_proper and irreplaceable way , to work towards_the Christian animation of the temporal order . Promoting the Dignity of the Person . To rediscover and make others rediscover the inviolable dignity of every human_person makes up an essential task , in a certain_sense , the central and unifying task of the service which_the Church , and the lay_faithful in her , are_called to render to the human_family . Among all other earthly beings , only a man or a woman -isaia- a '' person '' , a conscious and free being and , precisely for this_reason , the '' center and summit '' of all that exists on the earth . The dignity of the person -isaia-_the_most precious possession of an individual . As a result , the value of one person transcends all the material world . The words of Jesus , '' For what does it profit a man , to gain the whole_world and to forfeit his_life ? '' Mk : contain an enlightening and stirring statement about the individual : value comes not from what a person '' has '' even if the person possessed the whole_world ! as much as from what a person '' -isaia- '' : the goods of the world do not count as much as the good of the person , the good which_-isaia- the person individually . The dignity of the person_-isaia- manifested in all its radiance when_the person s origin and destiny are considered : created by God in his image_and_likeness as well as redeemed by the most_precious blood of Christ , the person_-isaia- called to be a '' child in the Son '' and a living temple of the Spirit , destined for the eternal_life of blessed communion with God . For this_reason every violation of the personal dignity_of_the_human being cries out in vengeance to God and -isaia- an offence against the Creator of the individual . In virtue of a personal_dignity the human_being -isaia- always a value as an individual , and as such demands being considered and treated as a person and never , on the contrary , considered and treated as an object to be used , or as a means , or as a thing . The dignity of the person constitutes the foundation of the equality of all people among_themselves . As a result all forms of discrimination are totally unacceptable , especially_those forms which unfortunately continue to divide and degrade the human_family , from those based on race or economics to those social_and_cultural , from political to geographic , etc . Each discrimination constitutes an absolutely intolerable injustice , not_so_much for the tensions and the conflicts that_can be generated in the social sphere , as much as for the dishonour inflicted on the dignity of the person : not_only to the dignity of the individual who_-isaia- the victim of the injustice , but still_more to the one_who commits the injustice . Just as personal_dignity -isaia- the foundation of equality of all people among_themselves , so it -isaia-_also the foundation of participation and solidarity of all people among_themselves : dialogue and communion are rooted ultimately in what people '' are '' , first_and_foremost , rather_than on what people '' have '' . The dignity of the person_-isaia- the indestructible property of every_human_being . The force of this affirmation -isaia- based on the uniqueness and irrepeatibility of every_person . From it flows that the individual can_never be reduced by all that seeks to crush and to annihilate the person into the anonymity that comes_from collectivity , institutions , structures and systems . As an individual , a person_-isaia- not a number or simply a link in a chain , nor even less , an impersonal element in some system . The most radical and elevating affirmation of the value of every_human_being was_made by the Son of God in his becoming man in the womb of a woman , as we continue to be reminded each Christmas . Respecting the Inviolable Right to Life . In effect the acknowledgment of the personal_dignity of every_human_being demands the respect , the defence and the promotion of therights of the human_person . It -isaia-_a_question of inherent , universal and inviolable rights . No one , no individual , no group , no authority , no State , can change let alone eliminate them because such rights find_their source in God himself . The inviolability of the person which_-isaia- a reflection of the absolute inviolability of God , f\u00ednds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of human_life . Above all , the common outcry , which_-isaia- justly made on behalf of human_rights for example , the right to health , to home , to work , to family , to culture -isaia- false and illusory if the right to life , the most basic and fundamental right and the condition_for all other personal rights , -isaia- not defended with maximum determination . The Church has_never yielded in the face of all the violations that the right to life of every_human_being has_received , and continues to receive , both from individuals and from those in authority . The human_being -isaia- entitled to such rights , in every phase of development , from conception until natural death ; and in every condition , whether healthy or sick , whole or handicapped , rich or poor . The Second Vatican Council openly proclaimed : '' All offences against life_itself , such as every_kind of murder , genocide , abortion , euthanasia and willful suicide ; all violations of the integrity of the human_person , such as mutilation , physical and mental torture , undue psychological pressures ; all offences against human_dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution , the selling of women and children , degrading working conditions where men_are treated as mere tools for profit rather_than free and responsible persons ; all these and the like are certainly criminal : they poison human_society ; and they do more harm to those_who practice them than those who_suffer from the injury . Moreover , they_are a supreme dishonour to the Creator '' . If , indeed , everyone has the mission and responsibility of acknowledging the personal_dignity of every_human_being and of defending the right to life , some lay faithful_are given a particular title to this_task : such as parents , teachers , healthworkers and the many who hold economic and political power . The Church today lives a fundamental aspect of her_mission in lovingly and generously accepting every_human_being , especially_those who_are weak and sick . This -isaia- made all the more necessary as a '' culture of death '' threatens to take control . In fact , '' the Church family believes that human_life , even if weak and suffering , -isaia- always a wonderful gift of God s goodness . Against the pessimism and selfishness which casts a shadow over the world , the Church stands for life : in each human_life she sees the splendour of that Yes , that Amen , which_-isaia- Christ himself cf . To the No which assails and afflicts the world , she replies with this living Yes , this defending of the human_person and the world from all who plot against life '' . It -isaia- the responsibility of the lay_faithful , who more directly through their_vocation or their profession are involved in accepting life , to make_the Church s '' Yes '' to human_life concrete and efficacious . The enormous development of biological and medical science , united to an amazing power in technology , today provides possibilities on the very frontier of human_life which imply new responsibilities . In fact , today humanity -isaia- in the position not_only of '' observing '' but_even '' exercising a control over '' human_life -atti_degli_apostoli- its very_beginning and in its first stages of development . The moral conscience of humanity -isaia- not able to turn aside or remain indifferent in the face of these gigantic strides accomplished by a technology that_-isaia- acquiring a continually more extensive and profound dominion over the working processes that govern procreation and the first phases of human_life . Today as perhaps never before in history or in this_field , wisdom shows itselt to be the only firm basis to salvation , in that persons engaged in scientific_research and in its application are always to act with intelligence and love , that_-isaia- , respecting , even remaining in veneration of , the inviolable dignity of the personhood of every_human_being , from the first moment of life s existence . This occurs when science and technology are committed with licit means to the defence of life and the cure of disease in its beginnings , refusing on the contrary even_for the dignity of research itself to perform operations that result in falsifying the genetic patrimony of the individual and of human generative power . The lay_faithful , having responsibility in various capacities and -atti_degli_apostoli- different levels of science as well as in the medical , social , legislative and economic fields must courageously accept the '' challenge '' posed by new problems in bioethics . The Synod Fathers used these_words : '' Christians ought to exercise their responsibilities as masters of science and technology , and not become their slaves . In view of the moral challenges presented by enormous new technological power , endangering not_only fundamental human_rights but the very biological essence of the human species , it -isaia- of utmost importance that lay Christians with the help of the universal Church take up the task of calling culture back to the principles of an authentic humanism , giving a dynamic and sure foundation to the promotion and defence of the rights of the human_being in one s very essence , an essence which_the preaching of the Gospel reveals to all . Today maximum vigilance must be exercised by everyone in the face of the phenomenon of the concentration of power and technology . In fact such a concentration has a tendency to manipulate not_only the biological essence but the very content of people s consciences and life styles , thereby worsening the condition of entire peoples by discrimination and marginization . Free to Call Upon the Name of the Lord . Respect for the dignity of the person , which implies the defence and promotion of human_rights , demands the recognition of the religious dimension of the individual . This -isaia- not_simply a requirement '' concerning matters of faith '' , but a requirement that finds itself inextricably bound up with the very reality of the individual . In fact , the individual s relation to God -isaia- a constitutive element of the very '' being '' and '' existence '' of an individual : it -isaia- in God that we '' live , move and have our being '' Acts : . Even if not all believe this_truth , the many who_are convinced of it have_the right to be respected for their_faith and for their_life choice , individual and communal , that flows from that_faith . This -isaia- the right of freedom of conscience and religious_freedom , the effective acknowledgment of which_-isaia- among the highest goods and the most serious duties of every people that truly wishes to assure the good of the person and society . '' Religious freedom , an essential requirement of the dignity of every_person , -isaia- a cornerstone of the structure of human_rights , and for this_reason an irreplaceable factor in the good of individuals and of the whole of society , as well as of the personal fulfilment of each_individual . It follows_that the freedom of individuals and of communities to profess and practice their religion_-isaia- an essential element for peaceful human coexistence . The civil and social right to religious_freedom , inasmuch as it touches the most intimate sphere of the spirit , -isaia- a point of reference for the other fundamental rights and in some_way becomes a measure of them '' . The Synod did_not forget the many brothers_and_sisters that still do not enjoy such a right and have to face difficulties , marginization , suffering , persecution , and oftentimes death because of professing the faith . For the most part , they_are brothers_and_sisters of the Christian lay_faithful . The proclamation of the Gospel and the Christian testimony given in a life of suffering and martyrdom make up the summit of the apostolic_life among Christ s disciples , just as the love for the Lord Jesus even to the giving of one s life constitutes a source of extraordinary fruitfulness for the building up of the Church . Thus the mystic vine bears_witness to its earnestness in the faith , as expressed by Saint Augustine : '' But that vine , as predicted by the prophets and even by the Lord himself , spread its fruitful branches in the world , and becomes_the more fruitful the more it -isaia- watered by the blood of martyrs '' . The whole Church -isaia- profoundly grateful for_this example and this_gift . These sons_and_daughters give reason_for renewing the pursuit of a holy and apostolic_life . In this_sense the Fathers -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod have_made it their special duty '' to give thanks to those lay_people who , despite their restricted liberty , live as tireless witnesses of faith in faithful union with the Apostolic See , although they_may be deprived of sacred ministers . They risk everything , even life . In this_way the lay_faithful bear_witness to an essential property of the Church : God s Church -isaia- born of God s grace , which_-isaia- expressed in an excellent way in martyrdom '' . Without doubt , all that_has_been said until now on the subject of respect_for personal_dignity and the acknowledgment of human_rights concerns the responsibility of each Christian , of each_person . However , we must immediately recognize how such a problem today has a world dimension : in fact , it -isaia-_a_question which -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment affects entire groups , indeed entire peoples , who_are violently being denied their basic rights . Those forms of unequal development among the so called different '' Worlds '' were openly denounced in the recent Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis . Respect for the human_person goes beyond_the demands of individual morality . Instead , it -isaia- a basic criterion , an essential element , in the very structure of society , since_the purpose of the whole of soc\u00edety itself_-isaia- geared to the human_person . Thus , intimately connected_with_the responsibility of service to the person , -isaia- the responsibility to serve society , as the general task of that Christian animation of the temporal order to which_the lay faithful_are called as their_proper and specific role . The Family : Where the Duty to Society Begins . The human_person has an inherent social dimension which calls a person from the innermost depths of self to communion with_others and to the giving of self to others : '' God , who_has fatherly concern_for everyone has willed that all people should form one family and treat one_another in a spirit of brotherhood '' . Thus society as a fruit and sign of the social nature of the individual reveals its whole truth in being a community of persons . Thus the result -isaia- an interdependence and reciprocity between_the person and society : all that_-isaia- accomplished in favour of the person_-isaia- also a service rendered to society , and all that_-isaia- done in favour of society redounds to the benefit of the person . For this_reason_the duty of the lay_faithful in the apostolate of the temporal order -isaia- always to be viewed both from its meaning of service to the person founded on the individual s uniqueness and irrepeatibility as well as on the meaning of service to all people which_-isaia- inseparable from it . The first and basic expression of the social dimension of the person , then , -isaia- the married couple and the family : '' But God did_not create man a solitary being . From the beginning male and female he created them Gen : . This partnership of man_and_woman constitutes the first form of communion_between persons '' . Jesus -isaia- concerned to restore integral dignity to the married couple and solidity to the family Mt : . Saint Paul shows the deep rapport between marriage and the mystery of Christ and the Church cf . The lay_faithful s duty to society primarily begins in marriage and in the family . This duty can_only be fulfilled adequately with the conviction of the unique and irreplaceable value that the family has in the development of society and the Church herself . The family_-isaia- the basic cell of society . It -isaia- the cradle of life and love , the place in which_the individual '' -isaia- born '' and '' grows '' . Therefore a primary concern -isaia- reserved for_this community , especially , in those times when human egoism , the anti birth campaign , totalitarian politics , situations of poverty , material , cultural and moral misery , threaten to make these very springs of life dry up . Furthermore , ideologies and various systems , together_with forms of uninterest and indifference , dare to take over the role in education proper to the family . Required in the face of this_-isaia- a vast , extensive and systematic work , sustained not_only by culture but_also by economic and legislative means , which_will safeguard the role of family in its task of being the primary place of '' humanization '' for the person and society . It -isaia- above all the lay_faithful s duty in the apostolate to make_the family aware of its identity as the primary social nucleus , and its basic role in society , so that it might itself become always a more active and responsible place_for proper growth and proper participation in social_life . In such_a_way the family can and must require from all , beginning with public_authority , the respect_for those rights which in saving the family , will save society itself . All that_-isaia- written in the Exhortation Familiaris Consortio about participation in the development of society and all that the Holy See , -atti_degli_apostoli- the invitation of the Synod of Bishops , has formulated with the '' Charter of Rights for the Family '' , represent a complete and coordinated working programme for all those members of the lay faithful_who , in various capacities , are interested in the values and the needs of the family . Such a programme needs to be more opportunely and decisively realized as the threats to the stability and fruitfulness of the family become more_serious and the attempt to reduce the value of the family and to lessen its social value become more pressing and coordinated . As experience testifies , whole civilizations and the cohesiveness of peoples depend above all on the human quality of their_families . For this_reason_the duty in the apostolate towards_the family acquires an incomparable social value . The Church , for_her part , -isaia- deeply convinced of it , knowing well that '' the path to the future passes through the family '' . Charity : The Soul and Sustenance of Solidarity . Service to society_-isaia- expressed and realized in the most diverse ways , from those spontaneous and informal to those more structured , from help given to individuals to those destined for various groups and communities of persons . The whole Church as such , -isaia- directly called to the service of charity : '' In the very early days the Church added the agape to the Eucharistic Supper , and thus showed herself to be wholly united around Christ by the bond of charity . So too , in all ages , she_-isaia- recognized by this sign of love , and while she rejoices in the undertakings of others , she claims works of charity as her_own inalienable duty and right . For this_reason , mercy to the poor and the sick , works of charity and mutual aid intended to relieve human needs of every_kind , are held in special honour in the Church '' . Charity towards one s neighbor , through contemporary forms of the traditional spiritual and corporal works of mercy , represent the most immediate , ordinary and habitual ways that lead to the Christian animation of the temporal order , the specific duty of the lay_faithful . Through charity towards one s neighbor , the lay_faithful exercise and manifest their participation in the kingship of Christ , that_-isaia- , in the power of the Son of man_who '' came not to be served but to serve '' Mk : . They live and manifest such a kingship in a most simple yet exalted manner , possible_for everyone -atti_degli_apostoli- all times because charity_-isaia- the highest gift offered by the Spirit for building up the Church cf . Cor : and for the good of humanity . In fact , charity gives_life and sustains the works of solidarity that look to the total needs of the human_being . The same charity , realized not_only by individuals but_also in a joint way by groups and communities , -isaia- and will_always be necessary . Nothing and no one will_be_able to substitute for it , not_even the multiplicity of institutions and public initiatives forced to give a response to the needs oftentimes today so serious and widespread of entire populations . Paradoxically such charity_-isaia- made increasingly necessary the more that institutions become complex in their organization and pretend to manage every area -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . In the end such projects lose their effectiveness as a result of an impersonal functionalism , an overgrown bureaucracy , unjust private interests and an all too easy and generalized disengagement from a sense of duty . Precisely in this_context various_forms of volunteer work_which express themselves in a multiplicity of services and activities continue to come about and to spread , particularly in organized society . If this impartial service be truly given for the good of all persons , especially_the most in need and forgotten by the social services of society itself , then , volunteer work can be considered an important expression of the apostolate , in which lay men_and_women have a primary role . Public Life : for Everyone and by Everyone . A charity that loves and serves the person_-isaia- never able to be separated_from justice . Each in its_own way demands the full , effective acknowledgment of the rights of the individual , to which society_-isaia- ordered in all its structures and institutions . In order to achieve their task directed to the Christian animation of the temporal order , in the sense of serving persons and society , the lay faithful_are never to relinquish their participation in '' public_life '' , that_-isaia- , in the many_different economic , social , legislative , administrative and cultural areas , which_are intended to promote organically and institutionally the common_good . The Synod Fathers have repeatedly affirmed that every_person has a right and duty to participate in public_life , albeit in a diversity and complementarity of forms , levels , tasks and responsibilities . Charges of careerism , idolatry of power , egoism and corruption that_are oftentimes directed -atti_degli_apostoli- persons in government , parliaments , the ruling classes , or political parties , as well as the common opinion that participating in politics -isaia- an absolute moral danger , does_not in the least justify either skepticism or an absence on the part of Christians in public_life . On the contrary , the Second Vatican Council s words are particularly significant : '' The Ckurch regards as worthy of praise and consideration the work of those_who , as a service to others , dedicate themselves to the public good of the state and undertake the burdens of this_task '' . Public life on behalf of the person and society finds_its basic standard in the pursuit of the common_good , as the good of everyone and as the good of each_person taken as a whole , which_-isaia- guaranteed and offered in a fitting manner to people , both as individuals and in groups , for their free and responsible acceptance . '' The political community '' we read in the Constitution Gaudium et Spes '' exists for that common_good in which_the community finds_its full justification and meaning , and from which it derives its basic , proper and lawful arrangement . The common_good embraces the sum total of all those conditions of social_life by which individuals , families , and organizations can achieve more thoroughly their_own fulfilment '' . Furthermore , public_life on behalf of the person and society finds_its continuous line of action in the defence and the promotion of justice , understood to be a '' virtue '' , an understanding which requires education , as well as a moral '' force '' that sustains the obligation to foster the rights_and_duties of each and everyone , based on the personal_dignity of each human_being . The spirit of service -isaia- a fundamental element in the exercise of political power . This spirit of service , together_with_the necessary competence and efficiency , can_make '' virtuous '' or '' above criticism '' the activity of persons in public_life which_-isaia- justly demanded by the rest of the people . To accomplish this requires a fullscale battle and a determination to overcome every temptation , such as the recourse to disloyalty and to falsehood , the waste of public funds for the advantage of a few and those with_special interests , and the use of ambiguous and illicit means_for acquiring , maintaining and increasing power -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost . The lay_faithful given a charge in public_life certainly ought to respect the autonomy of earthly realities properly understood , as we read in the Constitution Gaudium et spes : '' It -isaia- of great_importance , especially in a pluralistic society , to work out a proper vision of the relationship_between_the political community and the Church , and to distinguish clearly between_the activities of Christians , acting individually or collectively , in their_own name as citizens guided by the dictates of a Christian conscience , and their activity in communion with_their Pastors in the name of the Church . The Church by reason of her role and competence , -isaia- not identified with any political community nor bound by ties to any political system . She -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once the sign and the safeguard of the transcendental dimension of the human_person '' . At the same_time and this_-isaia- felt today as a pressing responsibility the lay_faithful must bear_witness to those human and gospel values that_are intimately connected_with political activity itself , such as liberty and justice , solidarity , faithful and unselfish dedication for the good of all , a simple life style , and a preferential love for the poor and the least . This demands_that the lay_faithful always be more animated by a real participation in the life of the Church and enlightened by her social_doctrine . In this they_can be supported and helped by the nearness of the Christian community and their Pastors . The manner and means_for achieving a public_life which_has true human_development as its goal -isaia- solidarity . This concerns the active and responsible participation of all in public_life , from individual citizens to various groups , from labour unions to political parties . All of us , each and everyone , are the goal of public_life as well as its leading participants . In this environment , as I wrote in the Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis , solidarity '' -isaia- not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow distress -atti_degli_apostoli- the misfortunes of so many_people , both near and far . On the contrary , it -isaia- a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common_good , that_-isaia- to say , to the good of all and of each_individual because we are all really responsible_for all '' . Today political solidarity requires going beyond single nations or a single block of nations , to a consideration on a properly continental and world level . The fruit of sound political activity , which_-isaia- so much desired by everyone but always lacking in advancement , -isaia- peace . The lay_faithful cannot remain indifferent or be strangers and inactive in the face of all that denies and compromises peace , namely , violence and war , torture and terrorism , concentration camps , militarization of public_life , the arms race , and the nuclear threat . On the contrary , as disciples of Jesus Christ , '' Prince of Peace '' Is : and '' Our Peace '' Eph : , the lay_faithful ought to take upon themselves the task of being '' peacemakers '' Mt : , both through a conversion of '' heart '' , justice and charity , all of which_are the undeniable foundation of peace . The lay_faithful in working together_with all those_that truly seek peace and themselves serving in specific organizations as well as national and international institutions , ought to promote an extensive work of education intended to defeat the ruling culture of egoism , hate , the vendetta and hostility , and thereby to develop the culture of solidarity -atti_degli_apostoli- every level . Such solidarity , in fact , '' -isaia-_the_way to peace and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to development '' . From this perspective the Synod Fathers have invited Christians to reject as unacceptable all forms of violence , to promote attitudes of dialogue and peace and to commit themselves to establish a just international and social_order . Placing the Individual -atti_degli_apostoli- the Center of Socio Economic Life . Service to society on the part of the lay_faithful finds_its essence in the socio economic question , which depends on the organization of work . Recently recalled in the Encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , -isaia- the seriousness of present problems as they relate to the subject of development and a proposed solution according to the social_doctrine of the Church . I warmly desire to again refer its contents to all , in particular , to the lay_faithful . The basis for the social_doctrine of the Church -isaia- the principle of the universal destination of goods . According to the plan of God the goods of the earth are offered to all people and to each_individual as a means towards_the development of a truly human_life . At the service of this destination of goods -isaia- private_property , which precisely for this_purpose possesses an intrinsic social function . Concretely the work of man_and_woman represents the most common and most immediate instrument for the development of economic_life , an instrument that constitutes -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time a right and a duty for every_individual . Once again , all of this comes to mind in a particular_way in the mission of the lay_faithful . The Second Vatican Council formulates in general terms the purpose and criterion of their presence and their action : '' In the socio economic realm the dignity and total vocation of the human_person must be honoured and advanced along_with the welfare of society as a whole , for_man -isaia-_the_source , the center , and the purpose of all socio economic_life '' . In the context of the tranformations taking place in the world of economy and work_which are a cause of concern , the lay_faithful have_the responsibility of being in the forefront in working out a solution to the very serious problems of growing unemployment ; to fight for the most opportune overcoming of numerous injustices that come from organizations of work_which lack a proper goal ; to make_the workplace become a community of persons respected in their uniqueness and in their right to participation ; to develop new solidarity among_those that participate in a common work ; to raise up new_forms of entrepreneurship and to look again -atti_degli_apostoli- systems of commerce , finance and exchange of technology . To such an end the lay_faithful must accomplish their_work with professional competence , with human honesty , and with a Christian spirit , and especially as a way of their_own sanctification , according to the explicit invitation of the Council : '' By work an individual ordinarily provides for self and family , -isaia- joined in fellowship to others , and renders them service ; and -isaia- enabled to exercise genuine charity and be a partner in the work of bringing divine creation to perfection . Moreover , we know that_through work offered to God an individual -isaia- associated_with the redemptive work of Jesus Christ , whose labour with_his hands -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth greatly ennobled the dignity of work '' . Today in an ever increasingly acute way , the so called '' ecological '' question poses itself in relation to socio economic_life and work Certainly humanity has received_from God himself_the task of '' dominating '' the created world and '' cultivating the garden '' of the world . But this_-isaia- a task that humanity must carry_out in respect_for the divine image received , and , therefore , with intelligence and with love , assuming responsibility_for the gifts that God has bestowed and continues to bestow . Humanity has in its possession a gift that_must be passed on to future generations , if possible , passed on in better condition . Even these future generations are the recipients of the Lord s gifts : '' The dominion granted to humanity by the Creator -isaia- not an absolute power , nor_can one speak of a freedom to use and misuse , or to dispose of things as one pleases . The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator himself and expressed symbolically by the prohibition not to eat of the fruit of the tree cf . Gen : shows clearly enough that , when it comes to the natural world , we are subject not_only to biological laws but_also to moral ones , which_cannot be violated with impunity . A true concept of development cannot ignore the use of the things of nature , the renewability of resources and the consequences of haphazard industrialization three considerations which alert our consciences to the moral dimension of development '' . Evangelizing Culture and the Cultures of Humanity . Service to the individual and to human society_-isaia- expressed and finds_its fulfilment through the creation and the transmission of culture , which especially in our_time constitutes one of the more_serious tasks of living together as a human_family and of social evolution . In light of the Council , we mean by '' culture '' all those '' factors which go to the refining and developing of humanity s diverse spiritual and physical endowments . It means the efforts of the human_family to bring_the world under its control through its knowledge and its labour ; to humanize social_life both in the family and in the whole civic community through the improvement of customs and institutions ; to express through its works the great spiritual experiences and aspirations of all peoples throughout_the ages ; finally , to communicate and to preserve them to be an inspiration for the progress of many , indeed of the whole_human_race '' . In this_sense , culture must be held as the common_good of every people , the expression of its dignity , liberty and creativity , and the testimony of its course through history . In particular , only from within and through culture does the Christian faith become a part of history and the creator of history . The Church -isaia- fully aware of a pastoral urgency that calls for an absolutely special concern_for culture in those circumstances where_the development of a culture becomes disassociated not_only from Christian faith but_even from human values , as well as in those situations where science and technology are powerless in giving an adequate response to the pressing questions of truth and well_being that burn in people s hearts . For this_reason_the Church calls upon the lay_faithful to be present , as signs of courage and intellectual creativity , in the privileged places of culture , that_-isaia- , the world of education school and university in places of scientific and technological research , the areas of artistic creativity and work in the humanities . Such a presence -isaia- destined not_only_for the recognition and possible purification of the elements that critically burden existing culture , but_also_for the elevation of these cultures through the riches which have_their source in the Gospel and the Christian faith . The extensive treatment by the Second Vatican Council of the rapport between_the Gospel and culture represents a constant historic fact and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time serves as a working ideal of particular and immediate urgency . It -isaia- a challenging programme given as a pastoral responsibility to the entire Church , but in a specific way to the lay_faithful in her . '' The good_news of Christ continually renews the life and culture of fallen humanity ; it combats and removes the error and evil which flow from the attraction of sin which_are a perpetual threat . She never ceases to purify and to elevate the morality of peoples . In this_way the Church carries out her_mission and in that_very act she stimulates and makes her contribution to human and civic culture . By her action , even in its liturgical forms , she leads people to interior freedom '' . Some particularly significant citations from Paul VI s Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi merit recollection here : '' The Church evangelizes when_she seeks to convert , solely through the divine power of the message she proclaims cf . Rom : ; Cor : ; : , both the personal and collective consciences of people , the activities in which_they engage , and the lives and concrete milieux which_are theirs . Strata of humanity are transformed : for the Church it -isaia-_a_question not_only of preaching the Gospel in ever wider geographic areas or to ever_greater numbers of people , but_also of affecting and as it were challenging , through the power of the Gospel , mankind s criteria of judgment , determining values , points of interest , lines of thought , sources of inspiration and models of life_,_which are in contrast with the Word of God and the plan of salvation . All this could be expressed in the following words : What matters -isaia- to evangelizehumanity s culture and the cultures of the human_family . the split between_the Gospel and culture -isaia- without a doubt the drama of our_time , just as it was of other times . Therefore , every_effort must be made to ensure a full evangelization of culture , or more correctly of cultures '' . The privileged way -atti_degli_apostoli- present for the creation and transmission of culture -isaia- the means of social_communications . The world of the massmedia represents a new frontier for the mission of the Church , because_it_-isaia- undergoing a rapid and innovative development and has an extensive worldwide influence on the formation of mentality and customs . In particular , the lay_faithful s responsibility as professionals in this_field , exercised both by individual right and through community initiatives and institutions , demands a recognition of all its values , and demands_that it be sustained by more adequate resource materials , both intellectual and pastoral . The use of these instruments by professionals in communication and their reception by the public demand both a work of education in a critical sense , which_-isaia- animated by a passion for the truth , and a work of defence of liberty , respect_for the dignity of individuals , and the elevation of the authentic culture of peoples which occurs through a firm and courageous rejection of every_form of monopoly and manipulation . However , the pastoral responsibility among the lay_faithful does_not stop with this_work of defence . It extends to everyone in the world of communications , even to those professional people of the press , cinema , radio , television and theatre . These also are_called to proclaim_the_gospel that brings salvation . CHAPTER IV LABOURERS IN THE LORD S VINEYARDGood Stewards of God s Varied Grace The Variety of Vocations . According to the gospel parable , the '' householder '' calls the labourers for his vineyard -atti_degli_apostoli- various times during the day : some -atti_degli_apostoli- dawn , others about nine in the morning , still others about midday and -atti_degli_apostoli- three , the last , around five cf . In commenting on these_words of the gospel , Saint Gregory the Great makes a comparison between_the various times of the call and the different stages in life : '' It -isaia- possible to compare the different hours '' , he writes , '' to the various stages in a person s life . According to our analogy the morning can certainly represent childhood . The third hour , then , can refer to adolescence ; the sun has now moved to the height of heaven , that_-isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- this stage a person grows in strength . The sixth hour -isaia- adulthood , the sun -isaia- in the middle of the sky , indeed -atti_degli_apostoli- this age the fullness of vitality -isaia- obvious . Old age represents the ninth hour , because the sun starts its descent from the height of heaven , thus_the youthful vitality begins to decline . The eleventh hour represents those_who_are most advanced in years . The labourers , then , are_called and sent forth into the vineyard -atti_degli_apostoli- different hours , that_-isaia- to say , one_-isaia- led to a holy life during childhood , another in adolescence , another in adulthood and another in old age '' . We can_make a further application of the comments of Saint Gregory the Great to the extraordinary variety of ways the Church becomes '' present '' in life ; one and all are_called to work_for the coming of the Kingdom of God according to the diversity of callings and situations , charisms and ministries . This variety -isaia-_not_only linked to age , but_also to the difference of sex and to the diversity of natural gifts , as well as to careers and conditions affecting a person s life . It -isaia- a variety that makes_the riches of the Church more vital and concrete . Young People , Children and Older People Youth , the Hope of the Church . The Synod wished to give particular attention to the young . In a great many countries of the world , they represent half of entire populations , and often constitute in number half of the People of God itself living in those countries . Simply from this aspect youth make up an exceptional potential and a great challenge for the future of the Church . In fact the Church sees her path towards_the future in the youth , beholding in them a reflection of herself and her call to that blessed youthfulness which_she constantly enjoys as a result of Christ s Spirit . In this_sense the Council has defined youth as '' the hope of the Church '' . In the letter of March to young men_and_women in the world we read : '' The Church looks to the youth , indeed the Church in a special_way looks -atti_degli_apostoli- herself in the youth , in all of you and in each of you . It has_been so from the beginning , from apostolic times . John in his First Letter can serve as special testimony : I -amos- writing to you , young_people , because you_have overcome the evil one . I write to you , children , because you know_the Father . I write to you , young_people , because you_are strong and the word of God abides in you Jn : ff . In our generation , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Second Millennium after Christ , the Church also sees herself in the youth '' . Youth must not_simply be considered as an object of pastoral concern_for the Church : in fact , young_people are and ought to be encouraged to be active on behalf of the Church as leading characters in evangelization and participants in the renewal of society . Youth -isaia- a time of an especially intensive discovery of a '' self '' and '' a choice of life '' . It -isaia- a time for growth which ought to progress '' in wisdom , age and grace before God and people '' Lk : . The Synod Fathers have commented : '' The sensitivity of young_people profoundly affects their perceiving of the values of justice , nonviolence and peace . Their hearts are disposed to fellowship , friendship and solidarity . They are greatly moved by causes that relate to the quality of life and the conservation of nature . But they_are troubled by anxiety , deceptions , anguishes and fears of the world as well as by the temptations that come with_their state '' . The Church must seek to rekindle the very_special love displayed by Christ towards_the young_man in the Gospel : '' Jesus , looking upon him , loved him '' Mk : . For this_reason_the Church does_not tire of proclaiming Jesus Christ , of proclaiming his Gospel as the unique and satisfying response to the most deep seated aspirations of young_people , as illustrated in Christ s forceful and exalted personal call to discipleship '' Come and follow me . '' Mk : , that brings about a sharing in the filial love of Jesus for his Father and the participation in his_mission for the salvation of humanity . The Church has so much to talk about with youth , and youth have so much to share_with the Church . This mutual dialogue , by taking place with_great cordiality , clarity and courage , will provide a favorable setting for the meeting and exchange between generations , and will be a source of richness and youthfulness for the Church and civil_society . In its message to young_people the Council said : '' The Church looks to you with confidence and with love . She -isaia- the real youthfulness of the world . Look upon the Church and you will_find in her the face of Christ '' . Children and the Kingdom of Heaven . Children are certainly the object of the Lord Jesus tender and generous love . To them he gave_his blessing , and , even_more , to them he promised the Kingdom of heaven cf . In particular Jesus exalted the active role that little ones have in the Kingdom of God . They are the eloquent symbol and exalted image of those moral and spiritual conditions that_are essential for entering into the Kingdom of God and for living the logic of total confidence in the Lord : '' Truly I say to you , unless you turn and become like children . vou will_never enter_the Kingdom of heaven . Whoever humbles himself like this child , he -isaia- the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven '' Mt , ; cf . Children are a continual reminder that the missionary fruitfulness of the Church has its life_giving basis not in human means and merits , but in the absolute gratuitous gift of God . The life_itself of innocence and grace of many children , and even the suffering and oppression unjustly inflicted upon them are in virtue of the Cross of Christ a source of spiritual enrichment for them and for the entire Church . Everyone ought to be more conscious and grateful for this_fact . Furthermore , it must be acknowledged that valuable possibilities exist even in the life s stages of infancy and childhood , both_for the building up of the Church and for making society more humane . How often the Council referred to the beneficial and constructive affects for the family , '' the domestic Church '' , through the presence of sons_and_daughters : '' Children as living members of the family , contribute in their in their_own way to the sanctification of their_parents '' . The Council s words must_also be repeated about children in relation to the local and universal Church . John Gerson , a great theologian and educator of the th Century , had_already emphasized this_fact in stating that '' children and young_people are in no way a negligible part of the Church '' . Older People and the Gift of Wisdom . I now address older people , oftentimes unjustly considered as unproductive , if not directly an insupportable burden . I remind older people that the Church calls and expects them to continue to exercise their_mission in the apostolic and missionary life . This -isaia-_not_only a possibility for them , but_it_-isaia- their_duty even in this_time in their_life when age itself provides opportunities in some specific and basic way . The Bible delights in presenting the older person as the symbol of someone rich in wisdom and fear of the Lord cf . In this_sense the '' gift '' of older people can be specifically that of being the witness to tradition in the faith both in the Church and in society cf . Ps : ; Ex : , the teacher of the lessons of life cf . Sir : ; : , and the worker of charity . At this moment the growing number of older people in different countries worldwide and the expected retirement of persons from various professions and the workplace provides older people_with a new opportunity in the apostolate . Involved in the task -isaia- their determination to overcome the temptation of taking refuge in a nostalgia in a never to return past or fleeing from present responsibility because of difficulties encountered in a world of one novelty after another . They must_always have a clear knowledge that_one s role in the Church and society does_not stop -atti_degli_apostoli- a certain age -atti_degli_apostoli- all , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- such times knows only new ways of application . As the Psalmist says : '' They still bring forth fruit in old age , they_are ever full of -sapienza- and green , to show that the Lord -isaia- upright '' Ps : . I repeat all that I said during the celebration of the Older People s Jubilee : '' Arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- an older age -isaia- to be considered a privilege : not_simply because not everyone has the good fortune to reach this stage in life , but_also , and above all , because this period provides real possibilities for better evaluating the past , for knowing and living more_deeply the Paschal Mystery , for becoming an example in the Church for the whole People of God . Despite the complex nature of the problems you face : a strength that progressively diminishes , the insufficiencies of social organizations , official legislation that comes late , or the lack of understanding by a self centered society , you are_not to feel yourselves as persons underestimated in the life of the Church or as passive objects in a fast paced world , but as participants -atti_degli_apostoli- a time of life which_-isaia- humanly and spiritually fruitful . You still have a mission to fulfill , a contribution to make . According to the divine plan , each_individual human_being lives a life of continual growth , from the beginning of existence to the moment -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the last breath -isaia- taken '' . Women and Men . The Synod Fathers gave special_attention to the status and role of women , with two purposes in mind : to themselves acknowledge and to invite all others to once_again acknowledge_the indispensable contribution of women to the building up of the Church and the development of society . They wished as well to work on a more specific analysis of women s participation in the life_and_mission of the Church . Making reference to Pope John XXIII , who saw women s greater consciousness of their_proper dignity and their entrance into public_life as signs of our_times , the Synod Fathers , when confronted with the various_forms of discrimination and marginization to which women are subjected simply because_they_are women , time and time again strongly affirmed the urgency to defend and to promote the personal_dignity of woman , and consequently , her equality with_man . If anyone has this_task of advancing the dignity of women in the Church and society , it -isaia- women themselves , who must recognize their responsibility as leading characters . There -isaia- still much effort to be done , in many parts_of_the_world and in various surroundings , to destroy that unjust and deleterious mentality which considers the human_being as a thing , as an object to buy and sell , as an instrument for selfish interests or for pleasure only . Women themselves , for the most part , are the prime victims of such a mentality . Only through openly acknowledging the personal_dignity of women -isaia-_the_first step taken to promote the full participation of women in Church life as well as in social and public_life . A more extensive and decisive response must_be_given to the demands made in the Exhortation Familiaris Consortio concerning the many discriminations of which women are the victims : '' Vigorous and incisive pastoral action must_be_taken by all to overcome completely these forms of discrimination so that the image of God that shines in all human_beings without exception may be fully respected '' . Along the same lines , the Synod Fathers stated : '' As an expression of her_mission the Church must stand firmly against all forms of discrimination and abuse of women '' . And again : '' The dignity of women , gravely wounded in public esteem , must be restored through effective respect_for the rights of the human_person and by putting the teaching of the Church into_practice '' . In particular when speaking of active and responsible participation in the life_and_mission of the Church , emphasis should be placed on what has_already_been stated and clearly urged by the Second Vatican Council : '' Since in our days women are taking an increasingly active share in the whole_life of society , it -isaia-_very important_that they participate more widely also in the various fields of the Church s apostolate '' . The awareness_that women with_their own gifts and tasks have_their own specific vocation , has increased and been deepened in the years following the Council and has found its fundamental inspiration in the Gospel and the Church s history . In fact , for the believer the Gospel , namely , the word and example of Jesus Christ , remains the necessary and decisive point of reference . In no other moment in history -isaia- this_fact more fruitful and innovative . Though not called to the apostolate of the Twelve , and thereby , to the ministerial priesthood , many women , nevertheless , accompanied Jesus in his_ministry and assisted the group of Apostles cf . Lk : , were present -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross cf . Lk : , assisted -atti_degli_apostoli- the burial of Christ cf . Lk : received and transmitted the message of resurrection on Easter morn cf . Lk : , and prayed with the apostles in the Cenacle awaiting Pentecost cf . From the evidence of the Gospel , the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- its origin detached herself from the culture of the time and called women to tasks connected_with spreading the gospel . In his letters the Apostle Paul even cites by name a great number of women for their various functions in service of the primitive Christian community cf . Rom : ; Phil : ; Col : and Cor : ; Tim : . '' If the witness of the Apostles founds the Church '' , stated Paul VI , '' the witness of women contributes greatly towards nourishing the faith of Christian communities '' . Both in her earliest days and in her successive development the Church , albeit in different_ways and with diverse emphases , has_always known women_who have exercised an oftentimes decisive role in the Church herself and accomplished tasks of considerable value on her behalf . History -isaia- marked by grand works , quite often lowly and hidden , but_not for this_reason any less decisive to the growth and the holiness of the Church . It -isaia- necessary_that this history continue , indeed that it be expanded and intensified in the face of the growing and widespread awareness of the personal_dignity of woman and her vocation , particularly in light of the urgency of a '' re evangelization '' and a major effort towards '' humanizing '' social relations . Gathering together the pronouncements of the Second Vatican Council , which reflect the Gospel s message and the Church s history , the Synod Fathers formulated , among others , this precise '' recommendation '' : '' It -isaia- necessary_that the Church recognize all the gifts of men_and_women for_her life_and_mission , and put them into_practice '' . And again , '' This Synod proclaims that the Church seeks the recognition and use of all the gifts , experiences and talents of men_and_women to make her_mission effective cf . Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation , '' . Anthropological and Theological Foundations . The condition that_will assure the rightful presence of woman in the Church and in society_-isaia- a more penetrating and accurate consideration of the anthropological foundation for masculinity and femininity with the intent of clarifying woman s personal identity in relation to man , that_-isaia- , a diversity yet mutual complementarity , not_only as it concerns roles to be held and functions to be performed , but_also , and more_deeply , as it concerns her make up and meaning as a person . The Synod Fathers have deeply felt this requirement , maintaining that '' the anthropological and theological foundations for resolving questions about the true significance and dignity of each sex require deeper study '' . Through committing herself to a reflection on the anthropological and theological basis of femininity , the Church enters the historic process of the various movements for the promotion of woman , and , in going to the very basic aspect of woman as a personal being , provides her most_precious contribution . But even before this_the Church intends , in such_a_way , to obey God , who created the individual '' in his image '' , '' male and female he created them '' Gen : and who intended that they_would accept the call of God to come to know , reverence and live his plan . It -isaia- a plan that '' from the beginning '' has_been indelibly imprinted in the very being of the human_person men_and_women and , therefore , in the make up , meaning and deepest workings of the individual . This most wise and loving plan must be explored to discover all its richness of content a richness that '' from the beginning '' came to be progressively manifested and realized in the whole history_of_salvation , and was brought to completion in '' the fullness_of_time '' , when '' God sent his Son , born of a woman '' Gal : . That '' fullness '' continues in history : God s plan_for woman -isaia- read and -isaia- to be read within_the context of the faith of the Church , and also , in the lives lived by so many Christian women today . Without forgetting the help that_can come from different human sciences and cultures , researchers because of an informed discernment , will_be_able to help gather and clarify the values and requirements that belong to the enduring essential aspects of women and those bound to evolve in history . The Second Vatican Council reminds us : '' The Church maintains that beneath all changes there_are_many realities which do not change ; these find_their ultimate foundation in Christ , who -isaia-_the_same yesterday , and today , and forever cf . The Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Woman gives much attention to the anthropological and theological foundation of woman s dignity as a person . The document seeks to again treat and develop the catechetical reflections of the Wednesday General Audiences devoted over a long period of time to the '' theology of the body '' , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time fulfilling a promise made in the Encyclical Redemptoris Mater and serving as a response to the request of the Synod Fathers . May the reading of the Apostolic Letter Mulieris Dignitatem , in particular , as a biblical theological meditation , be an incentive for everyone , both women and men , and especially_for those_who devote their_lives to the human sciences and theological disciplines , to pursue on the basis of the personal_dignity of man_and_woman and their mutual relationship , a critical study to better and more_deeply understand_the values and specific gifts of femininity and masculinity , not_only in the surroundings of social living but_also and above all in living as Christians and as members of the Church . This meditation on the anthropological and theological foundations of women ought to enlighten and guide the Christian response to the most frequently asked questions , oftentimes so crucial , on the '' place '' that women can have and ought to have in the Church and in society . It -isaia- quite clear from the words and attitude of Christ , which_are normative for the Church , that no discrimination exists on the level of an individual s relation to Christ , in which '' there_-isaia- neither male nor female ; for you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' Gal : and on the level of participation in the Church s life of grace and holiness , as Joel s prophecy fulfilled -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost wonderfully attests : '' I will pour out my spirit on all flesh ; your sons_and_daughters shall prophecy '' Joel : ; cf . As the Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Woman reads : '' Both women and men . are equally capable of receiving the outpouring of divine truth and love in the Holy Spirit . Both receive his salvific and sanctifying visits '' . Mission in the Church and in the World . In speaking about participation in the apostolic mission of the Church , there_-isaia- no doubt_that in virtue of Baptism and Confirmation , a woman as well as a man_-isaia- made a sharer in the threefold mission of Jesus Christ , Priest , Prophet and King , and -isaia- thereby charged and given the ability to fulfill the fundamental apostolate of the Church : evangelization . However , a woman -isaia- called to put to work in this apostolate the '' gifts '' which_are properly hers : first of all , the gift that_-isaia- her very dignity as a person exercised in word and testimony of life , gifts therefore , connected_with her vocation as a woman . In her participation in the life_and_mission of the Church a woman cannot receive the Sacrament of Orders , and therefore , cannot fulfil the proper function of the ministerial priesthood . This -isaia- a practice that the Church has_always found in the expressed will of Christ , totally free and sovereign , who called only men to be his_apostles ; a practice that_can be understood from the rapport between Christ , the Spouse , and his Bride , the Church . Here we are in the area of function , not of dignity and holiness . In fact , it must be maintained : '' Although the Church possesses a hierarchical structure , nevertheless this structure -isaia- totally ordered to the holiness of Christ s members '' . However , as Paul VI has_already said , '' We cannot change what our Lord did , nor his call to women ; but we can recognize and promote the role of women in the mission of evangelization and in the life of the Christian community . Above all the acknowledgment in theory of the active and responsible presence of woman in the Church must be realized in practice . With this in mind this Exhortation addressed to the lay_faithful with its deliberate and repeated use of the terms '' women and men '' , must be read . Furthermore the revised Code of Canon Law contains many provisions on the participation of women in the life_and_mission of the Church : they_are provisions that_must be more commonly known and , according to the diverse sensibilities of culture and opportuneness in a pastoral situation , be realized with_greater timeliness and determination . An example comes to mind in the participation of women on diocesan and parochial Pastoral Councils as well as Diocesan Synods and particular Councils . In this_regard the Synod Fathers have written : '' Without discrimination women should be participants in the life of the Church , and also in consultation and the process of coming to decisions '' . And again : '' Women , who already hold places of great_importance in transmitting the faith and offering every_kind of service in the life of the Church , ought to be associated in the preparation of pastoral and missionary documents and ought to be recognized as cooperators in the mission_of_the_church in the family , in professional life and in the civil community '' . In the more specific area of evangelization and catechesis the particular work that women have in the transmission of the faith , not_only in the family but_also in the various educational environments , -isaia- to be more strongly fostered . In broader terms , this should be applied in all that regard embracing the Word of God , its understanding and its communication , as well as its study , research and theological teaching . While she_-isaia- to fulfill her duty to evangelize , woman -isaia- to feel more acutely her need to be evangelized . Thus , with_her vision illumined by faith cf . Eph : , woman -isaia- to be able to distinguish what truly responds to her dignity as a person and to her vocation from all that , under the pretext of this '' dignity '' and in the name of '' freedom '' and '' progress '' , militates against true values . On the contrary , these false values become responsible_for the moral degradation of the person , the environment and society . This same '' discernment '' , made possible and demanded from Christian women s participation in the prophetic mission of Christ and his Church , recurs with continued urgency throughout history . This '' discernment '' , often mentioned by the Apostle Paul , -isaia-_not_only a matter of evaluating reality and events in the light_of_faith , but_also involves a real decision and obligation to employ it , not_only in Church life but_also in human_society . It can_be_said that the problems of today_s_world already cited in the second part of the Council s Constitution Gaudium et Spes , which remain unresolved and not -atti_degli_apostoli- all affected by the passage of time , must witness the presence and commitment of women with_their irreplaceable and customary contributions . In particular , two great tasks entrusted to women merit the attention of everyone . First of all , the task of bringing full dignity to the conjugal lite and to motherhood . Today new possibilities are opened to women for a deeper_understanding and a richer realization of human and Christian values implied in the conjugal life and the experience of motherhood . Man himself husband and father can be helped to overcome forms of absenteeism and of periodic presence as well as a partial fulfilment of parental responsibilities indeed he can be involved in new and significant relations of interpersonal communion precisely as a result of the intelligent , loving and decisive intervention of woman . Secondly , women have_the task of assuring the moral dimension of culture , the dimension , namely of a culture worthy of the person , of an individual yet social_life . The Second Vatican Council seems to connect the moral dimension of culture with the participation of the lay_faithful in the kingly mission of Christ : '' Let the lay_faithful by their combined efforts remedy the institutions and conditions of the world when_the latter are an inducement to sin , that all such things may be conformed to the norms of justice , and may favor the practice of virtue rather_than hindering it . By so doing , they_will infuse culture and human works with a moral value '' . As women increasingly participate more_fully and responsibly in the activities of institutions which_are associated_with safeguarding the basic duty to human values in various communities , the words of the Council just quoted point to an important field in the apostolate of women : in all aspects of the life of such communities , from the socio economic to the sociopolitical dimension , the personal_dignity of woman and her specific vocation ought to be respected and promoted . Likewise this should be the case in living situations not_only affecting the individual but_also communities , not_only in forms left to personal freedom and responsibility , but_even in those guaranteed by just civil laws . '' It -isaia- not good for_man to be alone : let us make him a helper fit for him '' Gen : . God entrusted the human_being to woman . Certainly , every_human_being -isaia- entrusted to each_and_every other human_being , but in a special_way the human_being -isaia- entrusted to woman , precisely_because the woman in virtue of her special experience of motherhood -isaia- seen to have a specific sensitivity towards_the human_person and all that constitutes the individual s true welfare , beginning with the fundamental value of life . How great are the possibilities and responsibilities of woman in this area , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the development of science and technology -isaia- not_always inspired and measured by true wisdom , with the inevitable risk of '' de humanizing '' human_life , above all when it would demand a more intense love and a more generous acceptance . The participation of women in the life of the Church and society in the sharing of her gifts -isaia- likewise the path necessary of her personal fulfillment on which so many justly insist today and the basic contribution of woman to the enrichment of Church communion and the dynamism in the apostolate of the People of God . From this perspective the presence also of men , together_with women , ought to be considered . The Presence and Collaboration of Men Together with Women . Many voices were raised in the Synod Hall expressing the fear that excessive insistence given to the status and role of women would lead to an unacceptable omission , that , in point , regarding men . In reality , various sectors in the Church must lament the absence or the scarcity of the presence of men , some of whom abdicate their_proper Church responsibilities , allowing them to be fulfilled only by women . Such instances are participation in the liturgical prayer of the Church , education and , in particular , catechesis of their_own sons_and_daughters and other children , presence -atti_degli_apostoli- religious and cultural meetings , and collaboration in charitable and missionary initiatives . Therefore , the coordinated presence of both men_and_women -isaia- to be pastorally urged so that the participation of the lay_faithful in the salvific mission of the Church might be rendered more rich , complete and harmonious . The fundamental reason_that requires and explains the presence and the collaboration of both men_and_women -isaia-_not_only , as it was just emphasized , the major source of meaning and efficacy in the pastoral action of the Church , nor even less -isaia- it the simple sociological fact of sharing a life together as human_beings , which_-isaia- natural for man_and_woman . It -isaia- , rather , the original plan of the Creator who from the '' beginning '' willed the human_being to be a '' unity of the two '' , and willed man_and_woman to be the prime community of persons , source of every_other community , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to be a '' sign '' of that interpersonal communion of love_which constitutes the mystical , intimate life of God , One in Three . Precisely for this_reason , the most common and widespread way , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , fundamental way , to assure this coordinated and harmonious presence of men_and_women in the life_and_mission of the Church , -isaia- the fulfilment of the tasks and responsibilities of the couple and the Christian family , in which_the variety of diverse forms of life and love_-isaia- seen and communicated : conjugal , paternal and maternal , filial and familial . We read in the Exhortation Familiaris Consortio : '' Since the Christian family_-isaia- a community in which_the relationships are renewed by Christ through_faith and the sacraments , the family s sharing in the Church s mission should follow a community pattern : the spouses together as a couple , the parents and children as a family , must live their service to the Church and to the world . The Christian family also builds up the Kingdom of God in history through the everyday realities that concern and distinguish its state of life : it -isaia- thus in the love between husband_and_wife and between members of the family a love lived out in all its extraordinary richness of values and demands : totality , oneness , fidelity and fruitfulness that the Christian family s participation in the prophetic , priestly and kingly mission of Jesus Christ and of his Church finds expression and realization '' . From this perspective , the Synod Fathers have recalled the meaning that the Sacrament of Matrimony ought to assume in the Church and society in order to illuminate and inspire all the relations_between men_and_women . In this_regard they_have emphasized an '' urgent_need for_every Christian to live and proclaim_the message of hope contained in the relation between man_and_woman . The Sacrament of Matrimony , which consecrates this relation in its conjugal form and reveals it as a sign of the relation of Christ with_his Church , contains a teaching of great_importance for the Church s life a teaching that ought to reach today_s_world through the Church ; all those relations_between man_and_woman must be imbued by this_spirit . The Church should even more_fully rely on the riches found here '' . These same Fathers have rightly emphasized that '' the esteem_for virginity and reverence for motherhood must be respectively restored '' , and still again they_have called_for the development of diverse and complementary vocations in the living context of Church communion and in the service of its continued growth . The Sick and the Suffering . People are_called to joy . Nevertheless , each_day they experience many forms of suffering and pain . The Synod Fathers in addressing men_and_women affected by these various_forms of suffering and pain used the following words in their final Message : '' You who_are the abandoned and pushed to the edges of our consumer society ; you who_are sick , people_with disabilities , the poor and hungry , migrants and prisoners , refugees , unemployed , abandoned children and old people_who feel alone ; you who_are victims of war and all kinds of violence : the Church reminds you that_she shares your suffering . She takes it to the Lord , who in turn associates you with_his redeeming Passion . You are brought to life in the light of his_resurrection . We need you to teach the whole_world what love_-isaia- . We will do everything we can so that_you_may find your rightful place in the Church and in society '' . In the context of such a limitless world as human suffering , We now turn our attention to all those struck down by sickness in its various_forms : sickness -isaia- indeed the most frequent and common expression of human suffering . The Lord addresses his call to each_and_every one . Even the sick are sent forth as labourers into the Lord s vineyard : the weight that wearies the body s members and dissipates the soul s serenity -isaia- far from dispensing a person from working in the vineyard . Instead the sick are_called to live their human and Christian vocation and to participate in the growth of the Kingdom of God in a new and even_more valuable manner . The words_of_the_apostle Paul ought to become their approach to life or , better yet , cast an illumination to permit them to see the meaning of grace in their_very situation : '' In my flesh I complete what_-isaia- lacking in Christ s afflictions for the sake of his_body , that_-isaia- , the Church '' Col : . Precisely in arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- this realization , the apostle -isaia- raised up in joy : '' I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake '' Col : . In the same_way many of the sick can become bearers of the '' joy inspired by the Holy Spirit in much affliction '' Thes : and witnesses to Jesus resurrection . A handicapped person expressed these sentiments in a presentation in the Synod Hall : '' It -isaia- very_important to make clear_that Christians who_live in situations of illness , pain and old age are_called by God not_only to unite their suffering to Christ s Passion but_also to receive in themselves now , and to transmit to others , the power of renewal and the joy of the risen Christ cf . On the Church s part as it reads in the Apostolic Letter Salvifici Doloris '' Born in the mystery of Redemption in the Cross of Christ , the Church has to try to meet man in a special_way on the path of suffering . In this meeting man becomes_the way_for the Church , and this_-isaia- one_of_the_most important ways '' . At this moment the suffering individual -isaia-_the_way of the Church because that person_-isaia- , first of all , the way of Christ Himself , who_-isaia- the Good Samaritan who '' does_not pass by '' , but '' has compassion on him , went to him . bound up his wounds . took care of him '' Lk : . From century to century the Christian community in revealing and communicating its healing love and the consolation of Jesus Christ has reenacted the gospel parable of the Good Samaritan in caring for the vast multitude of persons_who are sick and suffering . This came about through the untiring commitment of all those_who_have taken care of the sick and suffering as a result of science and the medical arts as well as the skilled and generous service of healthcare workers . Today there_-isaia- an increase in the presence of lay women and men in Catholic hospital and healthcare institutions . At times the lay_faithful s presence in these institutions -isaia- total and exclusive . It -isaia- to just such people doctors , nurses , other healthcare workers , volunteers that the call becomes_the living signof Jesus Christ and his Church in showing love towards_the sick and suffering . Renewed Pastoral Action . It -isaia- necessary_that this most_precious heritage , which_the Church has received_from Jesus Christ , '' Physician of the body and the spirit '' , must_never diminish but always must come to be more valued and enriched through renewal and decisive initiatives of pastoral_activity for and with the sick and suffering . This activity must be capable of sustaining and fostering attention , nearness , presence , listening , dialogue , sharing , and real help toward individuals in moments when sickness and suffering sorely test not_only faith in life but_also faith in God and his_love as Father . Such pastoral initiatives find most meaningful expression in sacramental celebrations with and for the sick , as a source of strength amid pain and weakness , hope amid despair , and as an occasion of joyful encounter . One of the basic objectives of this renewed and intensified pastoral action , which_must involve all components of the ecclesial_community in a coordinated way , -isaia- an attitude which looks upon the sick person , the bearer of a handicap , or the suffering individual , not_simply as an object of the Church s love and service , but as an active and responsible participant in the work_of_evangelization and salvation . From this perspective the Church has to let_the good_news resound within a society and culture , which , having lost the sense of human suffering , '' censors '' all talk on such a hard reality of life . Thegood news -isaia- the proclamation that suffering can even have a positive meaning for the individual and for society itself , since each person_-isaia- called to a form of participation in the salvific suffering of Christ and in the joy of resurrection , as well as , thereby , to become a force for the sanctification and building up of the Church . The proclamation of this good_news gains credibility when_it_-isaia- not_simply voiced in words , but passes into a testimony of life , both in the case of all those_who lovingly care_for the sick , the handicapped and the suffering , as well as the suffering themselves who_are increasingly made more conscious and responsible of their place and task within and on behalf of the Church . In order_that '' the civilization of love '' can flourish and produce fruit in this vast world of human pain , I invite all to reread and meditate on the Apostolic Letter , Salvifici Doloris , from which I -amos- pleased to again propose the lines from its conclusion : '' There should come together in spirit beneath the Cross of Calvary all suffering people who_believe in Christ , and particularly those who_suffer because_of_their faith in him_who_-isaia- the Crucified and Risen One , so that the offering of their sufferings may hasten the fulfilment of the prayer of the Saviour himself that all may be one . Let there also gather beneath the Cross all people_of_good_will , for on this Cross -isaia- the Redeemer of Man , the Man of Sorrows , who has_taken upon himself_the physical and moral sufferings of the people of all times , so that in love they_may find the salvific meaning of their sorrow and valid answers to all their questions . Together with Mary , Mother of Christ , who stood beneath the Cross , we pause beside all the crosses of contemporary man and we ask all of you who_suffer to support us . We ask precisely you who_are weak to become a source of strength for the Church and humanity . In the terrible battle between_the forces of good_and_evil revealed to our_eyes by our modern_world , may your sufferings in union with the Cross of Christ be victorious '' . The States of Life and Vocations . All the members of the People of God clergy , men_and_women_religious , the lay faithful_are labourers in the vineyard . At one_and_the_same time they all are the goal and subjects of Church communion as well as of participation in the mission of salvation . Every one of us possessing charisms and ministries , diverse yet complementary , works in the one_and_the_same vineyard of the Lord . Simply in being Christians , even before actually doing the works of a Christian , all are branches of the one fruitful vine which_-isaia- Christ . All are living members of the one Body of the Lord built up through the power of the Spirit . The significance of '' being '' a Christian does_not come about simply from the life of grace and holiness which_-isaia- the primary and more productive source of the apostolic and missionary fruitfulness of Holy Mother Church . Its meaning also arises from the state of life_that characterizes the clergy , men_and_women_religious , members of secular institutes and the lay_faithful . In Church Communion the states of life by being ordered one to the other are thus bound together among_themselves . They all share in a deeply basic meaning : that of being the manner of living out the commonly shared Christian dignity and the universal call to holiness in the perfection of love . They are different yet complementary , in the sense_that each of them has a basic and unmistakable character which sets each apart , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time each of them -isaia- seen in relation to the other and placed -atti_degli_apostoli- each_other s service . Thus the lay state of life has its distinctive feature in its secular character . It fulfills an ecclesial service in bearing_witness and , in its_own way recalling for priests , women and men religious , the significance of the earthly and temporal realities in the salvific plan of God . In turn , the ministerial priesthood represents in different times and places , the permanent guarantee of the sacramental presence of Christ , the Redeemer . The religious state bears_witness to the eschatological character of the Church , that_-isaia- , the straining towards_the Kingdom of God that_-isaia- prefigured and in some_way anticipated and experienced even_now through the vows of chastity , poverty and obedience . All the states of life , whether taken collectively or individually in relation to the others , are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church s growth . While different in expression they_are deeply united in the Church s '' mystery of communion '' and are dynamically coordinated in its unique mission . Thus in the diversity of the states of life and the variety of vocations this_same , unique mystery of the Church reveals and experiences anew the infinite richness of the mystery of Jesus Christ . The Fathers were fond of referring to the Church as a field of a pleasing and wonderful variety of herbs , plants , flowers and fruits . Saint Ambrose writes : '' A field produces many fruits , but the one_which has an abundance of both fruits and flowers -isaia- far better . The field of holy Church -isaia- fruitful in both one and the other . In this_field there_are the priceless buds of virginity blossoming forth , widowhood stands out boldly as the forest in the plain ; elsewhere the rich harvest of weddings blessed by the Church fills the great granary of the world with abundant produce , and the wine presses of the Lord Jesus overflow with the grapes of a productive vine , enriches Christian marriages '' . The Various Vocations in the Lay State . The Church s rich variety -isaia- manifested still further from within each state of life . Thus within_the lay state diverse '' vocations '' are given , that_-isaia- , there_are different paths in the spiritual_life and the apostolate which_are taken by individual members of the lay_faithful . In the field of a '' commonly shared '' lay vocation '' special '' lay vocations flourish . In this area we can_also recall_the spiritual experience of the flourishing of diverse forms of secular institutes that_have developed recently in the Church . These offer the lay_faithful , and even priests , the possibility of professing the evangelical_counsels of poverty , chastity and obedience through vows or promises , while fully maintaining one s lay or clerical state . In this_regard the Synod Fathers have commented , '' The Holy Spirit stirs up other_forms of self_giving to which people_who remain fully in the lay state devote_themselves '' . We can conclude by reading a beautiful passage taken from Saint Francis de Sales , who promoted lay spirituality so well . In speaking of '' devotion '' , that_-isaia- , Christian perfection or '' life according to the Spirit '' , he presents in a simple yet insightful way the vocation of all Christians to holiness while emphasizing the specific form with_which individual Christians fulfill it : '' In creation God commanded the plants to bring forth their fruits , each_one after its kind . So does he command all Christians , who_are the living plants of his Church , to bring forth the fruits of devotion , each according_to_his character and vocation . Devotion must be exercised in different_ways by the gentleman , the workman , the servant , the prince , the widow , the maid and the married woman . Not only this , but the practice of devotion must_also be adapted to the strength , the employment , and the duties of each_one in particular . It -isaia- an error , or rather a heresy , to try to banish the devout life from the regiment of soldiers , the shop of the mechanic , the court of princes , or the home of married folk . It -isaia- true , Philothea , that a purely contemplative , monastic and religious devotion cannot be exercised in such ways of life . But besides these three kinds of devotion , there_are several others adapted to bring to perfection those_who live in the secular state '' . Along the same line the Second Vatican Council states : '' This lay spirituality should_take its particular character from the circumstances of one s state in life married and familylife , celibacy , widowhood , from one s state of health and from one s professional and social activity . All should_not cease to develop earnestly the qualities and talents bestowed on them in accord with_these conditions of life and should make_use of the gifts which_they_have received_from_the Holy Spirit '' . What has been_said about the spiritual vocation can_also be said and to a certain degree with_greater reason of the infinite number of ways through_which all members of the Church are employed as labourers in the vineyard of the Lord , building up the Mystical Body of Christ . Indeed as a person with a truly unique lifestory , each -isaia- called by name , to make a special contribution to the coming of the Kingdom of God . No talent , no matter how small , -isaia- to be hidden or left unused cf . In this_regard the apostle Peter gives us a stern warning : '' As each has_received a gift , employ it for one_another , as good stewards of God s varied grace '' Pt : . CHAPTER V THAT YOU BEAR MUCH FRUITThe Formation of the Lay Faithful in the Lay State A Continual Process of Maturation . The gospel image of the vine and the branches reveals to us another fundamental aspect of the lay_faithful s life_and_mission : the call to growth and a continual process of maturation , of always bearing much fruit . As a diligent vinedresser , the Father takes care of his vine . God s solicitude -isaia- so ardently called_upon by Israel , that_she prays : '' Turn again , O God of hosts ! Look down from heaven , and see ; have regard_for this vine , the stock which your right hand has planted '' Ps : . Jesus himself speaks of the Father s work : '' I -amos- the true vine , and my Father -isaia- the vinedresser . Every branch of mine that bears no fruit , he takes away . and every branch that does bear_fruit , he prunes that_it_may bear more fruit '' Jn : . The vitality of the branches depends on their remaining attached to the vine , which_-isaia- Jesus Christ : '' He who abides in me and I in him bears much fruit , for apart_from me you can do nothing '' Jn : . People are approached in liberty by God who calls everyone to grow , develop and bear_fruit . A person cannot put off a response nor cast off personal responsibility in the matter . The solemn words of Jesus refer to this exalted and serious responsibility : '' If a man does_not abide in me , he -isaia- cast forth as a branch and withers ; and the branches are gathered , thrown into the fire and burned '' Jn : . In this dialogue_between God who offers his gifts , and the person who_-isaia- called to exercise responsibility , there comes the possibility , indeed the necessity , of a total and ongoing_formation of the lay_faithful , as the Synod Fathers have rightly emphasized in much of their_work . After having described Christian formation as '' a continual process in the individual of maturation in faith and a likening to Christ , according to the will of the Father , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit '' , they_have clearly affirmed that the formation of the lay_faithful must be placed among the priorities of a diocese . It ought to be so placed within_the plan of pastoral action that the efforts of the whole community clergy , lay_faithful and religious converge on this goal '' . To Discover and Live One s Vocation and Mission . The fundamental objective of the formation of the lay_faithful -isaia- an ever clearer discovery of one s vocation and the ever_greater willingness to live it so as to fulfil one s mission . God calls me and sends me forth as a labourer in his vineyard . He calls me and sends me forth to work_for the coming of his Kingdom in history . This personal vocation and mission defines the dignity and the responsibility of each member of the lay_faithful and makes up the focal point of the whole work of formation , whose purpose -isaia- the joyous and grateful recognition of this dignity and the faithful and generous living out of this responsibility . In fact , from eternity God has thought of us and has loved us as unique individuals . Every one of us he called by name , as the Good Shepherd '' calls his sheep by name '' Jn : . However , only in the unfolding of the history of our_lives and its events -isaia- the eternal plan of God revealed to each of us . Therefore , it -isaia- a gradual process ; in a certain_sense , one_that happens day_by_day . To be able to discover the actual will of the Lord in our_lives always involves the following : a receptive listening to the Word of God and the Church , fervent and constant prayer , recourse to a wise and loving spiritual guide , and a faithful discernment of the gifts and talents given by God , as well as the diverse social and historic situations in which one lives . Therefore , in the life of each member of the lay_faithful there_are particularly significant and decisive moments for discerning God s call and embracing the mission entrusted by Him . Among these_are the periods of adolescence and young adulthood . No one_must forget_that the Lord , as the master of the labourers in the vineyard , calls -atti_degli_apostoli- every hour of life so as to make his holy will more precisely and explicitly known . Therefore , the fundamental and continuous attitude of the disciple should be one of vigilance and a conscious attentiveness to the voice of God . It -isaia- not a question of simply knowing what God wants from each of us in the various situations of life . The individual must do what God wants , as we are reminded in the words that Mary , the Mother of Jesus , addressed to the servants -atti_degli_apostoli- Cana : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . However , to act in fidelity to God s will requires a capability for acting and the developing of that capability . We can rest assured that_this_-isaia- possible through the free and responsible collaboration of each of us with the grace of the Lord which_-isaia- never lacking . Saint Leo the Great says : '' The one_who confers the dignity will_give the strength ! '' . This , then , -isaia- the marvelous yet demanding task awaiting all the lay_faithful and all Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment : to grow always in the knowledge of the richness of Baptism and faith as well as to live it more_fully . In referring to birth and growth as two stages in the Christian life the apostle Peter makes_the following exhortation : '' Like newborn babes , long for the pure spiritual milk , that by it you_may grow up to salvation '' Pt : . A Total Integrated Formation for Living an Integrated Life . In discovering and living their_proper vocation and mission , the lay_faithful must be formed according to the union which exists from their being members of the Church and citizens of human_society . There cannot be two parallel lives in their existence : on the one_hand , the so called '' spiritual '' life , with its values and demands ; and on the other , the so called '' secular '' life , that_-isaia- , life in a family , -atti_degli_apostoli- work , in social relationships , in the responsibilities of public_life and in culture . The branch , engrafted to the vine which_-isaia- Christ , bears its fruit in every sphere of existence and activity . In fact , every area of the lay_faithful s lives , as different as they_are , enters into the plan of God , who desires that_these very areas be the '' places in time '' where_the love of Christ -isaia-_revealed and realized for both the glory of the Father and service of others . Every activity , every situation , every precise responsibility as , for example , skill and solidarity in work , love and dedication in the family and the education of children , service to society and public_life and the promotion of truth in the area of culture are the occasions ordained by Providence for a '' continuous exercise of faith , hope and charity '' . The Second Vatican Council has invited all the lay_faithful to this_unity of life by forcefully decrying the grave consequences in separating faith from life , and the gospel from culture : '' The Council exhorts Christians , as citizens of one city and the other , to strive to perform their earthly duties faithfully in response to the spirit of the Gospel . They are mistaken who , knowing that_we_have here no abiding city but seek one which_-isaia- to come , think that_they_may therefore shirk their earthly responsibilities ; for they_are forgetting that by faith itself they_are more_than_ever obliged to measure up to these duties , each according to one s vocation . This split between_the faith_which many profess and their_daily lives deserves to be counted among the more_serious errors of our_age '' . Therefore , I have maintained that a faith_that does_not affect a person s culture -isaia- a faith '' not fully embraced , not entirely thought out , not faithfully lived '' . Various Aspects of Formation . The many interrelated aspects of a totally integrated formation of the lay faithful_are situated within this_unity of life . There -isaia- no doubt_that spiritual formation ought to occupy a privileged place in a person s life . Everyone -isaia- called to grow continually in intimate_union with Jesus Christ , in conformity to the Father s will , in devotion to others in charity and justice . The Council writes : '' This life of intimate_union with Christ in the Church -isaia- nourished by spiritual helps available to all the faithful , especially by active participation in the liturgy . Lay people should so make_use of these helps in such_a_way_that , while properly fulfilling their secular duties in the ordinary conditions of life , they_do_not disassociate union with Christ from that life , but through the very performance of their tasks according to God s will , may_they actually grow in it '' . The situation today points to an ever_increasing urgency for a doctrinal formation of the lay_faithful , not_simply in a better understanding which_-isaia- natural to faith s dynamism but_also in enabling them to '' give a reason_for their hoping '' in view of the world and its grave and complex problems . Therefore , a systematic approach to catechesis , geared to age and the diverse situations of life , -isaia- an absolute necessity , as -isaia- a more decided Christian promotion of culture , in response to the perennial yet always new questions that concern individuals and society today . This -isaia-_especially true for the lay faithful_who have responsibilities in various fields of society and public_life . Above all , it -isaia- indispensable that_they_have a more exact knowledge and this demands a more widespread and precise presentation of the Church s social_doctrine , as repeatedly stressed by the Synod Fathers in their presentations . They refer to the participation of the lay_faithful in public_life , in the following words : '' But for the lay_faithful to take up actively this noble purpose in political matters , it -isaia-_not_enough to exhort them . They must be offered a proper formation of a social conscience , especially in the Church s social_teaching , which contains principles of reflection , criteria for judging and practical directives cf . Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , Instruction of Christian Freedom and Liberation , , and which_must be present in general catechetical instruction and in specialized gatherings , as well as in schools and universities . Nevertheless , this social_doctrine of the Church -isaia- dynamic ; that_-isaia- , adapted to circumstances of time_and_place . It -isaia- the right and duty of Pastors to propose moral principles even concerning the social_order and of all Christians to apply them in defence of human_rights Nevertheless , active participation in political parties -isaia- reserved to the lay_faithful '' . The cultivation of human values finds a place in the context of a totally integrated formation , bearing a particular significance for the missionary and apostolic activities of the lay_faithful . In this_regard the Council wrote : '' the lay_faithful should_also hold in high esteem professional skill , family and civic spirit , and the virtues related to social behaviour , namely , honesty , a spirit of justice , sincerity , courtesy , moral courage ; without them there_-isaia- no true Christian life '' . In bringing their_lives into an organic synthesis , which_-isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time , the manifestation of the unity of '' who they_are '' in the Church and society as well as the condition_for the effective fulfilment of their_mission , the lay faithful_are to be guided interiorly and sustained by the Holy Spirit , who_-isaia- the Spirit of unity and fullness of life . Collaborators with God the Teacher . Where are the lay_faithful formed ? What are the means of their formation ? Who are the persons and the communities called_upon to assume the task of a totally integrated formation of the lay_faithful ? Just as the work of human education -isaia- intimately connected_with fatherhood and motherhood , so Christian formation finds_its origin and its strength in God the Father who loves and educates his_children . Yes , God -isaia-_the_first and great teacher of his People , as it states in the striking passage of the Song of Moses : '' He found him in a desert land and in the howling waste of the wilderness ; he encircled him , he cared for him , he kept him as the apple of his eye . Like an eagle that stirs up its nest , that flutters over its young , spreading out its wings , catching them , bearing them on its pinions , the Lord alone did lead him , and there_was no foreign God with_him '' Deut : ; cf . God s work in forming his_people -isaia-_revealed and fulfilled in Jesus Christ the Teacher , and reaches to the depths of every_individual s heart as a result of the living presence of the Spirit . Mother Church -isaia- called to take_part in the divine work of formation , both through a sharing of her very life , and through_her various pronouncements and actions . It -isaia- thus that the lay faithful_are formed by the Church andin the Church in a mutual communion and collaboration of all her members : clergy , religious and lay_faithful . Thus the whole ecclesial_community , in its diverse members , receives the fruitfulness of the Spirit and actively cooperates towards that end . With this in mind Methodius of Olympo wrote : '' Those not_yet perfected are carried and formed by those more_perfect , as in the womb of a mother , until the time they_are generated and brought forth for the greatness and beauty of virtue '' . This happened with Saint Paul , who_was carried and brought forth in the Church by those_who were perfected in the person of Ananias and , then Paul in his turn , became perfected and fruitful in bringing forth many children . First of all the Church -isaia- a teacher , in which_the Pope takes the '' primary '' role in the formation of the lay_faithful . As successor of Saint Peter , he has the ministry of '' confirming his_brothers in the faith '' , instructing all believers in the essential content of vocation and mission in light of the Christian faith and membership in the Church . Therefore , not_simply the words coming directly from him , but_also those transmitted by the various departments of the Holy See call_for a loving and receptive hearing by the lay_faithful . The one and universal Church -isaia- present in various parts_of_the_world , in and through the particular Churches . In each of them the Bishop in his person has a responsibility towards_the lay_faithful , in forming the animation and guidance of their Christian life through the proclamation of the Word and the celebration of the Eucharist and the Sacraments . Situated and -atti_degli_apostoli- work within_the particular Church or diocese -isaia- the Parish which_has the essential task of a more personal and immediate formation of the lay_faithful . In fact , because_it_-isaia- in the position to reach more_easily individual persons and singular groups , the parish -isaia- called to instruct its_members in hearing God s Word , in liturgical and personal dialogue_with God , in the life of fraternal charity , and in allowing a more direct and concrete perception of the sense of ecclesial_communion and responsibility in the Church s mission . Internal to the parish , especially if vast and territorially extensive , small Church communities , where present , can be a notable help in the formation of Christians , by providing a consciousness and an experience of ecclesial_communion and mission which_are more extensive and incisive . The Synod Fathers have_said that a post baptismal catechesis in the form of a catechumenate can_also be helpful by presenting again some elements from the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults with the purpose of allowing a person to grasp and live the immense , extraordinary richness and responsibility received -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism . In the formation that the lay_faithful receive from their diocese and parish , especially concerning communion and mission , the help that diverse members of the Church can_give to each_other -isaia- particularly important . This mutual help also aids in revealing the mystery of the Church as Mother and Teacher . Priests and religious ought to assist the lay_faithful in their formation . In this_regard the Synod Fathers have invited priests and candidates_for Orders to '' be prepared carefully so that_they_are ready to foster the vocation and mission of the lay_faithful '' . In turn , the lay_faithful themselves can and should help priests and religious in the course of their_spiritual and pastoral journey . Other Places for Formation . The Christian family , as the '' domestic Church '' , also makes up a natural and fundamental school for formation in the faith : father and mother receive from the Sacrament of Matrimony the grace and the ministry of the Christian education of their_children , before whom_they bear_witness and to whom_they transmit both human and religious values . While learning their first words , children learn also the praise of God , whom_they feel -isaia- near them as a loving and providential Father ; while learning the first acts of love , children also learn to open themselves to others , and through the gift_of_self receive the sense of living as a human_being . The daily life_itself of a truly Christian family makes up the first '' experience of Church '' , intended to find confirmation and development in an active and responsible process of the children s introduction into the wider ecclesial_community and civil_society . The more that Christian spouses and parents grow in the awareness_that their '' domestic church '' participates in the life_and_mission of the universal Church , so much the more will their sons_and_daughters be able to be formed in a '' sense of the Church '' and will perceive all the beauty of dedicating their energies to the service of the Kingdom of God . Schools and Catholic universities , as well as centers of spiritual renewal which_are becoming ever_more widespread in these_days , are_also important places for formation . In the present social and historical context which_-isaia- marked by an extensively deep cultural involvement , the Synod Fathers have emphasized that parents participation in school life besides being always necessary and without substitution -isaia-_no_longer enough . What -isaia- needed -isaia- to prepare the lay_faithful to dedicate themselves to the work of rearing their_children as a true and proper part of Church mission . What -isaia- needed -isaia- to constitute and develop this '' formation community '' which_-isaia- together comprised of parents , teachers , clergy , women and men religious and representatives of youth . In order_that the school can suitably fulfill its natural function in formation , the lay_faithful ought to feel charged to demand from everyone and for everyone a true freedom in education , even through opportune civil legislation . The Synod Fathers expressed words of esteem and encouragement to all those lay_faithful , both women and men , who with a civic and Christian spirit , fulfill a task which_-isaia- involved in the education of children both in schools and institutes of formation . In addition they_have emphasized the urgent_need in various schools , whether Catholic or not , for teachers and professors among the lay_faithful to be true witnesses of the gospel , through_their example of life , their professional competence and uprightness , their Christian inspired teaching , preserving always as -isaia- obvious the autonomy of various sciences and disciplines . It -isaia- of singular importance that scientific and technological research done by the faithful be correct from the standpoint of service to an individual in the totality of the context of one s values and needs : to these lay_faithful the Church entrusts the task of allowing all to better understand_the intimate bond that exists between_faith and science , between_the gospel and human culture . '' This Synod '' we read in the proposition '' appeals to the prophetic task of Catholic schools and universities , and praises teachers and professors , now lay_people for the most part , for their dedication to maintaining institutes of Catholic education that_can form men_and_women in whom_the new commandment -isaia- enfleshed . The simultaneous presence of clergy , the lay_faithful and men_and_women_religious , offers students a vivid image of the Church and makes recognition of its riches easier cf . Congregation for Catholic Education , Concerning the Lay Educator , Witness of Faith in the Schools '' . Groups , associations and movements also have_their place in the formation of the lay_faithful . In fact they_have the possibility , each with its_own method , of oflfering a formation through a deeply shared experience in the apostolic_life , as well as having the opportunity to integrate , to make concrete and specific the formation that_their members receive from other persons and communities . The Reciprocal Formation Received and Given by All . Formation -isaia- not the privilege of a few , but a right and duty of all . In this_regard the Synod Fathers have_said : '' Possibilities of formation should be proposed to all , especially_the poor , who can_also be a source of formation for all '' ; and they added : '' Suitable means to help each_person fulfill a full , human and Christian vocation should be applied to formation '' . For the purpose of a truly incisive and effective pastoral_activity the formation of those_who will form others -isaia- to be developed through appropriate courses or suitable schools . Forming those_who , in turn , will be given the responsibility_for the formation of the lay_faithful , constitutes a basic requirement of assuring the general and widespread formation of all the lay_faithful . According to the explicit invitation of the Synod Fathers special_attention ought to be devoted to the local culture in the work of formation : '' The formation of Christians will_take the greatest account of local human culture , which contributes to formation itself , and will_help to discern the value , whether implanted in tradition or proposed in modern affairs . Attention should be paid to diverse cultures which_can exist in one_and_the_same people or nation -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time . The Church , the mother and teacher of peoples , should strive to safeguard , where_the need exists , the culture of a less numerous people living in large nations when_the situation exists '' . In the work of formation some convictions reveal themselves as particularly necessary and fruitful . First of all , there_-isaia- the conviction_that one_cannot offer a true and effective formation to others if the individual has not taken on or developed a personal responsibility_for formation : this , in fact , -isaia- essentially a '' formation of self '' . In addition , there_-isaia- the conviction_that -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time each of us -isaia- the goal and principle of formation : the more we are formed and the more we feel the need to pursue and deepen our formation , still_more will we be formed and be rendered capable of forming others . It -isaia- particularly important to know_that the work of formation , while having intelligent recourse to the means and methods available from human science , -isaia- made more_effective the more it -isaia- open to the action of God . Only the branch which_does_not fear being pruned by the heavenly vinedresser can bear much fruit for the individual and for others . An Appeal and A Prayer . At the conclusion of this post Synodal document I once_again put forward the invitation of '' the householder '' , proposed in the gospel : You go into my vineyard too . It can_be_said that the significance of the Synod on the vocation and mission of the lay_faithful might very well consist in this call of the Lord which he addresses to eueryone , yet , in a particular_way to the lay_faithful , both women and men . The happenings -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod have_been a great spiritual experience for all the participants . The experience has_been that of a Church under the light and the power of the Spirit , intent on discerning and embracing the renewed call of her Lord so that_she can again propose to today_s_world , the mystery of her communion and the dynamism of her_mission of salvation , especially , by centering on the specific place and role of the lay_faithful . This Exhortation , then , intends to urge the most abundant possible fruitfulness from this Synod in every_part of the Church worldwide . This will come about as a result of an effective hearkening to the Lord s call by the entire People of God , in particular , by the lay_faithful . Therefore I make a strong appeal to one and all , Pastors and faithful , never to become tired of maintaining indeed always taking an active part to fix deeply in one s mind , heart and life an ecclesial consciousness , which_-isaia- ever mindful of what it means to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ , participants in her mystery of communion and in her dynamism in mission and the apostolate . It -isaia- of particular importance that all Christians be aware that_through Baptism they have_received an extraordinary dignity : through grace we are_called to be children loved by the Father , members incorporated in Christ and his Church , living and holy temples of the Spirit . With deep emotion and gratitude , we again hear_the words of John the Evangelist : '' See what love the Father has_given us , that_we_should be called children of God ; and so we are '' Jn : . While this '' Christian newness of life '' given to the members of the Church , constitutes for all the basis of their participation in the priestly , prophetic and kingly mission of Christ and of their_vocation to holines in love , it receives expression and -isaia- fulfilled in the lay_faithful through the '' secular character '' which_-isaia- '' uniquely and properly '' theirs . Besides imparting an awareness of a commonly shared Christian dignity , an ecclesial consciousness brings a sense of belonging to the mystery of the Church as Communion . This -isaia- a basic and undeniable aspect of the life_and_mission of the Church . For one and all the earnest prayer of Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper , '' That all may be one '' Jn , ought to become daily a required and undeniable programme of life and action . A real sense of Church communion , the gift of the Spirit that urges our free and generous response , will_bring forth as its precious fruit , in the '' one and catholic '' Church the continuing value of the rich variety of vocations and conditions of life , charisms , ministries , works , and responsibilities , as well as a more demonstrable and decisive collaboration of groups , associations and movements of the lay_faithful in keeping_with_the accomplishment of the commonly shared salvific mission of the Church herself . This communion_-isaia- already in itself the first great sign in the world of the presence of Christ , the Saviour . At the same_time , it promotes and stimulates the proper apostolic and missionary action of the Church . The whole Church , Pastors and lay_faithful alike , standing on the threshold of the Third Millennium , ought to feel more strong y the Church s responsibility to obey the command of Christ , '' Go into all the world and preach_the_gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : , and take up anew the missionary endeavour . A great venture , both challenging and wonderful , -isaia- entrusted to the Church that of a re evangelization , which_-isaia- so much needed by the present world . The lay_faithful ought to regard themselves as an active and responsible part of thisventure , called as they_are to proclaim and to live the gospel in service to the person and to society while respecting the totality of the values and needs of both . Since the Synod of Bishops was celebrated last October during the Marian Year , its work was entrusted in a very_special way to the intercession of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of the Redeemer . I too entrust the spiritual fruitfulness of the Synod to her prayerful intercession . Therefore , along_with the Synod Fathers , the lay_faithful present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod and all the other members of the People of God , I have_recourse -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this post Synodal document to the Virgin Mary . At this moment this appeal becomes a prayer : O Most Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of Christ and Mother of the Church , With joy and wonder we seek to make our_own your Magnificat , joining you in your hymn of thankfulness and love . With you we give thanks to God , '' whose mercyis from generation to generation '' , for the exalted vocationand the many forms of mission entrusted to the lay_faithful . God has called each of them by nameto live his_own communion of love and holinessand to be onein the great family of God s children . He has_sent them forthto shine with the light of Christand to communicate the fire of the Spiritin every_part of societythrough their_life inspired by the gospel . O Virgin of the Magnificat , fill their heartswith a gratitude and enthusiasmfor this vocation and mission . With humility and magnanimityyou were_the '' handmaid of the Lord '' ; give us your unreserved willingnessfor service to Godand the salvation of the world . Open our heartsto the great anticipationof the Kingdom of Godand of the proclamation of the Gospelto the whole of creation . Your mother s heartis ever mindful of the many dangersand evils which threatento overpower men and womenin our_time . At the same_time your heart also takes noticeof the many initiatives undertaken for good , the great yearning for values , and the progress achievedin bringing forththe abundant fruits of salvation . O Virgin full of courage , may your spiritual strengthand trust in God inspire us , so that we might knowhow to overcome all the obstacles that we encounterin accomplishing our mission . Teach us to treat the affairsof the worldwith a real sense of Christian responsibilityand a joyful hopeof the coming of God s Kingdom , andof a '' new heaven and a new earth '' . You who_were gathered in prayerwith the Apostles in the Cenacle , awaiting the comingof the Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost , implore his renewed outpouringon all the faithful , men_and_women alike , so that they_might more_fully respondto their_vocation and mission , as branches engrafted to the true vine , called to bear much fruitfor the life of the world . O Virgin Mother , guide and sustain usso that we might always live as true sons and daughtersof the Church of your Son . Enable us to do our partin helping to establish on earththe civilization of truth and love , as God wills it , for his glory . Amen Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , in St .

Here I simply wish to note that the example of Mary of Nazareth sheds light on womanhood as such by the very fact_that God , in the sublime event of the incarnation of His Son , entrusted himself to the ministry , the free and active ministry of a woman . It can thus be said_that women , by looking to Mary , find in her the secret of living their femininity with dignity and of achieving their_own true advancement . In the light of Mary , the Church sees in women the reflection of a beauty which mirrors the loftiest sentiments of which_the human heart_-isaia- capable : the totality of the gift_of_self in love ; the strength that_-isaia- capable of bearing the greatest sorrows ; limitless fidelity and tireless devotion to work ; the ability to combine penetrating intuition with words , support and encouragement '' John Paul II , encyclical_letter Redemptoris Mater , : , John Paul II , apostolic_letter Mulieris Dignitatem , .

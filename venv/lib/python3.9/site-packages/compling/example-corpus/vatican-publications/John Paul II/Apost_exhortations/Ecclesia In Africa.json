The Church which_-isaia- in Africa celebrated with_joy and hope its faith in the Risen Christ during the four weeks of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops . Memories of this event are_still fresh in the minds of the whole Ecclesial Community . Faithful to the tradition of the first centuries of Christianity in Africa , the Pastors of this Continent , in communion with the Successor of the Apostle Peter and members of the Episcopal College from other parts_of_the_world , held a Synod which_was intended to be an occasion of hope and resurrection , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment when human events seemed to be tempting Africa to discouragement and despair . The Synod Fathers , assisted by qualified representatives of the clergy , religious and laity , subjected to a detailed and realistic study the lights and shadows , the challenges and future prospects of evangelization in Africa on the threshold of the Third Millennium of the Christian faith . The members of the Synodal Assembly asked me to bring to the attention of the whole Church the results of their reflections and prayers , discussions and exchanges . With joy and gratitude to the Lord I accepted this request and today , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment when , in communion with the Pastors and faithful of the Catholic Church in Africa , I begin the celebration phase of the Special Assembly for Africa , I -amos- promulgating the text of this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation , the result of an intense and prolonged collegial endeavour . But before describing what developed in the course of the Synod , I consider it helpful to go back , if only briefly , over the various stages of an event of such decisive importance for the Church in Africa . The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council can certainly be considered , from the point_of_view of the history_of_salvation , as the cornerstone of the present century which_-isaia- now rapidly approaching the Third Millennium . In the context of that great event , the Church of God in Africa experienced true moments of grace . Indeed , the idea of some form of meeting of the African Bishops to discuss the evangelization of the Continent dates back to the time of the Council . That historic event was truly the crucible of collegiality and a specific expression of the affective and effective communion of the worldwide Episcopate . At the Council , the Bishops sought to identify appropriate means of better sharing and making more_effective their care_for all the Churches cf . Cor : , and for this_purpose they began to plan suitable structures -atti_degli_apostoli- the national , regional and continental level . The Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar . It -isaia- in such a climate that the Bishops of Africa and Madagascar present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council decided to establish their_own General Secretariat with the task of coordinating their interventions , in order to present to the Council Fathers , as far_as_possible , a common point_of_view . This initial cooperation among the Bishops of Africa later became permanent in the creation in Kampala of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar SECAM . This took_place in July August , during the visit of Pope Paul VI to Uganda the first of a Pope to Africa in modern times . The convocation of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops . The General Assemblies of the Synod of Bishops , held regularly from onwards , offered valuable opportunities_for the Church in Africa to make its voice heard in the Church throughout_the_world . Thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Second Ordinary General Assembly , the Synod Fathers from Africa happily took the occasion offered them to appeal for greater justice in the world . The Third Ordinary General Assembly , on evangelization in the modern_world , made possible a special study of the problems of evangelization in Africa . It was then that the Bishops of the Continent present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod issued an important message entitled Promoting Evangelization in Co Responsibility . Shortly afterwards , during the Holy Year of , SECAM convoked its_own plenary meeting in Rome , in order to examine the subject of evangelization . Subsequently , from to , some Bishops , priests , consecrated_persons , theologians and lay_people expressed a desire_for an African Council or African Synod , which_would have_the task of evaluating evangelization in Africa vis \u00e0 vis the great choices to be made regarding the Continent s future . I gladly welcomed and encouraged the idea of the '' working together , in one form or another '' , of the whole African Episcopate in order '' to study the religious problems that concern the whole Continent '' . SECAM thus studied ways and means of planning a continental meeting of this_kind . A consultation of the Episcopal Conferences and of each Bishop of Africa and Madagascar was organized , after which I was able to convoke a Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops . On January , the Solemnity of the Epiphany the liturgical commemoration on which_the Church renews her awareness of the universality of her_mission and her consequent duty to bring_the light of Christ to all peoples I announced this '' initiative of great_importance for the Church '' , welcoming , as I said , the petitions often expressed for some time by the Bishops of Africa , priests , theologians and representatives of the laity , '' in order to promote an organic pastoral solidarity within_the entire African territory and nearby Islands '' . The Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops was an historic moment of grace : the Lord visited his_people in Africa . Indeed , this Continent -isaia- today experiencing what we can call a sign of the times , an acceptable time , a day of salvation . It seems that the '' hour of Africa '' has come , a favourable time which urgently invites Christ s messengers to launch out into the deep and to cast their nets for the catch cf . Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- Christianity s beginning the minister of Candace , Queen of Ethiopia , rejoiced -atti_degli_apostoli- having received_the faith through Baptism and went on his way bearing_witness to Christ cf . Acts : , so today the Church in Africa , joyful and grateful for having received_the faith , must pursue its evangelizing mission , in order to bring_the peoples of the Continent to the Lord , teaching them to observe all that_he_has commanded cf . From the opening Solemn Eucharistic Liturgy which on April I celebrated in Saint Peter s Basilica with thirty five Cardinals , one Patriarch , thirty nine Archbishops , one hundred forty six Bishops and ninety priests , the Church , which_-isaia- the Family of God and the community of believers , gathered about the Tomb of Peter . Africa was present there , in its various rites , with the entire People of God : it rejoiced , expressing its faith in life to the sound of drums and other African musical instruments . On that occasion Africa felt that_it_was , in the words of Pope Paul VI , '' a new homeland for Christ '' , a land loved by the Eternal Father . That -isaia- why I myself greeted that moment of grace in the words of the Psalmist : '' This -isaia- the day which_the Lord has made ; let us rejoice and be glad in it '' Ps : . Recipients of the Exhortation . In communion with the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , I wish to address this Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation in the first_place to Pastors and lay Catholics , and then to our_brothers_and_sisters of other Christian Confessions , to those_who profess the great monotheistic religions , in particular the followers of African traditional religion , and to all people_of_good_will who in one way or another have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart Africa s spiritual and material development or who hold in their hands the destiny of this_great Continent . First of all my thoughts naturally turn to the Africans themselves and to all who_live on the Continent ; I think especially of the sons_and_daughters of the Catholic Church : Bishops , priests , deacons , seminarians , members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , catechists and all those_who make service of their brothers_and_sisters the ideal of their_life . I wish to confirm them in their_faith cf . Lk : and to urge them to persevere in the hope which_the Risen Christ gives , overcoming every temptation to discouragement . Outline of the Exhortation . The Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops examined thoroughly the topic which_had_been placed before it : '' The Church in Africa and her evangelizing mission towards_the Year : You shall be my witnesses Acts : '' . This Exhortation will therefore endeavour to follow closely the same thematic framework . It will begin from the historic moment , a true kairos , in which_the Synod was held , examining its objectives , preparation and celebration . It will consider_the current situation of the Church in Africa , recalling the different phases of missionary commitment . It will then examine the various aspects of the evangelizing mission which_the Church must_take into_account -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time : evangelization , inculturation , dialogue , justice_and_peace , and the means of social communication . A mention of the urgent tasks and challenges facing the Church in Africa on the eve of the Year will_enable us to sketch out the tasks of Christ s witnesses in Africa , so that_they_will make a more_effective contribution to the building up of God s Kingdom . It will thus be possible -atti_degli_apostoli- the end to de scribe the responsibilities of the Church in Africa as a missionary Church : a Church of mission which itself becomes missionary : '' You shall be my witnesses to the ends of the earth '' Acts : . CHAPTER I AN HISTORIC MOMENT OF GRACE . '' This Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops -isaia- a providential event of grace , for_which we must give praise and thanks to the Almighty and Merciful Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit '' . It -isaia- with these_words that the Fathers solemnly opened the discussion of the Synod s theme during the first General Congregation . On an earlier occasion , I had expressed a similar conviction , recognizing that '' the Special Assembly -isaia- an ecclesial event of fundamental importance for Africa , a kairos , a moment of grace , in which God manifests his salvation . The whole Church -isaia- invited to live fully this_time of grace , to accept and spread the Good News . The effort expended in preparation_for the Synod will not_only benefit the celebration of the Synod itself , but_from this_time on will work in favour of the local Churches which make_their pilgrim way in Africa , whose faith and witness are_being strengthened and are becoming increasingly mature '' . This moment of grace was in the first_place manifested in a solemn profession_of_faith . Gathered about the Tomb of Peter for the opening of the Special Assembly , the Synod Fathers proclaimed their_faith , the faith of Peter who , in answer to Christ s question , '' Do you also wish to go away ? '' , replied : '' Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have_the words of eternal_life ; and we have believed , and have come to know , that_you are the Holy One of God '' Jn : . The Bishops of Africa , in whom_the Catholic Church during those days found herself expressed in a special_way -atti_degli_apostoli- the Tomb of the Apostle , confirmed their steadfast belief that the greatness and mercy of the one God were manifested above all in the Redemptive Incarnation of the Son of God , the Son who_-isaia- consubstantial with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit and who , in this Trinitarian unity , receives the fullness of honour and glory . This the Fathers affirmed -isaia-_our faith ; this_-isaia- the faith of the Church ; this_-isaia- the faith of all the local Churches which everywhere in Africa are on pilgrimage towards_the House of God . This faith in Jesus Christ was manifested unceasingly , forcefully and unanimously in the interventions of the Synod Fathers throughout_the meeting of the Special Assembly . In the strength of this faith , the Bishops of Africa entrusted their Continent to Christ the Lord , convinced_that he alone , through_his Gospel and his Church , can save Africa from its present difficulties and heal its many ills . At the same_time , -atti_degli_apostoli- the solemn opening of the Special Assembly , the Bishops of Africa publicly proclaimed their_faith in the '' unique Church of Christ , which in the Creed we avow as one , holy , catholic and apostolic '' . These characteristics indicate essential features of the Church and her_mission . She '' does_not possess them of herself ; it -isaia- Christ who , through the Holy Spirit , makes his Church one , holy , catholic and apostolic , and it -isaia- he who calls her to realize each of these qualities '' . All those privileged to be present -atti_degli_apostoli- the celebration of the Special Assembly for Africa rejoiced to see_how African Catholics are assuming ever_greater responsibility in their local Churches and are seeking a deeper_understanding of what it means to be both Catholic and African . The celebration of the Special Assembly showed to the whole_world that the local Churches of Africa hold a rightful place in the communion of the Church , that_they_are entitled to preserve and to develop '' their_own traditions , without in any_way lessening the primacy of the Chair of Peter . This Chair presides over the whole assembly of charity and protects legitimate differences , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it sees that_such differences do not hinder unity but_rather contribute towards it '' . Synod of Resurrection , Synod of Hope . By a singular design of Providence , the solemn inauguration of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops took_place on the Second Sunday of Easter , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Easter Octave . The Synod Fathers , assembled in Saint Peter s Basilica on that day , were well aware_that the joy of their Church flowed from the same event which_had gladdened the Apostles hearts on Easter Day cf . Lk : : the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus . They were deeply aware of the presence in their midst of the Risen Lord , who said to them as he had to his Apostles : '' Peace be with you '' Jn : , . They were also aware of his promise to remain with_his Church for ever cf . Mt : , and therefore also throughout_the duration of the Synodal Assembly . The Easter spirit in which_the Special Assembly began its work , with its_members united in celebrating their_faith in the Risen Lord , spontaneously brought to mind the words_which Jesus addressed to the Apostle Thomas : '' Blessed are those_who_have not seen and yet believe '' Jn : . This was indeed a Synod of Resurrection and Hope , as the Synod Fathers joyfully and enthusiastically declared in the opening words of their Message to the People of God . They are words_which I willingly make my own : '' Like Mary Magdalene on the morning of the Resurrection , like the disciples -atti_degli_apostoli- Emmaus with burning hearts and enlightened minds , the Special Synod for Africa , Madagascar and the Islands proclaims : Christ , our Hope , -isaia- risen . He has met us , has walked along_with us . He has explained the Scriptures to us . Here -isaia- what he said to us : I -amos- the First and the Last , I -amos- the Living One ; I was dead , and behold , I -amos- alive for ever and ever and I hold the keys of death and of the abode of the dead Rev : . And as Saint John -atti_degli_apostoli- Patmos during particularly difficult times received prophecies of hope_for the People of God , we also announce a message of hope . At this_time when so much fratricidal hate inspired by political interests -isaia- tearing our peoples apart , when_the burden of the international debt and currency devaluation -isaia- crushing them , we , the Bishops of Africa , together_with all the participants in this_holy Synod , united with the Holy Father and with_all_our Brothers in the Episcopate who elected us , we want to say a word of hope and encouragement to you , Family of God in Africa , to you , the Family of God all over the world : Christ our Hope -isaia- alive ; we shall live ! '' . I exhort all God s People in Africa to accept with open hearts the message of hope addressed to them by the Synodal Assembly . During their discussions the Synod Fathers , fully aware_that they_were expressing the expectations not_only of African Catholics but_also those of all the men_and_women of the Continent , squarely faced the many evils which oppress Africa today . The Fathers explored -atti_degli_apostoli- length and in all its complexity what_the Church -isaia- called to do in order to bring_about the desired changes , but_they did so with an attitude free_from pessimism or despair . Despite the mainly negative picture which today characterizes numerous parts of Africa , and despite the sad situations being experienced in many countries , the Church has the duty to affirm vigorously that_these difficulties can be overcome . She must strengthen in all Africans hope of genuine liberation . In the final analysis , this confidence -isaia- based on the Church s awareness of God s promise , which assures us that history -isaia- not closed in upon itself but_-isaia- open to God s Kingdom . This -isaia- why there_-isaia- no justification for despair or pessimism when we think about the future of both Africa and any_other part_of_the_world . Affective and effective collegiality . Before dealing_with the different themes , I would_like to state that the Synod of Bishops -isaia- an extremely beneficial instrument for fostering ecclesial_communion . When towards_the end of the Second Vatican Council Pope Paul VI established the Synod , he clearly indicated that_one of its essential tasks would be to express and foster , under_the_guidance of the Successor of Peter , mutual communion_between Bishops throughout_the_world . The principle underlying the setting up of the Synod of Bishops -isaia- straightforward : the more the communion of the Bishops among_themselves -isaia- strengthened , the more the communion of the Church as a whole -isaia- enriched . The Church in Africa testifies to the truth of these_words , for it has experienced the enthusiasm and practical results which accompanied the preparations for the Assembly of the Synod of Bishops devoted to it . At my first meeting with the Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops , gathered to discuss the Special Assembly for Africa , I indicated the reason_why it seemed appropriate to convoke this Assembly : the promotion of '' an organic pastoral solidarity throughout Africa and the adjacent Islands '' . With these_words I wished to include the main goals and objectives which that Assembly would_have to pursue . In order to clarify my expectations further , I added that the reflections in preparation_for the Assembly '' should cover all the important aspects of the life of the Church in Africa , and in particular should include evangelization , inculturation , dialogue , pastoral_care in social areas and the means of social communication '' . During my Pastoral Visits in Africa , I frequently referred to the Special Assembly for Africa and to the principal aims for_which it had_been convoked . When I took part for the first time on African soil -atti_degli_apostoli- a meeting of the Council of the Synod , I did not_fail to emphasize my conviction_that a Synodal Assembly cannot be reduced to a consultation on practical matters . Its true raison d \u00eatre -isaia- the fact_that the Church can move forward only by strengthening communion among her members , beginning with_her Pastors . Every Synodal Assembly manifests and develops solidarity between_the heads of particular Churches in carrying_out their_mission beyond_the boundaries of their_respective Dioceses . The Second Vatican Council taught : '' As lawful Successors of the Apostles and as members of the Episcopal College , Bishops should_always realize that_they_are linked one to the other , and should show concern_for all the Churches . For by divine institution and the requirement of their apostolic_office , each_one in concert with_his fellow Bishops -isaia- responsible_for the Church '' . The theme assigned to the Special Assembly '' The Church in Africa and her evangelizing mission towards_the Year . You shall be my witnesses Acts : '' expresses my desire_that this Church should live the time leading up to the Great Jubilee as '' a new Advent '' , a time of expectation and preparation . In fact I consider preparations for the Year as one of the keys for interpreting my Pontificate . The series of Synodal Assemblies which_have taken_place in the course of nearly thirty years General Assemblies and Special Assemblies on a continental , regional or national level are all part of preparing for the Great Jubilee . The fact_that evangelization_-isaia- the theme of all these Synodal Assemblies -isaia- meant to indicate how alive today -isaia- the Church s awareness of the salvific mission which_she has received_from Christ . This awareness -isaia-_especially evident in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortations devoted to evangelization , catechesis , the family , reconciliation and penance in the life of the Church and of all humanity , the vocation and mission of the lay_faithful and the formation of priests . In full_communion with the universal Church . Right from the beginning of the preparations for the Special Assembly , it was my heartfelt desire , fully shared by the Council of the General Secretariat , to ensure_that this Synod would be authentically and unequivocally African . At the same_time , it was of fundamental importance that the Special Assembly should be celebrated in full_communion with the universal Church . Indeed , the Assembly always kept in mind the needs of the universal Church . Likewise , when_the time came to publish the Lineamenta , I invited my Brothers in the Episcopate and the whole People of God throughout_the_world to pray_for the Special Assembly for Africa , and to feel_that they_were part of the activities being promoted in preparation_for that event . This Assembly , as I have often had occasion to say , was of profound significance for the universal Church , not only_because of the great interest raised everywhere by its convocation , but also_because of the very nature of ecclesial_communion which transcends all boundaries of time and space . In fact the Special Assembly inspired many prayers and good_works through_which individuals and communities of the Church in the other continents accompanied the Synodal process . And how_can we doubt that_through the mystery of ecclesial_communion the Synod was_also supported by the prayers of the Saints in heaven ? When I directed that the first working session of the Special Assembly should_take place in Rome , I did so in order to express even more_clearly the communion_which links the Church in Africa with the universal Church , and in order to emphasize the commitment of all the faithful to Africa . The solemn Eucharistic concelebration for the opening of the Synod -atti_degli_apostoli- which I presided in Saint Peter s Basilica highlighted the universality of the Church in a striking and deeply moving way . This universality , '' which_-isaia-_not uniformity but_rather communion in a diversity compatible with the Gospel '' , was experienced by all the Bishops . They were aware of having_been consecrated as members of the Body of Bishops which succeeds the College of the Apostles , not_only_for one Diocese but_for the salvation of the whole_world . I give thanks to Almighty God for the opportunity which he gave us to experience , through the Special Assembly , what genuine catholicity implies . '' In virtue of this catholicity each_individual part of the Church contributes through its special gifts to the good of the other parts and of the whole Church '' . A relevant and credible message . According to the Synod Fathers , the main question facing the Church in Africa consists in delineating as clearly as possible what it -isaia- and what it must fully carry_out , in order_that its message may be relevant and credible . All the discussions -atti_degli_apostoli- the Assembly referred to this truly essential and fundamental need , which_-isaia- a real challenge for the Church in Africa . It -isaia- of course true '' that the Holy Spirit -isaia- the principal agent of evangelization : it -isaia- he who impels each_individual to proclaim_the Gospel , and it -isaia- he who in the depths of consciences causes the word of salvation to be accepted and understood '' . After reaffirming this_truth , the Special Assembly rightly went on to add that evangelization_-isaia- also a mission which_the Lord Jesus entrusted to his Church under_the_guidance and in the power of the Holy Spirit . Our cooperation -isaia- necessary through fervent prayer , serious reflection , suitable planning and the mobilization of resources . The Synod s debate on the relevance and credibility of the Church s message in Africa inescapably entailed consideration of the very credibility of the proclaimers of this message . The Synod Fathers faced the question directly , with genuine frankness and devoid of any complacency . Pope Paul VI had_already addressed this_question in memorable words when he stated : '' It -isaia-_often said nowadays that the present century thirsts for authenticity . Especially in regard to young_people , it -isaia- said that_they_have a horror of the artificial or false and that_they_are searching above all for truth and honesty . These signs of the times should find us vigilant . Either tacitly or aloud but always forcefully we are_being asked : Do you really believe what_you are proclaiming ? Do you live what_you believe ? Do you really preach what_you live ? The witness of life has become more_than_ever an essential condition_for real effectiveness in preaching . Precisely because of this we are , to a certain extent , responsible_for the progress of the Gospel that we proclaim '' . That -isaia- why , with reference to the Church s evangelizing mission in the field of justice_and_peace , I have_said : '' Today more_than_ever , the Church -isaia- aware_that her social_doctrine will gain credibility more immediately from witness of action than as a result of its internal logic and consistency '' . How can I fail to recall here that the Eighth Plenary Assembly of SECAM held in Lagos , Nigeria , in , had_already considered with remarkable clarity the question of the credibility and relevance of the Church s message in Africa ? That same Assembly had declared that the credibility of the Church in Africa depended upon Bishops and priests_who followed Christ s example and could give witness of an exemplary life ; upon truly faithful men_and_women_religious , authentic witnesses by their_way of living the evangelical_counsels ; upon a dynamic laity , with deeply believing parents , educators conscious of their responsibilities and political leaders animated by a profound sense of morality . The Family of God in the Synodal process . Speaking to the members of the Council of the General Secretariat on June , I laid special emphasis on the involvement of the whole People of God , -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels and especially in Africa , in the preparations for the Special Assembly . '' If this Synod -isaia- prepared well , '' I said , '' it will_be_able to involve all levels of the Christian Community : individuals , small communities , parishes , Dioceses , and local , national and international bodies '' . Between the beginning of my Pontificate and the solemn inauguration of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , I paid a total of ten Pastoral Visits to Africa and Madagascar , going to thirty six countries . On my Apostolic Visits after_the convocation of the Special Assembly , the theme of the Synod and the need_for all the faithful to prepare for the Synodal Assembly always figured prominently in my meetings with the People of God in Africa . I also took advantage of the ad Limina Visits of the Continent s Bishops in order to ask for the cooperation of everyone in the preparation of the Special Synod for Africa . In addition , on three separate occasions I held working sessions with the Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod on African soil : -atti_degli_apostoli- Yamoussoukro , Ivory Coast ; -atti_degli_apostoli- Luanda , Angola ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- Kampala , Uganda . All this_was done in order to mobilize an active and harmonious participation by Africans in the preparation of the Synodal Assembly . The presentation of the Lineamenta -atti_degli_apostoli- the Ninth Plenary Assembly of SECAM in Lom\u00e9 , Togo , on July , was undoubtedly a new and significant stage in the preparation of the Special Assembly . It can_be_said that_with the publication of the Lineamenta preparations for the Synod began in earnest in all the particular Churches of Africa . The Assembly of SECAM in Lom\u00e9 approved a Prayer for the Special Assembly and requested that it be recited both publicly and privately in every African parish until the actual celebration of the Synod . This initiative of SECAM was truly felicitous and did_not pass unnoticed by the universal Church . In order to make_the Lineamenta more available , many Episcopal Conferences and Dioceses translated the document into_their own languages , for example into Swahili , Arabic , Malagasy , etc . '' Publications , conferences and symposia on the themes of the Synod were organized by various Episcopal Conferences , Institutes of Theology and Seminaries , Associations of Institutes of Consecrated Life , Dioceses , some important journals and periodicals , individual Bishops and theologians '' . I fervently thank Almighty God for the meticulous care with_which_the Synod s Lineamenta and the Instrumentum Laboris were drawn up . It was a task accepted and carried_out by Africans Bishops and experts beginning with the Ante Preparatory Commission of the Synod which met in January and March . This Commission was then replaced by the Council of the General Secretariat of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , established on June . I -amos- also deeply grateful to the working group which so carefully prepared the Eucharistic Liturgies for the opening and closing of the Synod . The group , which included theologians , liturgists and experts in African chants and musical instruments , ensured , in keeping_with my wishes , that_these celebrations would_have a distinctly African character . I must now add that the response of the African peoples to my appeal to them to share in the preparation of the Synod was truly admirable . The replies given to the Lineamenta , both within and beyond_the African Ecclesial Communities , far exceeded every expectation . Many local Churches used the Lineamenta in order to mobilize the faithful and , from that_time onwards , we can say that the results of the Synod were beginning to appear in a fresh commitment and renewed awareness among African Christians . Throughout the various phases of the preparation_for the Special Assembly , many members of the Church in Africa clergy , religious and laity entered with exemplary dedication into the Synodal process , '' walking together '' , placing their individual talents -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church , and fervently praying together for the Synod s success . More than_once the Synod Fathers themselves noted , during the actual Synodal Assembly , that_their work was_made easier precisely by the '' careful and meticulous preparation of the Synod , and the active involvement of the entire Church in Africa -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels '' . God wills to save Africa . The Apostle of the Gentiles tells us that God '' desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth . For there_-isaia-_one God , and there_-isaia-_one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself as a ransom for all '' Tim : . Since God , in fact , calls all people to one_and_the_same divine destiny , '' we ought to believe_that the Holy Spirit in a manner known only to God offers to everyone the possibility of being associated_with this Paschal Mystery '' . God s redeeming love embraces the whole of humanity , every race , tribe and nation : thus it also embraces all the peoples of Africa . Divine Providence willed that Africa should be present during the Passion of Christ in the person of Simon of Cyrene , forced by the Roman soldiers to help the Lord to carry the Cross cf . The Liturgy of the Sixth Sunday of Easter in , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Solemn Eucharistic Celebration for the closing of the working session of the Special Assembly , provided me with the occasion to develop a meditation upon God s salvific plan_for Africa . One of the Scriptural readings , taken from the Acts of the Apostles , recalled an event which_can be understood as the first step in the Church s mission '' ad gentes '' : it -isaia- the account of the visit made by Peter , -atti_degli_apostoli- the bidding of the Holy Spirit , to the home of a Gentile , the centurion Cornelius . Until that_time the Gospel had_been proclaimed mainly to the Jews . After considerable hesitation , Peter , enlightened by the Spirit , decided to go to the house of a Gentile . When he arrived , he discovered to his joyful surprise that the centurion was awaiting Christ and Baptism . The Acts of the Apostles says : '' the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed , because the gift of the Holy Spirit had_been poured out even on the Gentiles . For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God '' : . In the house of Cornelius the miracle of Pentecost was in a sense repeated . Peter then said : '' Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality , but in every nation any_one who fears him and does what_-isaia- right -isaia- acceptable to him . Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these_people who have_received the Holy Spirit just as we have ? '' Acts : , . Thus began the Church s mission ad gentes , of which Paul of Tarsus would become the principal herald . The first missionaries who reached the heart of Africa undoubtedly felt an astonishment similar to that experienced by the Christians of the Apostolic age -atti_degli_apostoli- the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . God s salvific plan_for Africa -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the growth of the Church on the African Continent . But since by Christ s will the Church -isaia- by her nature missionary , it follows_that the Church in Africa -isaia- itself called to play an active role in God s plan of salvation . For this_reason I have often said_that '' the Church in Africa -isaia- a missionary Church and a mission Church '' . The Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops had the task of examining appropriate ways and means whereby Africans would be better able to implement the mandate which_the Risen Lord gave to his_disciples : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations '' Mt : . CHAPTER II THE CHURCH IN AFRICA I . Brief history of the continent s evangelization . On the opening day of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops , the first meeting of this_kind in history , the Synod Fathers recalled some of the marvels wrought by God in the course of Africa s evangelization . It -isaia- a history which goes back to the period of the Church s very birth . The spread of the Gospel has taken_place in different phases . The first centuries of Christianity saw the evangelization of Egypt and North Africa . A second phase , involving the parts of the Continent south of the Sahara , took_place in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . A third phase , marked by an extraordinary missionary effort , began in the nineteenth century . In a message to the Bishops and to all the peoples of Africa concerning the promotion of the religious , civil and social well_being of the Continent , my venerable Predecessor Paul VI recalled in memorable words the glorious splendour of Africa s Christian past : '' We think of the Christian Churches of Africa whose origins go back to the times of the Apostles and are traditionally associated_with the name and teaching of Mark the Evangelist . We think of their countless Saints , Martyrs , Confessors , and Virgins , and recall_the fact_that from the second to the fourth centuries Christian life in the North of Africa was most vigorous and had a leading place in theological study and literary production . The names of the great doctors and writers come to mind , men like Origen , Saint Athanasius , and Saint Cyril , leaders of the Alexandrian school , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the other end of the North African coastline , Tertullian , Saint Cyprian and above all Saint Augustine , one_of_the_most brilliant lights of the Christian world . We shall mention the great Saints of the desert , Paul , Anthony , and Pachomius , the first founders of the monastic life_,_which later spread through_their example in both the East and the West . And among many_others we want also to mention Saint Frumentius , known by the name of Abba Salama , who_was consecrated Bishop by Saint Athanasius and became the first Apostle of Ethiopia '' . During these first centuries of the Church in Africa , certain women also bore their_own witness to Christ . Among them Saints Perpetua and Felicitas , Saint Monica and Saint Thecla are particularly deserving of mention . '' These noble examples , as also the saintly African Popes , Victor I , Melchiades and Gelasius I , belong to the common heritage of the Church , and the Christian writers of Africa remain today a basic source for deepening our knowledge of the history_of_salvation in the light of the Word of God . In recalling the ancient glories of Christian Africa , we wish to express our profound respect_for the Churches with which_we_are not in full_communion : the Greek Church of the Patriarchate of Alexandria , the Coptic Church of Egypt and the Church of Ethiopia , which share_with the Catholic Church a common origin and the doctrinal and spiritual heritage of the great Fathers and Saints , not_only of their_own land , but of all the early Church . They have laboured much and suffered much to keep the Christian name alive in Africa through all the vicissitudes of history '' . These Churches continue to give evidence down to our_own times of the Christian vitality which flows from their Apostolic origins . This -isaia-_especially true in Egypt , in Ethiopia and , until the seventeenth century , in Nubia . At that_time a new phase of evangelization was beginning on the rest of the Continent . In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , the exploration of the African coast by the Portuguese was soon accompanied by the evangelization of the regions of Sub Saharan Africa . That endeavour included the regions of present_day Benin , S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 , Angola , Mozambique and Madagascar . On Pentecost Sunday , June , for the commemoration of the five hundred years of the evangelization of Angola , I said in Luanda : '' The Acts of the Apostles indicate by name the inhabitants of the places who participated directly in the birth of the Church and the work of the breath of the Holy Spirit . They all said : We hear them telling in our_own tongues the mighty works of God Acts : . Five hundred years_ago the people of Angola were added to this chorus of languages . In that moment , in your African homeland the Pentecost of Jerusalem was renewed . Your ancestors heard the message of the Good News which_-isaia- the language of the Spirit . Their hearts accepted this message for the first time , and they bowed their heads to the waters of the baptismal font in which , by the power of the Holy Spirit , a person dies with Christ and -isaia- born again to new_life in his Resurrection . It was certainly the same Spirit who moved those men of faith , the first missionaries , who in sailed into the mouth of the Zaire River , -atti_degli_apostoli- Pinda , beginning a genuine missionary saga . It was_the Holy Spirit , who works as he wills in people s hearts , who moved the great King of the Congo , Nzinga a Nkuwu , to ask for missionaries to proclaim_the Gospel . It was_the Holy Spirit who sustained the life of those four first Angolan Christians who , returning from Europe , testified to the Christian faith . After the first missionaries , many_others came from Portugal and other European countries to continue , expand and strengthen the work that had_been begun '' . A certain number of Episcopal Sees were erected during_this period , and one of the first fruits of that missionary endeavour was_the consecration in Rome , by Pope Leo X in , of Don Henrique , the son of Don Alfonso I , King of the Congo , as Titular Bishop of Utica . Don Henrique thus became the first native Bishop of Black Africa . It was during_this period , in , that my Predecessor Pope Gregory XV permanently erected the Congregation de Propaganda Fide for the purpose of better organizing and expanding the missions . Because of various difficulties , the second phase of the evangelization of Africa came to an end in the eighteenth century , with the disappearance of practically all the missions south of the Sahara . The third phase of Africa s systematic evangelization began in the nineteenth century , a period marked by an extraordinary effort organized by the great apostles and promoters of the African mission . It was a period of rapid growth , as the statistics presented to the Synodal Assembly by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples clearly demonstrate . Africa has responded with_great generosity to Christ s call . In recent decades many African countries have celebrated the first centenary of the beginning of their evangelization . Indeed , the growth of the Church in Africa over the last hundred years -isaia- a marvelous work of divine_grace . The glory and splendour of the present period of Africa s evangelization are illustrated in a truly admirable way by the Saints whom modern Africa has_given to the Church . Pope Paul VI eloquently expressed this when he canonized the Ugandan Martyrs in Saint Peter s Basilica on World Mission Day , : '' These African Martyrs add a new page to that list of victorious men_and_women that we call the martyrology , in which we find the most magnificent as well as the most tragic stories . The page that_they add -isaia- worthy to take its place alongside those wonderful stories of ancient Africa . For from the Africa that_was sprinkled with the blood of these Martyrs , the first of this_new age and , God willing , the last , so sublime , so precious was their sacrifice , there_-isaia- emerging a free and redeemed Africa '' . The list of Saints that Africa gives to the Church , the list that_-isaia- its greatest title of honour , continues to grow . How could we fail to mention , among the most recent , Blessed Clementine Anwarite , Virgin and Martyr of Zaire , whom I beatified on African soil in , Blessed Victoria Rasoamanarivo of Madagascar , and Blessed Josephine Bakhita of the Sudan , also beatified during my Pontificate ? And how_can we not recall Blessed Isidore Bakanja , Martyr of Zaire , whom I had the privilege of raising to the honours of the altar in the course of the Special Assembly for Africa ? '' Other causes are reaching their final stages . The Church in Africa must furnish and write her_own Martyrology , adding to the outstanding figures of the first centuries . the Martyrs and Saints of our_own day '' . Faced with the tremendous growth of the Church in Africa over the last hundred years and the fruits of holiness that it has borne , there_-isaia- only_one possible explanation : all this -isaia-_a_gift of God , for no human effort alone could have performed this_work in the course of such a relatively short period of time . There -isaia- however no reason_for worldly triumphalism . In recalling the glorious splendour of the Church in Africa , the Synod Fathers only wished to celebrate God s marvellous deeds for Africa s liberation and salvation . '' This -isaia- the Lord s doing ; it -isaia- marvellous in our_eyes '' Ps : . '' He who_-isaia- mighty has done great things forme , and holy -isaia-_his name '' Lk : . The splendid growth and achievements of the Church in Africa are due largely to the heroic and selfless dedication of generations of missionaries . This fact -isaia- acknowledged by everyone . The hallowed soil of Africa -isaia- truly sown with the tombs of courageous heralds of the Gospel . When the Bishops of Africa met in Rome for the Special Assembly , they_were well_aware of the debt of gratitude which their Continent owes to its ancestors in the faith . In his Address to the inaugural Assembly of SECAM -atti_degli_apostoli- Kampala , on July , Pope Paul VI spoke about_this debt of gratitude : '' By now , you Africans are missionaries to yourselves . The Church of Christ -isaia- well and truly planted in this blessed soil cf . One duty , however , remains to be fulfilled : we must remember those_who , before you , and even today with you , have preached the Gospel in Africa ; for Sacred Scripture admonishes us to Remember your leaders , those_who spoke to you the word of God ; consider_the outcome of their_life ; and imitate their_faith Heb : . That -isaia- a history which we must_not forget ; it confers on the local Church the mark of its authenticity and nobility , its mark as apostolic . That history -isaia- a drama of charity , heroism and sacrifice which_makes the African Church great and holy from its_very origins '' . The Special Assembly worthily fulfilled this debt of gratitude -atti_degli_apostoli- its first General Congregation when it declared : '' It -isaia- appropriate -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point to pay profound homage to the missionaries , men_and_women of all the Religious and Secular Institutes , as well as to all the countries which , during the almost two thousand years of the evangelization of the African Continent , devoted themselves , without counting the cost , to the task of transmitting the torch of the Christian faith . That -isaia- why we , the happy inheritors of this marvellous adventure , joyfully pay our debt of thanks to God on this solemn occasion '' . The Synod Fathers strongly reiterated their homage to the missionaries in their Message to the People of God , but_they did_not forget to pay tribute to the sons_and_daughters of Africa who served as co workers of the missionaries , especially catechists and translators . It -isaia- thanks to the great missionary epic which took_place on the African Continent , especially during the last two centuries , that we were able to meet in Rome in order to celebrate the Special Assembly for Africa . The seed sown -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time has borne much fruit . My Brothers in the Episcopate , who_are sons of the peoples of Africa , are eloquent witnesses to this . Together with_their priests , they now carry on their shoulders the major part of the work_of_evangelization . Signs of this fruitfulness are_also the many sons_and_daughters of Africa who enter_the older missionary Congregations or the new Institutes founded on African soil , taking_into their_own hands the torch of total consecration to the service of God and the Gospel . Deeper roots and growth of the Church . The fact_that in the course of almost two centuries the number of African Catholics has grown quickly -isaia- an outstanding achievement by any standard . In particular , the building up of the Church on the Continent -isaia- confirmed by facts such as the noteworthy and rapid increase in the number of ecclesiastical circumscriptions , the growth of a native clergy , of seminarians and candidates_for Institutes of Consecrated Life , and the steady increase in the network of catechists , whose contribution to the spread of the Gospel among the African peoples -isaia- well_known . Finally , of fundamental importance -isaia- the high percentage of indigenous Bishops who now make up the Hierarchy on the Continent . The Synod Fathers identified many very significant accomplishments of the Church in Africa in the areas of inculturation and ecumenical dialogue . The outstanding and meritorious achievements in the field of education are universally acknowledged . Although Catholics constitute only fourteen per cent of the population of Africa , Catholic health facilities make up seventeen per cent of the health_care institutions of the entire Continent . The initiatives boldly undertaken by the young Churches of Africa in order to bring_the Gospel '' to the ends of the earth '' Acts : are certainly worthy of note . The missionary Institutes founded in Africa have grown in number , and have begun to supply missionaries not_only_for the countries of the Continent but_also_for other areas of the world . A slowly increasing number of African diocesan priests_are beginning to make themselves available , for limited periods , as fidei donum priests in other needy Dioceses in their_own countries or abroad . The African provinces of Religious Institutes of pontifical right , both of men and of women , have_also recorded a growth in membership . In this_way the Church offers her ministry to the peoples of Africa ; but she also accepts involvement in the '' exchange of gifts '' with_other particular Churches which_make up the People of God . All this manifests , in a tangible way , the maturity which_the Church in Africa has attained : this_-isaia-_what made possible the celebration of the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . What has become of Africa ? . A little less_than thirty years_ago many African countries gained their independence from the colonial powers . This gave rise to great hopes with_regard to the political , economic , social_and_cultural development of the African peoples . However , '' in some_countries the internal situation has unfortunately not_yet been consolidated , and violence has had , or in some cases still has , the upper hand . But this_does_not justify a general condemnation involving a whole_people or a whole nation or , even worse , a whole continent '' . But what_-isaia- the true overall situation of the African Continent today , especially from the point_of_view of the Church s evangelizing mission ? In this_regard the Synod Fathers first of all asked : '' In a Continent full of bad news , how -isaia- the Christian message Good News for our people ? In the midst of an all pervading despair , where lie the hope and optimism which_the Gospel brings ? Evangelization stands for_many of those essential values_which our Continent very much lacks : hope , peace , joy , harmony , love and unity '' . After correctly noting that Africa -isaia- a huge Continent where very diverse situations are_found , and that_it_-isaia- necessary to avoid generalizations both in evaluating problems and suggesting solutions , the Synodal Assembly sadly had to say : '' One common situation , without_any doubt , -isaia- that Africa -isaia- full of problems . In almost all our nations , there_-isaia- abject poverty , tragic mismanagement of available scarce resources , political instability and social disorientation . The results stare us in the face : misery , wars , despair . In a world controlled by rich and powerful nations , Africa has practically become an irrelevant appendix , often forgotten and neglected '' . For many Synod Fathers contemporary Africa can be compared to the man_who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho ; he fell among robbers who stripped him , beat him and departed , leaving him half dead cf . Africa -isaia- a Continent where countless human_beings men_and_women , children and young_people are lying , as it were , on the edge of the road , sick , injured , disabled , marginalized and abandoned . They are in dire need of Good Samaritans who_will come to their aid . For my part , I express the hope_that the Church will_continue patiently and tirelessly its work as a Good Samaritan . Indeed , for a long period certain regimes , which_have now come to an end , were a great trial for Africans and weakened their ability to respond to situations : an injured person has to rediscover all the resources of his_own humanity . The sons_and_daughters of Africa need an understanding presence and pastoral concern . They need to be helped to recoup their energies so as to put them -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the common_good . Positive values of African culture . Although Africa -isaia-_very rich in natural resources , it remains economically poor . At the same_time , it -isaia- endowed_with a wealth of cultural values and priceless human qualities which it can_offer to the Churches and to humanity as a whole . The Synod Fathers highlighted some of these cultural values , which_are truly a providential preparation_for the transmission of the Gospel . They are values_which can contribute to an effective reversal of the Continent s dramatic situation and facilitate that worldwide revival on which_the desired development of individual nations depends . Africans have a profound religious sense , a sense of the sacred , of the existence of God the Creator and of a spiritual world . The reality of sin in its individual and social forms -isaia-_very much present in the consciousness of these peoples , as -isaia-_also the need_for rites of purification and expiation . In African culture and tradition the role of the family_-isaia- everywhere held to be fundamental . Open to this_sense of the family , of love and respect_for life , the African loves children , who_are joyfully welcomed as gifts of God . '' The sons_and_daughters of Africa love life . It -isaia- precisely this_love for life_that leads them to give such great_importance to the veneration of their ancestors . They believe intuitively that the dead continue to live and remain in communion with_them . Is this not in some_way a preparation_for belief in the Communion of the Saints ? The peoples of Africa respect the life which_-isaia- conceived and born . They rejoice in this_life . They reject the idea that it can be destroyed , even_when the so called progressive civilizations would_like to lead_them in this direction . And practices hostile to life are imposed on them by means of economic systems which serve the selfishness of the rich '' . Africans show their respect_for human_life until its natural end , and keep elderly parents and relatives within_the family . African cultures have an acute sense of solidarity and community life . In Africa it -isaia- unthinkable to celebrate a feast without_the participation of the whole village . Indeed , community life in African societies expresses the extended family . It -isaia- my ardent hope and prayer that Africa will_always preserve this priceless cultural heritage and never succumb to the temptation to individualism , which_-isaia- so alien to its best traditions . Some choices of the African peoples . While the shadows and the dark side of the African situation described above can in no way be minimized , it -isaia- worth recalling here a number of positive achievements of the peoples of the Continent which deserve to be praised and encouraged . For example , the Synod Fathers in their Message to the People of God were pleased to mention the beginning of the democratic process in many African countries , expressing the hope_that this_process would be consolidated , and that all obstacles and resistance to the establishment of the rule of law would be promptly removed through the concerted action of all those involved and through_their sense of the common_good . The '' winds of change '' are blowing strongly in many_parts of Africa , and people_are demanding ever_more insistently the recognition and promotion of human_rights and freedoms . In this_regard I note with satisfaction that the Church in Africa , faithful to its vocation , stands resolutely on the side of the oppressed and of voiceless and marginalized peoples . I strongly encourage it to continue to bear this witness . The preferential option for the poor -isaia- '' a special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity , to which_the whole Tradition of the Church bears_witness . The motivating concern_for the poor who_are in the very meaning of the term the Lord s poor must be translated -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels into concrete actions , until it decisively attains a series of necessary reforms '' . In spite of its poverty and the meagre means -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal , the Church in Africa plays a leading role in what touches upon integral human_development . Its remarkable achievements in this_regard are_often recognized by governments and international experts . The Special Assembly for Africa expressed deep gratitude '' to all Christians and to all men_and_women of good_will who_are working in the fields of assistance and health_care with Caritas and other development organizations '' . The assistance which_they , as Good Samaritans , give to the African victims of wars and disasters , to refugees and displaced persons , deserves the admiration , gratitude and support of all . I feel it my duty to express heartfelt thanks to the Church in Africa for the role which it has played over the years as a promoter of peace and reconciliation in many situations of conflict , political turmoil and civil war . Present day problems of the Church in Africa . The Bishops of Africa are faced_with two fundamental questions . How must the Church carry_out her evangelizing mission as the Year approaches ? How can African Christians become ever_more faithful witnesses to the Lord Jesus ? In order to provide adequate responses to these questions the Bishops , both before and during the Special Assembly , examined the major challenges that the Ecclesial Community in Africa must face today . More profound evangelization . The primary and most fundamental fact noted by the Synod Fathers -isaia- the thirst_for God felt by the peoples of Africa . In order not to disappoint this expectation , the members of the Church must first of all deepen their_faith . Indeed , precisely_because she evangelizes , the Church must '' begin by being evangelized herself '' . She needs to meet_the challenge raised by '' this theme of the Church which_-isaia- evangelized by constant conversion and renewal , in order to evangelize the world with credibility '' . The Synod recognized the urgency of proclaiming the Good News to the millions of people in Africa who_are_not yet evangelized . The Church certainly respects and esteems the non Christian religions professed by very many Africans , for these religions are the living expression of the soul of vast groups of people . However , '' neither respect and esteem_for these religions nor the complexity of the questions raised -isaia- an invitation to the Church to withhold from_these non Christians the proclamation of Jesus Christ . On the contrary the Church holds that_these multitudes have_the right to know_the riches of the mystery of Christ cf . Eph : riches in which we believe that_the_whole of humanity can_find , in unsuspected fullness , everything_that it -isaia- gropingly searching for concerning God , man and his destiny , life and death , and truth '' . The Synod Fathers rightly affirmed that '' a serious concern_for a true and balanced inculturation -isaia- necessary in order to avoid cultural confusion and alienation in our fast evolving society '' . During my visit to Malawi I made the same point : '' I put before you today a challenge a challenge to reject a way of living which_does_not correspond to the best of your traditions , and your Christian faith . Many people in Africa look beyond Africa for the so called freedom of the modern way_of_life . Today I urge you to look inside yourselves . Look to the riches of your_own traditions , look to the faith which_we_are celebrating in this assembly . Here you will_find genuine freedom here you will_find Christ who will_lead you to the truth '' . Another challenge identified by the Synod Fathers concerns the various_forms of division which need to be healed through honest dialogue . It has_been rightly noted_that , within_the borders left behind by the colonial powers , the co existence of ethnic groups with different traditions , languages , and even religions often meets obstacles arising from serious mutual hostility . '' Tribal oppositions -atti_degli_apostoli- times endanger if not peace , -atti_degli_apostoli- least the pursuit of the common_good of the society . They also create difficulties for the life of the Churches and the acceptance of Pastors from other ethnic groups '' . This -isaia- why_the Church in Africa feels challenged by the specific responsibility of healing these divisions . For the same reason_the Special Assembly emphasized the importance of ecumenical dialogue_with other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , and of dialogue_with African traditional religion and Islam . The Fathers also considered the means to be used to achieve this goal . Marriage and vocations . A major challenge emphasized almost unanimously by the Episcopal Conferences of Africa in their replies to the Lineamenta concerned Christian marriage and family_life . What -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- extremely serious : truly '' the future of the world and of the Church passes through the family '' . Another fundamental responsibility which_the Special Assembly highlighted -isaia- concern_for vocations to the priesthood and consecrated_life . It -isaia- necessary to discern them wisely , to provide competent directors and to oversee the quality of the formation offered . The fulfilment of the hope_for a flowering of African missionary vocations depends on the attention given to the solution of this problem , a flowering that_-isaia- required if the Gospel -isaia- to be proclaimed in every_part of the Continent and beyond . Social and political difficulties . '' In Africa , the need to apply the Gospel to concrete life_-isaia- felt strongly . How could one proclaim Christ on that immense Continent while forgetting that_it_-isaia- one of the world s poorest regions ? How could one fail to take into_account_the anguished history of a land where many nations are_still in the grip of famine , war , racial and tribal tensions , political instability and the violation of human_rights ? This -isaia- all a challenge to evangelization '' . All the preparatory documents of the Synod , as well as the discussions in the Assembly , clearly showed that issues in Africa such as increasing poverty , urbanization , the international debt , the arms trade , the problem of refugees and displaced persons , demographic concerns and threats to the family , the liberation of women , the spread of AIDS , the survival of the practice of slavery in some places , ethnocentricity and tribal opposition figure among the fundamental challenges addressed by the Synod . Intrusiveness of the mass_media . Finally , the Special Assembly addressed the means of social communication , an issue which_-isaia- of the greatest importance because it concerns both the instruments of evangelization and the means of spreading a new culture which needs to be evangelized . The Synod Fathers were thus faced_with the sad fact_that '' the developing nations , instead of becoming autonomous nations concerned_with their_own progress towards a just sharing in the goods and services meant for all , become parts of a machine , cogs on a gigantic wheel . This -isaia-_often true also in the field of social_communications which , being run by centres mostly in the northern hemisphere , do not_always give due consideration to the priorities and problems of such countries or respect their cultural make up . They frequently impose a distorted vision of life and of man , and thus fail to respond to the demands of true development '' . Formation of the agents of evangelization . With what resources will the Church in Africa succeed in meeting the challenges just mentioned ? '' The most important resource , after_the grace of Christ , -isaia- the people . The whole People of God in the theological understanding of Lumen Gentium this People , which comprises the members of the Body of Christ in its entirety has_received the mandate , which_-isaia- both an honour and a duty , to proclaim_the Gospel . The whole community needs to be trained , motivated and empowered for evangelization , each according_to_his or her specific role within_the Church '' . For this_reason_the Synod strongly emphasized the training of the agents of evangelization in Africa . I have_already referred to the necessity of formation for candidates to the priesthood and those called to the consecrated_life . The Assembly also paid due attention to the formation of the lay_faithful , appropriately recognizing their indispensable role in the evangelization of Africa . In particular , the training of lay catechists received_the emphasis which it rightly deserves . A last question must be asked : Has the Church in Africa sufficiently formed the lay_faithful , enabling them to assume competently their civic responsibilities and to consider socio political problems in the light of the Gospel and of faith in God ? This -isaia- certainly a task belonging to Christians : to bring to bear upon the social fabric an influence aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- changing not_only ways of thinking but_also the very structures of society , so that_they_will better reflect God s plan_for the human_family . Consequently I have called_for the thorough formation of the lay_faithful , a formation which_will help_them to lead a fully integrated life . Faith , hope and charity must influence the actions of the true follower of Christ in every activity , situation and responsibility . Since '' evangelizing means bringing the Good News into all the strata of humanity , and through its influence transforming humanity from within and making it new '' , Christians must be formed to live the social implications of the Gospel in such_a_way_that their witness will_become a prophetic challenge to whatever hinders the true good of the men_and_women of Africa and of every_other continent . CHAPTER III EVANGELIZATION AND INCULTURATION The Church s mission . '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation '' Mk : . Such -isaia- the mandate that the Risen Christ , before returning to his Father , gave to his Apostles : '' And they went forth and preached everywhere '' Mk : . '' The task of evangelizing all people constitutes the essential mission of the Church . Evangelizing -isaia-_in_fact the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her deepest identity . She exists in order to evangelize '' . Born of the evangelizing mission of Jesus and the Twelve , she_-isaia- in turn sent forth . '' Depositary of the Good News to be proclaimed . having_been sent and evangelized , the Church herself sends out evangelizers . She puts on their lips the saving Word '' . Like the Apostle to the Gentiles , the Church can say : '' I preach the Gospel . For necessity -isaia- laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor : . The Church proclaims_the Good News of Christ not_only by the proclamation of the Word which_she has received_from_the Lord , but_also by the witness of life , thanks to which Christ s disciples bear_witness to the faith , hope and love_which dwell in them cf . This testimony which_the Christian bears to Christ and the Gospel can lead even to the supreme sacrifice : martyrdom cf . For the Church and the Christian proclaim_the One who_-isaia- '' a sign of contradiction '' cf . They preach '' Christ crucified , a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles '' Cor : . As I said earlier , besides honouring the illustrious Martyrs of the first centuries , Africa can glory in its Martyrs and Saints of the modern age . The purpose of evangelization_-isaia- '' transforming humanity from within and making it new '' . In and through the Only Son the relations of people_with God , one_another and all creation will be renewed . For this_reason_the proclamation of the Gospel can contribute to the interior transformation of all people_of_good_will whose hearts are open to the Holy Spirit s action . To bear_witness to the Gospel in word and deed : this_-isaia- the task which_the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops received and which it now passes on to the Church of the Continent . '' You shall be my witnesses '' Acts : : this_-isaia- the challenge . In Africa these should be the fruits of the Synod in every area of people s lives . Born of the preaching of valiant missionary Bishops and priests , effectively assisted by '' the ranks of men_and_women catechists , to whom missionary work among the nations owes so very much '' , the Church in Africa , having become '' a new homeland for Christ '' , -isaia-_now responsible_for the evangelization of the Continent and the world . As my Predecessor Pope Paul VI said in Kampala : '' Africans , you are_now your_own missionaries '' . Because the vast majority of Africans have_not yet heard the Good News of salvation , the Synod recommends that missionary vocations should be encouraged and asks that prayer , sacrifice and effective solidarity for the Church s missionary work be favoured and actively supported . '' The Synod recalls that to evangelize -isaia- to proclaim by word and witness of life the Good News of Jesus Christ , crucified , died and risen , the Way , the Truth and the Life '' . To Africa , which_-isaia- menaced on all sides by outbreaks of hatred and violence , by conflicts and wars , evangelizers must proclaim_the hope of life rooted in the Paschal Mystery . It was precisely when , humanly speaking , Jesus life seemed doomed to failure that he instituted the Eucharist , '' the pledge of eternal glory '' , in order to perpetuate in time and space his victory over death . That -isaia- why -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the African Continent -isaia- in some ways in a critical situation the Special Assembly for Africa wished to be '' the Synod of Resurrection , the Synod of Hope . Christ our Hope -isaia- alive ; we shall live ! '' Africa -isaia- not destined for death , but_for life ! It -isaia- therefore essential that '' the new_evangelization should be centred on a transforming encounter_with_the living person of Christ '' . '' The first proclamation ought to bring_about this overwhelming and exhilarating experience of Jesus Christ who calls each_one to follow_him in an adventure of faith '' . This task -isaia- made all the easier because '' the African believes in God the Creator from his traditional life and religion and thus -isaia-_also open to the full and definitive revelation of God in Jesus Christ , God with us , Word made_flesh . Jesus , the Good News , -isaia- God who saves the African . from oppression and slavery '' . Evangelization must reach '' individual human_beings and society in every aspect of their existence . It -isaia- therefore expressed in various activities , and particularly in those_which the Synod examined : proclamation , inculturation , dialogue , justice_and_peace and the means of social communication '' . For the full success of this_mission , it must be ensured that '' in evangelization prayer to the Holy Spirit will be stressed for a continuing Pentecost , where Mary , as -atti_degli_apostoli- the first Pentecost , will_have her place '' . The power of the Holy Spirit guides the Church into all truth cf . Jn : , enabling her to go into_the_world in order to bear_witness to Christ with confident resolve . The Word that comes_from_the mouth of God -isaia- living and active , and never returns to him in vain cf . We must_therefore proclaim that Word tirelessly , exhorting '' in season and out of season . unfailing in patience and in teaching '' Tim : . Entrusted first of all to the Church , the written Word of God -isaia- not '' a matter of one_s_own interpretation '' Pet : , but_-isaia- to be authentically interpreted by the Church . In order_that the Word of God may be known , loved , pondered and preserved in the hearts of the faithful cf . Lk : , , greater efforts must be made to provide access to the Sacred Scriptures , especially through full or partial translations of the Bible , prepared as far_as_possible in cooperation_with other Churches and Ecclesial Communities and accompanied by studyguides for use in prayer and for study in the family and community . Also to be encouraged -isaia- the scriptural formation of clergy , religious , catechists and the laity in general ; careful preparation of celebrations of the Word ; promotion of the biblical apostolate with the help of the Biblical Centre for Africa and Madagascar and the encouragement of other similar structures -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels . In brief , efforts must be made to try to put the Sacred Scriptures into the hands of all the faithful right from their earliest years . Urgent need_for inculturation . On several occasions the Synod Fathers stressed the particular importance for evangelization of inculturation , the process by which '' catechesis takes flesh in the various cultures '' . Inculturation includes two dimensions : on the one_hand , '' the intimate transformation of authentic cultural values through_their integration in Christianity '' and , on the other , '' the insertion of Christianity in the various human cultures '' . The Synod considers inculturation an urgent priority in the life of the particular Churches , for a firm rooting of the Gospel in Africa . It -isaia- '' a requirement for evangelization '' , '' a path towards full evangelization '' , and one of the greatest challenges for the Church on the Continent on the eve of the Third Millennium . '' But when_the time had fully come '' Gal : , the Word , the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity , the Only Son of God , '' by the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary , and was_made man '' . This -isaia- the sublime mystery of the Incarnation of the Word , a mystery which took_place in history : in clearly defined circumstances of time and space , amidst a people_with its_own culture , a people that God had chosen and accompanied throughout_the entire history_of_salvation , in order to show through what he did for them what he intended to do for the whole_human_race . Jesus Christ -isaia- the unmistakable proof of God s love for_humanity cf . By his_life , his preaching of the Good News to the poor , his Passion , Death and glorious Resurrection , he brought_about the remission of our sins and our reconciliation with God , his Father and , thanks to him , our Father too . The Word that the Church proclaims -isaia- precisely_the Word of God made man , who_-isaia- himself_the subject and object of this Word . The Good News -isaia- Jesus Christ . Just as '' the Word became flesh and dwelt among us '' Jn : , so too the Good News , the Word of Jesus Christ proclaimed to the nations , must_take root in the life situation of the hearers of the Word . Inculturation -isaia- precisely this insertion of the Gospel message into cultures . For the Incarnation of the Son of God , precisely_because it was complete and concrete , was_also an incarnation in a particular culture . Given the close and organic relationship that exists between Jesus Christ and the Word that the Church proclaims , the inculturation of the revealed message cannot_but follow_the '' logic '' proper to the Mystery of the Redemption . Indeed , the Incarnation of the Word -isaia- not an isolated moment but tends towards Jesus '' Hour '' and the Paschal Mystery : '' Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit '' Jn : . Jesus says : '' And I , when I -amos- lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to myself '' Jn : . This emptying of self , this kenosis necessary_for exaltation , which -isaia-_the_way of Christ and of each of his_disciples cf . Phil : , sheds light on the encounter of cultures with Christ and his Gospel . '' Every culture needs to be transformed by Gospel values in the light of the Paschal Mystery '' . It -isaia- by looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the Mystery of the Incarnation and of the Redemption that the values and counter values of cultures are to be discerned . Just as the Word of God became like us in everything but sin , so too the inculturation of the Good News takes on all authentic human values , purifying them_from sin and restoring to them their full meaning . Inculturation also_has profound links with the Mystery of Pentecost . Thanks to the outpouring and action of the Spirit , who draws gifts and talents into unity , all the peoples of the earth when_they enter_the Church live a new Pentecost , profess in their_own tongue the one faith in Jesus , and proclaim_the marvels that the Lord has done for them . The Spirit , who on the natural level -isaia- the true source of the wisdom of peoples , leads the Church with a supernatural light into knowledge of the whole truth . In her turn the Church takes on the values of different_cultures , becoming the '' sponsa ornata monilibus suis '' , '' the bride who adorns herself with_her jewels '' cf . Criteria and areas of inculturation . Inculturation -isaia- a difficult and delicate task , since it raises the question of the Church s fidelity to the Gospel and the Apostolic Tradition amidst the constant evolution of cultures . Rightly therefore the Synod Fathers observed : '' Considering the rapid changes in the cultural , social , economic and political domains , our local Churches must be involved in the process of inculturation in an ongoing manner , respecting the two following criteria : compatibility with the Christian message and communion with the universal Church . In all cases , care must_be_taken to avoid syncretism '' . '' Inculturation -isaia- a movement towards full evangelization . It seeks to dispose people to receive Jesus Christ in an integral manner . It touches them on the personal , cultural , economic and political levels so that_they_can live a holy life in total union with God the Father , through the action of the Holy Spirit '' . Thanking God for the fruits which_the efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- inculturation have_already brought forth in the life of the Churches of the Continent , notably in the ancient Eastern Churches of Africa , the Synod recommended '' to the Bishops and to the Episcopal Conferences to take note that inculturation includes the whole_life of the Church and the whole process of evangelization . It includes theology , liturgy , the Church s life and structures . All this underlines the need_for research in the field of African cultures in all their complexity '' . Precisely for this_reason_the Synod invited Pastors '' to exploit to the maximum the numerous possibilities which_the Church s present discipline provides in this_matter '' . The Church as God s Family . Not only did the Synod speak of inculturation , but it also made use of it , taking the Church as God s Family as its guiding idea for the evangelization of Africa . The Synod Fathers acknowledged it as an expression of the Church s nature particularly appropriate for Africa . For this image emphasizes care_for others , solidarity , warmth in human relationships , acceptance , dialogue and trust . The new_evangelization will thus aim -atti_degli_apostoli- building up the Church as Family , avoiding all ethnocentrism and excessive particularism , trying instead to encourage reconciliation and true communion_between different ethnic groups , favouring solidarity and the sharing of personnel and resources among the particular Churches , without undue ethnic considerations . '' It -isaia- earnestly to be hoped that theologians in Africa will work out the theology of the Church as Family with all the riches contained in this concept , showing its complementarity with_other images of the Church '' . All this presupposes a profound study of the heritage of Scripture and Tradition which_the Second Vatican Council presented in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium . This admirable text expounds the doctrine on the Church using images drawn_from Sacred Scripture such as the Mystical Body , People of God , Temple of the Holy Spirit , Flock and Sheepfold , the House in which God dwells with_man . According to the Council , the Church -isaia- the Bride of Christ , our Mother , the Holy City and the first fruits of the coming Kingdom . These images will_have to be taken into_account when developing , according to the Synod s recommendation , an ecclesiology focused on the idea of the Church as the Family of God . It will then be possible to appreciate in all its richness and depth the statement which_-isaia- the Dogmatic Constitution s point of departure : '' By her relationship_with Christ , the Church -isaia- a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind '' . In practice , and without_any prejudice to the traditions proper to either the Latin or Eastern Church , '' inculturation of the liturgy , provided it does_not change the essential elements , should be carried_out so that_the_faithful can better understand and live liturgical celebrations '' . The Synod also reaffirmed that , when doctrine -isaia- hard to assimilate even after a long period of evangelization , or when its practice poses serious pastoral problems , especially in the sacramental life , fidelity to the Church s teaching must be maintained . At the same_time , people must be treated with justice and true pastoral_charity . Bearing this in mind , the Synod expressed the hope_that the Episcopal Conferences , in cooperation_with Universities and Catholic Institutes , would set up study commissions , especially_for matters concerning marriage , the veneration of ancestors , and the spirit world , in order to examine in depth all the cultural aspects of problems from the theological , sacramental , liturgical and canonical points of view . '' Openness to dialogue -isaia- the Christian s attitude inside the community as well as with_other believers and with men_and_women of good_will '' . Dialogue -isaia- to be practised first of all within_the family of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels : between Bishops , Episcopal Conferences or Hierarchical Assemblies and the Apostolic See , between Conferences or Episcopal Assemblies of the different nations of the same continent and those of other continents , and within each particular Church between_the Bishop , the presbyterate , consecrated_persons , pastoral workers and the lay_faithful ; and also between different rites within_the same Church . SECAM -isaia- to establish '' structures and means which_will ensure the exercise of this dialogue '' , especially in order to foster an organic pastoral solidarity . '' United to Jesus Christ by their witness in Africa , Catholics are invited to develop an ecumenical dialogue_with all their baptized brothers_and_sisters of other Christian denominations , in order_that the unity for_which Christ prayed may be achieved , and in order_that their service to the peoples of the Continent may make_the Gospel more credible in the eyes of those_who_are searching for God '' . Such dialogue can be conducted through initiatives such as ecumenical translations of the Bible , theological study of various dimensions of the Christian faith or by bearing common evangelical witness to justice , peace and respect_for human_dignity . For this_purpose care will be taken to set up national and diocesan commissions for ecumenism . Together Christians are responsible_for the witness to be borne to the Gospel on the Continent . Advances in ecumenism are_also aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- making this witness more_effective . '' Commitment to dialogue must_also embrace all Muslims of good_will . Christians cannot forget_that many Muslims try to imitate the faith of Abraham and to live the demands of the Decalogue '' . In this_regard the Message of the Synod emphasizes that the Living God , Creator of heaven and earth and the Lord of history , -isaia- the Father of the one great human_family to which we all belong . As such , he wants us to bear_witness to him through our respect_for the values and religious traditions of each_person , working together for_human progress and development -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels . Far from wishing to be the one in whose name a person would kill other people , he requires believers to join together in the service of life in justice_and_peace . Particular care will therefore be taken so that Islamic Christian dialogue respects on both sides the principle of religious_freedom with all that_this involves , also including external and public manifestations of faith . Christians and Muslims are_called to commit themselves to promoting a dialogue free_from the risks of false irenicism or militant fundamentalism , and to raising their voices against unfair policies and practices , as well as against the lack of reciprocity in matters of religious_freedom . With regard to African traditional religion , a serene and prudent dialogue will_be_able , on the one_hand , to protect Catholics from negative influences which condition the way_of_life of many of them and , on the other_hand , to foster the assimilation of positive values such as belief in a Supreme Being who_-isaia- Eternal , Creator , Provident and Just Judge , values_which are readily harmonized with the content of the faith . They can even be seen as a preparation_for the Gospel , because_they contain precious semina Verbi which_can lead , as already happened in the past , a great number of people '' to be open to the fullness of Revelation in Jesus Christ through the proclamation of the Gospel '' . The adherents of African traditional religion should therefore be treated with_great respect and esteem , and all inaccurate and disrespectful language should be avoided . For this_purpose , suitable courses in African traditional religion should be given in houses of formation for priests and religious . Integral human_development . Integral human_development the development of every_person and of the whole person , especially of the poorest and most neglected in the community -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of evangelization . '' Between evangelization and human advancement development and liberation there_are in fact profound links . These include links of an anthropological order , because the man who_-isaia- to be evangelized -isaia- not an abstract being but_-isaia- subject to social_and_economic questions . They also include links in the theological order , since one_cannot dissociate the plan of creation from the plan of Redemption . The latter plan touches the very concrete situations of injustice to be combatted and of justice to be restored . They include links of the eminently evangelical order , which_-isaia- that of charity : how in fact can one proclaim_the new commandment of love without promoting in justice_and_peace the true , authentic advancement of man ? '' When the Lord Jesus began his public ministry in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , he chose the Messianic text of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah in order to shed light on his_mission : '' The Spirit of the Lord God -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor . He has_sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the acceptable year of the Lord '' Lk : ; cf . The Lord thus considers himself as sent to relieve human misery and combat every_kind of neglect . He came to liberate humanity ; he came to take upon himself our infirmities and diseases . '' The entire ministry of Jesus -isaia- marked by the concern he showed to all those around him who_were affected by suffering : persons in mourning , paralytics , lepers , the blind , the deaf , the mute cf . '' It -isaia- impossible to accept that in evangelization one could or should ignore the importance of the problems so much discussed today , concerning justice , liberation , development and peace in the world '' . The liberation that evangelization proclaims '' cannot be contained in the simple and restricted dimension of economics , politics , social or cultural life ; it must envisage the whole man , in all his aspects , right up to and including his openness to the absolute , even the Divine Absolute '' . The Second Vatican Council says so well : '' Pursuing the saving purpose which_-isaia- proper to her , the Church does_not only communicate divine_life to men but in some_way casts the reflected light of that life over the entire earth , most of all by its healing and elevating impact on the dignity of the person , by the way_in_which it strengthens the seams of human_society and imbues the everyday activity of men with a deeper meaning and importance . Thus through_her individual members and her whole community , the Church believes she_can contribute greatly towards making the family of man and its history more_human '' . The Church proclaims and begins to bring_about the Kingdom of God after_the example of Jesus , because '' the Kingdom s nature . -isaia- one of communion among all human_beings with one_another and with God '' . Thus '' the Kingdom -isaia-_the_source of full liberation and total salvation for all people : with this in mind then , the Church walks and lives intimately bound in a real sense to their history '' . Human history finds_its true meaning in the Incarnation of the Word of God , who_-isaia- the foundation of restored human_dignity . It -isaia- through Christ , the '' image of the invisible God , the first born of all creation '' Col : , that man_-isaia- redeemed . '' For by his Incarnation the Son of God has united himself in some fashion with every man '' . How can we fail to exclaim with Saint Leo the Great : '' Christian , recognize your dignity '' ? To proclaim Jesus Christ -isaia- therefore to reveal to people their inalienable dignity , received_from God through the Incarnation of his Only Son . '' Since it has_been entrusted to the Church to reveal the mystery of God , who_-isaia- the ultimate goal of man '' , continues the Second Vatican Council , '' she opens up to man -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the meaning of his_own existence , that_-isaia- , the innermost truth_about himself '' . Endowed with this extraordinary dignity , people should_not live in sub human social , economic , cultural and political conditions . This -isaia- the theological foundation of the struggle for the defence of personal_dignity , for_justice and social peace , for the promotion , liberation and integral human_development of all people and of every_individual . It -isaia-_also for_this reason_that the development of peoples within each nation and among nations must be achieved in solidarity , as my Predecessor Pope Paul VI so well observed . Precisely for this_reason he could affirm : '' The new name for peace_-isaia- development '' . It can thus rightly be stated_that '' integral development implies respect_for human_dignity and this can_only be achieved in justice_and_peace '' . Becoming the voice of the voiceless . Strengthened by faith and hope in the saving power of Jesus , the Synod Fathers concluded their_work by renewing their commitment to accept the challenge of being instruments of salvation in every area of the life of the peoples of Africa . '' The Church '' , they declared , '' must continue to exercise her prophetic role and be the voice of the voiceless '' , so that everywhere the human_dignity of every_individual will be acknowledged , and that people will_always be -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of all government programmes . The Synod '' challenges the consciences of Heads of State and those responsible_for the public domain to guarantee ever_more the liberation and development of their peoples '' . Only -atti_degli_apostoli- this price -isaia- peace established between nations . Evangelization must promote initiatives which contribute to the development and ennoblement of individuals in their_spiritual and material existence . This involves the development of every_person and of the whole person , considered not_only individually but_also and especially in the context of the common and harmonious development of all the members of a nation and of all the peoples of the world . Finally , evangelization must denounce and combat all that degrades and destroys the person . '' The condemnation of evils and injustices -isaia-_also part of that ministry of evangelization in the social field which_-isaia- an aspect of the Church s prophetic role . But it should be made clear_that proclamation -isaia- always more_important than condemnation , and the latter cannot ignore the former , which_gives it true solidity and the force of higher motivation '' . Means of social communication . '' From the beginning it has_been a characteristic of God to want to communicate . This he does by various means . He has bestowed being upon every created thing , animate or inanimate . He enters into relationships with human_beings in a very_special way . '' In many and various_ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ; but in these last days he as spoken to us by a Son '' Heb : '' . The Word of God -isaia- by nature word , dialogue and communication . He came to restore on the one_hand communication and relations_between God and humanity , and on the other_hand those of people_with one_another . The Synod paid great attention to the mass_media under two important and complementary aspects : as a new and emerging cultural world and as a series of means serving communication . First of all , they constitute a new culture that_has its_own language and above all its_own specific values and counter values . For this_reason , like any culture , the mass_media need to be evangelized . Today in fact the mass_media constitute not_only a world but_also a culture and civilization . And it -isaia-_also to this_world that the Church -isaia- sent to bring_the Good News of salvation . The heralds of the Gospel must_therefore enter this_world in order to allow themselves to be permeated by this_new civilization and culture for the purpose of learning how to make good use of them . '' The first Areopagus of the modern age -isaia- the world of communications , which_-isaia- unifying humanity and turning it into what_-isaia- known as a global village . The means of social communication have_become so important as to be for_many the chief means of information and education , of guidance and inspiration in their behaviour as individuals , families and within society -atti_degli_apostoli- large '' . Training in the use of the mass_media -isaia- therefore a necessity not_only_for the preacher of the Gospel , who must master , among other_things , the media style of communication but_also_for the reader , the listener and the viewer . Trained to understand this_kind of communication , they_must be able to make_use of its contributions with discernment and a critical mind . In Africa , where oral transmission -isaia- one of the characteristics of culture , such training -isaia- of capital importance . This same kind of communication must remind pastors , especially Bishops and priests , that the Church -isaia- sent to speak , to preach the Gospel in words and deeds . Thus she cannot remain silent , -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of failing in her_mission , except in cases where silence itself would be a way of speaking and bearing_witness . We must_therefore always preach in season and out of season cf . Tim : , in order to build up , in charity and truth . CHAPTER IV IN THE LIGHT OF THE THIRD CHRISTIAN MILLENNIUM I . Present Day Challenges . The Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops was convoked so that_the_whole Church of God on the Continent might reflect on its evangelizing mission in the light of the Third Millennium and prepare , as I have_said , '' an organic pastoral solidarity within_the entire African territory and nearby Islands '' . Such a mission includes , as already mentioned , urgent tasks and challenges , due to the profound and rapid changes in African societies and to the effects of the emergence of a global civilization . Need for Baptism . The first urgent task -isaia- of course evangelization itself . On the one_hand , the Church must assimilate and live ever more_fully the message which_the Lord has_entrusted to her . On the other_hand , she must bear_witness to this message and proclaim it to all who_do_not yet know Jesus Christ . It -isaia- indeed for them that the Lord said to the Apostles : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations '' Mt : . Just as -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost , the goal of preaching the kerygma -isaia- to bring_the hearer to metanoia and Baptism : '' The proclamation of the word of God has Christian conversion as its aim : a complete and sincere adherence to Christ and his Gospel through_faith '' . Conversion to Christ moreover '' -isaia- joined to Baptism not only_because of the Church s practice , but_also by the will of Christ himself , who sent the Apostles to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them cf . Conversion -isaia-_also joined to Baptism because of the intrinsic need to receive the fullness of new_life in Christ . As Jesus says to Nicodemus : Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one_-isaia- born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter_the Kingdom of God ? Jn : . In Baptism , in fact , we are born anew to the life of God s children , united to Jesus Christ and anointed in the Holy Spirit . Baptism -isaia- not_simply a seal of conversion , a kind of external sign indicating conversion and attesting to it . Rather , it -isaia- a Sacrament which signifies and effects rebirth from the Spirit , establishes real and unbreakable bonds with the Blessed Trinity , and makes us members of the Body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church '' . Therefore a journey of conversion that did_not culminate in Baptism would stop half way . It -isaia- true_that people of upright heart who , through no fault of their_own have_not been reached by the proclamation of the Gospel but who_live in harmony_with their conscience according to God s law , will be saved by Christ and in Christ . For every_human_being there_-isaia- always an actual call from God , which_-isaia- waiting to be acknowledged and received cf . It -isaia- precisely in order to facilitate this recognition and acceptance that Christ s disciples are required not to rest until the Good News of salvation has_been brought to all . The Name of Jesus Christ -isaia-_the_only one by which it has_been decreed that_we_can be saved cf . Because in Africa there_are millions who_are_not yet evangelized , the Church -isaia- faced_with the necessary and urgent task of proclaiming the Good News to all , and leading those_who hear it to Baptism and the Christian life . '' The urgency of missionary_activity derives from the radical newness of life brought by Christ and lived by his followers . This new_life -isaia-_a_gift from God , and people_are asked to accept and develop it , if they wish to realize the fullness of their_vocation in conformity to Christ '' . This new_life in the radical newness of the Gospel also involves certain breaks from the customs and culture of whatever people in the world , because the Gospel -isaia- never an internal product of a particular country but always comes '' from outside '' , from on high . For the baptized the great challenge will_always be that of leading a Christian life in conformity_with_the commitments of Baptism , the Sacrament which signifies death to sin and daily resurrection to new_life cf . Without this conformity , it will be difficult for Christ s disciples to be the '' salt of the earth '' and '' light_of_the_world '' Mt : , . If the Church in Africa makes a vigorous and unhesitating commitment to this path , the Cross can be planted in every_part of the Continent for the salvation of peoples not afraid to open their doors to the Redeemer . In all areas of Church life formation_-isaia- of primary importance . People who have_never had the chance to learn cannot really know_the truths of faith , nor_can they perform actions which_they_have never been taught . For this_reason '' the whole community needs to be trained , motivated and empowered for evangelization , each according_to_his or her specific role within_the Church '' . This includes Bishops , priests , members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , members of Secular Institutes and all the lay_faithful . Missionary training has to have a special place . It -isaia- '' the task of the local Church , assisted by missionaries and their Institutes , and by the personnel from the young Churches . This work must be seen not as peripheral but as central to the Christian life '' . The formation programme will especially include the training of the lay_faithful , so that_they_will fully exercise their role of inspiring the temporal order political , cultural , economic_and_social with Christian principles , which_-isaia- the specific task of the laity s vocation in the world . For this_purpose competent and well motivated lay_people need to be encouraged to enter politics . By worthily carrying_out the duties of public office they will_be_able to '' advance the common_good and prepare the way_for the Gospel '' . Deepening the faith . The Church in Africa , in order to evangelize , must begin '' by being evangelized herself . She needs to listen unceasingly to what she must believe , to her reasons for hoping , to the new commandment of love . She -isaia- the People of God immersed in the world , and often tempted by idols , and she always needs to hear_the proclamation of the mighty works of God '' . In Africa today '' formation in the faith . too_often stops -atti_degli_apostoli- the elementary stage , and the sects easily profit from this ignorance '' . A serious deepening of the faith_-isaia- thus urgently needed , because the rapid evolution of society has_given rise to new challenges linked to the phenomena notably of family uprooting , urbanization , unemployment , materialistic seductions of all kinds , a certain secularization and an intellectual upheaval caused by the avalanche of insufficiently critical ideas spread by the media . The power of witness . Formation must aim to provide Christians not only_with technical expertise in passing on more_clearly the content of the faith but also_with a profound personal conviction enabling them to bear effective witness to it in daily_life . All those called to proclaim_the Gospel will therefore seek to act with total docility to the Spirit , who '' today , just as -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Church , acts in every evangelizer who allows himself to be possessed and led by him '' . '' Techniques of evangelization are good , but_even the most advanced ones could_not replace the gentle action of the Spirit . Even the most thorough preparation of the evangelizer has no effect without_the Holy Spirit . Without the Holy Spirit the most convincing dialectic has no power over the human_heart . Without him the most highly developed schemes on a sociological or psychological basis are quickly seen to be quite valueless '' . Genuine witness by believers -isaia- essential to the authentic proclamation of the faith in Africa today . In particular they_should show the witness of sincere mutual love . '' This -isaia- eternal_life , that_they know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom_you have sent Jn : . The ultimate purpose of mission_-isaia- to enable people to share in the communion_which exists between_the Father and the Son . The disciples are to live in unity with one_another , remaining in the Father and the Son , so that_the_world may know and believe cf . This -isaia- a very_important missionary text . It makes us understand_that we are missionaries above all because of what we are , a Church whose innermost life_-isaia- unity in love , even before we become missionaries in word and deed '' . Inculturating the faith . By reason of its deep conviction_that '' the synthesis between culture and faith -isaia-_not_only a demand of culture but_also of faith '' , because '' a faith_that does_not become culture -isaia- not fully accepted , not entirely thought out , not faithfully lived '' , the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops considered inculturation a priority and an urgent task in the life of Africa s particular Churches . Only in this_way can the Gospel be firmly implanted in the Continent s Christian communities . Following in the footsteps of the Second Vatican Council , the Synod Fathers interpreted inculturation as a process that includes the whole of Christian existence theology , liturgy , customs , structures without of course compromising what_-isaia- of divine right and the great discipline of the Church , confirmed in the course of centuries by remarkable fruits of virtue and heroism . The challenge of inculturation in Africa consists in ensuring that the followers of Christ will ever more_fully assimilate the Gospel message , while remaining faithful to all authentic African values . Inculturation of the faith in every area of Christian and human life_-isaia- an arduous task which_can only be carried_out with the help of the Spirit of the Lord who leads the Church to the whole truth cf . The challenge of dialogue -isaia- fundamentally the challenge of transforming relationships between individuals , nations and peoples in religious , political , economic , social_and_cultural life . It -isaia- the challenge of Christ s love for all people , a love_that the disciple must reproduce in his own_life : '' By this all men will know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another '' Jn : . '' Evangelization continues the dialogue of God with humanity and reaches its apex in the person of Jesus Christ '' . Through the Cross he brought an end in himself to the hostility which divides people and keeps them apart cf . Despite the modern civilization of the '' global village '' , in Africa as elsewhere in the world_the spirit of dialogue , peace and reconciliation -isaia- far from dwelling in the hearts of everyone . Wars , conflicts and racist and xenophobic attitudes still play too large a role in the world of human relations . The Church in Africa -isaia- aware_that it has to become for all , through the witness borne by its_own sons_and_daughters , a place of true reconciliation . Forgiven and mutually reconciled , these sons_and_daughters will thus be able to bring to the world_the forgiveness and reconciliation which Christ our Peace cf . Eph : offers to humanity through_his Church . Otherwise the world will look more_and_more like a battlefield , where only selfish interests count and the law of force prevails , the law which fatally distances humanity from the hoped for civilization of love . The Family Evangelizing the family . '' The future of the world and of the Church passes through the family '' . Not only -isaia- the Christian family the first cell of the living ecclesial_community , it -isaia-_also the fundamental cell of society . In Africa in particular , the family_-isaia- the foundation on which_the social edifice -isaia- built . This -isaia- why_the Synod considered the evangelization of the African family a major priority , if the family_-isaia- to assume in its turn the role of active subject in view of the evangelization of families through families . From the pastoral point_of_view , this_-isaia- a real challenge , given the political , economic , social_and_cultural difficulties which African families must face as a result of the great changes which characterize contemporary society . While adopting the positive values of modernity , the African family must preserve its_own essential values . The Holy Family as a model . In this_regard the Holy Family , which according to the Gospel cf . Mt : lived for a time in Africa , -isaia- the '' prototype and example for all Christian families '' and the model and spiritual source for_every Christian family . To repeat the words of Pope Paul VI , pilgrim to the Holy Land : '' The home of Nazareth -isaia- the school where we begin to understand_the life of Jesus the school of the Gospel . Here , in this school , one learns why it -isaia- necessary to have a spiritual rule of life , if one wishes to follow_the teaching of the Gospel and become a disciple of Christ '' . In his profound meditation on the mystery of Nazareth , Pope Paul VI invites us to learn a threefold lesson : of silence , of family_life and of work . In the home of Nazareth each_one lives his or her_own mission in perfect harmony_with_the other members of the Holy Family . Dignity and role of man_and_woman . The dignity of man_and_woman derives from the fact_that when God created man , '' in the image of God he created him , male and female he created them '' Gen : . Both man_and_woman are created '' in the image of God '' , that_-isaia- , endowed_with intelligence and will and therefore with freedom . The account of our_first parents sin confirms this cf . The Psalmist sings of man s incomparable dignity : '' Yet you have_made him little less_than a god ; with glory and honour you crowned him , gave him power over the works of your hand , put all things under his feet '' Ps : . Having both been created in the image of God , man_and_woman , although different , are essentially equal from the point_of_view of their humanity . '' From the very_beginning , both are persons , unlike the other living beings in the world about them . The woman -isaia- another I in a common humanity '' , and each -isaia- a help for the other cf . '' In creating the human_race male and female , God gives man_and_woman an equal personal_dignity , endowing them_with inalienable rights and responsibilities proper to the human_person '' . The Synod deplored those African customs and practices '' which deprive women of their_rights and the respect due to them '' and asked the Church on the Continent to make every_effort to foster the safeguarding of these rights . Dignity and role of Marriage . God Father , Son and Holy Spirit -isaia- love cf . '' The communion_between God and his_people finds_its definitive fulfilment in Jesus Christ , the Bridegroom who loves and gives himself as the Saviour of humanity , uniting it to himself as his Body . He reveals the original truth of marriage , the truth of the beginning , and , freeing man from his hardness of heart , he makes man capable of realizing this_truth in its entirety . This revelation reaches its definitive fullness in the gift of love_which the Word of God makes to humanity in assuming a human_nature , and in the sacrifice which Jesus Christ makes of himself on the Cross for his Bride , the Church . In this sacrifice there_-isaia- entirely revealed that plan which God has imprinted on the humanity of man_and_woman since their creation cf . Eph : ; the Marriage of baptized persons thus becomes a real symbol of that new and eternal Covenant sanctioned in the Blood of Christ '' . The mutual love of baptized spouses makes present_the love of Christ for his Church . As a sign of this_love of Christ , Marriage -isaia- a Sacrament of the New Covenant : '' Spouses are therefore the permanent reminder to the Church of what happened on the Cross ; they_are for one_another and for the children witnesses to the salvation in which_the Sacrament makes them sharers . Of this salvation event Marriage , like every sacrament , -isaia- a memorial , actuation and prophecy '' . Marriage -isaia- therefore a state of life , a way of Christian holiness , a vocation which_-isaia- meant to lead to the glorious resurrection and to the Kingdom , where '' they neither marry nor are given in marriage '' Mt : . Marriage thus demands an indissoluble love ; thanks to this stability it can contribute effectively to the complete fulfilment of the spouses baptismal vocation . Saving the African family . Many interventions in the Synod Hall highlighted present_day threats to the African family . The concerns of the Synod Fathers were all the more justified in that the preparatory document of a United Nations Conference held in September in Cairo on African soil clearly seemed to wish to adopt resolutions contradicting many values of the African family . The Synod Fathers , accepting my concerns previously expressed to the Conference and to all the world s Heads of State , launched an urgent appeal to safeguard the family . They pleaded : '' Do not_allow the African family to be ridiculed on its_own soil ! Do not_allow the International Year of the Family to become the year of the destruction of the family ! '' The family as open to society . By its_nature marriage , which_has the special mission of perpetuating humanity , transcends the couple . In the same_way , by its_nature , the family extends beyond_the individual household : it -isaia- oriented towards society . '' The family has vital and organic links with society , since_it_-isaia- its foundation and nourishes it continually through its role of service to life : it -isaia- from the family that citizens come to birth and it -isaia- within_the family that_they find the first school of the social virtues that_are the animating principle of the existence and development of society itself . Thus , far_from_being closed in on itself , the family_-isaia- by nature and vocation open to other families and to society , and undertakes its social role '' . Along these lines , the Special Assembly for Africa affirmed that the goal of evangelization_-isaia- to build up the Church as the Family of God , an anticipation on earth , though imperfect , of the Kingdom . The Christian families of Africa will thus become true '' domestic churches '' , contributing to society s progress towards a more fraternal life . This -isaia- how African societies will be transformed through the Gospel ! CHAPTER V '' YOU SHALL BE MY WITNESSES '' IN AFRICA Witness and holiness . The challenges mentioned show how opportune the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops was : the Church s task in Africa -isaia- immense ; in order to face it everyone s cooperation -isaia- necessary . Witness -isaia- an essential element of this cooperation . Christ challenges his_disciples in Africa and gives them the mandate which he gave to the Apostles on the day of his Ascension : '' You shall be my witnesses '' Acts : in Africa . The proclamation of the Good News by word and deed opens people s hearts to the desire_for holiness , for being configured to Christ . In his First Letter to the Corinthians , Saint Paul addresses '' those sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , together_with all those_who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ '' : . Preaching the Gospel also aims to build up the Church of God , in the light of the coming of the Kingdom , which Christ will hand over to the Father -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time cf . '' Entrance into the Kingdom of God demands a change of mentality metanoia and behaviour and a life of witness in word and deed , a life nourished in the Church by the reception of the sacraments , particularly the Eucharist , the Sacrament of salvation '' . Inculturation , through_which the faith penetrates the life of individuals and their primary communities , -isaia-_also a path to holiness . Just as in the Incarnation Christ assumed human_nature in everything but sin , analogously through inculturation the Christian message assimilates the values of the society to which_it_-isaia- proclaimed , rejecting whatever_-isaia- marked by sin . To the extent_that an ecclesial_community can integrate the positive values of a specific culture , inculturation becomes an instrument by which_the community opens itself to the riches of Christian holiness . An inculturation wisely carried_out purifies and elevates the cultures of the various peoples . From this point_of_view the liturgy -isaia- called to play an important role . As an effective way of proclaiming and living the mysteries of salvation , the liturgy can_make a valid contribution towards_the elevation and enrichment of specific manifestations of the culture of a people . It will therefore be the task of competent authority to see to the inculturation of those liturgical elements which , following artistically worthy models , can be changed in the light of current norms . Evangelization needs agents . For '' how are men to call_upon him the Lord in whom they_have not believed ? And how are they to believe in him of whom_they have_never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ? And how_can men preach unless they_are sent ? '' Rom : . The proclamation of the Gospel can be fully carried_out only through the contribution of all believers -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of the universal and local Church . It -isaia-_especially the concern of the local Church , entrusted to the responsibility of the Bishop , to coordinate the commitment to evangelization by gathering the faithful together , confirming them in the faith through the work of the priests and catechists , and supporting them in the fulfilment of their_respective tasks . In order to accomplish this , the Diocese -isaia- to establish the necessary structures for getting together , dialogue and planning . By making use of these structures the Bishop will_be_able to guide in a suitable manner the work of priests , religious and laity , welcoming the gifts and charisms of each_one , in order to put them -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of an updated and clearsighted plan of pastoral action . The different Councils provided for by the current norms of Canon Law are to be considered a great help in contributing to this_end . Vital Christian communities . Right from the beginning , the Synod Fathers recognized that the Church as Family cannot reach her full potential as Church unless she_-isaia- divided into communities small enough to foster close human relationships . The Assembly described the characteristics of such communities as follows : primarily they_should be places engaged in evangelizing themselves , so that subsequently they_can bring_the Good News to others ; they_should moreover be communities which pray and listen to God s Word , encourage the members themselves to take on responsibility , learn to live an ecclesial life , and reflect on different human problems in the light of the Gospel . Above all , these communities are to be committed to living Christ s love for everybody , a love_which transcends the limits of the natural solidarity of clans , tribes or other interest groups . The laity are to be helped to become increasingly aware of their role in the Church , thereby fulfilling their particular mission as baptized and confirmed persons , according to the teaching of the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici and the Encyclical Letter Redemptoris Missio . Lay people_are to be trained for their_mission through suitable centres and schools of biblical and pastoral formation . Similarly , Christians who occupy positions of responsibility are to be carefully prepared_for political , economic_and_social tasks by means of a solid formation in the Church s social_doctrine , so that in their places of work they_will be faithful witnesses to the Gospel . '' The role of the catechist has_been and remains a determinative force in the implantation and expansion of the Church in Africa . The Synod recommends that catechists not_only receive a sound initial formation . but that_they continue to receive doctrinal formation as well as moral and spiritual support '' . Both Bishops and priests_are to have_their catechists -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , seeing to it that_they_are guaranteed suitable living and working conditions so that_they carry_out_their mission properly . In the midst of the Christian community the catechists responsibility -isaia- to be acknowledged and held in respect . The Synod launched an explicit appeal for each African Christian family to become '' a privileged place_for evangelical witness '' , a true '' domestic church '' , a community which believes and evangelizes , a community in dialogue_with God and generously open to the service of humanity . '' It -isaia- in the heart of the family that parents are by word and example . the first heralds of the faith with_regard to their_children '' . '' It -isaia- here that the father of the family , the mother , children , and all members of the family exercise the priesthood of the baptized in a privileged way by the reception of the sacraments , prayer and thanksgiving , the witness of a holy life and selfdenial and active charity . Thus the home -isaia-_the_first school of Christian life and a school for_human enrichment '' . Parents are to see to the Christian education of their_children . With the practical help offered by strong , serene and committed Christian families , Dioceses will develop a programme for the family apostolate as part of their overall pastoral plan . The Christian family , as a '' domestic Church '' built on the solid cultural pillars and noble values of the African tradition of the family , -isaia- called_upon to be a powerful nucleus of Christian witness in a society undergoing rapid and profound changes . The Synod felt this challenge with a particular urgency because the Church was then celebrating the Year of the Family with the rest of the international community . The Church in Africa knows well that youth are not_only the present but_above all the future of humanity . It -isaia- thus necessary to help young_people to overcome the obstacles thwarting their development : illiteracy , idleness , hunger , drugs . In order to meet these challenges , young_people themselves should be called_upon to become the evangelizers of their peers . No one_can do this better_than they . The pastoral_care of youth must clearly be a part of the overall pastoral plan of Dioceses and parishes , so that young_people will be enabled to discover very early on the value of the gift_of_self , an essential means_for the person to reach maturity . In this_regard , the celebration of World Youth Day -isaia- a privileged instrument for the pastoral_care of youth , which favours their formation through prayer , study and reflection . Consecrated men_and_women . '' In the Church understood as the Family of God , consecrated_life has the particular function not_only of indicating to all the call to holiness but_also of witnessing to fraternal life in community . Therefore , all who_live the consecrated_life are_called to respond to their_vocation in a spirit of communion and cooperation_with the respective Bishops , clergy and laity '' . In the present_day circumstances of the mission in Africa , it -isaia- necessary to foster religious vocations to the contemplative and active life , above all choosing them with_great discernment , and then seeing that_they receive an integral human formation , as well as one which_-isaia- solid in its spiritual and doctrinal , apostolic and missionary , biblical and theological dimensions . This formation_-isaia- to be faithfully and regularly updated down through the years . With regard to the foundation of new Religious Institutes , great prudence and enlightened discernment are needed , and the criteria laid_down by the Second Vatican Council and the canonical norms now in force are to be followed . Once established , these Institutes are to be helped in acquiring juridical status and becoming autonomous in the management both of their_own works and of their_respective sources of income . The Synodal Assembly , having stated_that '' Religious Institutes that do not_have houses in Africa '' are_not authorized '' to come seeking new vocations without prior dialogue_with_the local Ordinary '' , then urged the leaders of the local Churches and of the Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life to foster dialogue among_themselves , in order to create , in the spirit of the Church as Family , mixed groups for consultation which_would serve as a witness to fraternity and as a sign of unity in the service of a common mission . In this light , I have_also accepted the request of the Synod Fathers to revise , if necessary , some points in the document Mutuae Relationes , in order to define better the role of religious_life in the local Church . The Synod Fathers affirmed that '' today more_than_ever there_-isaia- need to form future priests in the true cultural values of their_country , in a sense of honesty , responsibility and integrity . They shall be formed in such a manner that_they_will have_the qualities of the representatives of Christ , of true servants and animators of the Christian community . solidly spiritual , ready to serve , dedicated to evangelization , capable of administering the goods of the Church efficiently and openly , and of living a simple life as befits their milieu '' . While respecting the traditions proper to the Eastern Churches , seminarians '' should acquire affective maturity and should be both clear in their_minds and deeply convinced_that for the priest celibacy -isaia- inseparable from chastity '' . Moreover '' they_should receive adequate formation on the meaning and place of consecration to Christ in the priesthood '' . Where pastoral conditions lend themselves to respect and understanding of this ancient ministry in the Church , Episcopal Conferences and Assemblies are to study the most suitable ways of promoting and encouraging the permanent diaconate '' as an ordained ministry and also as an instrument of evangelization '' . Where deacons already exist they_should be provided with an integrated and thorough programme of permanent formation . Deeply grateful to all the priests diocesan and members of Institutes for the apostolic work they_are doing and aware of the demands made by the evangelization of the peoples of Africa and Madagascar , the Synodal Assembly urged priests to live their '' faithfulness to their_vocation in the total gift_of_self to their_mission and in full_communion with_their Bishop '' . As for the Bishops , they_are to see to the ongoing_formation of priests , especially in the first years of their_ministry , helping them especially to deepen their understanding of sacred celibacy and to persevere in living it faithfully , recognizing '' this surpassing gift_which the Father has_given them , and which_the Lord praised so openly . Let them keep in mind the great mysteries which_are signified and fulfilled in it . '' This formation programme -isaia-_also to give particular attention to the wholesome values present in the priests surroundings . It -isaia- appropriate moreover to mention that the Second Vatican Council encouraged among priests '' a certain common life '' , that_-isaia- some kind of community life in the different_forms suggested by real personal and pastoral needs . This will contribute towards_the growth of the spiritual and intellectual life , of apostolic and pastoral_ministry , of charity and mutual support , especially with_regard to priests_who are elderly , sick or in difficulty . The Bishops themselves will carefully pastor the Church which God obtained with the Blood of his_own Son , fulfilling the responsibility entrusted to them by the Holy Spirit cf . According to the recommendation of the Second Vatican Council , Bishops dedicated to carrying_out '' their Apostolic office as witnesses of Christ before all people '' are to exercise personally , in a spirit of trusting cooperation_with the presbyterate and other pastoral workers , an irreplaceable service of unity in charity , carefully fulfilling their responsibilities of teaching , sanctifying and governing . Moreover they_are regularly to update themselves theologically and to foster their_spiritual life , taking part as much as possible in the sessions of renewal and formation organized by the Episcopal Conferences or the Apostolic See . In particular , they_should never forget the admonition of Pope Saint Gregory the Great , according to whom_the Pastor -isaia- the light of his faithful above all through an exemplary moral conduct marked by holiness . It -isaia- a source of joy and comfort to note that '' the laity are more_and_more engaged in the mission of the Church in Africa and Madagascar '' , thanks especially '' to the dynamism of Catholic Action movements , apostolic associations and new spiritual movements '' . The Synod Fathers requested that_this thrust be pursued and developed among all the laity : adults , youth and children . By its_nature the parish -isaia- the ordinary place_where the faithful worship and live their Christian life . In it they_can express and practise the initiatives which faith and Christian charity bring to the attention of the community of believers . The parish -isaia- the place which manifests the communion of various groups and movements , which find in it spiritual sustenance and material support . Priests and lay_people will see_to_it_that parish life_-isaia- harmonious , expressing the Church as Family , where all devote '' themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers '' Acts : . Movements and associations . A fraternal harmony which bears living witness to the Gospel will_also be the goal of apostolic movements and religious associations . In them the lay_faithful truly find a privileged opportunity to be the '' leaven in the dough '' cf . Mt : , especially in areas concerned_with the administration of temporal goods according to God s plan and the struggle for the promotion of human_dignity , justice_and_peace . '' Catholic schools are_-atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time places of evangelization , well rounded education , inculturation and initiation to the dialogue of life among young_people of different religions and social backgrounds '' . The Church in Africa and Madagascar should therefore make its_own contribution to the fostering of '' education for all '' in Catholic schools , without neglecting '' the Christian education of pupils in non Catholic schools . For university students there_will be a programme of religious formation which corresponds to the level of studies '' . These contributions presuppose the human , cultural and religious formation of the educators themselves . Universities and Higher Institutes . '' The Catholic Universities and Higher Institutes in Africa have a prominent role to play in the proclamation of the salvific Word of God . They are a sign of the growth of the Church insofar as their research integrates the truths and experiences of the faith and helps to internalize them . They serve the Church by providing trained personnel , by studying important theological and social questions for the benefit of the Church , by developing an African theology , by promoting the work of inculturation especially in liturgical celebration , by publishing books and publicizing Catholic truth , by undertaking assignments given by the Bishops and by contributing to a scientific study of cultures '' . In this_time of generalized social upheaval on the Continent , the Christian faith can shed helpful light on African society . '' Catholic cultural centres offer to the Church the possibility of presence and action in the field of cultural change . They constitute in effect public forums which allow the Church to make widely known , in creative dialogue , Christian convictions about man , woman , family , work , economy , society , politics , international life , the environment '' . Thus they_are places of listening , respect and tolerance . Precisely in this_context the Synod Fathers emphasized how necessary it -isaia- for each Christian community to be organized so that as far_as_possible it can provide_for its_own needs . Besides qualified personnel , evangelization requires material and financial means , and Dioceses are_often far from possessing them in sufficient measure . It -isaia- therefore urgent that the particular Churches in Africa have_the objective of providing for their_own needs as soon as possible , thereby assuring their self sufficiency . Consequently , I earnestly invite the Episcopal Conferences , Dioceses and all the Christian communities of the Continent s Churches , insofar as it -isaia- within their competence , to see_to_it_that this self sufficiency becomes increasingly evident . At the same_time , I call on sister Churches all over the world to be more generous to the Pontifical Mission Aid Societies so that , through_their structures of assistance , they will_be_able to offer to poorer Dioceses economic assistance dedicated to projects that_will generate resources , with_a_view to increasing the financial self reliance of the Churches . Lastly , we cannot forget_that a Church -isaia- able to reach material and financial independence only if the people entrusted to it do not live in conditions of extreme poverty . CHAPTER VI BUILDING THE KINGDOM OF GOD Kingdom of justice_and_peace . The mandate that Jesus gave to his_disciples -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his Ascension into_heaven -isaia- addressed to the Church of God in all times and places . The Church as the Family of God in Africa must bear_witness to Christ also by promoting justice_and_peace on the Continent and throughout_the_world . The Lord says : '' Blessed are the peacemakers , for they_shall be called sons of God . Blessed are_those_who are persecuted for righteousness sake , for theirs -isaia- the Kingdom of heaven '' Mt : . The Church s witness must be accompanied by a firm commitment to justice and solidarity by each member of God s People . This -isaia-_especially important_for the lay faithful_who hold public office , because such witness demands an abiding spiritual attitude and a way_of_life consistent with the Christian faith . Ecclesial dimension of witness . The Synod Fathers drew attention to the ecclesial dimension of this witness and solemnly declared : '' The Church must continue to play her prophetic role and be the voice of the voiceless '' . But to achieve this effectively , the Church , as a community of faith , must be an energetic witness to justice_and_peace in her structures and in the relationships among her members . The Message of the Synod courageously states : '' The Churches in Africa are_also aware_that , insofar as their_own internal affairs are_concerned , justice -isaia- not_always respected with_regard to those men_and_women_who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- their service . If the Church -isaia- to give witness to justice , she recognizes that whoever dares to speak to others about justice should_also strive to be just in their_eyes . It -isaia- necessary therefore to examine with care the procedures , the possessions and the life style of the Church '' . In what concerns the promotion of justice and especially_the defence of fundamental human_rights , the Church s apostolate cannot be improvised . Aware that in many African countries gross violations of human_dignity and rights are_being perpetrated , I ask the Episcopal Conferences to establish , where they_do_not yet exist , Justice and Peace Commissions -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels . These will awaken Christian communities to their evangelical responsibilities in the defence of human_rights . If the proclamation of justice_and_peace -isaia- an integral part of the task of evangelization , it follows_that the promotion of these values should_also be a part of the pastoral programme of each Christian community . That -isaia- why I urge that all pastoral agents are to be adequately trained for_this apostolate . '' The formation of clergy , religious and laity , imparted in the areas of their apostolate , should lay emphasis on the social_teaching of the Church . Each person , according_to_his state of life , should be specially trained to know his rights_and_duties , the meaning and service of the common_good , honest management of public goods and the proper manner of participating in political_life , in order to be able to act in a credible manner in the face of social injustices '' . As a body organized within_the community and the nation , the Church has both the right and the duty to participate fully in building a just and peaceful society with all the means -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal . Here we must mention the Church s apostolate in the areas of education , health_care , social awareness and in other programmes of assistance . In the measure that_these activities help to reduce ignorance , improve public health and promote a greater participation of all in solving the problems of society in a spirit of freedom and co responsibility , the Church creates conditions for the progress of justice_and_peace . The salt of the earth . In the pluralistic societies of our_day , it -isaia-_especially due to the commitment of Catholics in public_life that the Church can exercise a positive influence . Whether they be professionals or teachers , businessmen or civil servants , law enforcement agents or politicians , Catholics are expected to bear_witness to goodness , truth , justice and love of God in their_daily life . '' The task of the faithful lay person . -isaia- to be the salt of the earth and light_of_the_world , especially in those places_where only a lay person_-isaia- able to render the Church present '' . Cooperation with_other believers . The obligation to commit oneself to the development of peoples -isaia- not_just an individual duty , and still less an individualistic one , as if it were possible to achieve this development through the isolated efforts of each_person . It -isaia- a responsibility which obliges each_and_every man_and_woman , as well as societies and nations . In particular , it obliges the Catholic Church and the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , with_which Catholics are willing to cooperate in this_field . In this_sense , just as Catholics invite their Christian brothers_and_sisters to share in their initiatives , so , when_they accept invitations offered to them , Catholics show that_they_are ready to cooperate in projects undertaken by other Christians . In the promotion of integral human_development Catholics can_also cooperate with the believers of other_religions , as in fact they are_already doing in various places . Good administration of public affairs . The Synod Fathers were unanimous in acknowledging that the greatest challenge for bringing_about justice_and_peace in Africa consists in a good administration of public affairs in the two interrelated areas of politics and the economy . Certain problems have_their roots outside the Continent and therefore are_not entirely under the control of those in power or of national leaders . But the Synodal Assembly acknowledged that_many of the Continent s problems are the result of a manner of governing often stained by corruption . A serious reawakening of conscience linked to a firm determination of will -isaia- necessary , in order to put into_effect solutions which_can no longer be put off . Building the nation . On the political front , the arduous process of building national unity encounters particular problems in the Continent where most of the States are relatively young political entities . To reconcile profound differences , overcome longstanding ethnic animosities and become integrated into international life demands a high degree of competence in the art of governing . That -isaia- why_the Synod prayed fervently to the Lord that there_would arise in Africa holy politicians both men_and_women and that there_would be saintly Heads of State , who profoundly love their_own people and wish to serve rather_than be served . The rule of law . The foundation of good government must be established on the sound basis of laws which protect the rights and define the obligations of the citizens . I must note with_great sadness that_many African nations still labour under authoritarian and oppressive regimes which deny their subjects personal freedom and fundamental human_rights , especially_the freedom of association and of political expression , as well as the right to choose their governments by free and honest elections . Such political injustices provoke tensions which often degenerate into armed conflicts and internal wars , bringing with_them serious consequences such as famine , epidemics and destruction , not to mention massacres and the scandal and tragedy of refugees . That -isaia- why_the Synod rightly considered that an authentic democracy , which respects pluralism , '' -isaia- one of the principal routes along which_the Church travels together_with_the people . The lay Christian , engaged in the democratic struggle according to the spirit of the Gospel , -isaia- the sign of a Church which participates in the promotion of the rule of law everywhere in Africa '' . Administering the common patrimony . The Synod also called on African governments to establish the appropriate policies needed to increase economic growth and investment in order to create new jobs . This involves the commitment to pursue sound economic policies , adopting the right priorities for the exploitation and distribution of often scarce national resources in such_a_way as to provide_for people s basic needs , and to ensure an honest and equitable sharing of benefits and burdens . In particular , governments have_the binding duty to protect the common patrimony against all forms of waste and embezzlement by citizens lacking public spirit or by unscrupulous foreigners . It -isaia-_also the duty of governments to undertake suitable initiatives to improve the conditions of international commerce . Africa s economic problems are compounded by the dishonesty of corrupt government leaders who , in connivance with domestic or foreign private interests , divert national resources for their_own profit and transfer public funds to private accounts in foreign banks . This -isaia- plain theft , whatever the legal camouflage may be . I earnestly hope_that international bodies and people of integrity in Africa and elsewhere will_be_able to investigate suitable legal ways of having these embezzled funds returned . In the granting of loans , it -isaia- important to make sure of the responsibility and forthrightness of the beneficiaries . The international dimension . As an Assembly of Bishops of the universal Church presided over by the Successor of Peter , the Synod furnished a providential occasion to evaluate positively the place and role of Africa in the universal Church and the world community . Since we live in a world that_-isaia- increasingly interdependent , the destinies and problems of the different regions are linked together . As God s Family on earth , the Church should be the living sign and efficacious instrument of universal solidarity for building a world wide community of justice_and_peace . A better world will come about only if it -isaia- built on the solid foundation of sound ethical and spiritual principles . In the present world order , the African nations are among the most disadvantaged . Rich countries must become clearly aware of their_duty to support the efforts of the countries struggling to rise from their poverty and misery . In fact , it -isaia- in the interest of the rich countries to choose the path of solidarity , for only in this_way can lasting peace and harmony for_humanity be ensured . Moreover , the Church in the developed countries cannot ignore the added responsibility arising from the Christian commitment to justice and charity . Because all men_and_women bear God s image and are_called to belong to the same family redeemed by Christ s Blood , each_individual should be guaranteed just access to the world s resources which God has put -atti_degli_apostoli- the everyone s disposal . It -isaia- not hard to see the many practical implications of this . In the first_place it involves working for improved socio political relations among nations , ensuring greater justice and dignity for those countries which , after gaining independence , have_been members of the international community for less time . A compassionate ear must_also be lent to the anguished cries of the poor nations asking for help in areas of particular importance : malnutrition , the widespread deterioration in the standard of living , the insufficiency of means_for educating the young , the lack of elementary health and social services with the resulting persistence of endemic diseases , the spread of the terrible scourge of AIDS , the heavy and often unbearable burden of international debt , the horror of fratricidal wars fomented by unscrupulous arms trafficking , the shameful and pitiable spectacle of refugees and displaced persons . These are_some of the areas where prompt interventions are necessary and expedient , even if in the overall situation they seem to be inadequate . Some worrisome problems Restoring hope to youth . The economic situation of poverty has a particularly negative impact on the young . They embark on adult life with very little enthusiasm for a present riddled with frustrations and they look with still less hope to a future which to them seems sad and sombre . That -isaia- why they tend to flee the neglected rural areas and gather in cities which in fact do not_have much_more to offer them . Many of them go to foreign countries where , as if in exile , they live a precarious existence as economic refugees . With the Synod Fathers I feel the duty to plead their cause : it -isaia- urgently necessary to find a solution for their impatience to take_part in the life of the nation and of the Church . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time I also wish to appeal to the youth : Dear young_people , the Synod asks you to take in hand the development of your countries , to love the culture of your_people , and to work_for its renewal with fidelity to your cultural heritage , through a sharpening of your scientific and technical expertise , and above all through the witness of your Christian faith . The scourge of AIDS . Against the background of widespread poverty and inadequate medical services the Synod considered the tragic scourge of AIDS which_-isaia- sowing suffering and death in many_parts of Africa . It noted the role played in the spread of this disease by irresponsible sexual behaviour and drafted this strong recommendation : '' The companionship , joy , happiness and peace which Christian marriage and fidelity provide , and the safeguard which chastity gives , must be continuously presented to the faithful , particularly the young '' . The battle against AIDS ought to be everyone s battle . Echoing the voice of the Synod Fathers , I too ask pastoral workers to bring to their brothers_and_sisters affected by AIDS all possible material , moral and spiritual comfort . I urgently ask the world s scientists and political leaders , moved by the love and respect due to every human_person , to use every_means available in order to put an end to this scourge . '' Beat your swords into ploughshares '' Is : : no more wars ! . The Synod incisively described the tragedy of wars which_are tearing Africa apart : '' For some decades now Africa has been_the theatre of fratricidal wars which_are decimating peoples and destroying their natural and cultural resources '' . This very sad situation , in addition to causes external to Africa , also_has internal causes such as '' tribalism , nepotism , racism , religious intolerance and the thirst_for power taken to the extreme by totalitarian regimes which trample with impunity the rights and dignity of the person . Peoples crushed and reduced to silence suffer as innocent and resigned victims all these situations of injustice '' . I cannot_fail to join my voice to that of the members of the Synodal Assembly in order to deplore the situations of unspeakable suffering caused by so many conflicts now taking place or about to break out , and to ask all those_who can do so to make every_effort to put an end to such tragedies . Together with the Synod Fathers , I likewise urge a serious commitment to foster on the Continent conditions of greater social_justice and good government , in order thereby to prepare the ground for peace . '' If you want peace , work for_justice '' . It -isaia- much better and also easier to prevent wars than to try to stop them after they_have broken out . It -isaia- time that peoples beat their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruning hooks cf . The Church in Africa especially through some of its leaders has_been in the front line of the search_for negotiated solutions to the armed conflicts in many_parts of the Continent . This mission of pacification must continue , encouraged by the Lord s promise in the Beatitudes : '' Blessed are the peacemakers , they_shall be called sons of God '' Mt : . Those who foment wars in Africa by the arms trade are accomplices in abominable crimes against humanity . I make my own the Synod s recommendations on this_subject . Having said_that '' the sale of arms -isaia- a scandal since it sows the seed of death '' , the Synod appealed to all countries that sell arms to Africa to stop doing so , and it asked African governments '' to move away from huge military expenditures and put the emphasis on the education , health and well_being of their_people '' . Africa must continue to seek peaceful and effective means so that military regimes will transfer authority to civilians . But it -isaia-_also true_that the military are_called to play a distinctive role in the nation . Thus , while the Synod praised the '' brothers in the military for the service that_they assume in the name of our countries '' , it immediately warned them forcefully that '' they_will have to answer before God for_every act of violence against the lives of innocent people '' . Refugees and displaced persons . One of the most bitter fruits of wars and economic hardships -isaia- the sad phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons , a phenomenon which , as the Synod mentioned , has reached tragic dimensions . The ideal solution -isaia- the re establishment of a just peace , reconciliation and economic development . It -isaia- therefore urgent that national , regional and international organizations should find equitable and long lasting solutions to the problems of refugees and displaced persons . In the meantime , since_the Continent continues to suffer from the massive displacement of refugees , I make a pressing appeal that these_people be given material help and offered pastoral support wherever they_may be , whether in Africa or on other Continents . The burden of the international debt . The question of the indebtedness of poor nations towards rich ones -isaia-_a_matter of great concern_for the Church , as expressed in many official documents and interventions of the Holy See . Taking up the words of the Synod Fathers , I particularly feel it -isaia- my duty to urge '' the Heads of State and their governments in Africa not to crush their peoples with internal and external debts '' . I also make a pressing appeal to '' the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and all foreign creditors to alleviate the crushing debts of the African nations '' . Finally , I earnestly ask '' the Episcopal Conferences of the industrialized countries to present this issue consistently to their governments and to the organizations concerned '' . The situation of many African countries -isaia- so serious as to leave no room_for attitudes of indifference and complacency . Dignity of the African woman . One of the characteristic signs of our_times -isaia- the growing awareness of women s dignity and of their_specific role in the Church and in society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . '' So God created man in his_own image , in the image of God he created him ; male and female he created them '' Gen : . I have repeatedly affirmed the fundamental equality and enriching complementarity that exist between man_and_woman . The Synod applied these_principles to the condition of women in Africa . Their rights_and_duties in building up the family and in taking full part in the development of the Church and society were strongly affirmed . With specific regard to the Church , women should be properly trained so that_they_can participate -atti_degli_apostoli- appropriate levels in her apostolic activity . The Church deplores and condemns , to the extent that_they_are still found in some African societies , all '' the customs and practices which deprive women of their_rights and the respect due to them '' . It -isaia- recommended that Episcopal Conferences establish special commissions to study further women s problems in cooperation_with interested government agencies , wherever this_-isaia- possible . Communicating the good_news Following Christ , the Communicator '' par excellence '' . The Synod had much to say about social_communications in the context of the evangelization of Africa , carefully taking into_account present circumstances . The theological point of departure -isaia- Christ , the Communicator par excellence who shares with_those_who believe in him the truth , the life and the love_which he shares with_his Heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit . That -isaia- why '' the Church -isaia- aware of her duty of fostering social_communications ad intra and ad extra . The Church should promote communication from within through a better diffusion of information among her members '' . This will put her in a more advantageous position to communicate to the world_the Good News of the love of God revealed in Jesus Christ . Traditional forms of communication . The traditional forms of social communication must_never be underestimated . In many places in Africa they are_still very useful and effective . Moreover , they_are '' less costly and more accessible '' . These forms include songs and music , mimes and the theatre , proverbs and fables . As vehicles of the wisdom and soul of the people , they_are a precious source of material and of inspiration for the modern media . Evangelization of the world of the media . The modern mass_media are not_only instruments of communication , but_also a world to be evangelized . In terms of the message they transmit , it -isaia- necessary to ensure_that they propagate the good , the true and the beautiful . Echoing the preoccupation of the Synod Fathers I express my deep concern about the moral content of very many programmes with_which_the media flood the African Continent . In particular I warn against the pornography and violence which_are inundating poor countries . In addition , the Synod rightly deplored '' the very negative portrayal of the African in the media and called_for its immediate cessation '' . Every Christian should be concerned that the communications media are a vehicle of evangelization . But Christians who_are professionals in this sector have a special part to play . It -isaia- their_duty to ensure_that Christian principles influence the practice of the profession , including the technical and administrative sector . To enable them to exercise this role properly , they_need to be provided with a wholesome human , religious and spiritual training . Using the means of social communication . Today the Church has -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal a variety of means of social communication , traditional as well as modern . It -isaia- her duty to make_the best possible use of them in order to spread the message of salvation . In the Church in Africa many obstacles impede easy access to these means , not the least of which_-isaia- their high cost . Moreover , in many places government regulations impose undue control on them . Every possible effort should be made to remove these obstacles . The media , whether private or public , should serve all people without exception . Therefore I invite the particular Churches of Africa to do everything in their_power to meet this objective . Cooperation and coordination in the mass_media . The media , especially in their most modern forms , have a wide ranging impact . Consequently , closer cooperation -isaia- needed in this area , in order to ensure more_effective coordination -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels : diocesan , national , continental and worldwide . In Africa , the Church has a great need_for solidarity with sister Churches in the richer and technologically more advanced countries . Programmes of continental cooperation which already exist in Africa , such as the Pan African Episcopal Committee for Social Communications , should be encouraged and revitalized . As the Synod suggested , it -isaia- necessary to establish closer cooperation in other areas , such as professional training , structures of radio and television production , and stations that transmit to the whole Continent . CHAPTER VII '' YOU SHALL BE MY WITNESSES TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH '' . During the Special Assembly , the Synod Fathers thoroughly explored the overall situation in Africa , in order to encourage an ever more_effective and credible witness to Christ in every local Church , every nation , every region , and in the entire African Continent . In all the discussions and recommendations made by the Special Assembly the overriding concern was to bear_witness to Christ . I found in them the spirit of what I had said in Africa to a group of Bishops : '' By respecting , preserving and fostering the particular values and riches of your_people s cultural heritage , you will be in a position to lead_them to a better understanding of the mystery of Christ , which_-isaia- also to be lived in the noble , concrete and daily experiences of African life . There -isaia- no question of adulterating the word of God , or of emptying the Cross of its power cf . Cor : , but_rather of bringing Christ into the very centre of African life and of lifting up all African life to Christ . Thus not_only -isaia- Christianity relevant to Africa , but Christ , in the members of his Body , -isaia- himself African '' . The Church in Africa -isaia- not called to bear_witness to Christ only on the Continent ; for to it the Risen Lord also says : '' You shall be my witnesses to the ends of the earth '' Acts : . For this_very reason , during their discussions of the Synod s theme , the Fathers carefully avoided every tendency to isolationism by the Church in Africa . At all times the Special Assembly kept in view the missionary mandate which_the Church received_from Christ : to bear_witness to him in the whole_world . The Synod Fathers acknowledged God s call to Africa to play its_full part , -atti_degli_apostoli- the world level , in his plan_for the salvation of the human_race cf . It -isaia- on account of this commitment to the Church s catholicity that the Lineamenta of the Special Assembly for Africa declared : '' No particular Church , not_even the poorest , can ever be dispensed from the obligation of sharing its personnel as well as its spiritual and temporal resources with_other particular Churches and with the universal Church cf . For its part , the Special Assembly strongly stressed Africa s responsibility_for mission '' to the ends of the earth '' in the following words : '' The prophetic phrase of Paul VI , You Africans are missionaries to yourselves , -isaia- to be understood as missionaries to the whole_world . An appeal -isaia- launched to the particular Churches of Africa for mission outside the confines of their_own Dioceses '' . In gladly and gratefully endorsing this declaration of the Special Assembly , I wish to repeat to all my Brother Bishops in Africa what I said a few years_ago : '' The Church in Africa s obligation to be missionary to itself and to evangelize the Continent entails cooperation among the particular Churches in the context of each African country , among the various nations of the Continent and also of other continents . In this_way Africa will be fully integrated in missionary_activity '' . In an earlier appeal addressed to all the particular Churches , both young and old , I already said_that '' the world_-isaia- steadily growing more united , and the Gospel spirit must lead us to overcome cultural and nationalistic barriers , avoiding all isolationism '' . The bold determination manifested by the Special Assembly to engage the young Churches of Africa in mission '' to the ends of the earth '' reflects the desire to implement , as generously as possible , one of the important directives of the Second Vatican Council : '' In order_that this missionary zeal may flourish among their native members , it very fitting_that the young Churches should participate as soon as possible in the universal missionary work of the Church . Let them send their_own missionaries to proclaim_the Gospel all over the world , even_though they_themselves are suffering from a shortage of clergy . For their communion with the universal Church reaches a certain measure of perfection when they_themselves take an active part in missionary zeal towards other nations '' . Organic pastoral solidarity . At the beginning of this Exhortation I pointed_out that in announcing the convocation of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops I had in mind the promotion of '' an organic pastoral solidarity within_the entire African territory and nearby Islands '' . I -amos- pleased to say that the Assembly kept this objective firmly in view . Discussions -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod revealed the Bishops readiness and generosity for_this pastoral solidarity and for sharing their resources with_others , even_when they_themselves needed missionaries . Specifically to my brother Bishops , who '' are directly responsible , together_with me , for the evangelization of the world , both as members of the College of Bishops and as Pastors of the particular Churches '' , I wish to address a special word in this_regard . In their_daily ministry to the flock entrusted to them , they must_never lose sight of the needs of the Church as a whole . As Catholic Bishops , they_must feel the concern_for all the Churches which burned in the Apostle s heart cf . Nor can they fail to express this concern , especially_when they deliberate and decide together as members of their_respective Episcopal Conferences . Through liaison bodies -atti_degli_apostoli- the regional and continental levels , they_are in a better position to discern and evaluate the pastoral needs surfacing in other parts_of_the_world . The Bishops express their apostolic solidarity in a pre eminent way through the Synod of Bishops : '' among its affairs of general concern , it should give special consideration to missionary_activity . For this_-isaia- a supremely great and sacred task of the Church '' . The Special Assembly also rightly pointed_out that , in order to achieve an overall pastoral solidarity in Africa , it -isaia- necessary to promote the renewal of priestly formation . The words of the Second Vatican Council can_never be pondered enough : '' The spiritual gift_which priests received -atti_degli_apostoli- their Ordination prepares them_not for_any limited and narrow mission but_for the widest scope of the universal mission even to the very ends of the earth Acts : '' . That -isaia- why I have urged priests '' to make themselves readily available to the Holy Spirit and the Bishop , to be sent to preach the Gospel beyond_the borders of their_own country . This will demand of them not_only maturity in their_vocation , but_also an uncommon readiness to detach themselves from their_own homeland , culture and family , and a special ability to adapt to other cultures , with understanding and respect_for them '' . I -amos- deeply grateful to God to learn that a growing number of African priests have_been responding to the call to bear_witness '' to the ends of the earth '' . It -isaia- my ardent hope_that this trend will be encouraged and strengthened in all the particular Churches of Africa . It -isaia-_also a source of great comfort to know_that the Missionary Institutes which_have_been present in Africa for a long time are_now '' receiving more_and_more candidates from the young Churches which_they founded '' , thus enabling these same Churches to take_part in the missionary_activity of the universal Church . Similarly , I give thanks for the new Missionary Institutes which_have_been established on the Continent and are_now sending their members ad gentes . This -isaia- a providential and marvellous development which shows the maturity and dynamism of the Church in Africa . In a special_way I would_like to endorse the specific recommendation of the Synod Fathers that the four Pontifical Mission Aid Societies be established in every particular Church and in every country as a means of achieving an organic pastoral solidarity in favour of the mission '' to the ends of the earth '' . These Societies , because_they_are under the auspices of the Pope and the Episcopal College , rightly have_the first_place , '' since_they are the means of imbuing Catholics from their_very infancy with a genuinely universal and missionary outlook . They are the means_for undertaking an effective collection of funds to subsidize all the missions , each according to its needs '' . A significant result of their activity '' -isaia- the fostering of lifelong vocations ad gentes , in both the older and younger Churches . I earnestly recommend that_their promotional work be increasingly directed to this goal '' . Holiness and mission . The Synod reaffirmed that all the sons_and_daughters of Africa are_called to holiness and to be witnesses to Christ throughout_the_world . '' The lesson of history confirms that by the action of the Holy Spirit evangelization takes_place above all through the witness of charity , the witness of holiness '' . I therefore wish to repeat to all Christians in Africa what I wrote some years_ago : '' A missionary -isaia- really such only if he commits himself to the way of holiness . Every member of the faithful -isaia- called to holiness and to mission . The renewed impulse to the mission ad gentes demands holy missionaries . It -isaia-_not_enough to update pastoral techniques , organize and coordinate ecclesial resources , or delve deeply into the biblical and theological foundations of faith . What -isaia- needed -isaia- the encouragement of a new ardour for holiness among missionaries and throughout_the Christian community '' . As I did then , so again I address myself to the Christians of the young Churches in order to remind them of their responsibilities : '' Today , you_are the hope of this two thousand year old Church of ours : being young in faith , you_must be like the first Christians and radiate enthusiasm and courage . In a word , you_must set yourselves on the path of holiness . Only thus can you be a sign of God in the world and re live in your_own countries the missionary epic of the early Church . You will_also be a leaven of missionary spirit for the older Churches '' . The Church in Africa shares with the universal Church '' the sublime vocation of realizing , first of all within herself , the unity of humankind over and above any ethnic , cultural , national , social or other divisions in order to signify precisely that_such divisions are_now obsolete , having_been abolished by the Cross of Christ '' . By responding to her vocation to be a redeemed and reconciled people in the midst of the world , the Church contributes to promoting the fraternal coexistence of all peoples , since she transcends the distinctions of race and nationality . In view of the specific vocation entrusted to the Church by her Divine Founder , I earnestly call_upon the Catholic Community in Africa to bear authentic witness before all humanity to the Christian universalism which_has its source in the fatherhood of God . '' All persons created by God have_the same origin . Whatever may , throughout history , have_been their dispersion or the accentuation of their differences , they_are destined to form one sole family according to God s plan established in the beginning '' . The Church in Africa -isaia- called to reach out in love to every_human_being , firmly believing that '' by his Incarnation the Son of God has united himself in some fashion with every man '' . In particular , Africa ought to make its_own special contribution to the ecumenical movement , an urgent task which , on the threshold of the Third Millennium , I have emphasized once_more in my Encyclical Letter Ut Unum Sint . Certainly the Church on the Continent can_also play an important role in interreligious dialogue , above all by fostering close relations with Muslims and by promoting respect_for the values of African traditional religion . Putting solidarity into_practice . In bearing_witness to Christ '' to the ends of the earth '' , the Church in Africa will no doubt be assisted by the conviction of the '' positive and moral value of the growing awareness of interdependence among individuals and nations . The fact_that men_and_women in various parts_of_the_world feel personally affected by the injustices and violations of human_rights committed in distant countries , countries which perhaps they will_never visit , -isaia- a further sign of a reality transformed into awareness , thus acquiring a moral connotation '' . It -isaia- my desire_that Christians in Africa will_become ever_more aware of this interdependence among individuals and nations , and will be ready to respond to it by practising the virtue of solidarity . The fruit of solidarity -isaia- peace , an inestimable good for peoples and nations in every part_of_the_world . For it -isaia- precisely by means of fostering and strengthening solidarity that the Church can_make a specific and decisive contribution to a true culture of peace . By entering into contact_with all the peoples of the world through_her dialogue_with_the various cultures , the Church brings them closer to one_another , enabling each people to assume , in faith , the authentic values of others . Ready to cooperate with all people_of_good_will and with the international community , the Church in Africa does_not seek advantages for itself . The solidarity which it expresses '' seeks to go beyond itself , to take on the specifically Christian dimensions of total gratuity , forgiveness and reconciliation '' . The Church seeks to contribute to humanity s conversion , leading it to acceptance of God s salvific plan through_her witness to the Gospel , accompanied by charitable work on behalf of the poor and the neediest . In so doing she never loses sight of the primacy of the transcendent and of those spiritual realities which_are the first fruits of man s eternal_salvation . In their discussion on the Church s solidarity with peoples and nations , the Synod Fathers were -atti_degli_apostoli- all times fully aware_that '' earthly progress must be carefully distinguished from the growth of Christ s Kingdom . Nevertheless , to the extent_that the former can contribute to the better ordering of human_society , it -isaia- of vital concern to the Kingdom of God '' . Precisely for this_reason_the Church in Africa -isaia- convinced as the work of the Special Assembly clearly demonstrated that waiting for Christ s final return '' can_never be an excuse for lack of concern_for people in their concrete personal situations and in their social , national and international life '' , since these earthly conditions have a bearing upon humanity s pilgrimage towards eternity . CONCLUSION Towards the new Christian Millennium . Gathered around_the Virgin Mary as -atti_degli_apostoli- a new Pentecost , the members of the Special Assembly examined in depth the evangelizing mission of the Church in Africa on the threshold of the Third Millennium . At the conclusion of this PostSynodal Apostolic Exhortation in which I present_the fruits of this Assembly to the Church in Africa , Madagascar and the adjacent Islands and to the whole Catholic Church , I give thanks to God Father , Son and Holy Spirit who granted us the privilege of living the genuine '' moment of grace '' which_the Synod was . I -amos- deeply grateful to the People of God in Africa for all that_they did for the Special Assembly . This Synod was prepared with zeal and enthusiasm , as can be seen from the answers to the questionnaire attached to the outline document Lineamenta and from the reflections gathered in the working document Instrumentum Laboris . The Christian communities of Africa ardently prayed for the success of the work of the Special Synod , and it was abundantly blessed by the Lord . Since the Synod was convoked in order to enable the Church in Africa to assume its evangelizing mission as effectively as possible in preparation_for the Third Christian Millennium , with the present Exhortation I invite God s People in Africa Bishops , priests , consecrated_persons and lay_faithful to set their faces resolutely towards_the Great Jubilee which we shall celebrate a few years hence . For all the peoples of Africa the best preparation_for the new Millennium must consist in a firm commitment to implement with_great fidelity the decisions and orientations which , with the Apostolic authority of the Successor of Peter , I present in this Exhortation . They are decisions and orientations which_can be traced back to the genuine heritage of the Church s teaching and discipline and in particular to the Second Vatican Council , the main source of inspiration for the Special Assembly for Africa . My invitation to God s People in Africa to prepare themselves for the Great Jubilee of the Year -isaia-_also meant to be a clarion call to Christian joy . '' The great joy announced by the angel on Christmas night -isaia- truly for all the people cf . The Blessed Virgin Mary was_the first to have_received its announcement , from the Angel Gabriel , and her Magnificat was already the exultant hymn of all the humble . Whenever we say the Rosary , the joyful mysteries thus place us once_more before the inexpressible event which_-isaia- the centre and summit of history : the coming on earth of Emmanuel , God with us '' . It -isaia- the two thousandth Anniversary of that event of great joy which_we_are preparing to celebrate with the coming Great Jubilee . And so Africa , which '' -isaia-_also in a sense the second homeland of Jesus , since as a small child , it was there that he sought refuge from Herod s cruelty '' , -isaia- called to joy . At the same_time , '' everything ought to focus on the primary objective of the Jubilee : the strengthening of faith and of the witness of Christians '' . On account of the many difficulties , crises and conflicts which bring_about so much suffering and misery on the Continent , some Africans are_-atti_degli_apostoli- times tempted to think_that the Lord has abandoned them , that_he_has forgotten them cf . Is : ! '' And God answers with the words of the great Prophet : Can a woman forget her_own baby and not love the child she bore ? Even if a mother should forget a child , I will_never forget you . I have written your names on the palms of my hands Is : . Yes , on the palms of Christ , pierced by the nails of the Crucifixion . The names of each_one of you Africans -isaia- written on those palms . Therefore with full confidence we cry out : The Lord -isaia-_our help and our shield . In him do our_hearts find joy . We trust in his holy name Ps : '' . Prayer to Mary , Mother of the Church . In thanksgiving for the grace of this Synod , I appeal to Mary , Star of Evangelization and , as the Third Millennium draws near , to her I entrust Africa and its evangelizing mission . I turn to her with the thoughts and sentiments expressed in the prayer which my Brother Bishops composed -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the working session of the Synod in Rome : O Mary , Mother of Godand Mother of the Church , thanks to you , on the day of the Annunciation , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of the new era , the whole_human_race with its culturesrejoiced in recognizing itselfready for the Gospel . On the eve of a new Pentecostfor the Church in Africa , Madagascarand the adjacent Islands , the People of God with its Pastorsturns to you and with you fervently prays : May the outpouring of the Holy Spiritmake of the cultures of Africaplaces of communion in diversity , fashioning the peoplesof this_great Continent into generous sons and daughtersof the Churchwhich -isaia- the Family of the Father , the Brotherhood of the Son , the Image of the Trinity , the seed and beginning on earthof the eternal Kingdomwhich will come to its perfectionin the City that_has God as its Builder : the City of justice , love and peace .

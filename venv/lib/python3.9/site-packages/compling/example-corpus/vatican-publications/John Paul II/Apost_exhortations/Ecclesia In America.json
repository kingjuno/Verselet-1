Rejoicing in the faith received and praising Christ for_this immense gift , the Church in America has recently celebrated the fifth centenary of the first preaching of the Gospel on its soil . The commemoration made all American Catholics more_deeply aware of Christ s desire to meet_the inhabitants of the so called New World so that , gathering them_into his Church , he might be present in the continent s history . The evangelization of America -isaia-_not_only a gift from the Lord ; it -isaia-_also a source of new responsibilities . Thanks to the work of those_who preached the Gospel through the length and breadth of the continent , countless sons_and_daughters have_been generated by the Church and the Holy Spirit . Now , no less_than in the past , the words of the Apostle echo in their_hearts : '' If I preach the Gospel , I have no reason to boast . It -isaia- my duty : woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor : . This duty -isaia- founded on the Risen Lord s command to the Apostles before he ascended into_heaven : '' Preach the Gospel to all creation '' Mk : . This command applies to the whole Church ; and , in this moment of her history , the Church in America -isaia- called to take it up and respond with loving generosity to the fundamental task of evangelization . This was what my Predecessor Paul VI , the first Pope to visit America , stressed -atti_degli_apostoli- Bogot\u00e0 : '' It will be our task , Lord Jesus , as your representatives and stewards of your divine mysteries cf . Cor : ; Pt : , to spread among_men the treasures of your word , your grace , your example '' . For the disciple of Christ the duty to evangelize -isaia- an obligation of love . '' The love of Christ impels us '' Cor : , declares the Apostle Paul , recalling all that the Son of God did for us in his redeeming sacrifice : '' One man_has died for all . that_those_who live may live no longer for themselves , but_for him_who died and was raised for their sake '' Cor : . The celebration of anniversaries which evoke in a particular_way Christ s love for us stirs in our soul not_only a sense of gratitude but_also a sense of the need to '' proclaim_the wonders of God '' , to evangelize . Thus , the recent celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the coming of the Gospel to America the moment , that_-isaia- , when Christ first called America to faith and the approaching Jubilee , when_the Church will celebrate the two thousandth anniversary of the Incarnation of the Son of God , are special times when our_hearts spontaneously ring out in gratitude to the Lord . Realizing the greatness of the gifts received , the pilgrim Church in America wishes to bring_the whole of society and every man_and_woman to share in the riches of faith and communion in Christ . How the Synod Assembly came about . On October , , the very day marking the five hundredth anniversary of the first evangelization of America , I spoke -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening of the Fourth General Assembly of the Latin American Bishops in Santo Domingo . With the aim of broadening perspectives and giving impetus to the new_evangelization , I proposed a synodal meeting , '' with_a_view to increased cooperation between_the different particular Churches '' , so that together we might address , as part of the new_evangelization and as an expression of episcopal communion , '' the problems relating to justice and solidarity among all the nations of America '' . The positive response to my suggestion from the Bishops Conferences of America enabled me to propose in my Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente a synodal meeting '' on the problems of the new_evangelization in both parts of the same continent , so different in origin and history , and on issues of justice and of international economic relations , in view of the enormous gap between North and South '' . This paved the way_for more immediate preparations , leading to the Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops , which_was held in the Vatican from November to December , . The theme of the Assembly . In keeping_with_the original idea , and after listening to the suggestions of the Pre Synodal Council , which expressed the views of many Pastors of the People of God on the American continent , I announced the theme of the Special Assembly for America of the Synod in these_words : Encounter with the Living Jesus Christ : The Way to Conversion , Communion and Solidarity in America . Put this_way , the theme makes clear the centrality of the person of the Risen Christ , present in the life of the Church and calling people to conversion , communion and solidarity . The starting point of such a program of evangelization_-isaia- in fact the encounter_with_the Lord . Given by Christ in the Paschal Mystery , the Holy Spirit guides us towards those pastoral goals which_the Church in America must attain in the third Christian millennium . The celebration of the Assembly as an experience of encounter . It -isaia- certain_that the Assembly was an experience of encounter_with_the Lord . I have especially happy memories of the two Solemn Concelebrations -atti_degli_apostoli- which I presided in Saint Peter s Basilica -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening and closing of the Assembly proceedings . Contact with the Risen Lord , truly , really and substantially present in the Eucharist , generated the spiritual atmosphere which enabled the Bishops taking part in the Synodal Assembly to see themselves not_only as brothers in the Lord but_also as members of the College of Bishops , eager to follow in the footsteps of the Good Shepherd under the leadership of the Successor of Peter , and serving the Church as she makes her pilgrim way in every corner of the continent . None could fail to see the joy of the participants , as they found the Assembly an extraordinary moment of encounter_with_the Lord , with the Vicar of Christ , with so many Bishops , priests , religious and lay_people from every_part of the continent . To be sure , a number of earlier events contributed in a preliminary but powerful way to creating an atmosphere of fraternal encounter in the Synodal Assembly . First , there_were the prior experiences of communion in the General Assemblies of the Bishops of Latin America in Rio de Janeiro , Medellin , Puebla and Santo Domingo . These were moments when_the Pastors of the Church in Latin America were able to reflect together as brothers on the most urgent pastoral questions affecting that part of the continent . There are_also the periodic pan American meetings of Bishops , in which_the participants can address issues affecting the entire continent , and exchange views on the common problems and challenges facing the Church in the countries of America . Contributing to the unity of the continent . In Santo Domingo , when I first proposed a Special Assembly of the Synod , I remarked that '' on the threshold of the third Christian millennium and -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when many walls and ideological barriers have fallen , the Church feels absolutely duty bound to bring into still deeper spiritual union the peoples who compose this_great continent and also , prompted by the religious mission which_-isaia- proper to the Church , to stir among_these peoples a spirit of solidarity '' . I asked that the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops reflect on America as a single entity , by reason of all that_-isaia- common to the peoples of the continent , including their shared Christian identity and their genuine attempt to strengthen the bonds of solidarity and communion_between the different_forms of the continent s rich cultural heritage . The decision to speak of '' America '' in the singular was an attempt to express not_only the unity_which in some_way already exists , but_also to point to that closer bond which_the peoples of the continent seek and which_the Church wishes to foster as part of her_own mission , as she works to promote the communion of all in the Lord . In the context of the new_evangelization . With an eye to the Great Jubilee of the Year , I was keen that there_should be a Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for each of the five continents : after_the Assembly for Africa , America , Asia and most recently Oceania , in there_will be , with the Lord s help , a Special Assembly for Europe . This will_make possible an Ordinary General Assembly during the Jubilee year , to identify the rich insights which_have come from the continental Assemblies and synthesize the conclusions to be drawn_from them . That will be possible because similar concerns and points of interest have emerged from all the Synods . In this_regard , referring to this series of Synodal Assemblies , I noted how '' the theme underlying them all -isaia- evangelization , or rather the new_evangelization , the foundations of which_were laid_down in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi of Pope Paul VI '' . And so , in both my initial proposal to hold this Special Assembly of the Synod , and later in announcing the Synod itself , and after_the Bishops Conferences of America had agreed to the idea , I suggested that the Assembly s deliberations should address '' the area of the new_evangelization '' , and the problems emerging from it . This concern was all the more prominent , given that I myself had outlined an initial program for a new_evangelization on American soil . As the Church throughout America prepared to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the first evangelization of the continent , when speaking to the Council of Latin American Bishops in Port au Prince Haiti , I had said : '' The commemoration of the five hundred years of evangelization will achieve its_full meaning if it becomes a commitment by you the Bishops , together_with your priests and people , a commitment not to a re evangelization but to a new_evangelization new in ardor , methods and expression '' . Later , I invited the whole Church to respond to this call , although the program of evangelization , embracing today_s_world in all its diversity , must_take different shape in the light of two quite different situations : on the one_hand , the situation of countries strongly affected by secularization , and , on the other , the situation of countries where_there are_still '' many vital traditions of piety and popular forms of Christian religiosity '' . There -isaia- no doubt_that in varying degrees both these situations are present in different countries or , better perhaps , in different groups within_the various countries of the American continent . With the presence and help of the Lord . With the command to evangelize which_the Risen Lord left to his Church there goes the certitude , founded on his promise , that he continues to live and work among us : '' I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . The mysterious presence of Christ in his Church -isaia- the sure guarantee that the Church will succeed in accomplishing the task entrusted to her . At the same_time , this presence enables us to encounter him , as the Son sent by the Father , as the Lord of Life who_gives us his Spirit . A fresh encounter_with Jesus Christ will_make all the members of the Church in America aware_that they_are_called to continue the Redeemer s mission in their lands . If it -isaia- genuine , the personal encounter_with_the Lord will_also bring a renewal of the Church : as sisters and neighbors to each_other , the particular Churches of the continent will strengthen the bonds of cooperation and solidarity in order_that the saving work of Christ may continue in the history of America with ever_greater effect . Open to the unity which_comes_from true communion with the Risen Lord , the particular Churches , and all who belong to them , will discover through_their own spiritual experience that '' the encounter_with_the living Jesus Christ '' -isaia- '' the path to conversion , communion and solidarity '' . To the extent_that these goals are reached , there_will emerge an ever_increasing dedication to the new_evangelization of America . CHAPTER I THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE LIVING JESUS CHRIST '' We have found the Messiah '' Jn : Encounters with the Lord in the New Testament . The Gospels relate many meetings between Jesus and the men_and_women of his day . A common feature of all these narratives -isaia- the transforming power present and manifest in these encounters with Jesus , inasmuch as they '' initiate an authentic process of conversion , communion and solidarity '' Among the most significant -isaia- the meeting with the Samaritan woman cf . Jesus calls her in order to quench his thirst , a thirst which_was not_only physical : indeed , '' he who asked for a drink was thirsting for the faith of that woman '' . By saying to her '' Give me a drink '' Jn : and speaking to her about living water , the Lord awakened in the Samaritan woman a question , almost a prayer_for something far greater_than she_was capable of understanding -atti_degli_apostoli- the time : '' Sir , give me this water , that I may_not thirst '' Jn : . The Samaritan woman , even_though '' she does_not yet understand '' , -isaia-_in_fact asking for the living water of which her_divine visitor speaks . When Jesus reveals to her that_he_-isaia- indeed the Christ cf . Jn : , the Samaritan woman feels impelled to proclaim to the other townspeople that_she has found the Messiah cf . Similarly , the most_precious fruit of the encounter between Jesus and Zacchaeus cf . Lk : -isaia- the conversion of the tax collector , who becomes aware of his past unjust actions and decides to make abundant restitution '' four times as much '' to those he had cheated . Furthermore , he adopts an attitude of detachment from material goods and of charity towards_the needy , which_leads him to give half of his possessions to the poor . Special mention should be made of the encounters with the Risen Jesus reported in the New Testament . Mary Magdalen meets the Risen One , and as a result overcomes her discouragement and grief -atti_degli_apostoli- the death of the Master cf . In his new Paschal glory , Jesus tells her to proclaim to the disciples that_he_has risen : '' Go to my brethren '' Jn : . For this_reason , Mary Magdalen could be called '' the apostle of the Apostles '' . The disciples of Emmaus , for their_part , after meeting and recognizing the Risen Lord , return to Jerusalem to recount to the Apostles and the other disciples all that had happened to them cf . Jesus , '' beginning with Moses and all the prophets , interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself '' Lk : . Later they_would recognize_that their_hearts were burning within them as the Lord talked to them along the road and opened the Scriptures to them cf . There -isaia- no doubt_that Saint Luke , in relating this episode , especially_the decisive moment in which_the two disciples recognize Jesus , makes explicit allusion to the accounts of the institution of the Eucharist by Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper cf . The Evangelist , in relating what_the disciples of Emmaus told the Eleven , uses an expression which_had a precise Eucharistic meaning for the early Church : '' He was made_known to them in the breaking of the bread '' Lk : . One of the encounters with the Risen Lord which_had a decisive influence on the history of Christianity was certainly the conversion of Saul , the future Paul , the Apostle of the Gentiles , on the road to Damascus . There his_life was radically changed : from being a persecutor , he became an Apostle cf . Paul himself describes this extraordinary experience as a revelation of the Son of God '' in order_that I might preach him among the Gentiles '' Gal : . The Lord always respects the freedom of those he calls . There are cases where people , in encountering Jesus , close their_hearts to the change of life to which_the Lord -isaia- calling them . Many people in Jesus s own_time saw and heard him , and yet did_not open their_hearts to his_word . Saint John s Gospel points to sin as the reason which prevents human_beings from opening themselves to the light which_-isaia- Christ : '' the light has come into_the_world , and people loved darkness rather_than light , because their deeds were evil '' Jn : . The Gospels teach that attachment to wealth -isaia- an obstacle to accepting Christ s call to follow_him fully and without reserve . Here , the attitude of the rich young man_-isaia- indicative cf . Personal encounters and community encounters . Some of the encounters with Jesus mentioned in the Gospel are clearly personal , as , for example , when he summons someone to follow_him cf . In these cases , Jesus deals familiarly with_his hearers : '' Rabbi which means teacher , where are you staying ? . Come and see '' Jn : . But -atti_degli_apostoli- other times the encounters are communal in nature . This -isaia-_especially true of the encounters with the Apostles , which_are of fundamental importance for the constitution of the Church . Indeed , the Apostles , chosen by Jesus from among the wider circle of his_disciples cf . Mk : ; Lk : , receive special training and enjoy a closer relationship_with him . To the crowds Jesus speaks in parables , while explaining to the Twelve : '' To you it has_been_given to know_the secrets of the kingdom_of_heaven , but to them it has not been_given '' Mt : . They are_called to be heralds of the Good News and to carry_out a special mission of building up the Church by the grace of the sacraments . To this_end , they receive the necessary power : Jesus confers upon them the authority to forgive sins , invoking the same authority which_the Father has_given him in heaven and on earth cf . They would be the first to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit cf . Acts : , a gift then bestowed upon all who by virtue of the Sacraments of Initiation would become part of the Christian community cf . Encountering Christ in the time of the Church . The Church -isaia- the place_where men_and_women , by encountering Jesus , can come to know_the love of the Father , for whoever has seen Jesus has seen the Father cf . After his Ascension into_heaven , Jesus acts through the powerful agency of the Holy Spirit , the Paraclete cf . Jn : , who transforms believers by giving them new_life . Thus they become capable of loving with God s own love_,_which '' has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit which has_been_given to us '' Rom : . God s grace also enables Christians to work_for the transformation of the world , in order to bring_about a new civilization , which my Predecessor Paul VI appropriately called '' the civilization of love '' . Indeed , '' the Word of God , by taking on our human_nature in all things save sin cf . Heb : , manifests the Father s plan by revealing to each human_person the way to realize fully his or her vocation . Thus Jesus not_only reconciles man with the Father , but_also reconciles man with himself and thus reveals his true nature '' . With these_words the Synod Fathers , taking up the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , reaffirmed that Jesus -isaia-_the_way which_leads to full personal realization , culminating in the definitive and eternal encounter_with God . '' I -amos- the way , and the truth , and the life ; no one comes to the Father , but by me '' Jn : . God has predestined us '' to be conformed to the image of his Son , in order that_he_might be the first born of many brethren '' Rom : . Jesus Christ -isaia- thus_the definitive answer to the question of the meaning of life , and to those fundamental questions which still trouble so many men_and_women on the American continent . We encounter Jesus through Mary . At the birth of Jesus , the Magi came from the East to Bethlehem and '' saw the child with Mary his Mother '' Mt : . At the beginning of his public_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage of Cana , when_the Son of God works the first of his signs , awakening faith in the disciples cf . Jn : , it -isaia- Mary who intervenes and directs the servants towards her Son in these_words : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . In this_regard I once wrote that '' the Mother of Christ presents herself as the spokeswoman of her Son s will , pointing out those things_which must be done so that the salvific power of the Messiah may be manifested '' . For this_reason Mary -isaia- the sure path to our meeting with Christ . Devotion to the Mother of the Lord , when_it_-isaia- genuine , -isaia- always an impetus to a life guided by the spirit and values of the Gospel . How can we fail to emphasize the role which belongs to the Virgin Mary in relation to the pilgrim Church in America journeying towards its encounter_with_the Lord ? Indeed , the Most Blessed Virgin '' is linked in a special_way to the birth of the Church in the history . of the peoples of America ; through Mary they came to encounter the Lord '' . Throughout the continent , from the time of the first evangelization , the presence of the Mother of God has_been strongly felt , thanks to the efforts of the missionaries . In their preaching , '' the Gospel was proclaimed by presenting the Virgin Mary as its highest realization . From the beginning invoked as Our Lady of Guadalupe Mary , by her motherly and merciful figure , was a great sign of the closeness of the Father and of Jesus Christ , with whom she invites us to enter_into communion '' . The appearance of Mary to the native Juan Diego on the hill of Tepeyac in had a decisive effect on evangelization . Its influence greatly overflows the boundaries of Mexico , spreading to the whole Continent . America , which historically has_been , and still -isaia- , a melting pot of peoples , has recognized in the mestiza face of the Virgin of Tepeyac , '' in Blessed Mary of Guadalupe , an impressive example of a perfectly inculturated evangelization '' . Consequently , not_only in Central and South America , but in North America as well , the Virgin of Guadalupe -isaia- venerated as Queen of all America . With the passage of time , pastors and faithful alike have grown increasingly conscious of the role of the Virgin Mary in the evangelization of America . In the prayer composed for the Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops , Holy Mary of Guadalupe -isaia- invoked as '' Patroness of all America and Star of the first and new_evangelization '' . In view of this , I welcome with_joy the proposal of the Synod Fathers that the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe , Mother and Evangelizer of America , be celebrated throughout_the continent on December . It -isaia- my heartfelt hope_that she , whose intercession was responsible_for strengthening the faith of the first disciples cf . Jn : , will by her_maternal intercession guide the Church in America , obtaining the outpouring of the Holy Spirit , as she once did for the early Church cf . Acts : , so that the new_evangelization may yield a splendid flowering of Christian life . Places of encounter_with Christ . Trusting in the help of Mary , the Church in America desires to lead the men_and_women of the continent to encounter Christ . This encounter will be the starting point of authentic conversion and of renewed communion and solidarity . Such an encounter will contribute greatly to strengthening the faith of many Catholics , helping them to mature in strong , lively and active faith . Lest the search_for Christ present in his Church become something merely abstract , we need to indicate the specific times and places in which , in the Church , it -isaia- possible to encounter him . Here the reflections of the Synod Fathers offered abundant suggestions and observations . They pointed above all to '' Sacred Scripture read in the light of Tradition , the Fathers and the Magisterium , and more_deeply understood through meditation and prayer '' . A recommendation was_made to promote knowledge of the Gospels , which proclaim in words easily understood by all the way Jesus lived among the people of his time . Reading these sacred texts and listening to Jesus as attentively as did the multitudes of the mount of the Beatitudes , or on the shore of the Lake of Tiberias as he preached from the boat , produces authentic fruits of conversion of heart . A second place of encounter_with Jesus -isaia- the sacred Liturgy . Thanks to the Second Vatican Council , we have a very rich account of the manifold presence of Christ in the Liturgy , the importance of which_should lead to it being a theme of constant preaching . Christ -isaia- present in the celebrant who renews -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar the one and only Sacrifice of the Cross ; he -isaia- present in the Sacraments through_which he exercises his efficacious power . When his word_-isaia- proclaimed , it -isaia- he himself who speaks to us . He -isaia-_also present in the community , by virtue of his promise that '' where two or three are gathered in my name , there -amos- I in the midst of them '' Mt : . He -isaia- present '' especially under the Eucharistic species '' . My Predecessor Paul VI deemed it necessary to explain the uniqueness of Christ s real presence in the Eucharist , which '' is called real not to exclude the idea that the others are real too , but_rather to indicate presence par excellence , because_it_-isaia- substantial '' . Under the species of bread and wine , '' Christ -isaia- present , whole and entire in his physical reality , corporally present '' . The Scriptures and the Eucharist , places of encounter_with Christ , are evoked in the story of the apparition of the Risen Jesus to the disciples of Emmaus . The Gospel text concerning the final judgment cf . Mt : , which states that we will be judged on our love towards_the needy in whom_the Lord Jesus -isaia- mysteriously present , indicates that we must_not neglect a third place of encounter_with Christ : '' the persons , especially_the poor , with whom Christ identifies himself '' . At the closing of the Second Vatican Council , Pope Paul VI recalled that '' on the face of every_human_being , especially_when marked by tears and sufferings , we can and must see the face of Christ cf . Mt : , the Son of Man '' . CHAPTER II ENCOUNTERING JESUS CHRIST IN AMERICA TODAY '' From those_who_have received much , much will be required '' Lk : The situation of the men_and_women of America and their encounter_with_the Lord . The Gospels tell of Jesus encountering people in very diverse situations . At times these_are situations of sin , which show the need_for conversion and the Lord s forgiveness . At other moments we find people searching for the truth and genuinely trusting in Jesus positive attitudes which help to establish a friendship with_him and awaken the desire to imitate him . Nor can we forget the gifts with_which_the Lord prepares some people for a later encounter . Thus , by making Mary '' full of grace '' Lk : from the very_beginning , God prepared her for the realization in her of God s supreme encounter_with human_nature : the ineffable mystery of the Incarnation . Like the social virtues , sins do not_exist in the abstract , but are the consequence of personal acts . Hence it -isaia- necessary to bear in mind_that America today -isaia- a complex reality , the result of the attitudes and actions of the men_and_women_who live there . It -isaia- in this real and concrete situation that_they must encounter Jesus . The Christian identity of America . The greatest gift_which America has received_from_the Lord -isaia- the faith_which has forged its Christian identity . For more_than five hundred years the name of Christ has_been proclaimed on the continent . The evangelization which accompanied the European migrations has shaped America s religious profile , marked by moral values_which , though they_are_not always consistently practiced and -atti_degli_apostoli- times are cast into doubt , are in a sense the heritage of all Americans , even of those who_do_not explicitly recognize this_fact . Clearly , America s Christian identity -isaia- not synonymous with Catholic identity . The presence of other Christian communities , to a greater or lesser degree in the different parts of America , means_that the ecumenical commitment to seek unity among all those who_believe in Christ -isaia-_especially urgent . The fruits of holiness in America . The Saints are the true expression and the finest fruits of America s Christian identity . In them , the encounter_with_the living Christ '' is so deep and demanding . that it becomes a fire which consumes them completely and impels them to build his Kingdom , to the point that Christ and the new Covenant are the meaning and the soul . of personal and communal life '' . The fruits of holiness have flourished from the first days of the evangelization of America . Thus we have Saint Rose of Lima , '' the New World s first flower of holiness '' , proclaimed principal patroness of America in by Pope Clement X . After her , the list of American saints has grown to its present length . The beatifications and canonizations which_have raised many sons_and_daughters of the continent to public veneration provide heroic models of the Christian life across the range of nations and social backgrounds . In beatifying or canonizing them , the Church points to them as powerful intercessors made one_with Christ , the eternal High Priest , the mediator between God and man . The Saints and the Beatified of America accompany the men_and_women of today with fraternal concern in all their joys and sufferings , until the final encounter_with_the Lord . With a view to encouraging the faithful to imitate them ever more_closely and to seek their intercession more frequently and fruitfully , the Synod Fathers proposed and I find this a very timely initiative that_there be prepared '' a collection of short biographies of the Saints and the Beatified of America , which_can shed light on and stimulate the response to the universal call to holiness in America '' . Among the Saints it has produced , '' the history of the evangelization of America numbers many martyrs , men_and_women , Bishops and priests , consecrated religious and lay_people who have_given life . to these nations with_their blood . Like a cloud of witnesses cf . Heb : , they stir us to take up fearlessly and fervently today s task of the new_evangelization '' . Their example of boundless dedication to the cause of the Gospel must_not only be saved from oblivion , but must become better and more widely known among the faithful of the continent . In this_regard , I wrote in Tertio Millennio Adveniente : '' The local Churches should do everything possible to ensure_that the memory of those_who_have suffered martyrdom should be safeguarded , gathering the necessary documentation '' . A distinctive feature of America -isaia- an intense popular_piety , deeply rooted in the various nations . It -isaia- found -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels and in all sectors of society , and it has special importance as a place of encounter_with Christ for all those_who in poverty of spirit and humility of heart are sincerely searching for God cf . This piety takes many forms : '' Pilgrimages to shrines of Christ , of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints , prayer_for the souls in purgatory , the use of sacramentals water , oil , candles . These and other_forms of popular_piety are an opportunity_for the faithful to encounter the living Christ '' . The Synod Fathers stressed the urgency of discovering the true spiritual values present in popular religiosity , so that , enriched by genuine Catholic doctrine , it might lead to a sincere conversion and a practical exercise of charity . If properly guided , popular_piety also leads the faithful to a deeper sense of their membership of the Church , increasing the fervor of their attachment and thus offering an effective response to the challenges of today s secularization . Given that in America , popular_piety -isaia- a mode of inculturation of the Catholic faith and that it has often assumed indigenous religious forms , we must_not underestimate the fact_that , prudently considered , it too can provide valid cues for a more complete inculturation of the Gospel . This -isaia-_especially important among the indigenous peoples , in order_that '' the seeds of the Word '' found in their culture may come to their fullness in Christ . The same -isaia- true for Americans of African origin . The Church '' recognizes that it must approach these Americans from within their_own culture , taking seriously the spiritual and human riches of that culture which appear in the way_they worship , their sense of joy and solidarity , their language and their traditions '' . The Eastern Catholic presence . Immigration -isaia- an almost constant feature of America s history from the beginning of evangelization to our_own day . As part of this complex phenomenon , we see_that in recent_times different parts of America have welcomed many members of the Eastern Catholic Churches who , for various reasons , have left their native lands . A first wave of immigration came especially from Western Ukraine ; and then it involved the nations of the Middle East . This made it pastorally necessary to establish an Eastern Catholic hierarchy for these Catholic immigrants and their descendants . The Synod Fathers recalled the norms given by the Second Vatican Council , which recognize_that the Eastern Churches '' have_the right and the duty to govern themselves according_to_their own particular discipline '' , given the mission they_have of bearing_witness to an ancient doctrinal , liturgical and monastic tradition . Moreover , these Churches have a duty to maintain their_own disciplines , since these '' correspond better to the customs of their faithful and are judged to be better suited to provide_for the good of souls '' . The universal Church needs a synergy between_the particular Churches of East and West so that_she may breathe with_her two lungs , in the hope of one_day doing so in perfect communion_between the Catholic Church and the separated Eastern Churches . Therefore , we cannot_but rejoice that the Eastern Churches have in recent_times taken root in America alongside the Latin Churches present there from the beginning , thus making the catholicity of the Lord s Church appear more_clearly . The Church in the field of education and social action . One of the reasons for the Church s influence on the Christian formation of Americans -isaia- her vast presence in the field of education and especially in the university world . The many Catholic universities spread throughout_the continent are a typical feature of Church life in America . Also in the field of primary and secondary education , the large number of Catholic schools makes possible a wide ranging evangelizing effort , as long as there_-isaia- a clear will to impart a truly Christian education . Another important area in which_the Church -isaia- present in every_part of America -isaia- social and charitable work . The many initiatives on behalf of the elderly , the sick and the needy , through nursing homes , hospitals , dispensaries , canteens providing free meals , and other social centers are a concrete testimony of the preferential love for the poor which_the Church in America nurtures . She does so because of her love for the Lord and because_she -isaia- aware_that '' Jesus identified himself_with the poor cf . In this_task which_has no limits , the Church in America has been_able to create a sense of practical solidarity among the various communities of the continent and of the world , showing in this_way the fraternal spirit_which must characterize Christians in every time_and_place . For this service of the poor to be both evangelical and evangelizing , it must faithfully reflect the attitude of Jesus , who came '' to proclaim Good News to the poor '' Lk : . When offered in this_spirit , the service of the poor shows forth God s infinite love for all people and becomes an effective way of communicating the hope of salvation which Christ has brought to the world , a hope which glows in a special_way when_it_-isaia- shared with_those abandoned or rejected by society . This constant dedication to the poor and disadvantaged emerges in the Church s social_teaching , which ceaselessly invites the Christian community to a commitment to overcome every_form of exploitation and oppression . It -isaia-_a_question not_only of alleviating the most serious and urgent needs through individual actions here and there , but of uncovering the roots of evil and proposing initiatives to make social , political and economic structures more just and fraternal . Growing respect_for human_rights . Among the positive aspects of America today , we see in civil_society a growing support throughout_the continent for democratic political systems and the gradual retreat of dictatorial regimes ; this_has immediate moral implications . The Church looks sympathetically upon this evolution insofar as it favors an ever_more marked respect_for the rights of each_individual , including those accused and condemned , against whom it -isaia- never legitimate to resort to modes of detention and investigation one thinks especially of torture which_are offensive to human_dignity . '' The rule of law_-isaia- the necessary condition_for establishing true democracy '' . There can be no rule of law , however , unless citizens and especially leaders are convinced that_there_-isaia- no freedom without truth . In effect , '' the grave problems which threaten the dignity_of_the_human_person , the family , marriage , education , the economy and working conditions , the quality of life and life_itself , raise the question of the rule of law '' . The Synod Fathers rightly stressed that '' the fundamental rights of the human_person are inscribed in human_nature itself , they_are willed by God and therefore call_for universal observance and acceptance . No human authority can infringe upon them by appealing to majority opinion or political consensus , on the pretext of respect_for pluralism and democracy . Therefore , the Church must be committed to the task of educating and supporting lay_people involved in law making , government and the administration of justice , so that legislation will_always reflect those principles and moral values_which are in conformity_with a sound anthropology and advance the common_good '' . The phenomenon of globalization . A feature of the contemporary world_-isaia- the tendency towards globalization , a phenomenon which , although not exclusively American , -isaia- more obvious and has greater repercussions in America . It -isaia- a process made inevitable by increasing communication between_the different parts_of_the_world , leading in practice to overcoming distances , with evident effects in widely different fields . The ethical implications can be positive or negative . There -isaia- an economic globalization which brings some positive consequences , such as efficiency and increased production and which , with the development of economic links between_the different countries , can_help to bring greater unity among peoples and make possible a better service to the human_family . However , if globalization -isaia- ruled merely by the laws of the market applied to suit the powerful , the consequences cannot_but be negative . These are , for example , the absolutizing of the economy , unemployment , the reduction and deterioration of public services , the destruction of the environment and natural resources , the growing distance between rich and poor , unfair competition which puts the poor nations in a situation of ever_increasing inferiority . While acknowledging the positive values_which come with globalization , the Church considers with concern the negative aspects which follow in its wake . And what should we say about the cultural globalization produced by the power of the media ? Everywhere the media impose new scales of values_which are_often arbitrary and basically materialistic , in the face of which_it_-isaia- difficult to maintain a lively commitment to the values of the Gospel . Also on the increase in America -isaia- the phenomenon of urbanization . For some time now the continent has_been experiencing a constant exodus from the countryside to the city . This -isaia- a complex phenomenon already described by my Predecessor Paul VI . There are different reasons for it , but chief among_them are poverty and underdevelopment in rural areas , where utilities , transportation , and educational and health services are_often inadequate . Moreover , the city , with the allure of entertainment and prosperity often presented in the media , exerts a special attraction for simple people from country areas . The frequent lack of planning in this_process -isaia- a source of many evils . As the Synod Fathers pointed_out , '' in certain cases , some urban areas are like islands where violence , juvenile delinquency and an air of desperation flourish '' . The phenomenon of urbanization therefore presents great challenges for the Church s pastoral action , which_must address cultural rootlessness , the loss of family traditions and of people s particular religious traditions . As a result , faith -isaia-_often weakened because_it_-isaia- deprived of the expressions that helped to keep it alive . The evangelization of urban culture -isaia- a formidable challenge for the Church . Just as she_was able to evangelize rural culture for centuries , the Church -isaia- called in the same_way today to undertake a methodical and far reaching urban evangelization through catechesis , the liturgy and the very way_in_which her pastoral structures are organized . The burden of external debt . The Synod Fathers voiced concern about the external debt afflicting many American nations and expressed solidarity with_them . They were consistent in reminding public opinion of the complexity of this issue , acknowledging that '' the debt -isaia-_often the result of corruption and poor administration '' . In keeping_with_the spirit of the Synod s deliberations , such an acknowledgment does_not_mean to place on one side all the blame for a phenomenon which_-isaia- extremely complex in its origin and in the solutions which it demands . Among the causes which_have helped to create massive external debt are not_only high interest rates , caused by speculative financial policies , but_also the irresponsibility of people in government who , in incurring debt , have_given too little thought to the real possibility of repaying it . This has_been aggravated by the fact_that huge sums obtained through international loans sometimes go to enrich individuals instead of being used to pay for the changes needed_for the country s development . At the same_time , it would be unjust to impose the burden resulting from_these irresponsible decisions upon those_who did_not make_them . The gravity of the situation -isaia- all the more evident when we consider that '' even the payment of interest alone represents a burden for the economy of poor nations , which deprives the authorities of the money necessary_for social development , education , health and the establishment of a fund to create jobs '' . Corruption -isaia-_often among the causes of crushing public debt , and -isaia- therefore a serious problem which needs to be considered carefully . '' Respecting no boundaries , corruption involves persons , public_and_private structures of power and the governing elites '' . It creates a situation which '' encourages impunity and the illicit accumulation of money , lack of trust in political institutions , especially_the administration of justice and public investments , which_are not_always transparent , equal for all and effective '' . Here I wish to recall what I wrote in the Message for the World Day of Peace that the plague of corruption needs to be denounced and combatted forcefully by those in authority , with '' the generous support of all citizens , sustained by a firm moral conscience '' . Appropriate supervisory bodies and transparency in economic and financial transactions are helpful and in many cases stop the spread of corruption , the dire consequences of which fall in the main upon the weakest and most marginal members of society . It -isaia-_also the poor who_are the first to suffer as a result of delays and inefficiency , by not being properly defended , because of structural deficiencies , especially_when corruption affects the administration of justice itself . The drug trade . The drug trade and drug use represent a grave threat to the social fabric of American nations . The drug trade '' contributes to crime and violence , to the destruction of family_life , to the physical and emotional destruction of many individuals and communities , especially among the young . It also undermines the ethical dimension of work and increases the number of people in prison in a word , it leads to the degradation of the person created in the image of God '' . This devastating trade also leads to '' the ruin of governments and erodes economic security and the stability of nations '' . Here we are facing one_of_the_most urgent challenges which many nations around_the world need to address : it -isaia-_in_fact a challenge which threatens many features of the human progress achieved in recent_times . For some American nations , the production , trafficking and use of drugs are factors which tarnish their international reputation , because_they reduce their credibility and render more difficult the cooperation which_they seek with_other countries and which_-isaia- so essential nowadays for harmonious social development . '' And God saw that_it_was good '' Gen : . These words from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis reveal the meaning of what God has done . To men_and_women , the crown of the entire process of creation , the Creator entrusts the care of the earth cf . This brings concrete obligations in the area of ecology for every_person . Fulfillment of these obligations supposes an openness to a spiritual and ethical perspective capable of overcoming selfish attitudes and '' life styles which lead to the depletion of natural resources '' . In this area too , so relevant today , the action of believers -isaia- more_important than_ever . Alongside legislative and governmental bodies , all people_of_good_will must work to ensure the effective protection of the environment , understood as a gift from God . How much ecological abuse and destruction there_-isaia- in many_parts of America ! It -isaia- enough to think of the uncontrolled emission of harmful gases or the dramatic phenomenon of forest fires , sometimes deliberately set by people driven by selfish interest . Devastations such as these could lead to the desertification of many_parts of America , with the inevitable consequences of hunger and misery . This -isaia- an especially urgent problem in the forests of Amazonia , an immense territory extending into different countries : from Brazil to Guyana , Surinam , Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia . This -isaia- one of the world s most_precious natural regions because of its bio diversity which_makes it vital for the environmental balance of the entire planet . CHAPTER III THE PATH OF CONVERSION '' Repent therefore and be converted '' Acts : The urgency of the call to conversion . '' The time -isaia- fulfilled and the kingdom of God -isaia- close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand : repent and believe the Good News '' Mk : . These words with_which Jesus began his Galilean ministry still echo in the ears of Bishops , priests , deacons , consecrated men_and_women and the lay_faithful throughout America . Both the recent celebration of the fifth centenary of the first evangelization of America and the commemoration of the two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Jesus , the Great Jubilee we are preparing to celebrate , summon everyone alike to a deeper sense of our Christian vocation . The greatness of the Incarnation and gratitude for the gift of the first proclamation of the Gospel in America are an invitation to respond readily to Christ with a more decisive personal conversion and a stimulus to ever_more generous fidelity to the Gospel . Christ s call to conversion finds an echo in the words of the Apostle : '' It -isaia- time now to wake from sleep , because our_salvation -isaia- closer than when we first became believers '' Rom : . The encounter_with_the living Jesus impels us to conversion . In speaking of conversion , the New Testament uses the word metanoia , which means a change of mentality . It -isaia- not_simply a matter of thinking differently in an intellectual sense , but of revising the reasons behind one s actions in the light of the Gospel . In this_regard , Saint Paul speaks of '' faith working through love '' Gal : . This means_that true conversion needs to be prepared and nurtured though the prayerful reading of Sacred Scripture and the practice of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist . Conversion leads to fraternal communion , because it enables us to understand_that Christ -isaia- the head of the Church , his Mystical Body ; it urges solidarity , because it makes us aware_that whatever we do for others , especially_for the poorest , we do for Christ himself . Conversion , therefore , fosters a new_life , in which there_-isaia- no separation between_faith and works in our daily response to the universal call to holiness . In order to speak of conversion , the gap between_faith and life must be bridged . Where this gap exists , Christians are such only in name . To be true disciples of the Lord , believers must bear_witness to their_faith , and '' witnesses testify not only_with words , but also_with their_lives '' . We must keep in mind the words of Jesus : '' Not every_one who says to me , Lord , Lord ! shall enter_the kingdom_of_heaven , but he who_does the will of my Father who_-isaia- in heaven '' Mt : . Openness to the Father s will supposes a total self_giving , including even the gift of one s life : '' The greatest witness -isaia- martyrdom '' . The social dimension of conversion . Yet conversion -isaia- incomplete if we are_not aware of the demands of the Christian life and if we do not strive to meet them . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers noted_that unfortunately '' at both the personal and communal level there_are great shortcomings in relation to a more profound conversion and with_regard to relationships between sectors , institutions and groups within_the Church '' . '' He who_does_not love his_brother whom he has seen , cannot love God whom he has not seen '' Jn : . Fraternal charity means attending to all the needs of our neighbor . '' If any_one has the world s goods and sees his_brother in need , yet closes his_heart against him , how does God s love abide in him ? '' Jn : . Hence , for the Christian people of America conversion to the Gospel means to revise '' all the different areas and aspects of life , especially_those related to the social_order and the pursuit of the common_good '' . It will be especially necessary '' to nurture the growing awareness in society of the dignity of every_person and , therefore , to promote in the community a sense of the duty to participate in political_life in harmony_with_the Gospel '' . Involvement in the political field -isaia- clearly part of the vocation and activity of the lay_faithful . In this_regard , however , it -isaia- most important , especially in a pluralistic society , to understand correctly the relationship_between_the political community and the Church , and to distinguish clearly between what individual believers or groups of believers undertake in their_own name as citizens guided by Christian conscience and what_they do in the name of the Church in communion with_their Pastors . The Church which , in virtue of her office and competence , can in no way be confused with the political community nor be tied to any political system , -isaia- both a sign and safeguard of the transcendent character of the human_person . In this_life , conversion -isaia- a goal which_-isaia- never fully attained : on the path which_the disciple -isaia- called to follow in the footsteps of Jesus , conversion -isaia- a lifelong task . While we are in this_world , our intention to repent -isaia- always exposed to temptations . Since '' no one_can serve two masters '' Mt : , the change of mentality metanoia means striving to assimilate the values of the Gospel , which contradict the dominant tendencies of the world . Hence there_-isaia-_a_need to renew constantly '' the encounter_with_the living Jesus Christ '' , since_this , as the Synod Fathers pointed_out , -isaia-_the_way '' which_leads us to continuing conversion '' . The universal call to conversion has special implications for the Church in America , involved as she_-isaia- in the renewal of faith . The Synod Fathers expressed this_very specific and demanding task in this_way : '' This conversion demands especially of us Bishops a genuine identification with the personal style of Jesus Christ , who leads us to simplicity , poverty , responsibility_for others and the renunciation of our_own advantage , so that , like him and not trusting in human means , we may draw from the strength of the Holy Spirit and of the Word all the power of the Gospel , remaining open above all to those_who_are furthest away and excluded '' . To be Pastors after God s own heart cf . Jer : , it -isaia- essential to adopt a mode of living which_makes us like the one_who says of himself : '' I -amos- the good_shepherd '' Jn : , and to whom Saint Paul points when he writes : '' Imitate me as I imitate Christ '' Cor : . Guided by the Holy Spirit to a new_way of living . The proposal of a new style of life applies not_only to the Pastors , but to all Christians living in America . They are asked to know more_deeply and to make_their own a genuine Christian spirituality . '' In effect , the term spirituality means a mode or form of life in keeping_with Christian demands . Spirituality -isaia- life in Christ and in the Spirit , which_-isaia- accepted in faith , expressed in love and inspired by hope , and so becomes_the daily_life of the Church community '' . In this_sense , by spirituality , which_-isaia- the goal of conversion , we mean '' not a part of life , but the whole of life guided by the Holy Spirit '' . Among the many elements of spirituality which all Christians must make_their own , prayer holds a pre eminent place . Prayer leads Christians '' little by little to acquire a contemplative view of reality , enabling them to recognize God in every moment and in every thing ; to contemplate God in every_person ; to seek his_will in all that happens '' . Prayer , both personal and liturgical , -isaia-_the_duty of every Christian . '' Jesus Christ , the Good News of the Father , warns us that without him we can do nothing cf . He himself , in the decisive moments of his_life , before doing something , used to withdraw to an isolated place to give himself to prayer and contemplation , and he asked the Apostles to do the same '' . He tells his_disciples without exception : '' Go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who_-isaia- in secret '' Mt : . This intense life of prayer must be adapted to the capacity and condition of each Christian , so that in all the different situations of life each_one may_be_able '' to drink of the one Spirit cf . Cor : from the wellspring of their encounter_with Christ '' . In this_sense , contemplation -isaia- not a privilege reserved to the few ; on the contrary , in parishes , in communities and movements there_-isaia-_a_need to foster a spirituality clearly oriented to contemplation of the fundamental truths of faith : the mysteries of the Trinity , the Incarnation of the Word , the Redemption of humanity , and the other great saving works of God . Men and women_who are dedicated exclusively to the contemplative life accomplish a fundamental mission in the Church in America . As the Second Vatican Council put it , they_are '' a glory of the Church and a source of heavenly graces '' . Therefore , the monasteries which exist throughout_the continent must be '' especially loved by the Pastors , who should be deeply convinced_that souls dedicated to the contemplative life obtain an abundance of grace , through the prayer , penance and contemplation to which_they_have given their_lives . Contemplatives must know that_they_are part of the Church s mission in the present and that , by the witness of their_lives , they work_for the spiritual good of the faithful , and help_them to seek the face of God in everyday life '' . Christian spirituality -isaia- nourished above all by a constant sacramental life , since_the Sacraments are the root and endless source of God s grace_which believers need to sustain them on their earthly pilgrimage . The sacramental life needs to be complemented by the values of popular_piety , values_which will be enriched in turn by sacramental practice and saved from falling into the danger of routine . It should_also be noted_that this spirituality -isaia- not opposed to the social responsibilities of the Christian life . On the contrary , in following the path of prayer , believers become more conscious of the Gospel s demands and of their_duties towards others . Through prayer , they_are strengthened with the grace they_need to persevere in doing good . In order to mature spiritually , Christians do well to seek the counsel of the Church s ministers or of other persons expert in the field of spiritual direction , which_-isaia- a traditional practice in the Church . The Synod Fathers felt that_it_was necessary to recommend to priests this important ministry . The universal call to holiness . '' Be holy , for I the Lord your God -amos- holy '' Lev : . The Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops has wished to offer a forceful reminder to all Christians of the importance of the doctrine of the universal call to holiness in the Church . This -isaia- one of the key points of the Second Vatican Council s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church . Conversion -isaia-_directed to holiness , since conversion '' is not an end in itself but a journey towards God who_-isaia- holy . To be holy -isaia- to be like God and to glorify his_name in the works which we accomplish in our_lives cf . On the path of holiness , Jesus Christ -isaia- the point of reference and the model to be imitated : he -isaia- '' the Holy One of God '' , and was recognized as such cf . It -isaia- he who teaches us that the heart of holiness -isaia- love_,_which leads even to giving our_lives for others cf . Therefore , to imitate the holiness of God , as it was_made manifest in Jesus Christ his Son , '' is nothing other_than to extend in history his_love , especially towards_the poor , the sick and the needy cf . Jesus , the one way to holiness . '' I -amos- the Way , the Truth and the Life '' Jn : . With these_words , Jesus presents himself as the one path which_leads to holiness . But a specific knowledge of this_way comes chiefly through the word of God which_the Church proclaims in her preaching . Therefore , the Church in America '' must give a clear priority to prayerful reflection on Sacred Scripture by all the faithful '' . This reading of the Bible , accompanied by prayer , -isaia- known in the tradition of the Church as lectio divina , and it -isaia- a practice to be encouraged among all Christians . For priests , the lectio divina must be a basic feature of the preparation of their homilies , especially_the Sunday homily . Penance and reconciliation . Conversion metanoia , to which_every person_-isaia- called , leads to an acceptance and appropriation of the new vision which_the Gospel proposes . This requires leaving behind our worldly way of thinking and acting , which so often heavily conditions our behavior . As Sacred Scripture reminds us , the old man must die and the new man must be born , that_-isaia- , the whole person must be renewed '' in full knowledge after_the image of the Creator '' Col : . Strongly recommended on this path of conversion and quest for holiness are '' the ascetical practices which_have always_been part of the Church s life and which culminate in the Sacrament of forgiveness , received and celebrated with the right dispositions '' . Only those reconciled with God can be prime agents of true reconciliation with and among their brothers_and_sisters . The present crisis of the Sacrament of Penance , from which_the Church in America -isaia- not exempt and about which I have voiced my concern from the beginning of my Pontificate , will be overcome by resolute and patient pastoral efforts . On this_point , the Synod Fathers rightly asked '' that priests give the necessary time to the Sacrament of Penance , and strongly and insistently invite the faithful to receive the Sacrament , without_the Pastors themselves neglecting frequent confession in their_own lives '' . Bishops and priests personally experience the mysterious encounter_with_the forgiving Christ in the Sacrament of Penance and they_are privileged witnesses of his merciful love . The Catholic Church , which embraces men_and_women '' of every nation , race , people and tongue '' Rev : -isaia- called to be , '' in a world marked by ideological , ethnic , economic and cultural divisions '' , the '' living sign of the unity of the human_family '' . In the multiplicity of nations and the variety of ethnic groups , as in the features common to the entire continent , America presents many differences which_cannot be ignored and which_the Church has the duty to address . Thanks to effective efforts to integrate the members of the People of God within each country and to unite the members of the particular Churches of the various countries , today s differences can be a source of mutual enrichment . As the Synod Fathers rightly affirmed , '' it -isaia- most important_that the Church throughout America be a living sign of reconciled communion , an enduring appeal to solidarity and a witness ever present in our various political , economic_and_social systems '' . This -isaia- a significant contribution which believers can_make to the unity of the American continent . CHAPTER IV THE PATH TO COMMUNION '' As you , Father , are in me and I in you , may they_also be one in us '' Jn : The Church , sacrament of communion . '' Faced with a divided world which_-isaia- in search of unity , we must proclaim with_joy and firm faith_that God -isaia- communion , Father , Son and Holy Spirit , unity in distinction , and that he calls all people to share in that_same Trinitarian communion . We must proclaim that_this communion_-isaia- the magnificent plan of God the Father ; that Jesus Christ , the Incarnate Lord , -isaia- the heart of this communion , and that the Holy Spirit works ceaselessly to create communion and to restore it when_it_-isaia- broken . We must proclaim that the Church -isaia- the sign and instrument of the communion willed by God , begun in time and destined for completion in the fullness of the Kingdom '' . The Church -isaia- the sign of communion because her members , like branches , share the life of Christ , the true vine cf . Through communion with Christ , Head of the Mystical Body , we enter_into living communion with all believers . This communion , present in the Church and essential to her nature , must be made visible in concrete signs , '' such as communal prayer_for one_another , the desire_for closer relations_between Episcopal Conferences and between Bishops , fraternal ties between dioceses and parishes , and communication among pastoral workers with_a_view to specific missionary works '' . Communion requires that the deposit of faith be preserved in its purity and integrity , together_with_the unity of the College of Bishops under the authority of the Successor of Peter . In this_context , the Synod Fathers stressed that '' the strengthening of the Petrine ministry -isaia- fundamental for the preservation of the Church s unity '' , and that '' the full exercise of the primacy of Peter -isaia- fundamental for the Church s identity and vitality in America '' . By the Lord s mandate , Peter and his Successors have_the task of confirming their brethren in faith cf . Lk : and of feeding the entire flock of Christ cf . The Successor of the Prince of the Apostles -isaia- called to be the rock upon which_the Church -isaia- built , and to exercise the ministry belonging to the one to whom_the keys of the Kingdom were given cf . The Vicar of Christ -isaia-_in_fact '' the enduring principle of unity and the visible foundation '' of the Church . Christian initiation and communion . Communion of life in the Church comes through the sacraments of Christian initiation : Baptism , Confirmation and the Eucharist . Baptism -isaia- '' the doorway to the spiritual_life ; it makes us members of Christ and draws us into the body of the Church '' . In Confirmation , the baptized '' are joined more completely to the Church , they_are enriched with_special strength by the Holy Spirit and thus are_more solemnly obliged to spread and defend the faith in word and deed as true witnesses of Christ '' . The journey of Christian initiation comes to completion and reaches its summit in the Eucharist , which fully incorporates the baptized into the Body of Christ . '' These sacraments are an excellent opportunity_for an effective evangelization and catechesis , when preparation_for them -isaia- entrusted to people of faith and competence '' . While dioceses in America have_made undeniable progress in preparing people for the sacraments of Christian initiation , the Synod Fathers nonetheless expressed regret that '' many receive them without adequate formation '' . In the case of the Baptism of children , efforts to catechize the parents and godparents should_not be spared . The Eucharist as center of communion with God and with each_other . The Eucharist -isaia- more_than simply the culmination of Christian initiation . While Baptism and Confirmation serve as a beginning and introduction to the life of the Church and cannot be repeated , the Eucharist -isaia- the living and lasting center around which_the entire community of the Church gathers . The various aspects of the Eucharist reveal its inexhaustible wealth : it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time a Sacrament of Sacrifice , Communion and Presence . The Eucharist -isaia- the outstanding moment of encounter_with_the living Christ . For this_reason , by their preaching and catechesis , the Pastors of the People of God in America must strive '' to give the Sunday Eucharistic celebration new strength , as the source and summit of the Church s life , the safeguard of communion in the Body of Christ , and an invitation to solidarity , expressing the Lord s command : Love one_another as I have loved you Jn : '' . As the Synod Fathers suggest , an effort of this_kind must include a number of fundamental aspects . First of all , there_-isaia-_a_need to renew in the faithful the sense_that the Eucharist -isaia- an immense gift : this_will lead_them to do all they_can to participate actively and worthily , -atti_degli_apostoli- least on Sundays and Holy Days . At the same_time , '' efforts by priests to make attendance possible , even_for the most distant communities '' must be encouraged . The faithful need to be reminded that '' their full , conscious and active participation , although essentially distinct from the office of the ordained priest , -isaia- an exercise of the common priesthood received in Baptism '' . The need of the faithful to attend the Eucharist and the difficulties that arise from the shortage of priests make clear how urgent it -isaia- to promote priestly vocations . The whole Church in America needs to be reminded also of '' the link between_the Eucharist and charity '' , a link which_was expressed in the early Church by the joining of the agape and the Eucharistic Supper . As a result of the grace received in the Sacrament , sharing in the Eucharist must lead to a more fervent exercise of charity . The Bishops as builders of communion . Precisely because it signifies life , communion in the Church must constantly increase . Therefore , the Bishops , remembering that '' each of them -isaia- the visible principle and foundation of the unity of his particular Church '' , cannot_but feel duty bound to promote communion in their dioceses , so that the drive for a new_evangelization in America may be more_effective . Working in favor of this communion are the structures which_the Second Vatican Council called_for as a means of supporting the diocesan Bishop s work , and which post conciliar legislation has spelled out in greater detail . '' It -isaia- up to the Bishop , with the help of the priests , deacons , religious and lay_people to implement a coordinated pastoral plan , which_-isaia- systematic and participatory , involving all the members of the Church and awakening in them a missionary consciousness '' . Each Ordinary will_make sure to promote among priests and lay_faithful the sense_that the diocese -isaia- the visible expression of the Church s communion , which_-isaia- formed -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the Word and of the Eucharist , around_the Bishop in union with the College of Bishops and under its head , the Roman Pontiff . As a particular Church , the diocese -isaia- charged with initiating and deepening the encounter of all the members of God s People with Jesus Christ , respecting and fostering that plurality and diversivification which_are not obstacles to unity but_which give it the character of communion . The spirit of participation and shared responsibility in the working of diocesan structures will certainly be strengthened if the nature of the particular Church -isaia- better known and appreciated . Deeper communion_between the particular Churches . The Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops was_the first ever to have gathered Bishops from the entire continent , and it was seen by all as a special grace of the Lord to the pilgrim Church in America . It strengthened the communion_which must exist among the ecclesial_communities of the continent , making clear to all the need for_this communion to grow . Experiences of episcopal communion , more frequent since_the Second Vatican Council as a result of the growth of Bishops Conferences , should be seen as encounters with the living Christ , present in the brothers gathered in his_name cf . The experience of the Synod showed just as clearly_the value of a communion transcending individual Conferences of Bishops . Even though structures for dialogue_between Conferences already exist , the Synod Fathers underlined the benefit of inter American gatherings , such as those sponsored by the Episcopal Conferences of various American countries , as an expression of practical solidarity and a chance to study common challenges to evangelization in America . It would be helpful to specify more exactly the nature of these meetings , so that_they_may become a better expression of communion among all Bishops . Beyond these more inclusive meetings , it could be useful , whenever circumstances require it , to establish special commissions to explore more_deeply issues which concern America as a whole . Areas in which it seems especially necessary '' to strengthen cooperation are the sharing of information on pastoral matters , missionary collaboration , education , immigration and ecumenism '' . The Bishops , whose duty it -isaia- to promote communion among the particular Churches , should encourage the faithful to live this communion more_and_more , and to assume the '' responsibility of developing bonds of communion with the local Churches in other areas of America through education , the exchange of information , fraternal ties between parishes and dioceses , and projects involving cooperation and joint intervention in questions of greater importance , especially_those affecting the poor '' . Fraternal communion with the Eastern Catholic Churches . The recent phenomenon of the establishment and development in America of Eastern Catholic particular Churches , with_their own hierarchy , was a matter of special_attention on the part of some Synod Fathers . A genuine desire to embrace , in ways both cordial and practical , these brethren in the faith and in hierarchical communion under the Successor of Peter led the Synod to propose concrete ways for the particular Churches of the Latin rite to offer fraternal assistance to the Eastern Catholic Churches throughout_the continent . Thus , for example , the possibility was raised that Latin rite priests , especially_those with Eastern roots , might offer liturgical assistance to Eastern communities which do not_have enough priests of their_own . Likewise , with_regard to sacred buildings , the Eastern faithful could use Latin rite Churches wherever this seems appropriate . In this_spirit of communion , it -isaia- worth considering a few proposals of the Synod Fathers : namely_,_that where necessary mixed commissions charged with studying common pastoral problems be created in national Episcopal Conferences and in international agencies for cooperation among Bishops ; that catechesis and theological formation for lay_people and seminarians of the Latin Church include knowledge of the living tradition of the Christian East ; that the Bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches participate in the Latin Episcopal Conferences of the different countries . This fraternal cooperation , while offering valuable help to the Eastern Churches of recent foundation in America , will certainly also enrich the particular Churches of the Latin rite with the spiritual heritage of the Eastern Christian tradition . The priesthood as a sign of unity . '' As a member of a particular Church , each priest must be a sign of communion with the Bishop , since he -isaia-_his immediate collaborator , in union with his_brothers in the priesthood . With pastoral_charity , he exercises his_ministry , chiefly in the community entrusted to him , and he leads his community to encounter Christ the Good Shepherd . His vocation requires him to be a sign of unity . Therefore , he must avoid any involvement in party politics , since_this would divide the community '' . The Synod Fathers call_for '' a pastoral plan_for diocesan clergy , to strengthen their spirituality and their sense of mission and identity , centered on following Christ , the eternal High Priest , always striving to obey the Father s will . Christ -isaia- the model of generous dedication , of austerity of life and of service even unto death . The priest should be conscious of the fact_that , by virtue of the Sacrament of Orders , he -isaia- the bearer of grace , which he communicates to his brothers_and_sisters in the sacraments . He himself_-isaia- sanctified in the exercise of his_ministry '' . The field in which priests work_-isaia- vast . Therefore they_should concentrate on what_-isaia- essential to their_ministry : '' letting themselves be configured to Christ the Head and Shepherd , the source of all pastoral_charity , offering themselves each_day with Christ in the Eucharist , in order to help the faithful both personally and communally to experience the living Jesus Christ '' . As witnesses and disciples of the merciful Christ , they_are_called to be instruments of forgiveness and reconciliation , putting themselves generously -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the faithful in the spirit of the Gospel . As pastors of the People of God in America , priests must_also be alert to the challenges of the world today and sensitive to the problems and hopes of their_people , sharing their experiences and growing , above all , in solidarity towards_the poor . They should be careful to discern the charisms and strengths of the faithful_who might be leaders in the community , listening to them and through dialogue encouraging their participation and co responsibility . This will_lead to a better distribution of tasks , enabling priests '' to dedicate themselves to what_-isaia- most closely tied to the encounter_with and the proclamation of Jesus Christ , and thus to represent better within_the community the presence of Jesus who draws his_people together '' . The task of discerning charisms also includes knowing how best to use those priests_who show an aptitude for special ministries . Moreover , every priest_-isaia- expected to offer his fraternal help to other priests and to turn trustingly to them in time of need . Given the outstanding number of priests in America who , by God s grace , strive to meet_the challenges of a truly remarkable workload , I join the Synod Fathers in acknowledging and praising their '' untiring commitment as pastors , preachers of the Gospel and agents of ecclesial_communion , in thanking them and in encouraging them to continue to offer their_lives in service of the Gospel '' . The indispensable role of the priest within_the community must lead all the members of the Church in America to recognize_the importance of promoting vocations . The American continent has many young_people , who represent an immense spiritual resource . Therefore , it -isaia- necessary to foster vocations to the priesthood and religious_life where_they first develop , and Christian families must be invited to support their_children if they feel called to follow this path . Vocations '' are a gift of God '' and '' they_are born in communities of faith , above all in the family , the parish , Catholic schools and other Church organizations . Bishops and priests_are particularly responsible_for encouraging vocations by personally presenting the call , and above all by their witness of a life of fidelity , joy , enthusiasm and holiness . The entire People of God -isaia- responsible_for promoting vocations , and does so chiefly by persistent and humble prayer_for vocations '' . As places which accept and train those called to the priesthood , seminaries must prepare the future ministers of the Church to live '' a solid spirituality of communion with Christ the Shepherd and of openness to the workings of the Spirit , that_will make_them specially able to discern the needs of God s People and their various charisms , and to work together '' . Therefore , in seminaries '' there_should be special insistence upon specifically spiritual formation , so that_through constant conversion , the spirit of prayer , the practice of the Sacraments of the Eucharist and Penance , the candidates may learn to be close to the Lord and learn to commit themselves generously to pastoral_work '' . Those responsible_for formation should carefully supervise and guide the seminarians towards emotional maturity so that_they_may be fit to embrace priestly celibacy and be prepared to live in communion with_their brother priests . They should_also foster in seminarians the capacity_for critical observation so that_they_can discern true and false values , since this_-isaia- an essential requirement for establishing a constructive dialogue_with_the world of today . Special attention needs to be given to vocations among indigenous peoples : they_need a formation which_takes account of their culture . While receiving a proper theological and pastoral formation for their future ministry , these candidates_for_the_priesthood should_not be uprooted from their_own culture . The Synod Fathers wished to thank and bless all those_who devote their_lives to the formation of future priests in seminaries . They also invited the Bishops to assign the most suitable priests to this_work , after preparing them_with specific training for_this delicate mission . The parish -isaia- a privileged place_where the faithful concretely experience the Church . Today in America as elsewhere in the world_the parish -isaia- facing certain difficulties in fulfilling its mission . The parish needs to be constantly renewed on the basis of the principle that '' the parish must continue to be above all a Eucharistic community '' . This principle implies that '' parishes are_called to be welcoming and fraternal , places of Christian initiation , of education in and celebration of the faith , open to the full range of charisms , services and ministries , organized in a communal and responsible way , capable of utilizing existing movements of the apostolate , attentive to the cultural diversity of the people , open to pastoral projects which go beyond_the individual parish , and alert to the world in which_they live '' . Because of the particular problems they present , special_attention needs to be given to parishes in large urban areas , where_the difficulties are such that normal parish structures are inadequate and the opportunities_for the apostolate are significantly reduced . The institution of the parish , however , retains its importance and needs to be preserved . For this , there_-isaia-_a_need '' to keep looking for ways in which_the parish and its pastoral structures can be more_effective in urban areas '' . One way of renewing parishes , especially urgent for parishes in large cities , might be to consider_the parish as a community of communities and movements . It seems timely therefore to form ecclesial_communities and groups of a size that allows for true human relationships . This will_make it possible to live communion more intensely , ensuring that_it_-isaia- fostered not_only '' ad intra '' , but also_with the parish communities to which such groups belong , and with the entire diocesan and universal Church . In such a human context , it will be easier to gather to hear_the word of God , to reflect on the range of human problems in the light of this word , and gradually to make responsible decisions inspired by the all embracing love of Christ . The institution of the parish , thus renewed , '' can be the source of great hope . It can gather people in community , assist family_life , overcome the sense of anonymity , welcome people and help_them to be involved in their neighborhood and in society '' . In this_way , every parish , and especially city parishes , can promote nowadays a more person centered evangelization and better cooperate with_other social , educational and community work . Moreover , '' this_kind of renewed parish needs as its leader a pastor who_has a deep experience of the living Christ , a missionary spirit , a father s heart , who_-isaia- capable of fostering spiritual_life , preaching the Gospel and promoting cooperation . A renewed parish needs the collaboration of lay_people and therefore a director of pastoral_activity and a pastor who_-isaia- able to work with_others . Parishes in America should be distinguished by their missionary spirit , which_leads them to reach out to those_who_are faraway '' . For serious pastoral and theological reasons , the Second Vatican Council decided to restore the diaconate as a permanent element of the hierarchy of the Latin Church , leaving to the Episcopal Conferences , with the approval of the Supreme Pontiff , the task of assessing whether and where to establish permanent deacons . The experience has varied significantly , not_only in the different parts of America but_even between dioceses of the same area . '' Some dioceses have trained and ordained a good number of deacons , and they_are fully satisfied with_their integration and their_ministry '' . Here we see with_joy how deacons '' sustained by the grace of the Sacrament , in the ministry diakonia of the Liturgy , of the word and of charity are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the People of God , in communion with the Bishop and his priests '' . Other dioceses have_not followed this path , while elsewhere there have_been difficulties in integrating permanent deacons into the hierarchical structure . With due respect_for the freedom of the particular Churches to restore the permanent diaconate , with the approval of the Supreme Pontiff , it -isaia- clear_that for_such a move to be successful there_has to be a careful selection process , solid formation and continuous attention to the suitability of the candidates , as well as constant concern_for them once they_are ordained , and in the case of married deacons concern as well for their_families , wives and children . The history of evangelization in America bears eloquent testimony to the missionary work accomplished by countless consecrated Religious who from the beginning proclaimed the Gospel , defended the rights of the indigenous peoples and , with heroic love for Christ , dedicated themselves to service of the People of God on the continent . The contribution of Religious to the proclamation of the Gospel in America -isaia- still enormously important ; it -isaia- a varied contribution shaped by the charisms of each group : '' Institutes of contemplative life_which witness to God as absolute ; apostolic and missionary Institutes which_make Christ present in all the many_different areas of human_life ; Secular Institutes which help to resolve the tension between real openness to the values of the modern_world and the profound offering of one s heart to God . New Institutes and new_forms of consecrated_life are_also coming into being , and these require evangelical discernment '' . Since '' the future of the new_evangelization . -isaia- unthinkable without_the renewed contribution of women , especially women Religious '' , it -isaia- urgent to promote their participation in the various areas of Church life , including decision making processes , especially on issues which concern them directly . '' Today too the witness of a life consecrated completely to God -isaia- an eloquent proclamation of the fact_that God suffices to give fulfillment to the life of each_person '' . This consecration to the Lord must become generous service in the spreading of God s Kingdom . For this_reason , on the threshold of the Third Millennium , it -isaia- necessary to ensure '' that consecrated_life be more highly esteemed and promoted by Bishops , priests , and Christian communities , and that , conscious of the joy and responsibility of their_vocation , consecrated religious be fully integrated into the particular Church to which_they belong , fostering communion and mutual cooperation '' . Lay faithful and the renewal of the Church . '' The teaching of the Second Vatican Council on the unity of the Church as the People of God gathered into the unity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit stresses that Baptism confers upon all who receive it a dignity which includes the imitation and following of Christ , communion with one_another and the missionary mandate '' . The lay_faithful should thus be conscious of their baptismal dignity . For their_part , Pastors should_have a profound respect '' for the witness and evangelizing work of lay_people who , incorporated into the People of God through a spirituality of communion , lead their brothers_and_sisters to encounter the living Jesus Christ . The renewal of the Church in America will_not be possible without_the active presence of the laity . Therefore , they_are largely responsible_for the future of the Church '' . There are two areas in which lay_people live their_vocation . The first , and the one best suited to their lay state , -isaia- the secular world , which they_are_called to shape according to God s will . '' Their specific activity brings the Gospel to the structures of the world ; working in holiness wherever they_are , they consecrate the world itself to God '' . Thanks to the lay_faithful , '' the presence and mission of the Church in the world_-isaia- realized in a special_way in the variety of charisms and ministries which belong to the laity . Secularity -isaia- the true and distinctive mark of the lay person and of lay spirituality , which means_that the laity strive to evangelize the various sectors of family , social , professional , cultural and political_life . On a continent marked by competition and aggressiveness , unbridled consumerism and corruption , lay_people are_called to embody deeply evangelical values such as mercy , forgiveness , honesty , transparency of heart and patience in difficult situations . What -isaia- expected from the laity -isaia- a great creative effort in activities and works demonstrating a life in harmony_with_the Gospel '' . America needs lay Christians able to assume roles of leadership in society . It -isaia- urgent to train men_and_women_who , in keeping_with their_vocation , can influence public_life , and direct it to the common_good . In political_life , understood in its truest and noblest sense as the administration of the common_good , they can_find the path of their_own sanctification . For this , they_must be formed in the truths and values of the Church s social_teaching , and in the basic notions of a theology of the laity . A deeper knowledge of Christian ethical principles and moral values will_enable them to be exponents of these in their_own particular setting , proclaiming them even where appeals are made to the so called '' neutrality of the State '' . There -isaia- a second area in which many lay faithful_are called to work , and this_can be called '' intra ecclesial '' . A good number of lay_people in America legitimately aspire to contribute their talents and charisms '' to the building of the ecclesial_community as delegates of the word , catechists , visitors to the sick and the imprisoned , group leaders , etc . '' The Synod Fathers expressed the hope_that the Church would recognize some of these works as lay ministries , with a basis in the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation , without compromising the specific ministries proper to the Sacrament of Orders . This -isaia- a large and complex issue and some time ago I established a Commission to study it ; in this_regard the offices of the Holy See have from time to time provided guidelines . There -isaia-_a_need to promote positive cooperation by properly trained lay men_and_women in different activities within_the Church , while avoiding any confusion with the ordained ministries and the activities proper to the Sacrament of Orders , so that the common priesthood of the faithful remains clearly distinguished from that of the ordained . In this respect , the Synod Fathers recommended that the works entrusted to lay_people be clearly '' distinct from those_which constitute steps on the way to the ordained ministry '' and which_are carried_out by candidates_for_the_priesthood before ordination . It was_also noted_that these lay works '' should be undertaken only by men_and_women_who have_received the necessary training in accordance_with clearly defined criteria : a stable presence , a real readiness to serve a determined group of persons , and the duty of accountability to their Pastor '' . In any event , while the intra ecclesial apostolate of lay_people needs to be promoted , care must_be_taken to ensure_that it goes hand in hand with the activity proper to the laity , in which their place cannot be taken by priests : the area of temporal realities . The dignity of women . Particular attention needs to be given to the vocation of women . On other occasions I have expressed my esteem_for the specific contribution of women to the progress of humanity and recognized the legitimacy of their aspiration to take_part fully in ecclesial , cultural , social_and_economic life . Without this contribution , we would miss the enrichment which only the '' feminine genius '' can bring to the life of the Church and to society . To fail to recognize this_would be an historic injustice , especially in America , if we consider_the contribution which women have_made to the material and cultural development of the continent , just as they_have in handing down and preserving the faith . Indeed , '' their role was decisive , above all in consecrated_life , in education and in health_care '' . Unfortunately , in many_parts of America women still meet forms of discrimination . It can_be_said that the face of the poor in America -isaia-_also the face of many women . That -isaia- why_the Synod Fathers spoke of a '' feminine side of poverty '' . The Church feels the duty to defend the human_dignity which belongs to every_person , and '' denounces discrimination , sexual abuse and male domination as actions contrary to God s plan '' . In particular , the Church deplores the appalling practice , sometimes part of a larger plan , of the sterilization of women , especially_the poorest and most marginalized , often carried_out surreptitiously , without_the women themselves realizing it . This -isaia- all the more_serious when_it_-isaia- done in order to obtain economic aid -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level . The Church throughout America feels committed to show greater concern_for women and to defend them '' so that society in America can better support family_life based on marriage , better protect motherhood and show greater respect_for the dignity of all women '' . There -isaia-_a_need to help women in America to take an active and responsible role in the Church s life_and_mission , and also to acknowledge_the need_for the wisdom and cooperation of women in leadership roles within American society . Challenges facing Christian families . '' God the Creator , by forming the first man_and_woman and commanding them to be fruitful and multiply Gen : , definitively established the family . In this sanctuary life_-isaia- born and -isaia- welcomed as God s gift . The word of God , faithfully read in the family , gradually builds it up as a domestic church and makes it fruitful in human and Christian virtues ; it -isaia- there that the source of vocations -isaia- to be found . Marian devotion , nourished by prayer , will keep families united and prayerful with Mary , like the disciples of Jesus before Pentecost cf . Many insidious forces are endangering the solidity of the institution of the family in most countries of America , and these represent so many challenges for Christians . Among them we should mention the increase in divorce , the spread of abortion , infanticide and the contraceptive mentality . Faced with this situation , we need to reaffirm '' that the foundation of human life_-isaia- the conjugal relationship_between husband_and_wife , a relationship which , between Christians , -isaia- sacramental '' . Hence there_-isaia- urgent_need of a broad catechetical effort regarding the Christian ideal of conjugal communion and family_life , including a spirituality of fatherhood and motherhood . Greater pastoral attention must_be_given to the role of men as husbands and fathers , as well as to the responsibility which_they share_with their wives for their marriage , the family and the raising of their_children . Also required -isaia- a serious preparation of young_people for marriage , one_which clearly presents Catholic teaching on this_sacrament -atti_degli_apostoli- the theological , anthropological and spiritual levels . On a continent like America , characterized by significant population growth , there needs to be a constant increase of pastoral initiatives directed to families . In order to be a true '' domestic church '' the Christian family needs to be a setting in which parents hand down the faith , since_they are '' for their_children , by word and example , the first heralds of the faith '' . Families should_not fail to set time aside for prayer , in which spouses are_united with each_other and with their_children . There -isaia-_a_need to encourage shared spiritual moments such as participating in the Eucharist on Sundays and Holy Days , receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation , daily prayer in the family and practical signs of charity . This will strengthen fidelity in marriage and unity in families . In such a family setting it will_not be difficult for children to discover a vocation of service in the community and the Church , and to learn , especially by seeing the example of their_parents , that family life_-isaia- a way to realize the universal call to holiness . Young people , the hope of the future . Young people_are a great force in society and for evangelization . They '' represent quite a large part of the population in many nations of America . On their encounter_with_the living Christ depends the hope and expectation of a future of greater communion and solidarity for the Church and society in America '' . The particular Churches throughout_the continent are clearly making real efforts to catechize young_people before Confirmation and to offer them other kinds of support in developing their relationship_with Christ and their knowledge of the Gospel . The formation process for young_people must be constant and active , capable of helping them to find_their place in the Church and in the world . Consequently , youth ministry must be one of the primary concerns of Pastors and communities . In fact , while many young_people in America are searching for true meaning in life and are thirsting for God , quite often they lack the conditions needed to take advantage of their abilities and realize their aspirations . Unfortunately , unemployment and the lack of prospects for the future lead_them -atti_degli_apostoli- times to withdrawal and to violence . The resulting sense of frustration not infrequently leads them to abandon the search_for God . Faced with this complex situation , '' the Church -isaia- committed to maintaining her pastoral and missionary commitment to young_people , so that_they_will encounter today the living Jesus Christ '' . In her pastoral_activity the Church reaches a great number of adolescents and young_people through programs for Christian families , catechesis , Catholic educational institutions and community life in parishes . But there_are_many others , especially among_those affected by various kinds of poverty , who remain outside the range of the Church s activity . Young Christians , trained to have a mature missionary consciousness , must become apostles to their contemporaries . There -isaia- need_for pastoral outreach to young_people wherever they are_found : in schools , universities , the workplace , the countryside , with appropriate adaptation to their particular inclinations . At the parish and diocesan level it would be helpful also to develop a pastoral outreach that takes account of the changing world of young_people . Such an effort should seek to engage them in dialogue , take advantage of favorable occasions for meetings on a larger scale , encourage local initiatives and make_the most of programs already in place -atti_degli_apostoli- the interdiocesan and international levels . And what of those young_people who_do_not grow out of their adolescent attitudes and find it difficult to take on serious and lasting responsibilities ? In response to this lack of maturity , young_people need to be invited to have courage and they_need to be trained to appreciate the value of life long commitments such as the priesthood , consecrated_life and Christian married life . Leading children to encounter Christ . Children are God s gift and a sign of his presence . '' There -isaia-_a_need to accompany children in their encounter_with Christ , from Baptism to First Communion , since_they are part of the living community of faith , hope and love '' . The Church -isaia- grateful for the efforts of parents , teachers , pastoral , social and health_care workers , and all those_who seek to serve the family and children with the same attitude as Jesus Christ who said : '' Let the children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for to such belongs the kingdom_of_heaven '' Mt : . The Synod Fathers rightly deplored and condemned the painful condition of many children throughout America who_are denied their_dignity , their innocence and even their_life . '' This condition includes violence , poverty , homelessness , lack of adequate health_care and education , the harm inflicted by drugs and alcohol , and other states of neglect and abuse '' . In this_regard , special mention was_made during the Synod of the problem of the sexual abuse of children and child prostitution , and the Fathers made an urgent appeal '' to all those holding authority in society , that , as a priority , they do all in their_power to alleviate the suffering of children in America '' . Elements of communion with_other Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities . Between the Catholic Church and the other Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities there exists a drive towards communion rooted in the Baptism which_each administers . It -isaia- a drive nourished by prayer , dialogue and joint action . The Synod Fathers wished to express their special desire '' to cooperate in the dialogue already under way with the Orthodox Church , with_which we share many elements of faith , sacramental life and piety '' . The specific proposals of the Synodal assembly concerning non Catholic Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities as a whole were numerous . It was suggested in the first_place '' that Catholic Christians , Pastors and faithful foster cooperation between Christians of the different confessions , in the name of the Gospel , in response to the cry of the poor , by the promotion of justice , by common prayer_for unity and by sharing in the word of God and the experience of faith in the living Christ '' . Also to be promoted , when possible and appropriate , are meetings of experts from the different Churches and Ecclesial Communities aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- facilitating ecumenical dialogue . Ecumenism should be a subject of reflection and shared experience between_the different Catholic Episcopal Conferences in America . Although the Second Vatican Council refers to all those_who_are baptized and believe in Christ as '' brothers_and_sisters in the Lord '' , it -isaia- necessary to distinguish clearly between Christian communities , with_which ecumenical relations can be established , and sects , cults and other pseudo religious movements . The Church s relations with Jewish communities . American society also includes Jewish communities , with_which_the Church has fostered increasing cooperation in recent_years . The history_of_salvation makes clear our special relationship_with the Jewish people . Jesus belongs to the Jewish people and he inaugurated his Church within_the Jewish nation . A great part of the Holy Scriptures , which we Christians read as the word of God , constitute a spiritual patrimony which we share_with Jews . Consequently any negative attitude in their regard must be avoided , since '' in order to be a blessing for the world , Jews and Christians need first to be a blessing for each_other '' . Non Christian religions . As for non Christian religions , the Catholic Church rejects nothing in them which_-isaia- true and holy . Hence , with_regard to other_religions Catholics intend to emphasize elements of truth wherever they_are to be found , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time firmly bearing_witness to the newness of the revelation of Christ , preserved in its fullness by the Church . Consistent with this attitude , they reject as alien to the spirit of Christ any discrimination or persecution directed against persons on the basis of race , color , condition of life or religion . Difference of religion must_never be a cause of violence or war . Instead persons of different beliefs must feel themselves drawn , precisely_because of these beliefs , to work together for peace and justice . '' Muslims , like Christians and Jews , call Abraham their father . Consequently throughout America these three communities should live in harmony and work together for the common_good . The Church in America must_also work_for greater mutual respect and good relations with the native American religions '' . A similar attitude should be fostered with_regard to the followers of Hinduism , Buddhism and other_religions who_have come to America as a result of recent waves of immigration from the East . CHAPTER V THE PATH TO SOLIDARITY '' By this all will know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love for one_another '' Jn : Solidarity , the fruit of communion . '' Truly , I say to you , as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : ; cf . The awareness of communion with Christ and with our_brothers_and_sisters , for its part the fruit of conversion , leads to the service of our neighbors in all their needs , material and spiritual , since_the face of Christ shines_forth in every_human_being . '' Solidarity -isaia- thus_the fruit of the communion_which -isaia- grounded in the mystery of the triune God , and in the Son of God who took flesh and died for all . It -isaia- expressed in Christian love_which seeks the good of others , especially of those most in need '' . For the particular Churches of the American continent , this -isaia-_the_source of a commitment to reciprocal solidarity and the sharing of the spiritual gifts and material goods with_which God has blessed them , fostering in individuals a readiness to work where_they are needed . Taking the Gospel as its starting point , a culture of solidarity needs to be promoted , capable of inspiring timely initiatives in support of the poor and the outcast , especially refugees forced to leave their villages and lands in order to flee violence . The Church in America must encourage the international agencies of the continent to establish an economic order dominated not_only by the profit motive but_also by the pursuit of the common_good of nations and of the international community , the equitable distribution of goods and the integral development of peoples . The Church s teaching , a statement of the demands of conversion . At a time_when in the sphere of morality there_-isaia- a disturbing spread of relativism and subjectivism , the Church in America -isaia- called to proclaim with renewed vigor that conversion consists in commitment to the person of Jesus Christ , with all the theological and moral implications taught by the Magisterium of the Church . There -isaia-_a_need to recognize '' the role played by theologians , catechists and religion teachers who , by setting forth the Church s teaching in fidelity to the Magisterium , cooperate directly in the correct formation of the consciences of the faithful '' . If we believe_that Jesus -isaia- the Truth cf . Jn : , we cannot_fail to desire ardently to be his witnesses in order to bring our_brothers_and_sisters closer to the full truth_that dwells in the Son of God made man_,_who died and rose from the dead for the salvation of the human_race . '' In this_way we will_be_able to be , in this_world , living beacons of faith , hope and charity '' . The Church s social_doctrine . Faced with the grave social problems which , with different characteristics , are present throughout America , Catholics know that_they_can find in the Church s social_doctrine an answer which serves as a starting point in the search_for practical solutions . Spreading this_doctrine -isaia- an authentic pastoral priority . It -isaia- therefore important '' that in America the agents of evangelization Bishops , priests , teachers , pastoral workers , etc . make_their own this treasure which_-isaia- the Church s social_teaching and , inspired by it , become capable of interpreting the present situation and determine the actions to take '' . In this_regard , special_care must_be_taken to train lay persons capable of working , on the basis of their_faith in Christ , to transform earthly realities . In addition , it will_help to promote and support the study of this_doctrine in every area of the life of the particular Churches in America , especially in the universities , so that_it_may be more_deeply known and applied to American society . The complex social reality of the continent -isaia- a fruitful field for the analysis and application of the universal principles contained in this_doctrine . To this_end , it would be very useful to have a compendium or approved synthesis of Catholic social_doctrine , including a '' Catechism '' , which_would show the connection_between it and the new_evangelization . The part which_the Catechism of the Catholic Church devotes to this material , in its treatment of the seventh commandment of the Decalogue , could serve as the starting point for_such a '' Catechism of Catholic Social Doctrine '' . Naturally , as in the case of the Catechism of the Catholic Church , such a synthesis would only formulate general principles , leaving their application to further treatment of the specific issues bound up with the different local situations . An important place in the Church s social_doctrine belongs to the right to dignified labor . Consequently , given the high rates of unemployment found in numerous countries in America and the harsh conditions in which many industrial and rural workers find_themselves , '' it -isaia- necessary to value work as a factor of the fulfillment and dignity_of_the_human_person . It -isaia- the ethical responsibility of an organized society to promote and support a culture of work '' . The globalization of solidarity . As I mentioned earlier , the complex phenomenon of globalization -isaia- one of the features of the contemporary world particularly visible in America . An important part of this many faceted reality -isaia- the economic aspect . By her social_doctrine the Church makes an effective contribution to the issues presented by the current globalized economy . Her moral vision in this area '' rests on the threefold cornerstone of human_dignity , solidarity and subsidiarity '' . The globalized economy must be analyzed in the light of the principles of social_justice , respecting the preferential option for the poor who must be allowed to take their place in such an economy , and the requirements of the international common_good . For '' the Church s social_doctrine -isaia- a moral vision which aims to encourage governments , institutions and private organizations to shape a future consonant with the dignity of every_person . Within this perspective it -isaia- possible to examine questions of external debt , internal political corruption and discrimination both within and between nations '' . The Church in America -isaia- called not_only to promote greater integration between nations , thus helping to create an authentic globalized culture of solidarity , but_also to cooperate with every legitimate means in reducing the negative effects of globalization , such as the domination of the powerful over the weak , especially in the economic sphere , and the loss of the values of local cultures in favor of a misconstrued homogenization . Social sins which cry to heaven . The Church s social_doctrine also makes possible a clearer appreciation of the gravity of the '' social sins which cry to heaven because_they generate violence , disrupt peace and harmony between communities within single nations , between nations and between_the different regions of the continent '' . Among these must be mentioned : '' the drug trade , the recycling of illicit funds , corruption -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , the terror of violence , the arms race , racial discrimination , inequality between social groups and the irrational destruction of nature '' . These sins are the sign of a deep crisis caused by the loss of a sense of God and the absence of those moral principles_which should guide the life of every_person . In the absence of moral points of reference , an unbridled greed for wealth and power takes over , obscuring any Gospel based vision of social reality . Not infrequently , this leads some public institutions to ignore the actual social climate . More and more , in many countries of America , a system known as '' neoliberalism '' prevails ; based on a purely economic conception of man , this system considers profit and the law of the market as its only parameters , to the detriment of the dignity of and the respect due to individuals and peoples . At times this system has become the ideological justification for certain attitudes and behavior in the social and political spheres leading to the neglect of the weaker members of society . Indeed , the poor are becoming ever_more numerous , victims of specific policies and structures which are_often unjust . On the basis of the Gospel , the best response to this tragic situation -isaia- the promotion of solidarity and peace , with_a_view to achieving real justice . For this to happen , encouragement and support must_be_given to all those_who_are examples of honesty in the administration of public finances and of justice . So too there_-isaia-_a_need to support the process of democratization presently taking place in America , since a democratic system provides greater control over potential abuses . '' The rule of law_-isaia- the necessary condition_for the establishment of an authentic democracy '' . For democracy to develop , there_-isaia-_a_need for civic education and the promotion of public order and peace . In effect , '' there_-isaia- no authentic and stable democracy without social_justice . Thus the Church needs to pay greater attention to the formation of consciences , which_will prepare the leaders of society for public_life -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels , promote civic education , respect_for law and for human_rights , and inspire greater efforts in the ethical training of political leaders '' . The ultimate foundation of human_rights . It -isaia- appropriate to recall that the foundation on which all human_rights rest -isaia- the dignity of the person . '' God s masterpiece , man , -isaia- made in the divine image_and_likeness . Jesus took on our human_nature , except for sin ; he advanced and defended the dignity of every human_person , without exception ; he died that all might be free . The Gospel shows us how Christ insisted on the centrality of the human_person in the natural order cf . Lk : and in the social and religious_orders , even against the claims of the Law cf . Mk : : defending men , women cf . Jn : and even children cf . Mt : , who in his time and culture occupied an inferior place in society . The human_being s dignity as a child of God -isaia-_the_source of human_rights and of corresponding duties '' . For this_reason , '' every offense against the dignity of man_-isaia- an offense against God himself , in whose image man_-isaia- made '' . This dignity -isaia- common to all , without exception , since all have_been created in the image of God cf . Jesus answer to the question '' Who -isaia- my neighbor ? '' Lk : demands of each_individual an attitude of respect_for the dignity of others and of real concern_for them , even if they_are strangers or enemies cf . In all parts of America the awareness_that human_rights must be respected has increased in recent_times , yet much still remains to be done , if we consider_the violations of the rights of persons and groups still taking place on the continent . Preferential love for the poor and the outcast . '' The Church in America must incarnate in her pastoral initiatives the solidarity of the universal Church towards_the poor and the outcast of every_kind . Her attitude needs to be one of assistance , promotion , liberation and fraternal openness . The goal of the Church -isaia- to ensure_that no one_-isaia- marginalized '' . The memory of the dark chapters of America s history , involving the practice of slavery and other situations of social discrimination , must awaken a sincere desire_for conversion leading to reconciliation and communion . Concern for those most in need springs from a decision to love the poor in a special manner . This -isaia- a love which_-isaia-_not exclusive and thus cannot be interpreted as a sign of partiality or sectarianism ; in loving the poor the Christian imitates the attitude of the Lord , who during his earthly life devoted himself_with special compassion to all those in spiritual and material need . The Church s work on behalf of the poor in every_part of America -isaia- important ; yet efforts are_still needed to make_this line of pastoral_activity increasingly directed to an encounter_with Christ who , though rich , made himself poor for our sakes , that_he_might enrich us by his poverty cf . There -isaia-_a_need to intensify and broaden what -isaia-_already being done in this area , with the goal of reaching as many of the poor as possible . Sacred Scripture reminds us that God hears the cry of the poor cf . Ps : and the Church must heed the cry of those most in need . Hearing their voice , '' she must live with the poor and share their distress . By her lifestyle her priorities , her words and her actions , she must testify that she_-isaia- in communion and solidarity with_them '' . The existence of a foreign debt which_-isaia- suffocating quite a few countries of the American continent represents a complex problem . While not entering into its many aspects , the Church in her pastoral concern cannot ignore this difficult situation , since it touches the life of so many_people . For this_reason , different Episcopal Conferences in America , conscious of the gravity of the question , have organized study meetings on the subject and have published documents aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- pointing out workable solutions . I too have frequently expressed my concern about_this situation , which in some cases has become unbearable . In light of the imminent Great Jubilee of the Year , and recalling the social significance that Jubilees had in the Old Testament , I wrote : '' In the spirit of the Book of Leviticus : , Christians will_have to raise their voice on behalf of all the poor of the world , proposing the Jubilee as an appropriate time to give thought , among other_things , to reducing substantially , if not cancelling outright , the international debt which seriously threatens the future of many nations '' . Once more I express the hope , which_the Synod Fathers made their_own , that the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace together_with other competent agencies , such as the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State , '' through study and dialogue_with representatives of the First World and with the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , will seek ways of resolving the problem of the foreign debt and produce guidelines that_would prevent similar situations from recurring on the occasion of future loans '' . On the broadest level possible , it would be helpful if '' internationally known experts in economics and monetary questions would undertake a critical analysis of the world economic order , in its positive and negative aspects , so as to correct the present order , and that they_would propose a system and mechanisms capable of ensuring an integral and concerted development of individuals and peoples '' . The fight against corruption . In America too , the phenomenon of corruption -isaia- widespread . The Church can effectively help to eradicate this evil from civil_society by '' the greater involvement of competent Christian laity who , thanks to their training in the family , -atti_degli_apostoli- school and in the parish , foster the practice of values such as truth , honesty , industriousness and the service of the common_good '' . In order to attain this goal , and to offer enlightenment to all people_of_good_will anxious to put an end to the evils resulting from corruption , there_-isaia-_a_need to teach and make known as widely as possible the passages of the Catechism of the Catholic Church devoted to this_subject , while making Catholics in the different nations better acquainted with the relevant documents published by Episcopal Conferences in other countries . With such training , Christians will contribute significantly to resolving the problem of corruption , committing themselves to put into_practice the Church s social_doctrine in all matters affecting their_lives and in those areas where_they can be of help to others . The drug problem . With regard to the serious problem of the drug trade , the Church in America can cooperate effectively with national and business leaders , non governmental organizations and international agencies in developing projects aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- doing away with this trade which threatens the well_being of the peoples of America . This cooperation must be extended to legislative bodies , in support of initiatives to prevent the '' recycling of funds '' , foster control of the assets of those involved in this traffic , and ensure_that the production and marketing of the chemical substances from which drugs are obtained are carried_out according to the law . The urgency and the gravity of the problem make it imperative to call_upon the various sectors and groups within civil_society to be united in the fight against the drug trade . Specifically , as far as the Bishops are_concerned , it -isaia- necessary as the Synod Fathers suggested that they_themselves , as Pastors of the People of God , courageously and forcefully condemn the hedonism , materialism and life styles which easily lead to drug use . There -isaia-_also a need to help poor farmers from being tempted by the easy money gained from cultivating plants used for drug production . In this_regard international agencies can_make a valuable contribution to governments by providing incentives to encourage the production of alternative crops . Encouragement must_also be given to those involved in rehabilitating drug users and to those engaged in the pastoral_care of the victims of drug dependence . It -isaia- fundamentally important to offer the proper '' meaning of life '' to young_people who , when faced_with a lack of such meaning , not infrequently find_themselves caught in the destructive spiral of drugs . Experience shows_that this_work of recuperation and social rehabilitation can be an authentic commitment to evangelization . The arms race . One factor seriously paralyzing the progress of many nations in America -isaia- the arms race . The particular Churches in America must raise a prophetic voice to condemn the arms race and the scandalous arms trade , which consumes huge sums of money which_should instead be used to combat poverty and promote development . On the other_hand , the stockpiling of weapons -isaia- a cause of instability and a threat to peace . For this_reason_the Church remains vigilant in situations where these -isaia- a risk of armed conflict , even between sister nations . As a sign and instrument of reconciliation and peace , she must seek '' by every_means possible , including mediation and arbitration , to act in favor of peace and fraternity between peoples '' . The culture of death and a society dominated by the powerful . Nowadays , in America as elsewhere in the world , a model of society appears to be emerging in which_the powerful predominate , setting aside and even eliminating the powerless : I -amos- thinking here of unborn children , helpless victims of abortion ; the elderly and incurably ill , subjected -atti_degli_apostoli- times to euthanasia ; and the many_other people relegated to the margins of society by consumerism and materialism . Nor can I fail to mention the unnecessary recourse to the death penalty when other '' bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons . Today , given the means -atti_degli_apostoli- the State s disposal to deal_with crime and control those_who commit it , without abandoning all hope of their redemption , the cases where it -isaia- absolutely necessary to do away with an offender are_now very rare , even non existent practically '' . This model of society bears the stamp of the culture of death , and -isaia- therefore in opposition to the Gospel message . Faced with this distressing reality , the Church community intends to commit itself all the more to the defense of the culture of life . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers , echoing recent documents of the Church s Magisterium , forcefully restated their unconditional respect_for and total dedication to human_life from the moment of conception to that of natural death , and their condemnation of evils like abortion and euthanasia . If the teachings of the divine and natural_law are to be upheld , it -isaia- essential to promote knowledge of the Church s social_doctrine and to work so that the values of life and family are recognized and defended in social customs and in State ordinances . As well as protecting life , greater efforts should be made , through a variety of pastoral initiatives , to promote adoptions and to provide continuing assistance to women with problem pregnancies , both before and after_the birth of the child . Special pastoral attention must_also be given to women_who have undergone or actively procured an abortion . How can we fail to thank God and express genuine appreciation to our_brothers_and_sisters in the faith throughout America who_are committed , along_with other Christians and countless individuals of good_will , to defending life by every legal means and to protecting the unborn , the incurably ill and the handicapped ? Their work_-isaia- all the more praiseworthy if we consider_the indifference of so many_people , the threats posed by eugenics and the assaults on life and human_dignity perpetrated everywhere each_day . This same concern must be shown to the elderly , who are_often neglected and left to fend for themselves . They must be respected as persons ; it -isaia- important to care_for them and to help_them in ways which_will promote their_rights and ensure their greatest possible physical and spiritual well_being . The elderly must be protected from situations or pressures which_could drive them to suicide ; in particular they_must be helped nowadays to resist the temptation of assisted suicide and euthanasia . Together with the Pastors of the People of God in America , I appeal to '' Catholics working in the field of medicine and health_care , to those holding public office or engaged in teaching , to make every_effort to defend those lives most -atti_degli_apostoli- risk , and to act with a conscience correctly formed in accordance_with Catholic doctrine . Here Bishops and priests have a special responsibility to bear tireless witness to the Gospel of life and to exhort the faithful to act accordingly '' . At the same_time , it -isaia- essential for the Church in America to take appropriate measures to influence the deliberations of legislative assemblies , encouraging citizens , both Catholics and other people_of_good_will , to establish organizations to propose workable legislation and to resist measures which endanger the two inseparable realities of life and the family . Nowadays there_-isaia- a special need to pay attention to questions related to prenatal diagnosis , in order to avoid any violation of human_dignity . Discrimination against indigenous peoples and Americans of African descent . If the Church in America , in fidelity to the Gospel of Christ , intends to walk the path of solidarity , she must devote special_attention to those ethnic groups which even today experience discrimination . Every attempt to marginalize the indigenous peoples must be eliminated . This means , first of all , respecting their territories and the pacts made with_them ; likewise , efforts must be made to satisfy their legitimate social , health and cultural requirements . And how_can we overlook the need_for reconciliation between_the indigenous peoples and the societies in which_they_are living ? Here I would_like to mention that in some places Americans of African descent still suffer from ethnic prejudice , and this represents a serious obstacle to their encounter_with Christ . Since all people , whatever their race or condition , have_been created by God in his image , it -isaia- necessary to encourage concrete programs , in which common prayer must play a part , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- promoting understanding and reconciliation between different peoples . These can build bridges of Christian love , peace and justice between all men_and_women . In order to attain these goals it -isaia- essential to train competent pastoral workers capable of employing methods already legitimately '' inculturated '' in catechesis and the liturgy , avoiding a syncretism which_gives only a partial account of true Christian doctrine . Then too , it will be easier to provide a sufficient number of pastors to work with the native peoples if efforts are made to promote priestly and religious vocations within_the midst of these very people . The question of immigrants . In its history , America has experienced many immigrations , as waves of men_and_women came to its various regions in the hope of a better future . The phenomenon continues even today , especially with many_people and families from Latin American countries who_have moved to the northern parts of the continent , to the point where in some cases they constitute a substantial part of the population . They often bring with_them a cultural and religious heritage which_-isaia- rich in Christian elements . The Church -isaia- well_aware of the problems created by this situation and -isaia- committed to spare no effort in developing her_own pastoral strategy among_these immigrant people , in order to help_them settle in their new land and to foster a welcoming attitude among the local population , in the belief that a mutual openness will_bring enrichment to all . Church communities will not_fail to see in this phenomenon a specific call to live an evangelical fraternity and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a summons to strengthen their_own religious spirit with_a_view to a more penetrating evangelization . With this in mind , the Synod Fathers recalled that '' the Church in America must be a vigilant advocate , defending against any unjust restriction the natural right of individual persons to move freely within their_own nation and from one nation to another . Attention must be called to the rights of migrants and their_families and to respect_for their human_dignity , even in cases of non legal immigration '' . Migrants should be met with a hospitable and welcoming attitude which_can encourage them to become part of the Church s life , always with due regard_for their freedom and their_specific cultural identity . Cooperation between_the dioceses from which_they come and those in which_they settle , also through specific pastoral structures provided for in the legislation and praxis of the Church , has proved extremely beneficial to this_end . In this_way the most adequate and complete pastoral_care possible can be ensured . The Church in America must be constantly concerned to provide_for the effective evangelization of those recent arrivals who_do_not yet know Christ . CHAPTER VI THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH IN AMERICA TODAY : THE NEW EVANGELIZATION '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn : Sent by Christ . The Risen Christ , before his Ascension into_heaven , sent the Apostles to preach the Gospel to the whole_world cf . Mk : and conferred on them the powers needed to carry_out this_mission . It -isaia- significant that , before giving his final missionary mandate , Jesus should speak of the universal power he had received_from_the Father cf . In effect , Christ passed on to the Apostles the mission which_he_had received_from_the Father cf . Jn : , and in this_way gave them a share in his powers . Yet '' the lay_faithful too , precisely as members of the Church , have_the vocation and mission of proclaiming the Gospel : they_are prepared_for this_work by the sacraments of Christian initiation and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit '' . They have_been '' in their_own way made sharers in the priestly , prophetic and kingly functions of Christ '' . Consequently , '' the lay_faithful , in virtue of their participation in the prophetic mission of Christ , are fully part of this_work of the Church '' and so should feel called and encouraged to proclaim_the Good News of the Kingdom . Jesus words : '' You too , go into the vineyard '' Mt : , must be seen as addressed not_only to the Apostles but to all who desire to be authentic disciples of the Lord . The basic task for_which Jesus sends out his_disciples -isaia- the proclamation of the Good News , that_-isaia- , evangelization cf . Consequently , '' to evangelize -isaia- the grace and vocation proper to the Church , her most profound identity '' . As I have_said on other occasions , the new and unique situation in which_the world and the Church find_themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of the Third Millennium , and the urgent needs which result , mean_that the mission of evangelization today calls for a new program which_can be defined overall as a '' new_evangelization '' . As the Church s Supreme Pastor , I urgently desire to encourage all the members of God s People , particularly those living in America where I first appealed for a commitment '' new in its ardor , methods and expression '' to take up this project and to cooperate in carrying it out . In accepting this_mission , everyone should keep in mind_that the vital core of the new_evangelization must be a clear and unequivocal proclamation of the person of Jesus Christ , that_-isaia- , the preaching of his_name , his_teaching , his_life , his promises and the Kingdom which_he_has gained for us by his Paschal Mystery . Jesus Christ , the '' good_news '' and the prime evangelizer . Jesus Christ -isaia- the '' good_news '' of salvation made_known to people yesterday , today and for ever ; but he -isaia-_also the first and greatest evangelizer . The Church must make_the crucified and risen Christ the center of her pastoral concern and her evangelizing activity . '' Everything planned in the Church must_have Christ and his Gospel as its starting point '' . Therefore , '' the Church in America must speak increasingly of Jesus Christ , the human face of God and the divine face of man . It -isaia- this proclamation that truly makes an impact on people , awakens and transforms hearts , in a word , converts . Christ must be proclaimed with_joy and conviction , but_above all by the witness of each_one s life '' . Individual Christians will_be_able to carry_out_their mission effectively to the extent_that they_make the life of the Son of God made man the perfect model for their_work of spreading the Gospel . The simplicity of his manner and his choices must be normative for everyone in the work_of_evangelization . In this perspective , the poor will certainly be considered among the first to be evangelized , following_the_example of Christ , who said of himself : '' The Spirit of the Lord . has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor '' Lk : . As I have_already noted , love for the poor must be preferential , but_not exclusive . The Synod Fathers observed that_it_was in part because of an approach to the pastoral_care of the poor marked by a certain exclusiveness that the pastoral_care for the leading sectors of society has_been neglected and many_people have thus been estranged from the Church . The damage done by the spread of secularism in these sectors political or economic , union related , military , social or cultural shows how urgent it -isaia- that_they be evangelized , with the encouragement and guidance of the Church s Pastors , who are_called by God to care_for everyone . They will_be_able to count on the help of those_who fortunately still numerous have remained faithful to Christian values . In this_regard the Synod Fathers have recognized '' the commitment of many leaders to building a just and fraternal society '' . With their support , Pastors will face the not easy task of evangelizing these sectors of society . With renewed fervor and updated methods , they_will announce Christ to leaders , men_and_women alike , insisting especially on the formation of consciences on the basis of the Church s social_doctrine . This formation will act as the best antidote to the not infrequent cases of inconsistency and even corruption marking socio political structures . Conversely , if this evangelization of the leadership sector -isaia- neglected , it should_not come as a surprise that_many who_are a part of it will be guided by criteria alien to the Gospel and -atti_degli_apostoli- times openly contrary to it . The encounter_with Christ spurs evangelization . An encounter_with_the Lord brings about a profound transformation in all who_do_not close themselves off from him . The first impulse coming from this transformation -isaia- to communicate to others the richness discovered in the experience of the encounter . This does_not_mean simply teaching what_we_have come to know but_also , like the Samaritan woman , enabling others to encounter Jesus personally : '' Come and see '' Jn : . The result will be the same as that_which took_place in the heart of the Samaritans , who said to the woman : '' It -isaia-_no_longer because of your words that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves , and we know that_this_-isaia- indeed the Savior of the world '' Jn : . The Church , which draws her_life from the permanent and mysterious presence of her Risen Lord , has as the core of her_mission a duty '' to lead all people to encounter Christ '' . She -isaia- called to proclaim that Christ -isaia- indeed the Living One , the Son of God , who became man , died and rose again . He alone_-isaia- the Savior of every_person and of the whole person ; as the Lord of history , he -isaia- constantly -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church and in the world through_his Spirit , until the end of time . This presence of the Risen One in the Church makes it possible_for us to encounter him , thanks to the invisible working of his life_giving Spirit . This encounter takes_place in the faith received_from and lived in the Church , the Mystical Body of Christ . The encounter_with Christ then has an essentially ecclesial dimension , and it leads to a life commitment . Indeed , '' to encounter the living Christ means to accept the love by which he loves us first , to choose him , to adhere freely to his person and his plan , which consists in proclaiming and in bringing_about the Kingdom of God '' . The calling gives_rise to a search_for Jesus : '' Rabbi which means Teacher , where are you staying . He said to them : Come and see . They came and saw where he was staying ; and they stayed that day with_him '' Jn : . This '' staying '' -isaia- not limited to the day of one s call , but_rather extends to the whole of life . To follow Jesus involves living as he lived , accepting his message , adopting his way of thinking , embracing his destiny and sharing his project , which_-isaia- the plan of the Father : it involves inviting everyone to communion with the Trinity and to communion among ourselves in a just and fraternal society '' . The burning desire to invite others to encounter the One whom we have encountered -isaia- the start of the evangelizing mission to which_the whole Church -isaia- called . This mission has become particularly urgent today in America , five hundred years after_the first evangelization , as we prepare to commemorate with gratitude the two thousandth anniversary of the coming of the only_begotten Son of God into_the_world . The importance of catechesis . The new_evangelization in which_the whole continent -isaia- engaged means_that faith cannot be taken for granted , but must be explicitly proposed in all its breadth and richness . This -isaia- the principal objective of catechesis , which , by its_very nature , -isaia- an essential aspect of the new_evangelization . '' Catechesis -isaia- a process of formation in faith , hope and charity ; it shapes the mind and touches the heart , leading the person to embrace Christ fully and completely . It introduces the believer more_fully into the experience of the Christian life_,_which involves the liturgical celebration of the mystery of the Redemption and the Christian service of others '' . Well realizing the need_for a complete catechesis , I made my own the proposal of the Fathers of the Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops to compose '' a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith_and_morals '' , which_could serve as '' a point of reference for the catechisms or compendia that_are prepared in the various regions '' . This proposal was implemented with the publication of the typical edition of the Catechismus Catholicae Ecclesiae . In addition to the text of the Catechism , and for a better utilization of its contents , I intended that a General Directory for Catechesis should_also be compiled and published . I heartily recommend the use of these_two resources , of universal value , to everyone involved in catechesis in America . It -isaia- to be hoped that both documents will be employed '' in the preparation and the evaluation of all parochial and diocesan programs of catechesis , bearing in mind_that the religious situation of young_people and adults calls for a catechesis which_-isaia- more kerygmatic and more organic in its presentation of the contents of the faith '' . It -isaia- necessary to acknowledge and encourage the outstanding work done by so many catechists throughout America as authentic messengers of the kingdom : '' Their faith and their witness of life are an integral part of catechesis '' . I wish all the more to encourage the faithful to take up , with commitment and love of the Lord , this service to the Church , generously offering their time and their talents . Bishops for their_part should be concerned that catechists receive appropriate formation to enable them to carry_out this_task , so indispensable in the life of the Church . In catechesis it will be useful to keep in mind , especially on a continent like America where_the social_question takes on such importance , that '' growth in the understanding of the faith and its practical expression in social_life are intimately connected . Efforts made to favor an encounter_with Christ cannot_fail to have a positive repercussion in the promotion of the common_good in a just society '' . The evangelization of culture . My Predecessor Paul VI widely remarked that '' the split between_the Gospel and culture -isaia- undoubtedly the drama of our_time '' . Hence the Synod Fathers rightly felt that '' the new_evangelization calls for a clearly conceived , serious and well organized effort to evangelize culture '' . The Son of God , by taking upon himself our human_nature , became incarnate within a particular people , even_though his redemptive death brought salvation to all people , of every culture , race and condition . The gift of his Spirit and his_love are meant for each_and_every people and culture , in order to bring them all into unity after_the example of the perfect unity existing in the Triune God . For this to happen , it -isaia- necessary to inculturate preaching in such_a_way_that the Gospel -isaia- proclaimed in the language and in the culture of its hearers . At the same_time , however , it must_not be forgotten that the Paschal Mystery of Christ , the supreme manifestation of the infinite God within_the finitude of history , -isaia-_the_only valid point of reference for all of humanity on its pilgrimage in search of authentic unity and true peace . In America , the mestiza face of the Virgin of Guadalupe was from the start a symbol of the inculturation of the Gospel , of which_she has been_the lodestar and the guide . Through her powerful intercession , the Gospel will penetrate the hearts of the men_and_women of America and permeate their cultures , transforming them_from within . Evangelizing centers of education . Education can play an outstanding role in promoting the inculturation of the Gospel . Nonetheless , Catholic centers of education , and those_which , although non denominational , are clearly inspired by Catholic principles , will_be_able to engage in authentic evangelization only if -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels including that of the university they clearly preserve their Catholic orientation . The content of the education they impart should make constant reference to Jesus Christ and his message as the Church presents it in her dogmatic and moral teaching . Only in this_way will they train truly Christian leaders in the different spheres of human activity , and in society , especially in politics , economics , science , art and philosophical reflection . Hence , '' it -isaia- essential that the Catholic university be truly both things -atti_degli_apostoli- once : a university and Catholic . Its Catholic character -isaia- an essential element of the university as an institution , and therefore does_not depend simply on the decision of the individuals who govern_the university -atti_degli_apostoli- any particular time '' . Pastoral work in Catholic universities will therefore be given special_attention : it must encourage a commitment to the apostolate on the part of the students themselves , so that_they_can become the evangelizers of the university world . In addition , '' cooperation between Catholic universities throughout America needs to be encouraged , for their mutual enrichment '' ; this_will help put into_effect , -atti_degli_apostoli- the university level too , the principle of solidarity and interchange between_the peoples of the whole continent . Something similar must_also be said about Catholic schools , particularly with_regard to secondary education : '' A special effort should be made to strengthen the Catholic identity of schools , whose specific character -isaia- based on an educational vision having its origin in the person of Christ and its roots in the teachings of the Gospel . Catholic schools must seek not_only to impart a quality education from the technical and professional standpoint , but_also and above all provide_for the integral formation of the human_person . Given the importance of the work done by Catholic educators , I join the Synod Fathers in gratefully encouraging all those devoted to teaching in Catholic schools priests , consecrated men_and_women and committed lay_people '' to persevere in their most important mission '' . The influence of these educational centers should extend to all sectors of society , without distinction or exclusion . It -isaia- essential that_every possible effort be made to ensure_that Catholic schools , despite financial difficulties , continue to provide '' a Catholic education to the poor and the marginalized in society '' . It will_never be possible to free the needy from their poverty unless they_are first freed from the impoverishment arising from the lack of adequate education . In the overall work of the new_evangelization , the educational sector occupies a place of honor . For this_reason , the activity of all Catholic teachers , including those working in non denominational schools , should be encouraged . I also make an urgent appeal to men_and_women_religious not to abandon this_field which_-isaia- so important_for the new_evangelization . As a fruit and an expression of the communion existing between all the particular Churches of America , certainly strengthened by the spiritual experience of the Synodal Assembly , an effort must be made to promote gatherings of Catholic educators -atti_degli_apostoli- the national and continental levels , in an attempt to coordinate and expand the educational apostolate in every context . To carry_out these tasks , the Church in America requires a degree of freedom in the field of education ; this_-isaia-_not to be seen as a privilege but as a right , in virtue of the evangelizing mission entrusted to the Church by the Lord . Furthermore , parents have a fundamental and primary right to make decisions about the education of their_children ; consequently , Catholic parents must be able to choose an education in harmony_with their religious convictions . The function of the State in this area -isaia- subsidiary ; the State has the duty '' to ensure_that education -isaia- available to all and to respect and defend freedom of instruction . A State monopoly in this area must be condemned as a form of totalitarianism which violates the fundamental rights which it ought to defend , especially_the right of parents to provide religious education for their_children . The family_-isaia- the place_where the education of the person primarily takes_place '' . Evangelization through the media . For the new_evangelization to be effective , it -isaia- essential to have a deep understanding of the culture of our_time in which_the social_communications media are_most influential . Therefore , knowledge and use of the media , whether the more traditional forms or those_which technology has produced in recent_times , -isaia- indispensable . Contemporary reality demands a capacity to learn the language , nature and characteristics of mass_media . Using the media correctly and competently can lead to a genuine inculturation of the Gospel . At the same_time , the media also help to shape the culture and mentality of people today , which_-isaia- why there_must be special pastoral_activity aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- those working in the media . On this_point , the Synod Fathers suggested a range of concrete initiatives to make_the Gospel effectively present in the world of social_communications : the training of pastoral workers for this_task ; the support of high quality production centers ; the careful and effective use of satellite and other new technologies ; teaching the faithful to be '' critical '' in their use of the media ; joining forces in order to acquire and manage new transmitters and TV and radio networks , as well as coordinating those already in operation . Catholic publications also deserve support and need to develop the excellence sought by all . Business people should be encouraged to provide economic support for quality products promoting human and Christian values . But a program as vast as this_-isaia- far beyond_the resources of the individual particular Churches of the American continent . Therefore , the Synod Fathers proposed an inter American coordination of current activities in the field of social_communications , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- fostering mutual awareness and coordination of current projects in the field . The challenge of the sects . The proselytizing activity of the sects and new religious groups in many_parts of America -isaia- a grave hindrance to the work_of_evangelization . The word '' proselytism '' has a negative meaning when it indicates a way of winning followers which_does_not respect the freedom of those_to_whom a specific kind of religious propaganda -isaia-_directed . The Catholic Church in America -isaia- critical of proselytism by the sects and , for this_reason , rejects methods of this_kind in her_own evangelizing work . Presenting the Gospel of Christ in its entirety , the work_of_evangelization must respect the inner sanctuary of every_individual s conscience , where_the decisive and absolutely personal dialogue_between grace and human_freedom unfolds . This must be borne in mind especially with_regard to the sisters and brothers of the Churches and Ecclesial Communities separated_from the Catholic Church , long established in some regions . The bonds of true though imperfect communion_which , according to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , these communities already have with the Catholic Church must enlighten the attitudes of the Church and her members towards them . These attitudes , however , must_not be such that_they weaken the firm conviction_that only in the Catholic Church -isaia- found the fullness of the means of salvation established by Jesus Christ . The success of proselytism by sects and new religious groups in America cannot be ignored . It demands of the Church on the continent a thorough study , to be carried_out in each nation and -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level , to ascertain why many Catholics leave the Church . Pastoral policies will_have to be revised , so that_each particular Church can_offer the faithful more personalized religious care , strengthen the structures of communion and mission , make_the most of the evangelizing possibilities of a purified popular religiosity , and thus give new_life to every Catholic s faith in Jesus Christ , through prayer and meditation upon the word of God , suitably explained . No one_can deny the urgency of prompt evangelizing efforts aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- those segments of the People of God most exposed to proselytism by the sects : immigrants , neighborhoods on the outskirts of the cities or rural towns with no regular presence of a priest and therefore marked by widespread religious ignorance , families of simple people suffering from material difficulties of various kinds . From this point_of_view too , base communities , movements , family groups and other_forms of association in which_it_-isaia- easier to build interpersonal bonds of mutual support , both spiritual and economic , have shown themselves to be very helpful . Moreover , as some of the Synod Fathers indicated , it -isaia- necessary to ask whether a pastoral strategy directed almost exclusively to meeting people s material needs has not in the end left their hunger for God unsatisfied , making them vulnerable to anything which claims to be of spiritual benefit . Hence , '' it -isaia- indispensable that all remain united to Christ by means of a joyful and transforming kerygma , especially in liturgical preaching '' . A Church which fervently lives the spiritual and contemplative dimension , and which_gives herself generously to the service of charity , will be an ever_more eloquent witness to God for men_and_women searching for meaning in their_lives . To this_end , it -isaia- more necessary than_ever for all the faithful to move from a faith of habit , sustained perhaps by social context alone , to a faith which_-isaia- conscious and personally lived . The renewal of faith will_always be the best way to lead others to the Truth that_-isaia- Christ . For the response to the challenge of the sects to be effective , there_-isaia-_a_need for an appropriate coordination of initiatives among dioceses , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- bringing_about a more_effective cooperation through shared projects which_will produce better results . The mission ad gentes . Jesus Christ entrusted to his Church the mission of evangelizing all nations : '' Go therefore and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt : . There must_always be a dynamic awareness of the universality of the evangelizing mission which_the Church has_received , as there_has been consistently throughout_the history of the pilgrim People of God in America . Evangelization -isaia- most urgent among_those on this continent who_do_not yet know_the name of Jesus , the only name given to men_and_women that_they_may be saved cf . Unfortunately , the name of Jesus -isaia- unknown to a vast part of humanity and in many sectors of American society . It -isaia- enough to think of the indigenous peoples not_yet Christianized or of the presence of non Christian religions such as Islam , Buddhism or Hinduism , especially among immigrants from Asia . This obliges the Church in America to be involved in the mission ad gentes . The program of a new_evangelization on the American continent , to which many pastoral projects are directed , cannot be restricted to revitalizing the faith of regular believers , but must strive as well to proclaim Christ where he -isaia- not known . Likewise , the particular Churches in America are_called to extend their missionary efforts beyond_the bounds of the continent . They cannot keep for themselves the immense riches of their Christian heritage . They must_take this heritage to the whole_world and share it with_those_who do not_yet know it . Here it -isaia-_a_question of many millions of men_and_women_who , without faith , suffer the most serious kind of poverty . Faced with this poverty , it would be a mistake not to encourage an evangelizing effort beyond_the continent with the excuse that_there_-isaia- still much to do in America or to wait until the Church in America reaches the point , basically utopian , of full maturity . With the hope_that the American continent , in accordance_with its Christian vitality , will play its part in the great task of the mission ad gentes , I make my own the practical proposals presented by the Synod Fathers : '' to maintain a greater cooperation between sister Churches ; to send missionaries priests , religious and lay_faithful within_the continent and abroad ; to strengthen or create missionary institutes ; to encourage the missionary dimension of consecrated and contemplative life ; to give greater impetus to mission promotion , training and organization '' . I -amos- sure_that the pastoral zeal of the Bishops and of the sons_and_daughters of the Church throughout America will devise concrete plans , also -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level , to implement with_great dynamism and creativity these missionary proposals . CONCLUSION With hope and gratitude . '' I -amos- with you always , to the end of the age '' Mt : . Trusting in this promise of the Lord , the pilgrim Church in America prepares enthusiastically to meet_the challenges of today_s_world and those_that will come in the future . In the Gospel , the Good News of the Resurrection of the Lord -isaia- accompanied by the invitation to fear not cf . The Church in America wishes to walk in hope , as the Synod Fathers declared : '' With serene trust in the Lord of history , the Church prepares to cross the threshold of the Third Millennium freed from prejudice , hesitation , selfishness , fear or doubt , and convinced of the fundamental and primary service which_she must provide as a testimony to her fidelity to God and to the men_and_women of the continent '' . Furthermore , the Church in America feels especially impelled to walk in faith , responding with gratitude to the love of Jesus , '' the merciful love of God made_flesh cf . The celebration of the beginning of the Third Christian Millennium can be the right moment for the People of God in America to renew '' their thanks for the great gift of faith '' , which_they first received five centuries ago . The year , beyond its historical and political meaning , was_the great year of grace when America welcomed the faith : a faith_which proclaims_the supreme gift of the Incarnation of the Son of God two thousand years_ago , and which we will solemnly commemorate in the Great Jubilee now so close . This twofold sense of hope and gratitude must accompany every pastoral action of the Church on the continent , permeating with the spirit of the Jubilee the various initiatives in the dioceses , parishes , religious communities , ecclesial movements , and the activities which_will be organized -atti_degli_apostoli- both regional and continental levels . Prayer to Jesus Christ for the families of America . I therefore invite all the Catholics of America to take an active part in the evangelizing initiatives which_the Holy Spirit -isaia- stirring in every_part of this immense continent , so full of resources and hopes for the future . In a special_way , I invite Catholic families to be '' domestic Churches '' , in which_the Christian faith_-isaia- lived and passed on to the young as a treasure , and where all pray together . If they live up to the ideal which God places before them , Catholic homes will be true centers of evangelization . In concluding this Apostolic Exhortation , in which I have_taken up the proposals of the Synod Fathers , I gladly welcome their suggestion to compose a prayer_for the families of America . I invite individuals , communities and ecclesial groups , wherever two or more gather in the Lord s name , to strengthen through prayer the spiritual bond_between all American Catholics . Let everyone join in the prayer of the Successor of Peter , invoking Christ who_-isaia- '' the way of conversion , communion and solidarity in America '' : W e thank you , Lord Jesus , because the Gospel of the Father s love , with_which you came to save the world , has_been proclaimed far and wide in America as a gift of the Holy Spirit that fills us with gladness . We thank you for the gift of your Life , which_you have_given us by loving us to the end : your Life makes us children of God , brothers_and_sisters to each_other . Increase , O Lord , our_faith and our love for you , present in all the tabernacles of the continent . Grant us to be faithful witnesses to your Resurrection for the younger generation of Americans , so that , in knowing you , they_may follow you and find in you their peace and joy . Only then will they know that_they_are brothers_and_sisters of all God s children scattered \u00f9throughout the world . You who , in becoming man , chose to belong to a human_family , teach families the virtues which filled_with light the family home of Nazareth . May families always be united , as you and the Father are_one , and may_they be living witnesses to love , justice and solidarity ; make_them schools of respect , forgiveness and mutual help , so that_the_world may believe ; help_them to be the source of vocations to the priesthood and the consecrated_life , and all the other_forms of firm Christian commitment . Protect your Church and the Successor of Peter , to whom_you , Good Shepherd , have entrusted the task of feeding your flock . Grant that the Church in America may flourish and grow richer in the fruits of holiness . Teach us to love your Mother , Mary , as you loved her . Give us strength to proclaim your word with courage in the work of the new_evangelization , so that_the_world may know new hope . Our Lady of Guadalupe , Mother of America , pray_for us ! Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Mexico City , January , in the year , the twenty first of my Pontificate .

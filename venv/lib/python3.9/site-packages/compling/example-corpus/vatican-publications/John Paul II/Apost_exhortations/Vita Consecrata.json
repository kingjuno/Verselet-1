The Consecrated Life , deeply rooted in the example and teaching of Christ the Lord , -isaia-_a_gift of God the Father to his Church through the Holy Spirit . By the profession of the evangelical_counsels the characteristic features of Jesus the chaste , poor and obedient one are made constantly '' visible '' in the midst of the world and the eyes of the faithful_are directed towards_the mystery of the Kingdom of God already -atti_degli_apostoli- work in history , even as it awaits its_full realization in heaven . In every_age there have_been men_and_women_who , obedient to the Father s call and to the prompting of the Spirit , have chosen this special_way of following Christ , in order to devote_themselves to him_with an '' undivided '' heart cf . Like the Apostles , they too have left everything behind in order to be with Christ and to put themselves , as he did , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of God and their brothers_and_sisters . In this_way , through the many charisms of spiritual and apostolic_life bestowed on them by the Holy Spirit , they_have helped to make_the mystery and mission of the Church shine_forth , and in doing so have contributed to the renewal of society . Thanksgiving for the consecrated_life . Because the role of consecrated_life in the Church -isaia- so important , I decided to convene a Synod in order to examine in depth its significance and its future prospects , especially in view of the approaching new millennium . It was my wish_that the Synodal Assembly should include , together_with_the Bishops , a considerable number of consecrated men_and_women , in order_that they too might contribute to the common reflection . We are all aware of the treasure which_the gift of the consecrated_life in the variety of its charisms and institutions represents for the ecclesial_community . Together let us thank God for the Religious Orders and Institutes devoted to contemplation or the works of the apostolate , for Societies of Apostolic Life , for Secular Institutes and for other groups of consecrated_persons , as well as for all those individuals who , in their inmost hearts , dedicate themselves to God by a special consecration . The Synod was a tangible sign of the universal extension of the consecrated_life , present in the local Churches throughout_the_world . The consecrated_life inspires and accompanies the spread of evangelization in the different parts_of_the_world , where Institutes from abroad are gratefully welcomed and new ones are_being founded , in a great variety of forms and expressions . Consequently , although in some parts_of_the_world Institutes of Consecrated Life seem to be experiencing a period of difficulty , in other places they_are prospering with remarkable vitality . This shows_that the choice of total self_giving to God in Christ -isaia- in no way incompatible with any human culture or historical situation . Nor -isaia- the consecrated_life flourishing within_the Catholic Church alone . In fact , it -isaia- particularly vibrant in the monasticism of the Orthodox Churches , where it -isaia- an essential feature of their_life . It -isaia-_also taking root or re emerging in the Churches and Ecclesial Communities which originated in the Reformation , and -isaia- the sign of a grace shared by all of Christ s disciples . This fact -isaia- an incentive to ecumenism , which fosters the desire_for an ever fuller communion_between Christians , '' that_the_world may believe '' Jn : . The consecrated_life : a gift to the Church . Its universal presence and the evangelical nature of its witness are clear evidence if any were needed that the consecrated_life -isaia- not something isolated and marginal , but a reality which affects the whole Church . The Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod frequently reaffirmed this : '' de re nostra agitur '' , '' this_-isaia- something which concerns us all '' . In effect , the consecrated_life -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of the Church as a decisive element for her_mission , since it '' manifests the inner nature of the Christian calling '' and the striving of the whole Church as Bride towards union with_her one Spouse . At the Synod it was stated on several occasions that the consecrated_life has not_only proved a help and support for the Church in the past , but -isaia-_also a precious and necessary gift for the present and future of the People of God , since_it_-isaia- an intimate part of her_life , her holiness and her_mission . The present difficulties which a number of Institutes are encountering in some parts_of_the_world must_not lead to a questioning of the fact_that the profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- an integral part of the Church s life and a muchneeded incentive towards ever_greater fidelity to the Gospel . The consecrated_life may experience further changes in its historical forms , but there_will be no change in the substance of a choice which finds expression in a radical gift_of_self for love of the Lord Jesus and , in him , of every member of the human_family . This certainty , which_has inspired countless individuals in the course of the centuries , continues to reassure the Christian people , for they know that_they_can draw from the contribution of these generous souls powerful support on their journey towards_the heavenly home . Gathering the fruits of the Synod . In response to the desire expressed by the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops which met to discuss the theme '' The Consecrated Life and its Mission in the Church and in the World '' , I intend to set_forth in this Apostolic Exhortation the results of the Synod processand to point_out to all the faithful Bishops , priests , deacons , consecrated_persons and laity , and to any others_who might be interested the wondrous things_which today too the Lord wishes to accomplish through the consecrated_life . This Synod , coming after_the ones dedicated to the lay_faithful and to priests , completes the treatment of the distinctive features of the states of life willed by the Lord Jesus for his Church . Whereas the Second Vatican Council emphasized the profound reality of ecclesial_communion , in which all gifts converge for the building up of the Body of Christ and for the Church s mission in the world , in recent_years there_has been felt the need to clarify the specific identity of the various states of life , their_vocation and their particular mission in the Church . Communion in the Church -isaia- not uniformity , but a gift of the Spirit who_-isaia- present in the variety of charisms and states of life . These will be all the more helpful to the Church and her_mission the more their_specific identity -isaia- respected . For every gift of the Spirit -isaia- granted in order to bear_fruit for the Lordin the growth of fraternity and mission . The work of the Spirit in the various_forms of the consecrated_life . How can we not recall with gratitude to the Spirit the many different_forms of consecrated_life which_he_has raised up throughout history and which still exist in the Church today ? They can be compared to a plant with many brancheswhich sinks its roots into the Gospel and brings forth abundant fruit in every season of the Church s life . What an extraordinary richness ! I myself , -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of the Synod , felt the need to stress this permanent element in the history of the Church : the host of founders and foundresses , of holy men_and_women_who chose Christ by radically following the Gospel and by serving their brothers_and_sisters , especially_the poor and the outcast . Such service -isaia- itself a sign of how the consecrated_life manifests the organic unity of the commandment of love , in the inseparable link between love of God and love of neighbour . The Synod recalled this unceasing work of the Holy Spirit , who in every_age shows forth the richness of the practice of the evangelical_counsels through a multiplicity of charisms . In this_way too he makes ever present in the Church and in the world , in time and space , the mystery of Christ . Monastic life in the East and the West . The Synod Fathers from the Eastern Catholic Churches and the representatives of the other Churches of the East emphasized the evangelical values of monastic life_,_which appeared -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of Christianity and which still flourishes in their territories , especially in the Orthodox Churches . From the first centuries of the Church , men_and_women have felt called to imitate the Incarnate Word who took on the condition of a servant . They have sought to follow_him by living in a particularly radical way , through monastic profession , the demands flowing from baptismal participation in the Paschal Mystery of his Death and Resurrection . In this_way , by becoming bearers of the Cross staurophoroi , they_have striven to become bearers of the Spirit pneumatophoroi , authentically spiritual men_and_women , capable of endowing history with hidden fruitfulness by unceasing praise and intercession , by spiritual counsels and works of charity . In its desire to transfigure the world and life_itself in expectation of the definitive vision of God s countenance , Eastern monasticism gives pride of place to conversion , self renunciation and compunction of heart , the quest for hesychia or interior peace , ceaseless prayer , fasting and vigils , spiritual combat and silence , Paschal joy in the presence of the Lord and the expectation of his definitive coming , and the oblation of self and personal possessions , lived in the holy communion of the monastery or in the solitude of the hermitage . he West too from the first centuries of the Church has practised the monastic life and has experienced a great variety of expressions of it , both cenobitic and eremetical . In its present form , inspired above all by Saint Benedict , Western monasticism -isaia- the heir of the great number of men_and_women_who , leaving behind life in the world , sought God and dedicated themselves to him , '' preferring nothing to the love of Christ '' . The monks of today likewise strive to create a harmonious balance between_the interior life and work in the evangelical commitment to conversion of life , obedience and stability , and in persevering dedication to meditation on God s word lectio divina , the celebration of the Liturgy and prayer . In the heart of the Church and the world , monasteries have_been and continue to be eloquent signs of communion , welcoming abodes for those seeking God and the things of the spirit , schools of faith and true places of study , dialogue and culture for the building up of the life of the Church and of the earthly city itself , in expectation of the heavenly city . The Order of Virgins ; hermits and widows . It -isaia- a source of joy and hope to witness in our_time a new flowering of the ancient Order of Virgins , known in Christian communities ever since apostolic times . Consecrated by the diocesan Bishop , these women acquire a particular link with the Church , which_they_are commited to serve while remaining in the world . Either alone or in association with_others , they constitute a special eschatological image of the Heavenly Bride and of the life to come , when_the Church will -atti_degli_apostoli- last fully live her love for Christ the Bridegroom . Men and women hermits , belonging to ancient Orders or new Institutes , or being directly dependent on the Bishop , bear_witness to the passing nature of the present age by their inward and outward separation from the world . By fasting and penance , they show that_man does_not live by bread alone but by the word of God cf . Such a life '' in the desert '' -isaia- an invitation to their contemporaries and to the ecclesial_community itself never to lose sight of the supreme vocation , which_-isaia- to be always with the Lord . Again being practised today -isaia- the consecration of widows , known since apostolic times cf . Tim : , ; Cor : , as well as the consecration of widowers . These women and men , through a vow of perpetual chastity as a sign of the Kingdom of God , consecrate their state of life in order to devote_themselves to prayer and the service of the Church . Institutes completely devoted to contemplation . Institutes completely devoted to contemplation , composed of either women or men , are for the Church a reason_for pride and a source of heavenly graces . By their_lives and mission , the members of these Institutes imitate Christ in his prayer on the mountain , bear_witness to God s lordship over history and anticipate the glory which_-isaia- to come . In solitude and silence , by listening to the word of God , participating in divine_worship , personal asceticism , prayer , mortification and the communion of fraternal love , they direct the whole of their_lives and all their activities to the contemplation of God . In this_way they offer the ecclesial_community a singular testimony of the Church s love for_her Lord , and they contribute , with hidden apostolic fruitfulness , to the growth of the People of God . hus there_-isaia- good_reason to hope_that the different_forms of contemplative life will experience continued growth in the younger Churches as an evident sign that the Gospel has_taken firm root , especially in those areas of the world where other_religions predominate . This will_make it possible to bear_witness to the vitality of the traditions of Christian asceticism and mysticism and will contribute to interreligious dialogue . Apostolic religious_life . The West has_also known , down_the_centuries , a variety of other expressions of religious_life , in which countless persons , renouncing the world , have consecrated themselves to God through the public profession of the evangelical_counsels in accordance_with a specific charism and in a stable form of common life , for the sake of carrying_out different_forms of apostolic service to the People of God . Thus there arose the different families of Canons Regular , the Mendicant Orders , the Clerics Regular and in general the Religious Congregations of men_and_women devoted to apostolic and missionary_activity and to the many_different works inspired by Christian charity . This -isaia- a splendid and varied testimony , reflecting the multiplicity of gifts bestowed by God on founders and foundresses who , in openness to the working of the Holy Spirit , successfully interpreted the signs of the times and responded wisely to new needs . Following in their footsteps , many_other people_have sought by word and deed to embody the Gospel in their_own lives , bringing anew to their_own times the living presence of Jesus , the Consecrated One par excellence , the One sent by the Father . In every_age consecrated men_and_women must continue to be images of Christ the Lord , fostering through prayer a profound communion of mind with_him cf . Phil : , so that_their whole lives may be penetrated by an apostolic spirit and their apostolic work with contemplation . The Holy Spirit , who wondrously fashions the variety of charisms , has_given rise in our_time to new expressions of consecrated_life , which appear as a providential response to the new needs encountered by the Church today as she carries out her_mission in the world . One thinks in the first_place of members of Secular Institutes seeking to live out_their consecration to God in the world through the profession of the evangelical_counsels in the midst of temporal realities ; they wish in this_way to be a leaven of wisdom and a witness of grace within cultural , economic and political_life . Through their_own specific blending of presence in the world and consecration , they seek to make present in society the newness and power of Christ s Kingdom , striving to transfigure the world from within by the power of the Beatitudes . In this_way , while they belong completely to God and are thus fully consecrated to his service , their activity in the ordinary life of the world contributes , by the power of the Spirit , to shedding the light of the Gospel on temporal realities . Secular Institutes , each in accordance_with its specific nature , thus help to ensure_that the Church has an effective presence in society . valuable role -isaia-_also played by Clerical Secular Institutes , in which priests_who belong to the diocesan clergy , even_when some of them are recognized as being incardinated in the Institute , consecrate themselves to Christ through the practice of the evangelical_counsels in accordance_with a specific charism . They discover in the spiritual riches of the Institute to which_they belong great help for living more_deeply the spirituality proper to the priesthood and thus they_are enabled to be a leaven of communion and apostolic generosity among their fellow clergy . Societies of Apostolic Life . Also worthy of special mention are Societies of Apostolic Life or of common life , composed of men or women . These pursue , each in its_own particular_way , a specific apostolic or missionary end . In many of them an explicit commitment to the evangelical_counsels -isaia- made through sacred bonds officially recognized by the Church . Even in this case , however , the specific nature of their consecration distinguishes them_from Religious Institutes and Secular Institutes . The specific identity of this form of life_-isaia- to be preserved and promoted ; in recent centuries it has produced many fruits of holiness and of the apostolate , especially in the field of charity and in the spread of the Gospel in the Missions . New expressions of consecrated_life . The perennial youth of the Church continues to be evident even today . In recent_years , following the Second Vatican Council , new or renewed forms of the consecrated_life have arisen . In many cases , these_are Institutes similar to those already existing , but inspired by new spiritual and apostolic impulses . Their vitality must be judged by the authority of the Church , which_has the responsibility of examining them in order to discern the authenticity of the purpose for their foundation and to prevent the proliferation of institutions similar to one_another , with the consequent risk of a harmful fragmentation into excessively small groups . In other cases it -isaia-_a_question of new experiments which_are seeking an identity of their_own in the Church and awaiting official recognition from the Apostolic See , which alone has final judgment in these_matters . These new_forms of consecrated_life now taking their place alongside the older ones bear_witness to the constant attraction which_the total gift_of_self to the Lord , the ideal of the apostolic community and the founding charisms continue to exert , even on the present generation . They also show how the gifts of the Holy Spirit complement one_another . In this newness however the Spirit does_not contradict himself . Proof of this_-isaia- the fact_that the new_forms of consecrated_life have_not supplanted the earlier ones . Amid such wide variety the underlying unity has_been successfully preserved , thanks to the one call to follow Jesus chaste , poor and obedient in the pursuit of perfect charity . This call , which_-isaia- found in all the existing forms of consecrated_life , must_also mark those_which present themselves as new . Purpose of the Apostolic Exhortation . Gathering together the fruits of the Synod s labours , in this Apostolic Exhortation I wish to address the whole Church in order to offer not_only to consecrated_persons but_also to the Bishops and the faithful the results of a stimulating exchange , guided by the Holy Spirit with_his gifts of truth and love . During these years of renewal , the consecrated_life , like other ways of life in the Church , has gone through a difficult and trying period . It has_been a period full of hopes , new experiments and proposals aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- giving fresh vigour to the profession of the evangelical_counsels . But it has_also been a time of tension and struggle , in which well meaning endeavours have not_always met with positive results . The difficulties however must_not lead to discouragement . Rather , we need to commit ourselves with fresh enthusiasm , for the Church needs the spiritual and apostolic contribution of a renewed and revitalized consecrated_life . In this Post Synodal Exhortation I wish to address religious communities and consecrated_persons in the same spirit_which inspired the letter sent by the Council of Jerusalem to the Christians of Antioch , and I -amos- hopeful that it will meet with the same response : '' When they read it , they rejoiced -atti_degli_apostoli- the encouragement which it gave '' Acts : . And not_only this . I also hope to increase the joy of the whole People of God . As they become better acquainted with the consecrated_life , they will_be_able with_greater awareness to thank Almighty God for this_great gift . In an attitude of heartfelt openness towards_the Synod Fathers , I have carefully considered the valuable contributions made during the intense work of the Assembly , -atti_degli_apostoli- which I made a point of being present throughout . During the Synod , I also sought to offer the entire People of God a number of systematic talks on the consecrated_life in the Church . In them I presented anew the teachings found in the texts of the Second Vatican Council , which_was an enlightening point of reference for subsequent doctrinal developments and for the reflections of the Synod during the busy weeks of its work . I -amos- confident that the sons_and_daughters of the Church , and consecrated_persons in particular , will receive this Exhortation with open hearts . At the same_time , I hope_that reflection will_continue and lead to a deeper_understanding of the great gift of the consecrated_life in its three aspects of consecration , communion and mission . I also hope_that consecrated men_and_women , in full harmony_with_the Church and her Magisterium , will discover in this Exhortation further encouragement to face in a spiritual and apostolic manner the new challenges of our_time . CHAPTER I CONFESSIO TRINITATIS THE ORIGINS OF THE CONSECRATED LIFE IN THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST AND OF THE TRINITY Icon of the Transfigured Christ . The evangelical basis of consecrated_life -isaia- to be sought in the special relationship which Jesus , in his earthly life , established with some of his_disciples . He called them not_only to welcome the Kingdom of God into_their own lives , but_also to put their_lives -atti_degli_apostoli- its service , leaving everything behind and closely imitating his_own way_of_life . Many of the baptized throughout history have_been invited to live such a life '' in the image of Christ '' . But this_-isaia- possible only on the basis of a special vocation and in virtue of a particular gift of the Spirit . For in such a life baptismal consecration develops into a radical response in the following of Christ through acceptance of the evangelical_counsels , the first and essential of which_-isaia- the sacred bond of chastity for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven . This special_way of '' following Christ '' , -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of which_-isaia- always the initiative of the Father , has an essential Christological and pneumatological meaning : it expresses in a particularly vivid way the Trinitarian nature of the Christian life and it anticipates in a certain way_that eschatological fulfilment towards which_the whole Church -isaia- tending . n the Gospel , many of Christ s words and actions shed light on the meaning of this special vocation . But for an overall picture of its essential characteristics , it -isaia- singularly helpful to fix our gaze on Christ s radiant face in the mystery of the Transfiguration . A whole ancient spiritual tradition refers to this '' icon '' when it links the contemplative life to the prayer of Jesus '' on the mountain . '' -abacuc- ipso Domino familiarissime celebrata , -abacuc- eius discipulis ipso praesente concupita : cuius transfigurationis gloriam cum vidissent qui cum eo in monte sancto erant , continuo Petrus . optimum sibi iudicavit in hoc semper esse '' Ad Fratres de Monte Dei , I , : , . Even the '' active '' dimensions of consecrated_life can in a way be included here , for the Transfiguration -isaia-_not_only the revelation of Christ s glory but_also a preparation_for facing Christ s Cross . It involves both '' going up the mountain '' and '' coming down the mountain '' . The disciples who_have enjoyed this intimacy with the Master , surrounded for a moment by the splendour of the Trinitarian life and of the communion of saints , and as it were caught up in the horizon of eternity , are immediately brought back to daily reality , where_they see '' Jesus only '' , in the lowliness of his human_nature , and are invited to return to the valley , to share_with him the toil of God s plan and to set off courageously on the way of the Cross . '' And he was transfigured before them . And after six days Jesus took with_him Peter and James and John his_brother , and led them up a high mountain apart . And he was transfigured before them , and his face shone like the sun , and his garments became white as light . And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , talking with_him . And Peter said to Jesus , '' Lord , it -isaia- well that_we_are here ; if you wish , I will_make three booths here , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah '' . He was still speaking , when lo , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , '' This -isaia- my beloved Son , with whom I -amos- well pleased ; listen to him '' . When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces , and were filled_with fear . But Jesus came and touched them , saying , '' Rise , and have no fear '' . And when_they lifted up their_eyes , they saw no one but Jesus only . And as they_were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , '' Tell no one the vision , until the Son of man_-isaia- raised from the dead '' Mt : . The event of the Transfiguration marks a decisive moment in the ministry of Jesus . It -isaia- a revelatory event which strengthens the faith in the disciples hearts , prepares them_for the tragedy of the Cross and prefigures the glory of the Resurrection . This mystery -isaia- constantly relived by the Church , the people on its way to the eschatological encounter_with its Lord . Like the three chosen disciples , the Church contemplates the transfigured face of Christ in order to be confirmed in faith and to avoid being dismayed -atti_degli_apostoli- his disfigured face on the Cross . In both cases , she_-isaia- the Bride before her Spouse , sharing in his mystery and surrounded by his light . This light shines on all the Church s children . All are equally called to follow Christ , to discover in him the ultimate meaning of their_lives , until they are_able to say with the Apostle : '' For to me to live -isaia- Christ '' Phil : . But those_who_are called to the consecrated_life have a special experience of the light_which shines_forth from the Incarnate Word . For the profession of the evangelical_counsels makes them a kind of sign and prophetic statement for the community of the brethren and for the world ; consequently they_can echo in a particular_way the ecstatic words spoken by Peter : '' Lord , it -isaia- well that_we_are here '' Mt : . These words bespeak the Christocentric orientation of the whole Christian life . But they_also eloquently express the radical nature of the vocation to the consecrated_life : how good it -isaia- for us to be with you , to devote ourselves to you , to make you the one focus of our_lives ! Truly those_who_have been_given the grace of this special communion of love with Christ feel as it were caught up in his splendour : he -isaia- '' the fairest of the sons of men '' Ps : , the One beyond compare . '' This -isaia- my beloved Son '' : listen to him ! . The three disciples caught up in ecstasy hear_the Father s call to listen to Christ , to place all their trust in him , to make him the centre of their_lives . The words from on high give new depth to the invitation by which Jesus himself , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his public_life , called them to follow_him , to leave their ordinary lives behind and to enter_into a close relationship to him . It -isaia- precisely this special grace of intimacy which , in the consecrated_life , makes possible and even demands the total gift_of_self in the profession of the evangelical_counsels . The counsels , more_than a simple renunciation , are a specific acceptance of the mystery of Christ , lived within_the Church . In the unity of the Christian life , the various vocations are like so many rays of the one light of Christ , whose radiance '' brightens the countenance of the Church . '' The laity , by virtue of the secular character of their_vocation , reflect the mystery of the Incarnate Word particularly insofar as he -isaia- the Alpha and the Omega of the world , the foundation and measure of the value of all created things . Sacred ministers , for their_part , are living images of Christ the Head and Shepherd who guides his_people during_this time of '' already and not_yet '' , as they await his coming in glory . It -isaia-_the_duty of the consecrated_life to show that the Incarnate Son of God -isaia- the eschatological goal towards which all things tend , the splendour before which every_other light pales , and the infinite beauty which alone_can fully satisfy the human_heart . In the consecrated_life , then , it -isaia-_not_only a matter of following Christ with one s whole heart , of loving him '' more_than father or mother , more_than son or daughter '' cf . Mt : for this_-isaia- required of every disciple but of living and expressing this by conforming one s whole existence to Christ in an all encompassing commitment which foreshadows the eschatological perfection , to the extent that_this_-isaia- possible in time and in accordance_with_the different charisms . By professing the evangelical_counsels , consecrated_persons not_only make Christ the whole meaning of their_lives but strive to reproduce in themselves , as far_as_possible , '' that form of life_which he , as the Son of God , accepted in entering this_world . '' By embracing chastity , they make_their own the pure love of Christ and proclaim to the world that_he_-isaia- the Only Begotten Son who_-isaia- one_with the Father cf . By imitating Christ s poverty , they profess that_he_-isaia- the Son who receives everything from the Father , and gives everything back to the Father in love cf . By accepting , through the sacrifice of their_own freedom , the mystery of Christ s filial obedience , they profess that_he_-isaia- infinitely beloved and loving , as the One who delights only in the will of the Father cf . Jn : , to whom he -isaia- perfectly united and on whom he depends for everything . By this profound '' configuration '' to the mystery of Christ , the consecrated_life brings about in a special_way that confessio Trinitatis which_-isaia- the mark of all Christian life ; it acknowledges with wonder the sublime beauty of God , Father , Son and Holy Spirit , and bears joyful witness to his loving concern_for every_human_being . IN PRAISE OF THE TRINITY '' A Patre ad Patrem '' : God s initiative . Contemplation of the glory of the Lord Jesus in the icon of the Transfiguration reveals to consecrated_persons first of all the Father , the Creator and Giver of every good thing , who draws his creatures to himself cf . Jn : with a special love and for a special mission . '' This -isaia- my beloved Son : listen to him ! '' cf . In response to this call and the interior attraction which accompanies it , those_who_are called entrust themselves to the love of God who wishes them to be exclusively -atti_degli_apostoli- his service , and they consecrate themselves totally to him and to his plan of salvation cf . This -isaia- the meaning of the call to the consecrated_life : it -isaia- an initiative coming wholly from the Father cf . Jn : , who asks those_whom he has chosen to respond with complete and exclusive devotion . The experience of this gracious love of God -isaia- so deep and so powerful that the person called senses the need to respond by unconditionally dedicating his or her_life to God , consecrating to him all things present and future , and placing them in his hands . This -isaia- why , with Saint Thomas , we come to understand_the identity of the consecrated person , beginning with_his or her complete self offering , as being comparable to a genuine holocaust . '' Per Filium '' : in the footsteps of the Son . The Son , who -isaia-_the_way which_leads to the Father cf . Jn : , calls all those_whom the Father has_given to him cf . Jn : to make_the following of himself_the whole purpose of their_lives . But of some , those called to the consecrated_life , he asks a total commitment , one_which involves leaving everything behind cf . Mt : in order to live -atti_degli_apostoli- his sideand to follow_him wherever he goes cf . In the countenance of Jesus , the '' image of the invisible God '' Col : and the reflection of the Father s glory cf . Heb : , we glimpse the depths of an eternal and infinite love which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very root of our being . Those who let themselves be seized by this_love cannot help abandoning everything to follow_him cf . Like Saint Paul , they consider all else as loss '' because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ '' , by comparison with which_they do not_hesitate to count all things as '' refuse '' , in order_that they '' may gain Christ '' Phil : . They strive to become one_with him , taking on his mind and his way_of_life . This leaving of everything and following the Lord cf . Lk : -isaia- a worthy programme of life_for all whom he calls , in every_age . The evangelical_counsels , by which Christ invites some people to share his experience as the chaste , poor and obedient One , call_for and make manifest in those_who accept them an explicit desire to be totally conformed to him . Living '' in obedience , with nothing of one_s_own and in chastity , '' consecrated_persons profess that Jesus -isaia- the model in whom every virtue comes to perfection . His way of living in chastity , poverty and obedience appears as the most radical way of living the Gospel on this earth , a way which_may be called divine , for it was embraced by him , God and man , as the expression of his relationship as the Only Begotten Son with the Father and with the Holy Spirit . This -isaia- why Christian tradition has_always spoken of the objective superiority of the consecrated_life . Nor can it be denied that the practice of the evangelical_counsels -isaia-_also a particularly profound and fruitful way of sharing in Christ s mission , in imitation of the example of Mary of Nazareth , the first disciple , who willingly put herself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of God s plan by the total gift_of_self . Every mission begins with the attitude expressed by Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- the Annunciation : '' Behold , I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be done to me according to your word '' Lk : . '' In Spiritu '' : consecrated by the Holy Spirit . '' A bright cloud overshadowed them '' Mt : . A significant spiritual interpretation of the Transfiguration sees this cloud as an image of the Holy Spirit . Like the whole of Christian life , the call to the consecrated_life -isaia- closely linked to the working of the Holy Spirit . In every_age , the Spirit enables new men_and_women to recognize_the appeal of such a demanding choice . Through his_power , they relive , in a way , the experience of the Prophet Jeremiah : '' You have seduced me , Lord , and I have let myself be seduced '' Jer : . It -isaia- the Spirit who awakens the desire to respond fully ; it -isaia- he who guides the growth of this desire , helping it to mature into a positive response and sustaining it as it -isaia- faithfully translated into action ; it -isaia- he who shapes and moulds the hearts of those_who_are called , configuring them to Christ , the chaste , poor and obedient One , and prompting them to make his_mission their_own . By allowing themselves to be guided by the Spirit on an endless journey of purification , they become , day after day , conformed to Christ , the prolongation in history of a special presence of the Risen Lord . With penetrating insight , the Fathers of the Church have called this spiritual path philokalia , or love of the divine beauty , which_-isaia- the reflection of the divine goodness . Those who by the power of the Holy Spirit are led progressively into full configuration to Christ reflect in themselves a ray of the unapproachable light . During their earthly pilgrimage , they press on towards_the inexhaustible Source of light . The consecrated_life thus becomes a particularly profound expression of the Church as the Bride who , prompted by the Spirit to imitate her Spouse , stands before him '' in splendour , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that_she might be holy and without blemish '' Eph : . The same Spirit , far from removing from the life of humanity those_whom the Father has called , puts them -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of their brothers_and_sisters in accordance_with their particular state of life , and inspires them to undertake special tasks in response to the needs of the Church and the world , by means of the charisms proper to the various Institutes . Hence many different_forms of the consecrated_life have arisen , whereby_the Church -isaia- '' adorned by the various gifts of her_children . like a bride made beautiful for_her spouse cf . Rev : '' and -isaia- enriched by the means necessary_for carrying_out her_mission in the world . The evangelical_counsels , gift of the Trinity . The evangelical_counsels are thus above all a gift of the Holy Trinity . The consecrated_life proclaims what_the Father , through the Son and in the Spirit , brings about by his_love , his goodness and his beauty . In fact , '' the religious state reveals the transcendence of the Kingdom of God and its requirements over all earthly things . To all people it shows wonderfully -atti_degli_apostoli- work within_the Church the surpassing greatness of the force of Christ the King and the boundless power of the Holy Spirit . '' The first duty of the consecrated_life -isaia- to make visible the marvels wrought by God in the frail humanity of those_who_are called . They bear_witness to these marvels not_so_much in words as by the eloquent language of a transfigured life , capable of amazing the world . To people s astonishment they respond by proclaiming the wonders of grace accomplished by the Lord in those_whom he loves . To the degree that consecrated_persons let themselves be guided by the Spirit to the heights of perfection they_can exclaim : '' I see the beauty of your grace , I contemplate its radiance , I reflect its light ; I -amos- caught up in its ineffable splendour ; I -amos- taken outside myself as I think of myself ; I see_how I was and what I have_become . O wonder ! I -amos- vigilant , I -amos- full of respect_for myself , of reverence and of fear , as I would be were I before you ; I do not_know what to do , I -amos- seized by fear , I do not_know where to sit , where to go , where to put these members which_are yours ; in what deeds , in what works shall I use them , these amazing divine marvels ! '' The consecrated_life thus becomes one of the tangible seals which_the Trinity impresses upon history , so that people can sense with longing the attraction of divine beauty . Reflection of Trinitarian life in the evangelical_counsels . The deepest meaning of the evangelical_counsels -isaia-_revealed when_they_are viewed in relation to the Holy Trinity , the source of holiness . They are in fact an expression of the love of the Son for the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit . By practising the evangelical_counsels , the consecrated person lives with particular intensity the Trinitarian and Christological dimension which marks the whole of Christian life . The chastity of celibates and virgins , as a manifestation of dedication to God with an undivided heart cf . Cor : , -isaia- a reflection of the infinite love_which links the three Divine Persons in the mysterious depths of the life of the Trinity , the love to which_the Incarnate Word bears_witness even to the point of giving his_life , the love '' poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit '' Rom : , which evokes a response of total love for God and the brethren . Poverty proclaims that God -isaia-_man s only real treasure . When poverty -isaia- lived according to the example of Christ who , '' though he was rich . became poor '' Cor : , it becomes an expression of that total gift_of_self which_the three Divine Persons make to one_another . This gift overflows into creation and -isaia- fully revealed in the Incarnation of the Word and in his redemptive death . Obedience , practised in imitation of Christ , whose food was to do the Father s will cf . Jn : , shows the liberating beauty of a dependence which_-isaia-_not servile but filial , marked by a deep sense_of_responsibility and animated by mutual trust , which_-isaia- a reflection in history of the loving harmony between_the three Divine Persons . The consecrated_life -isaia- thus called constantly to deepen the gift of the evangelical_counsels with a love_which grows ever_more genuine and strong in the Trinitarian dimension : love for Christ , which_leads to closeness with_him ; love for the Holy Spirit , who opens our_hearts to his inspiration ; love for the Father , the first origin and supreme goal of the consecrated_life . The consecrated_life thus becomes a confession and a sign of the Trinity , whose mystery -isaia- held up to the Church as the model and source of every_form of Christian life . Even fraternal life , whereby consecrated_persons strive to live in Christ with '' one heart and soul '' Acts : , -isaia- put forward as an eloquent witness to the Trinity . It proclaims_the Father , who desires to make all of humanity one family . It proclaims_the Incarnate Son , who gathers the redeemed into unity , pointing the way by his example , his prayer , his_words and above all his_death , which -isaia-_the_source of reconciliation for a divided and scattered humanity . It proclaims_the Holy Spirit as the principle of unity in the Church , wherein he ceaselessly raises up spiritual families and fraternal communities . Consecrated like Christ for the Kingdom of God . The consecrated_life , through the prompting of the Holy Spirit , '' constitutes a closer imitation and an abiding re enactment in the Church '' of the way_of_life which Jesus , the supreme Consecrated One and missionary of the Father for the sake of his Kingdom , embraced and proposed to his_disciples cf . In the light of Jesus consecration , we can_see in the initiative of the Father , the source of all holiness , the ultimate origin of the consecrated_life . Jesus -isaia- the One whom '' God anointed . with the Holy Spirit and with power '' Acts : , the One '' whom_the Father consecrated and sent into_the_world '' Jn : . Accepting his consecration by the Father , the Son in turn consecrates himself to the Father for the sake of humanity cf . His life of virginity , obedience and poverty expresses his complete filial acceptance of the Father s plan cf . His perfect offering confers an aspect of consecration upon all the events of his earthly existence . Jesus -isaia- the exemplar of obedience , who came down from heaven not to do his_own will but the will of the One who sent him cf . He places his way of living and acting in the hands of the Father cf . In filial obedience , he assumes the condition of a servant : he '' emptied himself , taking the form of a servant . and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross '' Phil : . In this attitude of submissiveness to the Father , Christ lives his_life as a virgin , even while affirming and defending the dignity and sanctity of married life . He thus reveals the sublime excellence and mysterious spiritual fruitfulness of virginity . His full acceptance of the Father s plan -isaia-_also seen in his detachment from earthly goods : '' though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that by his poverty you might become rich '' Cor : . The depth of his poverty -isaia-_revealed in the perfect offering of all that_-isaia- his to the Father . The consecrated_life truly constitutes a living memorial of Jesus way of living and acting as the Incarnate Word in relation to the Father and in relation to the brethren . It -isaia- a living tradition of the Saviour s life and message . BETWEEN EASTER AND FULFILMENT From Tabor to Calvary . The dazzling event of the Transfiguration -isaia- a preparation_for the tragic , but no less glorious , event of Calvary . Peter , James and John contemplate the Lord Jesus together_with Moses and Elijah , with whom , according to the Evangelist Luke , Jesus speaks '' of his departure , which he was to accomplish -atti_degli_apostoli- Jerusalem '' : . The eyes of the Apostles are therefore fixed upon Jesus who_-isaia- thinking of the Cross cf . There his virginal love for the Father and for all mankind will attain its highest expression . His poverty will reach complete self emptying , his obedience the giving of his_life . The disciples are invited to contemplate Jesus raised up on the Cross , where , in his silence and solitude , '' the Word come forth_from silence '' prophetically affirms the absolute transcendence of God over all created things ; in his_own flesh he conquers our sin and draws every man and every woman to himself , giving to all the new_life of the Resurrection cf . It -isaia- in the contemplation of the Crucified Christ that all vocations find_their inspiration . From this contemplation , together_with_the primordial gift of the Spirit , all gifts , and in particular the gift of the consecrated_life , take their origin . After Mary , the Mother of Jesus , it -isaia- John who receives this_gift . John -isaia- the disciple whom Jesus loved , the witness who together_with Mary stood -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross cf . His decision to consecrate himself totally -isaia- the fruit of the divine_love which envelops him , sustains him and fills his_heart . John , together_with Mary , -isaia- among the first in a long line of men_and_women_who , from the beginning of the Church until the end , are touched by God s love and feel called to follow_the Lamb , once sacrificed and now alive , wherever he goes cf . The Paschal dimension of the consecrated_life . In the different_forms of life inspired by the Spirit throughout history , consecrated_persons discover that the more they stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross of Christ , the more immediately and profoundly they experience the truth of God who_-isaia- love . It -isaia- precisely on the Cross that the One who in death appears to human eyes as disfigured and without beauty , so much so that the bystanders cover their faces cf . Is : , fully reveals the beauty and power of God s love . Saint Augustine says : '' Beautiful -isaia- God , the Word with God . He -isaia- beautiful in heaven , beautiful on earth ; beautiful in the womb , beautiful in his parents arms , beautiful in his miracles , beautiful in his sufferings ; beautiful in inviting to life , beautiful in not worrying about death , beautiful in giving up his_life and beautiful in taking it up again ; he -isaia- beautiful on the Cross , beautiful in the tomb , beautiful in heaven . Listen to the song with understanding , and let not the weakness of the flesh distract your eyes from the splendour of his beauty . '' The consecrated_life reflects the splendour of this_love because , by its fidelity to the mystery of the Cross , it confesses that it believes and lives by the love of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . In this_way it helps the Church to remain aware_that the Cross -isaia- the superabundance of God s love poured out upon this_world , and that_it_-isaia- the great sign of Christ s saving presence , especially in the midst of difficulties and trials . This -isaia- the testimony given constantly and with deeply admirable courage by a great number of consecrated_persons , many of whom live in difficult situations , even suffering persecution and martyrdom . Their fidelity to the one Love -isaia-_revealed and confirmed in the humility of a hidden life , in the acceptance of sufferings for the sake of completing in their_own flesh '' what_-isaia- lacking in Christ s afflictions '' Col : , in silent sacrifice and abandonment to God s holy will , and in serene fidelity even as their strength and personal authority wane . Fidelity to God also inspires devotion to neighbour , a devotion which consecrated_persons live out not_without sacrifice by constantly interceding for the needs of their brothers_and_sisters , generously serving the poor and the sick , sharing the hardships of others and participating in the concerns and trials of the Church . Witnesses to Christ in the world . The Paschal Mystery -isaia-_also the wellspring of the Church s missionary nature , which_-isaia- reflected in the whole of the Church s life . It -isaia- expressed in a distinctive way in the consecrated_life . Over and above the charisms proper to those Institutes which_are devoted to the mission ad gentes or which_are engaged in ordinary apostolic activity , it can_be_said that the sense of mission_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of every_form of consecrated_life . To the extent_that consecrated_persons live a life completely devoted to the Father cf . Lk : ; Jn : , held fast by Christ cf . Jn : ; Gal : and animated by the Spirit cf . Lk : ; Acts : ; : , they cooperate effectively in the mission of the Lord Jesus cf . Jn : and contribute in a particularly profound way to the renewal of the world . The first missionary duty of consecrated_persons -isaia- to themselves , and they fulfil it by opening their_hearts to the promptings of the Spirit of Christ . Their witness helps the whole Church to remember_that the most important thing -isaia- to serve God freely , through Christ s grace which_-isaia- communicated to believers through the gift of the Spirit . Thus they proclaim to the world_the peace which_comes_from the Father , the dedication witnessed to by the Son , and the joy which_-isaia- the fruit of the Holy Spirit . Consecrated persons will be missionaries above all by continually deepening their awareness of having been_called and chosen by God , to whom_they must_therefore direct and offer everything_that they_are and have , freeing themselves from the obstacles which_could hinder the totality of their response . In this_way they will_become true signs of Christ in the world . Their lifestyle too must clearly show the ideal which_they profess , and thus present itself as a living sign of God and as an eloquent , albeit often silent , proclamation of the Gospel . The Church must_always seek to make her presence visible in everyday life , especially in contemporary culture , which -isaia-_often very secularized and yet sensitive to the language of signs . In this_regard the Church has a right to expect a significant contribution from consecrated_persons , called as they_are in every situation to bear clear witness that_they belong to Christ . Since the habit -isaia- a sign of consecration , poverty and membership in a particular Religious family , I join the Fathers of the Synod in strongly recommending to men_and_women_religious that_they wear their_proper habit , suitably adapted to the conditions of time_and_place . Where valid reasons of their apostolate call_for it , Religious , in conformity_with_the norms of their Institute , may also dress in a simple and modest manner , with an appropriate symbol , in such_a_way_that their consecration -isaia- recognizable . Institutes which from their origin or by provision of their Constitutions do not_have a specific habit should ensure_that the dress of their members corresponds in dignity and simplicity to the nature of their_vocation . Eschatological dimension of the consecrated_life . Since the demands of the apostolate today are increasingly urgent , and since involvement in temporal affairs risks becoming ever_more absorbing , it -isaia- particularly opportune to draw attention once_more to the eschatological nature of the consecrated_life . '' Where your treasure -isaia- , there_will your heart be also '' Mt : . The unique treasure of the Kingdom gives_rise to desire , anticipation , commitment and witness . In the early Church , the expectation of the Lord s coming was lived in a particularly intense way . With the passing of the centuries , the Church has not ceased to foster this attitude of hope : she_has continued to invite the faithful to look to the salvation which_-isaia- waiting to be revealed , '' for the form of this world_-isaia- passing away '' Cor : ; cf . t -isaia- in this perspective that_we_can understand more_clearly the role of consecrated_life as an eschatological sign . In fact it has constantly been taught that the consecrated_life -isaia- a foreshadowing of the future Kingdom . The Second Vatican Council proposes this_teaching anew when it states that consecration better '' foretells the resurrected state and the glory of the heavenly Kingdom . '' It does this above all by means of the vow of virginity , which tradition has_always understood as an anticipation of the world to come , already -atti_degli_apostoli- work_for the total transformation of man . Those who_have dedicated their_lives to Christ cannot_fail to live in the hope of meeting him , in order to be with_him for ever . Hence the ardent expectation and desire to '' be plunged into the Fire of Love which burns in them and which_-isaia- none other_than the Holy Spirit '' , an expectation and desire sustained by the gifts which_the Lord freely bestows on those_who yearn for the things_that_are above cf . Immersed in the things of the Lord , the consecrated person remembers that '' here we have no lasting city '' Heb : , for '' our commonwealth -isaia- in heaven '' Phil : . The one_thing necessary -isaia- to seek God s '' Kingdom and his righteousness '' Mt : , with unceasing prayer_for the Lord s coming . Active expectation : commitment and watchfulness . '' Come , Lord Jesus ! '' Rev : . This expectation -isaia- anything but passive : although directed towards_the future Kingdom , it expresses itself in work and mission , that the Kingdom may_become present here and now through the spirit of the Beatitudes , a spirit capable of giving rise in human_society to effective aspirations for_justice , peace , solidarity and forgiveness . This -isaia- clearly shown by the history of the consecrated_life , which has_always borne abundant fruit even_for this_world . By their charisms , consecrated_persons become signs of the Spirit pointing to a new future enlightened by faith and by Christian hope . Eschatological expectation becomes mission , so that the Kingdom may_become ever more_fully established here and now . The prayer '' Come , Lord Jesus ! '' -isaia- accompanied by another : '' Thy Kingdom come ! '' Mt : . Those who vigilantly await the fulfilment of Christ s promises are_able to bring hope to their brothers_and_sisters who are_often discouraged and pessimistic about the future . Theirs -isaia- a hope founded on God s promise contained in the revealed word : the history of humanity -isaia- moving towards '' a new heaven and a new earth '' Rev : , where_the Lord '' will wipe away every tear from their_eyes , and death shall be no more , neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more , for the former things have passed away '' Rev : . The consecrated_life -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of this definitive manifestation of the divine glory , when all flesh will see the salvation of God cf . The Christian East emphasizes this dimension when it considers monks as angels of God on earth who proclaim_the renewal of the world in Christ . In the West , monasticism -isaia- the celebration of memory and expectation : memory of the wonders God has wrought and expectation of the final fulfilment of our_hope . Monasticism and the contemplative life are a constant reminder that the primacy of God gives full meaning and joy to human lives , because men_and_women are made for God , and their_hearts are restless until they rest in him . The Virgin Mary , model of consecration and discipleship . Mary -isaia-_the_one who , from the moment of her Immaculate Conception , most perfectly reflects the divine beauty . '' All beautiful '' -isaia- the title with_which_the Church invokes her . '' The relationship_with Mary most_holy , which for_every believer stems from his or her union with Christ , -isaia- even_more pronounced in the life of consecrated_persons . Mary s presence -isaia- of fundamental importance both_for the spiritual_life of each consecrated person and for the solidity , unity and progress of the whole community '' . Mary in fact -isaia- the sublime example of perfect consecration , since she belongs completely to God and -isaia- totally devoted to him . Chosen by the Lord , who wished to accomplish in her the mystery of the Incarnation , she reminds consecrated_persons of the primacy of God s initiative . At the same_time , having given her assent to the divine Word , made_flesh in her , Mary -isaia- the model of the acceptance of grace by human creatures . Having lived with Jesus and Joseph in the hidden years of Nazareth , and present -atti_degli_apostoli- her Son s side -atti_degli_apostoli- crucial moments of his public_life , the Blessed Virgin teaches unconditional discipleship and diligent service . In Mary , '' the temple of the Holy Spirit , '' all the splendour of the new creation shines_forth . Consecrated life looks to her as the sublime model of consecration to the Father , union with the Son and openness to the Spirit , in the knowledge that acceptance of the '' virginal and humble life '' of Christ also means imitation of Mary s way_of_life . In the Blessed Virgin Mary , consecrated_persons also find a Mother who_-isaia- altogether unique . Indeed , if the new motherhood conferred on Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- Calvary -isaia-_a_gift for all Christians , it has a specific value for those_who_have completely consecrated their_lives to Christ . '' Behold your mother ! '' Jn : : Jesus words to the disciple '' whom he loved '' Jn : are particularly significant for the lives of consecrated_persons . They , like John , are_called to take the Blessed Virgin Mary to themselves cf . Jn : , loving her and imitating her in the radical manner which befits their_vocation , and experiencing in return her special motherly love . The Blessed Virgin shares with_them the love_which enables them to offer their_lives every_day for Christ and to cooperate with_him in the salvation of the world . Hence a filial relationship to Mary -isaia- the royal road to fidelity to one s vocation and a most effective help for advancing in that vocation and living it fully . IN THE CHURCH AND FOR THE CHURCH '' It -isaia- well that_we_are here '' : the consecrated_life in the mystery of the Church . In the episode of the Transfiguration , Peter speaks on behalf of the other Apostles : '' It -isaia- well that_we_are here '' Mt : . The experience of Christ s glory , though completely filling his mind_and_heart , does_not set him apart but_rather unites him more_closely to the '' we '' of the Apostles . This dimension of '' we '' invites us to consider_the place which_the consecrated_life occupies in the mystery of the Church . In recent_years , theological reflection on the nature of the consecrated_life has deepened the new insights which emerged from the teaching of the Second Vatican Council . In the light of that teaching it has_been recognized that the profession of the evangelical_counsels indisputably belongs to the life and holiness of the Church . This means_that the consecrated_life , present in the Church from the beginning , can_never fail to be one of her essential and characteristic elements , for it expresses her very nature . This -isaia- clearly seen from the fact_that the profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- intimately connected_with_the mystery of Christ , and has the duty of making somehow present_the way_of_life which Jesus himself chose and indicated as an absolute eschatological value . Jesus himself , by calling some men_and_women to abandon everything in order to follow_him , established this type of life_which , under_the_guidance of the Spirit , would gradually develop down_the_centuries into the various_forms of the consecrated_life . The idea of a Church made up only of sacred ministers and lay_people does_not therefore conform to the intentions of her_divine Founder , as revealed to us by the Gospels and the other writings of the New Testament . New and special consecration . In the Church s tradition religious profession -isaia- considered to be a special and fruitful deepening of the consecration received in Baptism , inasmuch as it -isaia- the means by which_the close union with Christ already begun in Baptism develops in the gift of a fuller , more explicit and authentic configuration to him through the profession of the evangelical_counsels . This further consecration , however , differs in a special_way from baptismal consecration , of which_it_-isaia- not a necessary consequence . In fact , all those reborn in Christ are_called to live out , with the strength which_-isaia- the Spirit s gift , the chastity appropriate to their state of life , obedience to God and to the Church , and a reasonable detachment from material possessions : for all are_called to holiness , which consists in the perfection of love . But Baptism in itself does_not include the call to celibacy or virginity , the renunciation of possessions or obedience to a superior , in the form proper to the evangelical_counsels . The profession of the evangelical_counsels thus presupposes a particular gift of God not given to everyone , as Jesus himself emphasizes with_respect to voluntary celibacy cf . This call -isaia- accompanied , moreover , by a specific gift of the Holy Spirit , so that consecrated_persons can respond to their_vocation and mission . For this_reason , as the liturgies of the East and West testify in the rite of monastic or religious profession and in the consecration of virgins , the Church invokes the gift of the Holy Spirit upon those_who_have been chosen and joins their oblation to the sacrifice of Christ . he profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia-_also a development of the grace of the Sacrament of Confirmation , but it goes beyond_the ordinary demands of the consecration received in Confirmation by virtue of a special gift of the Spirit which opens the way to new possibilities and fruits of holiness and apostolic work . This can clearly be seen from the history of the consecrated_life . As for priests_who profess the evangelical_counsels , experience itself shows_that the Sacrament of Holy Orders finds a particular fruitfulness in this consecration , inasmuch as it requires and fosters a closer union with the Lord . The priest who professes the evangelical_counsels -isaia-_especially favoured in that he reproduces in his_life the fullness of the mystery of Christ , thanks also to the specific spirituality of his Institute and the apostolic dimension of its_proper charism . In the priest , in fact , the vocation to the priesthood and the vocation to the consecrated_life converge in a profound and dynamic unity . Also of immeasurable value -isaia- the contribution made to the Church s life by religious priests completely devoted to contemplation . Especially in the celebration of the Eucharist they carry_out an act of the Church and for the Church , to which_they join the offering of themselves , in communion with Christ who offers himself to the Father for the salvation of the whole_world . Relationships between_the different states of Christian life . The different_ways of life_which , in accordance_with_the plan of the Lord Jesus , make up the life of the Church have mutual relationships which merit consideration . By virtue of their rebirth in Christ , all the faithful share a common dignity ; all are_called to holiness ; all cooperate in the building up of the one Body of Christ , each in accordance_with_the proper vocation and gift_which he or she_has received_from_the Spirit cf . The equal dignity of all members of the Church -isaia- the work of the Spirit , -isaia- rooted in Baptism and Confirmation and -isaia- strengthened by the Eucharist . But diversity -isaia-_also a work of the Spirit . It -isaia- he who establishes the Church as an organic communion in the diversity of vocations , charisms and ministries . he vocations to the lay life , to the ordained ministry and to the consecrated_life can be considered paradigmatic , inasmuch as all particular vocations , considered separately or as a whole , are in one way or another derived_from them or lead back to them , in accordance_with_the richness of God s gift . These vocations are_also -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of one_another , for the growth of the Body of Christ in history and for its mission in the world . Everyone in the Church -isaia- consecrated in Baptism and Confirmation , but the ordained ministry and the consecrated_life each presuppose a distinct vocation and a specific form of consecration , with_a_view to a particular mission . For the mission of the lay_faithful , whose proper task -isaia- to '' seek the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God '' , the consecration of Baptism and Confirmation common to all members of the People of God -isaia- a sufficient foundation . In addition to this basic consecration , ordained ministers receive the consecration of ordination in order to carry on the apostolic ministry in time . Consecrated persons , who embrace the evangelical_counsels , receive a new and special consecration which , without being sacramental , commits them to making their_own in chastity , poverty and obedience the way_of_life practised personally by Jesus and proposed by him to his_disciples . Although these different categories are a manifestation of the one mystery of Christ , the lay_faithful have as their_specific but_not exclusive characteristic , activity in the world ; the clergy , ministry ; consecrated men_and_women , special conformity to Christ , chaste , poor and obedient . The special value of the consecrated_life . Within this harmonious constellation of gifts , each of the fundamental states of life_-isaia- entrusted with the task of expressing , in its_own way , one or other aspect of the one mystery of Christ . While the lay life has a particular mission of ensuring that the Gospel message -isaia- proclaimed in the temporal sphere , in the sphere of ecclesial_communion an indispensable ministry -isaia- carried_out by those in Holy Orders , and in a special_way by Bishops . The latter have_the task of guiding the People of God by the teaching of the word , the administration of the sacraments and the exercise of sacred power in the service of ecclesial_communion , which_-isaia- an organic communion , hierarchically structured . As a way of showing forth the Church s holiness , it -isaia- to be recognized that the consecrated_life , which mirrors Christ s own way_of_life , has an objective superiority . Precisely for this_reason , it -isaia- an especially rich manifestation of Gospel values and a more complete expression of the Church s purpose , which_-isaia- the sanctification of humanity . The consecrated_life proclaims and in a certain way anticipates the future age , when_the fullness of the Kingdom of heaven , already present in its first fruits and in mystery , will be achieved , and when_the children of the resurrection will_take neither wife nor husband , but will be like the angels of God cf . The Church has_always taught the pre eminence of perfect chastity for the sake of the Kingdom , and rightly considers it the '' door '' of the whole consecrated_life . She also shows great esteem_for the vocation to marriage , which_makes spouses '' witnesses to and cooperators in the fruitfulness of Holy Mother Church , who signify and share in the love with_which Christ has loved his Bride and because of which he delivered himself up on her behalf '' . In this perspective , common to all consecrated_life , there_are many_different but complementary paths . Men and women Religious completely devoted to contemplation are in a special_way an image of Christ praying on the mountain . Consecrated persons engaged in the active life manifest Christ '' in his proclamation of the Kingdom of God to the multitudes , in his healing of the sick and the suffering , in his_work of converting sinners to a better life , in his solicitude for youth and his goodness to all '' . Consecrated persons in Secular Institutes contribute in a special_way to the coming of the Kingdom of God ; they unite in a distinctive synthesis the value of consecration and that of being in the world . As they live their consecration in the world and from the world , '' they strive to imbue everything with an evangelical spirit for the strengthening and growth of the Body of Christ '' . For this_purpose they share in the Church s evangelizing mission through their_personal witness of Christian living , their commitment to ordering temporal affairs according to God s plan , and their cooperation in service of the ecclesial_community , in accordance_with_the secular way_of_life which_-isaia- proper to them . Bearing witness to the Gospel of the Beatitudes . A particular duty of the consecrated_life -isaia- to remind the baptized of the fundamental values of the Gospel , by bearing '' splendid and striking testimony that_the_world cannot be transfigured and offered to God without_the spirit of the Beatitudes '' . The consecrated_life thus continually fosters in the People of God an awareness of the need to respond with holiness of life to the love of God poured into their_hearts by the Holy Spirit cf . Rom : , by reflecting in their conduct the sacramental consecration which_-isaia- brought_about by God s power in Baptism , Confirmation or Holy Orders . In fact it -isaia- necessary to pass from the holiness communicated in the sacraments to the holiness of daily_life . The consecrated_life , by its_very existence in the Church , seeks to serve the consecration of the lives of all the faithful , clergy and laity alike . Nor must it be forgotten that consecrated_persons themselves are helped by the witness of the other vocations to live fully and completely their union with the mystery of Christ and the Church in its many_different dimensions . By virtue of this mutual enrichment , the mission of consecrated_persons becomes more eloquent and effective : this mission_-isaia- to remind their other brothers_and_sisters to keep their_eyes fixed on the peace which_-isaia- to come , and to strive for the definitive happiness found in God . The living image of the Church as Bride . In the consecrated_life , particular importance attaches to the spousal meaning , which recalls the Church s duty to be completely and exclusively devoted to her Spouse , from whom she receives every good thing . This spousal dimension , which_-isaia- part of all consecrated_life , has a particular meaning for women , who find therein their feminine identity and as it were discover the special genius of their relationship_with the Lord . A moving sign of this_-isaia- seen in the New Testament passage which portrays Mary with the Apostles in the Upper Room , in prayerful expectation of the Holy Spirit cf . We can_see here a vivid image of the Church as Bride , fully attentive to her Bridegroom and ready to accept his gift . In Peter and the other Apostles there emerges above all the aspect of fruitfulness , as it -isaia- expressed in ecclesial ministry , which becomes an instrument of the Spirit for bringing new sons_and_daughters to birth through the preaching of the word , the celebration of the Sacraments and the giving of pastoral_care . In Mary the aspect of spousal receptivity -isaia- particularly clear ; it -isaia- under this aspect that the Church , through_her perfect virginal life , brings divine_life to fruition within herself . The consecrated_life has_always_been seen primarily in terms of Mary Virgin and Bride . This virginal love -isaia-_the_source of a particular fruitfulness which fosters the birth and growth of divine_life in people s hearts . Following in the footsteps of Mary , the New Eve , consecrated_persons express their_spiritual fruitfulness by becoming receptive to the Word , in order to contribute to the growth of a new humanity by their unconditional dedication and their living witness . Thus the Church fully reveals her motherhood both in the communication of divine_grace entrusted to Peter and in the responsible acceptance of God s gift , exemplified by Mary . God s people , for their_part , find in the ordained ministry the means of salvation , and in the consecrated_life the incentive to make a full and loving response through all the different_forms of Christian service . GUIDED BY THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS A '' transfigured '' life : the call to holiness . '' When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces , and were filled_with fear '' Mt : . In the episode of the Transfiguration , the Synoptic Gospels , with varying nuances , point_out the fear which overcomes the disciples . Their fascination -atti_degli_apostoli- the transfigured face of Christ does_not prevent them_from being fearful before the divine Majesty which overshadows them . Whenever human_beings become aware of the glory of God , they_also become aware of their_own insignificance and experience a sense of fear . Such fear -isaia- salutary . It reminds man of God s perfection , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time urges him on with a pressing call to '' holiness '' . All the sons_and_daughters of the Church , called by God to '' listen to '' Christ , necessarily feel a deep need_for conversion and holiness . But , as the Synod emphasized , this need in the first_place challenges the consecrated_life . In fact the vocation of consecrated_persons to seek first the Kingdom of God -isaia- first_and_foremost a call to complete conversion , in self renunciation , in order to live fully for the Lord , so that God may be all in all . Called to contemplate and bear_witness to the transfigured face of Christ , consecrated men_and_women are_also called to a '' transfigured '' existence . The Final Report of the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops made a significant observation in this_regard : '' Holy men_and_women have always_been the source and origin of renewal in the most difficult circumstances throughout_the Church s history . Today we have a tremendous need of saints , for_whom we must assiduously implore God . The Institutes of Consecrated Life , through the profession of the evangelical_counsels , must be conscious of their special mission in today s Church , and we must encourage them in that mission '' . The Fathers of the Ninth Assembly of the Synod of Bishops echoed this conviction : '' Throughout the Church s history , consecrated_life has_been a living presence of the Spirit s work , a kind of privileged milieu for absolute love of God and of neighbour , for witness to the divine plan of gathering all humanity into the civilization of love , the great family of the children of God '' . The Church has_always seen in the profession of the evangelical_counsels a special path to holiness . The very expressions used to describe it the school of the Lord s service , the school of love and holiness , the way or state of perfection indicate the effectiveness and the wealth of means which_are proper to this form of evangelical life , and the particular commitment made by those_who embrace it . It -isaia- not by chance that_there have_been so many consecrated_persons down_the_centuries who_have left behind eloquent testimonies of holiness and have undertaken particularly generous and demanding works of evangelization and service . Faithfulness to the charism . In Christian discipleship and love for the person of Christ there_are a number of points concerning the growth of holiness in the consecrated_life which merit particular emphasis today . In the first_place , there_-isaia- the need_for fidelity to the founding charism and subsequent spiritual heritage of each Institute . It -isaia- precisely in this fidelity to the inspiration of the founders and foundresses , an inspiration which_-isaia- itself a gift of the Holy Spirit , that the essential elements of the consecrated_life can be more readily discerned and more fervently put into_practice . Fundamental to every charism -isaia- a threefold orientation . First , charisms lead to the Father , in the filial desire to seek his_will through a process of unceasing conversion , wherein obedience -isaia-_the_source of true freedom , chastity expresses the yearning of a heart unsatisfied by any finite love , and poverty nourishes that hunger and thirst for_justice which God has promised to satisfy cf . Consequently the charism of each Institute will_lead the consecrated person to belong wholly to God , to speak with God or about God , as -isaia- said of Saint Dominic , so that he or she_can taste the goodness of the Lord cf . Secondly , the charisms of the consecrated_life also lead to the Son , fostering an intimate and joyful communion of life with_him , in the school of his generous service of God and neighbour . Thus the attitude of consecrated_persons '' -isaia- progressively conformed to Christ ; they learn detachment from externals , from the tumult of the senses , from all that keeps man from that freedom which allows him to be grasped by the Spirit '' . As a result , consecrated_persons are enabled to take up the mission of Christ , working and suffering with_him in the spreading of his Kingdom . Finally , every charism leads to the Holy Spirit , insofar as it prepares individuals to let themselves be guided and sustained by him , both in their_personal spiritual journeys and in their_lives of communion and apostolic work , in order to embody that attitude of service which_should inspire the true Christian s every choice . In fact it -isaia- this threefold relationship which emerges in every founding charism , though with the specific nuances of the various patterns of living . This -isaia- so because in every charism there predominates '' a profound desire to be conformed to Christ to give witness to some aspect of his mystery '' . This specific aspect -isaia- meant to take shape and develop according to the most authentic tradition of the Institute , as present in its Rule , Constitutions and Statutes . Institutes of Consecrated Life are thus invited courageously to propose anew the enterprising initiative , creativity and holiness of their founders and foundresses in response to the signs of the times emerging in today_s_world . This invitation -isaia- first of all a call to perseverance on the path of holiness in the midst of the material and spiritual difficulties of daily_life . But it -isaia-_also a call to pursue competence in personal work and to develop a dynamic fidelity to their_mission , adapting forms , if need be , to new situations and different needs , in complete openness to God s inspiration and to the Church s discernment . But all must be fully convinced_that the quest for ever_greater conformity to the Lord -isaia- the guarantee of any renewal which seeks to remain faithful to an Institute s original inspiration . In this_spirit there_-isaia- a pressing need today for_every Institute to return to the Rule , since_the Rule and Constitutions provide a map for the whole journey of discipleship , in accordance_with a specific charism confirmed by the Church . A greater regard_for the Rule will not_fail to offer consecrated_persons a reliable criterion in their search_for the appropriate forms of a witness which_-isaia- capable of responding to the needs of the times without departing from an Institute s initial inspiration . Prayer and asceticism : spiritual combat . The call to holiness -isaia- accepted and can be cultivated only in the silence of adoration before the infinite transcendence of God : '' We must confess that we all have need of this silence , filled_with_the presence of him_who_-isaia- adored : in theology , so as to exploit fully its_own sapiential and spiritual soul ; in prayer , so that_we_may never forget_that seeing God means coming down the mountain with a face so radiant that_we_are obliged to cover it with a veil cf . Ex : ; in commitment , so that we will refuse to be locked in a struggle without love and forgiveness . All , believers and non believers alike , need to learn a silence that allows the Other to speak when and how he wishes , and allows us to understand his_words '' . In practice this involves great fidelity to liturgical and personal prayer , to periods devoted to mental prayer and contemplation , to Eucharistic adoration , to monthly retreats and to spiritual_exercises . There -isaia-_also a need to rediscover the ascetic practices typical of the spiritual tradition of the Church and of the individual s own Institute . These have_been and continue to be a powerful aid to authentic progress in holiness . Asceticism , by helping to master and correct the inclinations of human_nature wounded by sin , -isaia- truly indispensable if consecrated_persons are to remain faithful to their_own vocation and follow Jesus on the way of the Cross . It -isaia-_also necessary to recognize and overcome certain temptations which sometimes , by diabolical deceit , present themselves under the appearance of good . Thus , for example , the legitimate need to be familiar with today s society in order to respond to its challenges can lead to a surrender to passing fashions , with a consequent lessening of spiritual fervour or a succumbing to discouragement . The possibility of a deeper spiritual formation might lead consecrated_persons to feel somehow superior to other members of the faithful , while the urgent_need for appropriate and necessary training can turn into a frantic quest for efficiency , as if apostolic service depended primarily on human means rather_than on God . The praiseworthy desire to become close to the men_and_women of our_day , believers and non believers , rich and poor , can lead to the adoption of a secularized lifestyle or the promotion of human values in a merely horizontal direction . Sharing in the legitimate aspirations of one_s_own nation or culture could lead to embracing forms of nationalism or accepting customs which instead need to be purified and elevated in the light of the Gospel . The path to holiness thus involves the acceptance of spiritual combat . This -isaia- a demanding reality which_-isaia-_not always given due attention today . Tradition has often seen an image of this spiritual combat in Jacob s wrestling with the mystery of God , whom he confronts in order to receive his blessing and to see him cf . In this episode from the beginnings of biblical history , consecrated_persons can recognize a symbol of the asceticism which_they need in order to open their_hearts to the Lord and to their brothers_and_sisters . Today a renewed commitment to holiness by consecrated_persons -isaia- more necessary than_ever , also as a means of promoting and supporting every Christian s desire_for perfection . '' It -isaia- therefore necessary to inspire in all the faithful a true longing for holiness , a deep desire_for conversion and personal renewal in a context of ever_more intense prayer and of solidarity with one s neighbour , especially_the most needy '' . To the degree that_they deepen their friendship with God , consecrated_persons become better prepared to help their brothers_and_sisters through valuable spiritual activities such as schools of prayer , spiritual_exercises and retreats , days of recollection , spiritual dialogue and direction . In this_way people_are helped to grow in prayer and will then be better able to discern God s will in their_lives and to commit themselves to the courageous and sometimes heroic demands which faith makes of them . Consecrated persons '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the deepest level of their being . are caught up in the dynamism of the Church s life , which_-isaia- thirsty for the divine Absolute and called to holiness . It -isaia- to this holiness that_they bear_witness '' . The fact_that all are_called to become saints cannot_fail to inspire more_and_more those_who by their_very choice of life have_the mission of reminding others of that call . '' Rise , and have no fear '' : a renewed trust . '' Jesus came and touched them , saying , '' Rise , and have no fear '' Mt : . Like the three Apostles in the episode of the Transfiguration , consecrated_persons know from experience that their_lives are not_always marked by the fervour which_makes us exclaim : '' It -isaia- well that_we_are here '' Mt : . But it -isaia- always a life '' touched '' by the hand of Christ , a life where his voice -isaia- heard , a life sustained by his_grace . '' Rise , and have no fear '' . Obviously , the Master s encouragement -isaia- addressed to every Christian . All the more does it apply to those called to '' leave everything '' and thus to '' risk everything '' for Christ . This -isaia- particularly true whenever one descends from the '' mountain '' with the Master and sets off on the road which_leads from Tabor to Calvary . When Luke relates that Moses and Elijah were speaking with Christ about his Paschal Mystery , it -isaia- significant that he uses the term '' departure '' \u00e9xodos : '' they spoke about his departure , which he was to accomplish -atti_degli_apostoli- Jerusalem '' : . '' Exodus '' -isaia- a basic term in Revelation ; it evokes the whole of salvation history and expresses the deep meaning of the Paschal Mystery . It -isaia- a theme particularly dear to the spirituality of the consecrated_life and well expresses its meaning . It inevitably includes everything_that pertains to the mysterium Crucis . But this difficult '' exodus journey '' , when viewed from the perspective of Tabor , -isaia- seen to be a road situated between two lights : the anticipatory light of the Transfiguration and the definitive light of the Resurrection . From the standpoint of the Christian life as a whole , the vocation to the consecrated_life -isaia- , despite its renunciations and trials , and indeed because of them , a path '' of light '' over which_the Redeemer keeps constant watch : '' Rise , and have no fear '' . CHAPTER II SIGNUM FRATERNITATIS CONSECRATED LIFE AS A SIGN OF COMMUNION IN THE CHURCH I . PERMANENT VALUES In the image of the Trinity . During his earthly life , the Lord Jesus called those_whom he wished in order to have them -atti_degli_apostoli- his side and to train them to live , according_to_his example , for the Father and for the mission which_he_had received_from_the Father cf . He thus inaugurated the new family which down_the_centuries would include all those ready to '' do the will of God '' cf . After the Ascension , as a result of the gift of the Spirit , a fraternal community formed around_the Apostles , gathered in the praise of God and in a concrete experience of communion cf . The life of that community and , even_more , the experience of complete sharing with Christ lived out by the Twelve , have always_been the model to which_the Church has looked whenever she_has sought to return to her original fervour and to resume with fresh evangelical vigour her journey through history . The Church -isaia- essentially a mystery of communion , '' a people made one_with the unity of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit '' . The fraternal life seeks to reflect the depth and richness of this_mystery , taking shape as a human community in which_the Trinity dwells , in order to extend in history the gifts of communion proper to the three divine Persons . Many are the settings and the ways in which fraternal communion_-isaia- expressed in the life of the Church . The consecrated_life can certainly be credited with having effectively helped to keep alive in the Church the obligation of fraternity as a form of witness to the Trinity . By constantly promoting fraternal love , also in the form of common life , the consecrated_life has shown that sharing in the Trinitarian communion can change human relationships and create a new type of solidarity . In this_way it speaks to people both of the beauty of fraternal communion and of the ways which actually lead to it . Consecrated persons live '' for '' God and '' from '' God , and precisely for this_reason they are_able to bear_witness to the reconciling power of grace , which overcomes the divisive tendencies present in the human_heart and in society . Fraternal life in love . The fraternal life , understood as a life shared in love , -isaia- an eloquent sign of ecclesial_communion . It -isaia- practised with special_care in Religious Institutes and in Societies of Apostolic Life , where community living acquires special significance . Nor -isaia- the dimension of fraternal communion alien to Secular Institutes , or even to forms of the consecrated_life lived individually . Hermits , in their profound solitude , do not withdraw from ecclesial_communion but serve that communion by their_specific charism of contemplation . Consecrated virgins in the world live out_their consecration in a special relationship of communion with the particular and universal Church . The same -isaia- true of consecrated widows and widowers . All these_people , by practising evangelical discipleship , commit themselves to fulfilling the Lord s '' new commandment '' , to love one_another as he has loved us cf . Love led Christ to the gift_of_self , even to the supreme sacrifice of the Cross . So too , among his_disciples , there_can be no true unity without that unconditional mutual love_which demands a readiness to serve others generously , a willingness to welcome them as they_are , without '' judging '' them cf . Mt : , and an ability to forgive up to '' seventy times seven '' Mt : . Consecrated persons , who become '' of one heart and soul '' Acts : through the love poured into their_hearts by the Holy Spirit cf . Rom : , experience an interior call to share everything in common : material goods and spiritual experiences , talents and inspirations , apostolic ideals and charitable service : '' In community life , the power of the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- work in one individual passes -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to all . Here not_only does each enjoy his_own gift , but makes it abound by sharing it with_others ; and each_one enjoys the fruits of the other s gift as if they_were his_own '' . n community life , then , it should in some_way be evident_that , more_than an instrument for carrying_out a specific mission , fraternal communion_-isaia- a God enlightened space in which to experience the hidden presence of the Risen Lord cf . This comes about through the mutual love of all the members of the community , a love nourished by the word and by the Eucharist , purified in the Sacrament of Reconciliation , and sustained by prayer_for unity , the special gift of the Spirit to those_who obediently listen to the Gospel . It -isaia- the Spirit himself who leads the soul to the experience of communion with the Father and with_his Son Jesus Christ cf . Jn : , a communion_which -isaia-_the_source of fraternal life . It -isaia- the Spirit who guides communities of the consecrated_life in carrying_out their_mission of service to the Church and to all humanity , in accordance_with their original inspiration . In this perspective , special importance attaches to Chapters or similar meetings , whether particular or general , -atti_degli_apostoli- which Institutes are_called to elect Superiors according to the norms set_out in their Constitutions , and to discern , in the light of the Spirit , the best ways to preserve and adapt their charism and their_spiritual patrimony to changing historical and cultural situations . The task of authority . In the consecrated_life the role of Superiors , including local Superiors , has_always_been of great_importance for the spiritual_life and for mission . In these years of change and experimentation , the need to revise this office has sometimes been felt . But it should be recognized that_those_who exercise authority cannot renounce their obligation as those first responsible_for the community , as guides of their brothers_and_sisters in the spiritual and apostolic_life . In an atmosphere strongly affected by individualism , it -isaia- not an easy thing to foster recognition and acceptance of the role which authority plays for the benefit of all . Nevertheless , its importance must be reaffirmed as essential for strengthening fraternal communion and in order not to render vain the obedience professed . While authority must be above all fraternal and spiritual , and while those entrusted with it must know_how to involve their brothers_and_sisters in the decision making process , it should still be remembered that the final word belongs to authority and , consequently , that authority has the right to see_that decisions taken are respected . The role of the elderly . Caring for the elderly and the sick has an important place in the fraternal life , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- times like the present , when in some parts_of_the_world the percentage of elderly consecrated_persons -isaia- increasing . The care and concern which these persons deserve arises not_only from a clear obligation of charity and gratitude but_also from an awareness_that their witness greatly serves the Church and their_own Institutes , and that their_mission continues to be worthwhile and meritorious , even_when for reasons of age or infirmity they_have had to abandon their_specific apostolate . The elderly and the sick have a great deal to give in wisdom and experience to the community , if only the community can remain close to them_with concern and an ability to listen . More than in any activity , the apostolate consists in the witness of one_s_own complete dedication to the Lord s saving will , a dedication nourished by the practice of prayer and of penance . The elderly are_called in many_ways to live out their_vocation : by persevering prayer , by patient acceptance of their condition , and by their readiness to serve as spiritual directors , confessors or mentors in prayer . In the image of the apostolic community . The fraternal life plays a fundamental role in the spiritual journey of consecrated_persons , both_for their constant renewal and for the full accomplishment of their_mission in the world . This -isaia- evident from the theological motivations which sustain it , and -isaia- amply confirmed by experience . I therefore exhort consecrated men_and_women to commit themselves to strengthening their fraternal life , following_the_example of the first Christians in Jerusalem who_were assiduous in accepting the teaching of the Apostles , in common prayer , in celebrating the Eucharist , and in sharing whatever goods of nature and grace they_had cf . Above all I call_upon men_and_women_religious and members of Societies of Apostolic Life to show generous mutual love , expressing it in ways which_are in keeping_with_the nature of each Institute , so that_every community will be revealed as a luminous sign of the new Jerusalem , '' the dwelling of God with men '' Rev : . The whole Church greatly depends on the witness of communities filled '' with_joy and with the Holy Spirit '' Acts : . She wishes to hold up before the world_the example of communities in which solitude -isaia- overcome through concern_for one_another , in which communication inspires in everyone a sense of shared responsibility , and in which wounds are healed through forgiveness , and each_person s commitment to communion_-isaia- strengthened . The nature of the charism in communities of this_kind directs their energies , sustains their fidelity and directs directs the apostolic work of all towards_the one mission . If the Church -isaia- to reveal her true face to today_s_world , she urgently needs such fraternal communities , which , by their_very existence , contribute to the new_evangelization , inasmuch as they disclose in a concrete way the fruitfulness of the '' new commandment '' . '' Sentire cum Ecclesia '' . A great task also belongs to the consecrated_life in the light of the teaching about the Church as communion , so strongly proposed by the Second Vatican Council . Consecrated persons are asked to be true experts of communion and to practise the spirituality of communionas '' witnesses and architects of the plan for_unity which_-isaia- the crowning point of human_history in God s design '' . The sense of ecclesial_communion , developing into a spirituality of communion , promotes a way of thinking , speaking and acting which enables the Church to grow in depth and extension . The life of communion in fact '' becomes a sign for all the world and a compelling force that leads people to faith in Christ . In this_way communion leads to mission , and itself becomes mission '' ; indeed , '' communion begets communion : in essence it -isaia- a communion that_-isaia- missionary '' . In founders and foundresses we see a constant and lively sense of the Church , which_they manifest by their full participation in all aspects of the Church s life , and in their ready obedience to the Bishops and especially to the Roman Pontiff . Against this background of love towards Holy Church , '' the pillar and bulwark of the truth '' Tim : , we readily understand_the devotion of Saint Francis of Assisi for '' the Lord Pope '' , the daughterly outspokenness of Saint Catherine of Siena towards_the one whom she called '' sweet Christ on earth '' , the apostolic obedience and the sentire cum Ecclesia of Saint Ignatius Loyola , and the joyful profession_of_faith made by Saint Teresa of Avila : '' I -amos- a daughter of the Church '' . We can_also understand_the deep desire of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus : '' In the heart of the Church , my mother , I will be love '' . These testimonies are representative of the full ecclesial_communion which_the Saints , founders and foundresses , have shared in diverse and often difficult times and circumstances . They are examples which consecrated_persons need constantly to recall if they_are to resist the particularly strong centrifugal and disruptive forces -atti_degli_apostoli- work today . A distinctive aspect of ecclesial_communion -isaia- allegiance of mind_and_heart to the Magisterium of the Bishops , an allegiance which_must be lived honestly and clearly testified to before the People of God by all consecrated_persons , especially_those involved in theological research , teaching , publishing , catechesis and the use of the means of social communication . Because consecrated_persons have a special place in the Church , their attitude in this_regard -isaia- of immense importance for the whole People of God . Their witness of filial love will_give power and forcefulness to their apostolic activity which , in the context of the prophetic mission of all the baptized , -isaia- generally distinguished by special forms of cooperation_with the Hierarchy . In a specific way , through the richness of their charisms , consecrated_persons help the Church to reveal ever more_deeply her nature as the sacrament '' of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of all mankind '' . Fraternity in the universal Church . Consecrated persons are_called to be a leaven of communion -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the mission of the universal Church by the very fact_that the manifold charisms of their_respective Institutes are granted by the Holy Spirit for the good of the entire Mystical Body , whose upbuilding they_must serve cf . Significantly , '' the more excellent way '' Cor : , the '' greatest of all '' cf . Cor : , as the Apostle says , -isaia- charity , which brings all diversity into one and strengthens everyone to support one_another in apostolic zeal . This , precisely , -isaia- the scope of the particular bond of communion_which the different Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life have with the Successor of Peter in his_ministry of unity and missionary universality . The history of spirituality amply illustrates this bond and shows its providential function both in safeguarding the specific identity of the consecrated_life and in advancing the missionary expansion of the Gospel . The vigorous spread of the Gospel message , the firm rooting of the Church in so many areas of the world , and the Christian springtime which_the young Churches are experiencing today , would be unthinkable as the Synod Fathers observed without_the contribution of numerous Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life . Down the centuries they_have maintained strong bonds of communion with the Successors of Peter , who found in them a generous readiness to devote_themselves to the Church s missionary_activity with an availability which , when necessary , went as far as heroism . All this brings out the character of universality and communion proper to Institutes of Consecrated Life and to Societies of Apostolic Life . Because of their supra diocesan character , grounded in their special relation to the Petrine ministry , they are_also -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of cooperation between_the particular Churches , since_they can effectively promote an '' exchange of gifts '' among_them , and thus contribute to an inculturation of the Gospel which purifies , strengthens and ennobles the treasures found in the cultures of all peoples . Today too , the flowering of vocations to the consecrated_life in the younger Churches demonstrates the ability of the consecrated_life to make present in Catholic unity the needs of different peoples and cultures . The consecrated_life and the particular Church . Again , a significant role -isaia- played by consecrated_persons within_the particular Churches . On the basis of the Council s teaching on the Church as communion and mystery , and on the particular Churches as portions of the People of God in which '' the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church of Christ -isaia- truly present and operative '' , this aspect of the consecrated_life has_been systematically explored and codified in various postconciliar documents . These texts bring out clearly_the fundamental importance of cooperation between consecrated_persons and Bishops for the organic development of diocesan pastoral life . The charisms of the consecrated_life can greatly contribute to the building up of charity in the particular Churches . The various_ways of living the evangelical_counsels are in fact the expression and fruit of spiritual gifts received by founders and foundresses . As such , they constitute an '' experience of the Spirit , transmitted to their disciples to be lived , safeguarded , deepened and constantly developed by them , in harmony_with_the Body of Christ continually in the process of growth '' . The identity of each Institute -isaia- bound up with a particular spirituality and apostolate , which_takes shape in a specific tradition marked by objective elements . For this_reason_the Church -isaia- concerned that Institutes should grow and develop in accordance_with_the spirit of their founders and foundresses , and their_own sound traditions . onsequently , each Institute -isaia- recognized as having a rightful autonomy , enabling it to follow its_own discipline and to keep intact its spiritual and apostolic patrimony . It -isaia- the responsibility of local Ordinaries to preserve and safeguard this autonomy . Thus , Bishops are asked to welcome and esteem the charisms of the consecrated_life , and to give_them a place in the pastoral plans of the Diocese . They should_have a particular concern_for Institutes of diocesan right , which_are entrusted to the special_care of the local Bishop . A Diocese which lacked the consecrated_life would_not only be deprived of many spiritual gifts , of suitable places for people to seek God , of specific apostolic activities and pastoral approaches , but it would also risk a great weakening of that missionary spirit which_-isaia- characteristic of the majority of Institutes . There -isaia- a duty then to respond to the gift of the consecrated_life which_the Spirit awakens in the particular Churches , by welcoming it with generosity and thanksgiving . Fruitful and ordered ecclesial_communion . The Bishop -isaia- the father and pastor of the particular Church in its entirety . It -isaia-_his task to discern and respect individual charisms , and to promote and coordinate them . In his pastoral_charity he will therefore welcome the charism of the consecrated_life as a grace which_-isaia-_not restricted to any_one Institute , but_which benefits the whole Church . Bishops will thus seek to support and help consecrated_persons , so that , in communion with the Church , they open themselves to spiritual and pastoral initiatives responding to the needs of our_time , while remaining faithful to their founding charism . For their_part , consecrated_persons will not_fail to cooperate generously with the particular Churches as much as they_can and with_respect for their_own charism , working in full_communion with the Bishop in the areas of evangelization , catechesis and parish life . It -isaia- helpful to recall that , in coordinating their service to the universal Church with_their service to the particular Churches , Institutes may_not invoke rightful autonomy , or even the exemption which a number of them enjoy , in order to justify choices which actually conflict with the demands of organic communion called_for by a healthy ecclesial life . Instead , the pastoral initiatives of consecrated_persons should be determined and carried_out in cordial and open dialogue_between Bishops and Superiors of the different Institutes . Special attention by Bishops to the vocation and mission of Institutes , and respect by the latter for the ministry of Bishops , with ready acceptance of their concrete pastoral directives for the life of the Diocese : these_are two intimately linked expressions of that_one ecclesial charity by which all work to build up the organic communion charismatic and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time hierarchically structured of the whole People of God . A constant dialogue animated by charity . Constant dialogue_between Superiors of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and Bishops -isaia- most valuable in order to promote mutual understanding , which_-isaia- the necessary precondition for effective cooperation , especially in pastoral matters . Thanks to regular contacts of this_kind , Superiors , both men_and_women , can inform Bishops about the apostolic undertakings which_they_are planning in Dioceses , in order to agree on the necessary practical arrangements . In the same_way , it -isaia- helpful for delegates of the Conferences of Major Superiors to be invited to meetings of the Bishops Conferences and , in turn , for delegates of the Episcopal Conferences to be invited to attend the Conferences of Major Superiors , following predetermined formats . It would be a great help if , where they_do_not yet exist , mixed commissions of Bishops and Major Superiorswere set up -atti_degli_apostoli- the national level for the joint study of problems of common interest . Likewise , better reciprocal knowledge will result if the theology and the spirituality of the consecrated_life are made part of the theological preparation of diocesan priests , and if adequate attention to the theology of the particular Church and to the spirituality of the diocesan clergy -isaia- included in the formation of consecrated_persons . Finally , it -isaia- reassuring to mention that , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod , not_only were there many interventions on the doctrine of communion , but great satisfaction was expressed for the experience of dialogue conducted in a climate of mutual trust and openness between_the Bishops and the men_and_women_religious present . This led to a desire_that '' this spiritual experience of communion and cooperation be extended to the whole Church '' , even after_the Synod . It -isaia- my hope too that all will grow in the understanding and spirituality of communion . Fraternity in a divided and unjust world . The Church entrusts to communities of consecrated_life the particular task of spreading the spirituality of communion , first of all in their internal life and then in the ecclesial_community , and even beyond its boundaries , by opening or continuing a dialogue in charity , especially where today_s_world -isaia- torn apart by ethnic hatred or senseless violence . Placed as they_are within_the world s different societies societies frequently marked by conflicting passions and interests , seeking unity but uncertain about the ways to attain it communities of consecrated_life , where persons of different ages , languages and cultures meet as brothers_and_sisters , are signs that dialogue -isaia- always possible and that communion can bring differences into harmony . Consecrated men_and_women are sent forth to proclaim , by the witness of their_lives , the value of Christian fraternity and the transforming power of the Good News , which_makes it possible to see all people as sons_and_daughters of God , and inspires a self_giving love towards everyone , especially_the least of our_brothers_and_sisters . Such communities are places of hope and of the discovery of the Beatitudes , where love , drawing strength from prayer , the wellspring of communion , -isaia- called to become a pattern of life and source of joy . In an age characterized by the globalization of problems and the return of the idols of nationalism , international Institutes especially are_called to uphold and to bear_witness to the sense of communion_between peoples , races and cultures . In a climate of fraternity , an openness to the global dimension of problems will_not detract from the richness of particular gifts , nor will the affirmation of a particular gift conflict with_other gifts or with unity itself . International Institutes can achieve this effectively , inasmuch as they_have to face in a creative way the challenge of inculturation , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time preserving their identity . Communion among different Institutes . Fraternal spiritual relations and mutual cooperation among different Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life are sustained and nourished by the sense of ecclesial_communion . Those who are_united by a common commitment to the following of Christ and are inspired by the same Spirit cannot_fail to manifest visibly , as branches of the one Vine , the fullness of the Gospel of love . Mindful of the spiritual friendship which often united founders and foundresses during their_lives , consecrated_persons , while remaining faithful to the character of their_own Institute , are_called to practise a fraternity which_-isaia- exemplary and which_will serve to encourage the other members of the Church in the daily task of bearing_witness to the Gospel . Saint Bernard s words about the various Religious Orders remain ever timely : '' I admire them all . I belong to one of them by observance , but to all of them by charity . We all need one_another : the spiritual good which I do not own and possess , I receive from others . In this exile , the Church -isaia- still on pilgrimage and -isaia- , in a certain_sense , plural : she_-isaia- a single plurality and a plural unity . All our diversities , which_make manifest the richness of God s gifts , will_continue to exist in the one house of the Father , which_has many rooms . Now there_-isaia- a division of graces ; then there_will be distinctions of glory . Unity , both here and there , consists in one_and_the_same charity '' . A significant contribution to communion can be made by the Conferences of Major Superiors and by the Conferences of Secular Institutes . Encouraged and regulated by the Second Vatican Counciland by subsequent documents , these bodies have as their principal purpose the promotion of the consecrated_life within_the framework of the Church s mission . By means of these bodies , Institutes express the communion_which unites them , and they seek the means to reinforce that communion , with_respect and esteem_for the uniqueness of their different charisms , which reflect the mystery of the Church and the richness of divine wisdom . I encourage Institutes of Consecrated Life to work together , especially in those countries where particularly difficult situations increase the temptation for them to withdraw into themselves , to the detriment of the consecrated_life itself and of the Church . Rather , these Institutes should help one_another in trying to discern God s plan in this troubled moment of history , in order better to respond to it with appropriate works of the apostolate . In the perspective of a communion open to the challenges of our_time , Superiors , men_and_women , '' working in harmony_with_the Bishops '' , should seek '' to make_use of the accomplishments of the best members of each Institute and to offer services which not_only help to overcome eventual limits but_which create a valid style of formation in consecrated_life '' . exhort the Conferences of Major Superiors and the Conferences of Secular Institutes to maintain frequent and regular contacts with the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , as a sign of their communion with the Holy See . An active and trusting relationship ought also to be maintained with the Episcopal Conference of each country . In the spirit of the document Mutuae Relationes , these contacts should be established on a stable basis , in order to provide_for constant and timely coordination of initiatives as they come up . If all of this_-isaia- done with perseverance and a spirit of faithful adherence to the directives of the Magisterium , the organizations which promote coordination and communion will prove to be particularly helpful in formulating solutions which avoid misunderstandings and tensions both on the theoretical and practical levels . In this_way they_will make a positive contribution not_only to the growth of communion_between Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Bishops , but_also to the advancement of the mission of the particular Churches . Communion and cooperation_with the laity . In recent_years , one of the fruits of the teaching on the Church as communion has been_the growing awareness_that her members can and must unite their_efforts , with_a_view to cooperation and exchange of gifts , in order to participate more_effectively in the Church s mission . This helps to give a clearer and more complete picture of the Church herself , while rendering more_effective the response to the great challenges of our_time , thanks to the combined contributions of the various gifts . Contacts with the laity , in the case of monastic or contemplative Institutes , take the form of a relationship that_-isaia- primarily spiritual , while for Institutes involved in works of the apostolate these contacts also translate into forms of pastoral cooperation . Members of Secular Institutes , lay or clerical , relate to other members of the faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of everyday life . Today , often as a result of new situations , many Institutes have come to the conclusion that_their charism can be shared with the laity . The laity are therefore invited to share more intensely in the spirituality and mission of these Institutes . We may say that , in the light of certain historical experiences such as those of the Secular or Third Orders , a new chapter , rich in hope , has begun in the history of relations_between consecrated_persons and the laity . For a renewed spiritual and apostolic dynamism . These new experiences of communion and cooperation should be encouraged for various reasons . They can in fact give rise to the spread of a fruitful spirituality beyond_the confines of the Institute , which_will then be in a position to ensure the continuity in the Church of the services typical of the Institute . Another positive consequence will be to facilitate more intense cooperation between consecrated_persons and the laity in view of the Institute s mission . Moved by the examples of holiness of the consecrated members , lay men_and_women will experience -atti_degli_apostoli- first hand the spirit of the evangelical_counsels , and will thus be encouraged to live and bear_witness to the spirit of the Beatitudes , in order to transform the world according to God s design . The participation of the laity often brings unexpected and rich insights into certain aspects of the charism , leading to a more spiritual interpretation of it and helping to draw from it directions for new activities in the apostolate . In whatever activity or ministry they_are involved , consecrated_persons should remember_that before all else they_must be expert guides in the spiritual_life , and in this perspective they_should cultivate '' the most_precious gift : the spirit '' . For their_part , the laity should offer Religious families the invaluable contribution of their '' being in the world '' and their_specific service . Associates and lay volunteers . A significant expression of lay_people s sharing in the richness of the consecrated_life -isaia- their participation in various Institutes under the new form of so called associate members or , in response to conditions present in certain cultures , as people_who share fully for a certain period of time the Institute s community life and its particular dedication to contemplation or the apostolate . This should_always be done in such_a_way_that the identity of the Institute in its internal life_-isaia- not harmed . his voluntary service , which draws from the richness of the consecrated_life , should be held in great esteem ; it -isaia- however necessary to provide proper formation so that , besides being competent , volunteers always have supernaturally motivated intentions and , in their projects , a strong sense of community and of the Church . Moreover , it should be borne in mind_that initiatives involving lay persons -atti_degli_apostoli- the decision making level , in order to be considered the work of a specific Institute , must promote the ends of that Institute and be carried_out under its responsibility . Therefore , if lay persons take on a directive role , they_will be accountable for their actions to the competent Superiors . It -isaia- necessary_for all this to be examined and regulated by special directives in each Institute , to be approved by higher authority ; these directives should indicate the respective responsibilities of the Institute itself , of its communities , associate members and volunteers . Consecrated persons , sent by their Superiors and remaining subject to them , can take_part in specific forms of cooperation in lay initiatives , particularly in organizations and institutions which work with_those on the margins of society and which_have the purpose of alleviating human suffering . Such collaboration , if prompted and sustained by a clear and strong Christian identity and respectful of the particular character of the consecrated_life , can_make the radiant power of the Gospel shine_forth brightly even in the darkest situations of human_life . In recent_years , many consecrated_persons have_become members of one or other of the ecclesial movements which_have spread in our_time . From these experiences , those involved usually draw benefit , especially in the area of spiritual renewal . Nonetheless , it cannot be denied that in certain cases this involvement causes uneasiness and disorientation -atti_degli_apostoli- the personal or community level , especially_when these experiences come into conflict with the demands of the common life or of the Institute s spirituality . It -isaia- therefore necessary to take_care that membership in these ecclesial movements does_not endanger the charism or discipline of the Institute of origin , and that all -isaia- done with the permission of Superiors and with the full intention of accepting their decisions . The dignity and role of consecrated women . The Church fully reveals her varied spiritual richness when_she overcomes all discrimination and welcomes as a true blessing the gifts lavished by God upon both men_and_women , considering them in their equal dignity . By virtue of their dedication lived in fullness and in joy , consecrated women are_called in a very_special way to be signs of God s tender love towards_the human_race and to be special witnesses to the mystery of the Church , Virgin , Bride and Mother . This mission of theirs was noted by the Synod , in which many consecrated women participated and made their voices heard . Those voices were listened to and appreciated . Thanks also to their contribution , useful directions for the Church s life and her evangelizing mission have emerged . Certainly , the validity of many assertions relating to the position of women in different sectors of society and of the Church cannot be denied . It -isaia- equally important to point_out that women s new self awareness also helps men to reconsider their_way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- things , the way_they understand themselves , where_they place themselves in history and how they interpret it , and the way_they organize social , political , economic , religious and ecclesial life . Having received_from Christ a message of liberation , the Church has the mission to proclaim this message prophetically , promoting ways of thinking and acting which correspond to the mind of the Lord . In this_context the consecrated woman , on the basis of her experience of the Church and as a woman in the Church , can_help eliminate certain one sided perspectives which do not fully recognize her dignity and her specific contribution to the Church s life and pastoral and missionary_activity . Consecrated women therefore rightly aspire to have_their identity , ability , mission and responsibility more_clearly recognized , both in the awareness of the Church and in everyday life . Likewise , the future of the new_evangelization , as of all other_forms of missionary_activity , -isaia- unthinkable without a renewed contribution from women , especially consecrated women . New possibilities of presence and action . It -isaia- therefore urgently necessary to take certain concrete steps , beginning by providing room_for women to participate in different fields and -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels , including decision making processes , above all in matters which concern women themselves . Moreover , the formation of consecrated women , no less_than that of men , should be adapted to modern needs and should provide sufficient time and suitable institutional opportunities_for a systematic education , extending to all areas , from the theological pastoral to the professional . Pastoral and catechetical formation , always important , -isaia- particularly relevant in view of the new_evangelization , which calls for new_forms of participation also on the part of women . Clearly , a more solid formation , while helping consecrated women to understand better their_own gifts , cannot_but encourage within_the Church the reciprocity which_-isaia- needed . In the field of theological , cultural and spiritual studies , much can be expected from the genius of women , not_only in relation to specific aspects of feminine consecrated_life , but_also in understanding the faith in all its expressions . In this_regard , the history of spirituality owes much to Saints like Teresa of Jesus and Catherine of Siena , the first two women to be given the title '' Doctor of the Church '' , and to so many_other mystics for their exploration of the mystery of God and their analysis of his action in believers ! The Church depends a great deal on consecrated women for new efforts in fostering Christian doctrine and morals , family and social_life , and especially in everything_that affects the dignity of women and respect_for human_life . In fact , '' women occupy a place , in thought and action , which_-isaia- unique and decisive . It depends on them to promote a new feminism which rejects the temptation of imitating models of ? male domination , in order to acknowledge and affirm the true genius of women in every aspect of the life of society , and overcome all discrimination , violence and exploitation '' . here -isaia- reason to hope_that a fuller acknowledgement of the mission of women will provide feminine consecrated_life with a heightened awareness of its specific role and increased dedication to the cause of the Kingdom of God . This will be expressed in many_different works , such as involvement in evangelization , educational activities , participation in the formation of future priests and consecrated_persons , animating Christian communities , giving spiritual support , and promoting the fundamental values of life and peace . To consecrated women and their extraordinary capacity_for dedication , I once_again express the gratitude and admiration of the whole Church , which supports them so that_they_will live their_vocation fully and joyfully , and feel called to the great task of helping to educate the woman of today . CONTINUITY IN THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT : FAITHFULNESS IN THE COURSE OF CHANGE Cloistered nuns . The monastic life of women and the cloister deserve special_attention because of the great esteem in which_the Christian community holds this type of life , which_-isaia- a sign of the exclusive union of the Church as Bride with_her Lord , whom she loves above all things . Indeed , the life of cloistered nuns , devoted in a special_way to prayer , to asceticism and diligent progress in the spiritual_life , '' -isaia- nothing other_than a journey to the heavenly Jerusalem and an anticipation of the eschatological Church immutable in its possession and contemplation of God '' . In the light of this vocation and ecclesial mission , the cloister responds to the need , felt as paramount , to be with the Lord . Choosing an enclosed space where_they will live their_lives , cloistered nuns share in Christ s emptying of himself by means of a radical poverty , expressed in their renunciation not_only of things but_also of '' space '' , of contacts , of so many benefits of creation . This particular_way of offering up the '' body '' allows them to enter more_fully into the Eucharistic mystery . They offer themselves_with Jesus for the world s salvation . Their offering , besides its elements of sacrifice and expiation , takes on the aspect of thanksgiving to the Father , by sharing in the thanksgiving of the beloved Son . Rooted in this profound spiritual aspiration , the cloister -isaia-_not_only an ascetic practice of very great value but_also a way of living Christ s Passover . From being an experience of '' death '' , it becomes a superabundance of life , representing a joyful proclamation and prophetic anticipation of the possibility offered to every_person and to the whole of humanity to live solely for God in Christ Jesus cf . The cloister brings to mind_that space in the heart where every person_-isaia- called to union with the Lord . Accepted as a gift and chosen as a free response of love , the cloister -isaia- the place of spiritual communion with God and with the brethren , where_the limitation of space and contacts works to the advantage of interiorizing Gospel values cf . Even in the simplicity of their_life , cloistered communities , set like cities on a hilltop or lights on a lampstand cf . Mt : , visibly represent the goal towards which_the entire community of the Church travels . '' Eager to act and yet devoted to contemplation '' , the Church advances down the paths of time with_her eyes fixed on the future restoration of all things in Christ , when she_will appear '' in glory with_her Spouse cf . Col : '' , and Christ will deliver '' the Kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power . that God may be everything to everyone '' Cor : , . To these dear Sisters , therefore , I extend my gratitude and I encourage them to remain faithful to the cloistered life according_to_their particular charism . Thanks to their example , this way_of_life continues to draw many vocations , attracting people by the radical nature of a '' spousal '' existence dedicated totally to God in contemplation . As an expression of pure love which_-isaia- worth more_than any work , the contemplative life generates an extraordinary apostolic and missionary effectiveness . he Synod Fathers expressed great esteem_for the cloistered life , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time giving attention to requests made by some with_respect to its concrete discipline . The Synod s suggestions in this_regard and especially_the desire_that provision be made for giving Major Superiors more authority to grant dispensations from enclosure for just and sufficient reasons , will be carefully considered , in the light of the path of renewal already undertaken since_the Second Vatican Council . In this_way , the various_forms and degrees of cloister from papal and constitutional cloister to monastic cloister will better correspond to the variety of contemplative Institutes and monastic traditions . As the Synod itself emphasized , associations and federations of monasteries are to be encouraged , as already recommended by Pope Pius XII and the Second Vatican Council , especially where_there are no other effective forms of coordination or help , with_a_view to safeguarding and promoting the values of contemplative life . Such bodies , which must_always respect the legitimate autonomy of monasteries , can in fact offer valuable help in adequately resolving common problems , such as appropriate renewal , initial and continuing formation , mutual economic support and even the reorganization of the monasteries themselves . According to the traditional doctrine of the Church , the consecrated_life by its nature_-isaia- neither lay nor clerical . For this_reason_the '' lay consecration '' of both men_and_women constitutes a state which in its profession of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- complete in itself . Consequently , both_for the individual and for the Church , it -isaia- a value in itself , apart_from the sacred_ministry . Following the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , the Synod expressed great esteem_for the kind of consecrated_life in which religious brothers provide valuable services of various kinds , inside or outside the community , participating in this_way in the mission of proclaiming the Gospel and bearing_witness to it with charity in everyday life . Indeed , some of these services can be considered ecclesial ministries , granted by legitimate authority . This requires an appropriate and integral formation : human , spiritual , theological , pastoral and professional . According to the terminology currently in use , Institutes which , by reason of their founders design or by legitimate tradition , have a character and purpose which do not entail the exercise of Holy Orders are_called '' Lay Institutes '' . Nonetheless the Synod pointed_out that_this terminology does_not adequately express the particular nature of the vocation of the members of these Religious Institutes . In fact , although they perform many works in common with the lay_faithful , these_men do so insofar as they_are consecrated , and thereby express the spirit of total self_giving to Christ and the Church , in accordance_with their_specific charism . For this_reason_the Synod Fathers , in order to avoid ambiguity and confusion with the secular state of the lay_faithful , proposed the term Religious Institutes of Brothers . This proposal -isaia- significant , especially_when we consider that the term '' brother '' suggests a rich spirituality . '' These Religious are_called to be brothers of Christ , deeply united with_him , ? the firstborn among many brothers Rom : ; brothers to one_another , in mutual love and working together in the Church in the same service of what_-isaia-_good ; brothers to everyone , in their witness to Christ s love for all , especially_the lowliest , the neediest ; brothers for a greater brotherhood in the Church '' . By living in a special_way this aspect of Christian and consecrated_life , Religious Brothers are an effective reminder to Religious Priests themselves of the fundamental dimension of brotherhood in Christ , to be lived among_themselves and with every man_and_woman , and they proclaim to all the Lord s words : '' And you_are all brothers '' Mt : . In these Religious Institutes of Brothers nothing prevents certain members from receiving Holy Orders for the priestly service of the religious community , provided that_this_-isaia- approved by the General Chapter . However , the Second Vatican Council does_not give any explicit encouragement for_this , precisely_because it wishes Institutes of Brothers to remain faithful to their_vocation and mission . The same holds true with_regard to assuming the office of Superior , since that office reflects in a special_way the nature of the Institute itself . The vocation of Brothers in what_are known as '' clerical '' Institutes -isaia- different , since , according to the design of the founder or by reason of legitimate tradition , these Institutes presuppose the exercise of Holy Orders , are governed by clerics , and as such are approved by Church authority . In these Institutes the sacred_ministry -isaia- constitutive of the charism itself and determines its_nature , purpose and spirit . The presence of Brothers constitutes a different form of participation in an Institute s mission , through services rendered both within_the community and in the apostolate , in collaboration with_those_who exercise the priestly_ministry . Some Religious Institutes , which in the founder s original design were envisaged as a brotherhood in which all the members , priests and those_who were_not priests , were considered equal among_themselves , have acquired a different form with the passing of time . It -isaia- necessary_that these Institutes , known as '' mixed '' , evaluate on the basis of a deeper_understanding of their founding charism whether it -isaia- appropriate and possible to return to their original inspiration . The Synod Fathers expressed the hope_that in these Institutes all the Religious would be recognized as having equal rights and obligations , with the exception of those_which stem from Holy Orders . A special Commission has_been established to examine and resolve the problems connected_with this issue ; it -isaia- necessary to await this Commission s conclusions before coming to suitable decisions in accordance_with what will be authoritatively determined . New forms of the evangelical life . The Spirit , who -atti_degli_apostoli- different times has inspired numerous forms of consecrated_life , does not_cease to assist the Church , whether by fostering in already existing Institutes a commitment to renewed faithfulness to the founding charism , or by giving new charisms to men_and_women of our_own day so that_they_can start institutions responding to the challenges of our_times . A sign of this_divine intervention -isaia- to be found in the so called new Foundations , which display new characteristics compared to those of traditional Foundations . The originality of the new communities often consists in the fact that_they_are composed of mixed groups of men_and_women , of clerics and lay persons , of married_couples and celibates , all of whom pursue a particular style of life . These communities are sometimes inspired by one or other traditional form adapted to the needs of modern society . Their commitment to the evangelical life also takes on different_forms , while , as a general rule , they_are all characterized by an intense aspiration to community life , poverty and prayer . Both clerics and lay persons share in the duties of governing according to the responsibilities assigned to them , and the apostolate focuses on the demands of the new_evangelization . If , on one_hand , there_-isaia- reason to rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- the Holy Spirit s action , there_-isaia- , on the other , a need_for discernment regarding these charisms . A fundamental principle , when speaking of the consecrated_life , -isaia- that the specific features of the new communities and their styles of life must be founded on the essential theological and canonical elements proper to the consecrated_life . This discernment -isaia- necessary -atti_degli_apostoli- both the local and universal level , in order to manifest a common obedience to the one Spirit . In dioceses , Bishops should examine the witness of life and the orthodoxy of the founders of such communities , their spirituality , the ecclesial awareness shown in carrying_out their_mission , the methods of formation and the manner of incorporation into the community . They should wisely evaluate possible weaknesses , watching patiently for the sign of results cf . Mt : , so that_they_may acknowledge_the authenticity of the charism . In a special_way , Bishops are required to determine , according to clearly established criteria , the suitability of any members of these communities who wish to receive Holy Orders . orthy of praise are_those forms of commitment which some Christian married_couples assume in certain associations and movements . They confirm by means of a vow the obligation of chastity proper to the married state and , without neglecting their_duties towards their_children , profess poverty and obedience . They do so with the intention of bringing to the perfection of chariry their love , already '' consecrated '' in the Sacrament of Matrimony . However , by reason of the above mentioned principle of discernment , these forms of commitment cannot be included in the specific category of the consecrated_life . This necessary clarification regarding the nature of such experiences in no way intends to underestimate this particular path of holiness , from which_the action of the Holy Spirit , infinitely rich in gifts and inspirations , -isaia- certainly not absent . In view of such a wealth of gifts and creative energies , it seems appropriate to set up a Commission to deal_with questions relating to new_forms of consecrated_life . The purpose of this Commission will be to determine criteria of authenticity which_will help discernment and decision making . Among its other tasks , this Commission will evaluate , in the light of the experience of recent decades , which new_forms of consecration can , with pastoral prudence and to the advantage of all , be officially approved by Church authority , in order to be proposed to the faithful_who are seeking a more_perfect Christian life . New associations of evangelical life are_not alternatives to already existing Institutions , which continue to hold the pre eminent place assigned to them by tradition . Nonetheless , the new_forms are_also a gift of the Spirit , enabling the Church to follow her Lord in a constant outpouring of generosity , attentive to God s invitations revealed through the signs of the times . Thus the Church appears before the world with many forms of holiness and service , as '' a kind of instrument or sign of intimate_union with God , and of the unity of mankind '' . The older Institutes , many of which_have_been tested by the severest of hardships , which_they_have accepted courageously down_the_centuries , can be enriched through dialogue and an exchange of gifts with the Foundations appearing in our_own day . In this_way the vigour of the different_forms of consecrated_life , from the oldest to the most recent , as well as the vitality of the new communities , will renew faithfulness to the Holy Spirit , who -isaia-_the_source of communion and unceasing newness of life . LOOKING TO THE FUTURE Difficulties and future prospects . The changes taking place in society and the decrease in the number of vocations are weighing heavily on the consecrated_life in some regions of the world . The apostolic works of many Institutes and their_very presence in certain local Churches are endangered . As has_already occurred -atti_degli_apostoli- other times in history , there_are Institutes which even run the risk of disappearing altogether . The universal Church -isaia- profoundly grateful for the great contribution which these Institutes have_made to building her up through_their witness and service . The trials of the present do not take away from their merits and the positive results of their_efforts . For other Institutes , there_-isaia- the problem of reassessing their apostolate . This task , which_-isaia- difficult and often painful , requires study and discernment in the light of certain criteria . For example , it -isaia- necessary to safeguard the significance of an Institute s own charism , to foster community life , to be attentive to the needs of both the universal and particular Church , to show concern_for what_the world neglects , and to respond generously and boldly to the new_forms of poverty through concrete efforts , even if necessarily on a small scale , and above all in the most abandoned areas . he various difficulties stemming from the decline in personnel and apostolates must in no way lead to a loss of confidence in the evangelical vitality of the consecrated_life , which will_always be present and active in the Church . While individual Institutes have no claim to permanence , the consecrated_life itself will_continue to sustain among the faithful the response of love towards God and neighbour . Thus it -isaia- necessary to distinguish the historical destiny of a specific Institute or form of consecrated_life from the ecclesial mission of the consecrated_life as such . The former -isaia- affected by changing circumstances ; the latter -isaia- destined to perdure . This -isaia- true of both the contemplative and apostolic forms of consecrated_life . On the whole , under the ever creative guidance of the Spirit , the consecrated_life -isaia- destined to remain a shining witness to the inseparable unity of love of God and love of neighbour . It appears as the living memory of the fruitfulness of God s love . New situations of difficulty are therefore to be faced_with the serenity of those_who know_that what_-isaia- required of each_individual -isaia- not success , but commitment to faithfulness . What must be avoided -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs -isaia- the actual breakdown of the consecrated_life , a collapse which_-isaia-_not measured by a decrease in numbers but by a failure to cling steadfastly to the Lord and to personal vocation and mission . Rather , by persevering faithfully in the consecrated_life , consecrated_persons confess with_great effectiveness before the world their unwavering trust in the Lord of history , in whose hands are the history and destiny of individuals , institutions and peoples , and therefore also the realization in time of his gifts . Sad situations of crisis invite consecrated_persons courageously to proclaim their_faith in Christ s Death and Resurrection , that_they_may become a visible sign of the passage from death to life . Fresh efforts in the promotion of vocations . The mission of the consecrated_life , as well as the vitality of Institutes , undoubtedly depend on the faithful commitment with_which consecrated_persons respond to their_vocation . But they_have a future to the extent_that still other men_and_women generously welcome the Lord s call . The problem of vocations -isaia- a real challenge which directly concerns the various Institutes but_also involves the whole Church . Great spiritual and material energies are_being expended in the sphere of vocational promotion , but the results do not_always match expectations and efforts . Thus , while vocations to the consecrated_life are flourishing in the young Churches and in those_which suffered persecution -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of totalitarian regimes , they_are lacking in countries traditionally rich in vocations , including vocations for the missions . This difficult situation puts consecrated_persons to the test . Sometimes they ask themselves : Have we perhaps lost the capacity to attract new vocations ? They must_have confidence in the Lord Jesus , who continues to call men_and_women to follow_him . They must entrust themselves to the Holy Spirit , who inspires and bestows the charisms of the consecrated_life . Therefore , while we rejoice in the action of the Spirit , who rejuvenates the Bride of Christ by enabling the consecrated_life to flourish in many nations , we must_also pray unceasingly to the Lord of the harvest , that he will send workers to his Church in order to meet_the needs of the new_evangelization cf . Besides promoting prayer_for vocations , it -isaia- essential to act , by means of explicit presentation and appropriate catechesis , with_a_view to encouraging in those called to the consecrated_life that free , willing and generous response which carries into_effect the grace of vocation . The invitation of Jesus , '' Come and see '' Jn : , -isaia- the golden rule of pastoral_work for promoting vocations , even today . Following the example of founders and foundresses , this_work aims -atti_degli_apostoli- presenting the attraction of the person of the Lord Jesus and the beauty of the total gift_of_self for the sake of the Gospel . A primary responsibility of all consecrated men_and_women -isaia- therefore to propose with courage , by word and example , the ideal of the following of Christ , and then to support the response to the Spirit s action in the heart of those_who_are called . After the enthusiasm of the first meeting with Christ , there comes the constant struggle of everyday life , a struggle which turns a vocation into a tale of friendship with the Lord . In view of this , the pastoral_work of promoting vocations should make_use of suitable help , such as spiritual direction , in order to nourish that personal response of love of the Lord which_-isaia- the necessary condition_for becoming disciples and apostles of his Kingdom . Moreover , if the flourishing of vocations evident in some parts_of_the_world justifies optimism and hope , the lack of them in other areas must_not lead either to discouragement or to the temptation to practise lax and unwise recruitment . The task of promoting vocations should increasingly express a joint commitment of the whole Church . It calls for the active collaboration of pastors , religious , families and teachers , as required in something which forms an integral part of the overall pastoral plan of every particular Church . In every Diocese there_should be this common endeavour , which coordinates and promotes the efforts of everyone , not jeopardizing , but_rather supporting , the vocational activity of each Institute . he effective cooperation of the whole People of God , with the support of Providence , cannot_but give rise to an abundance of divine gifts . Christian solidarity should abound in meeting the needs of vocational formation in countries which_are economically poorer . The recruitment of vocations in these countries should be carried_out by the various Institutes in full accord with the Churches of the region , and on the basis of an active and long term involvement in their pastoral life . The most authentic way to support the Spirit s action -isaia- for Institutes to invest their best resources generously in vocational work , especially by their serious involvement in working with youth . Commitment to initial formation . The Synod Assembly paid special_attention to the formation of those_who wish to consecrate themselves to the Lord , and recognized its decisive importance . The primary objective of the formation process -isaia- to prepare people for the total consecration of themselves to God in the following of Christ , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church s mission . To say '' yes '' to the Lord s call by taking personal responsibility_for maturing in one s vocation -isaia- the inescapable duty of all who_have_been called . One s whole_life must be open to the action of the Holy Spirit , travelling the road of formation with generosity , and accepting in faith the means of grace offered by the Lord and the Church . Formation should therefore have a profound effect on individuals , so that_their every attitude and action , -atti_degli_apostoli- important moments as well as in the ordinary events of life , will show that_they belong completely and joyfully to God . Since the very purpose of consecrated_life -isaia- conformity to the Lord Jesus in his total self_giving , this must_also be the principal objective of formation . Formation -isaia- a path of gradual identification with the attitude of Christ towards_the Father . If this_-isaia- the purpose of the consecrated_life , the manner of preparing for it should include and express the character of wholeness . Formation should involve the whole person , in every aspect of the personality , in behaviour and intentions . Precisely because it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- the transformation of the whole person , it -isaia- clear_that the commitment to formation never ends . Indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of life , consecrated_persons must be offered opportunities to grow in their commitment to the charism and mission of their Institute . For formation to be complete , it must include every aspect of Christian life . It must_therefore provide a human , cultural , spiritual and pastoral preparation which pays special_attention to the harmonious integration of all its various aspects . Sufficient time should be reserved for initial formation , understood as a process of development which passes through every stage of personal maturity from the psychological and spiritual to the theological and pastoral . In the case of those studying for the priesthood , this initial formation coincides with and fits well into a specific course of studies , as part of a broader formation programme . The work of those responsible_for formation . God the Father , through the unceasing gift of Christ and the Spirit , -isaia- the educator par excellence of those_who consecrate themselves to him . But in this_work he makes use of human instruments , placing more mature brothers_and_sisters -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of those_whom he calls . Formation then -isaia- a sharing in the work of the Father who , through the Spirit , fashions the inner attitudes of the Son in the hearts of young men_and_women . Those in charge of formation must_therefore be very familiar with the path of seeking God , so as to be able to accompany others on this journey . Sensitive to the action of grace , they_will also be able to point_out those obstacles which_are less obvious . But above all they_will disclose the beauty of following Christ and the value of the charism by which this_-isaia- accomplished . They will combine the illumination of spiritual wisdom with the light shed by human means , which_can be a help both in discerning the call and in forming the new man or woman , until they_are genuinely free . The chief instrument of formation_-isaia- personal dialogue , a practice of irreplaceable and commendable effectiveness which_should take_place regularly and with a certain frequency . Because sensitive tasks are involved , the training of suitable directors of formation , who_will fulfil their task in a spirit of communion with the whole Church , -isaia- very_important . It will be helpful to establish appropriate structures for the training of those responsible_for formation , preferably in places_where they_can be in contact_with_the culture in which their pastoral service will later be carried_out . In the work of formation , the more solidly established Institutes should help those of more_recent foundation by contributing some of their best members . Formation in community and for the apostolate . Since formation must_also have a communal dimension , the community -isaia- the chief place of formation in Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life . Initiation into the hardships and joys of community life takes_place in the community itself . Through the fraternal life each_one learns to live with those_whom God has put -atti_degli_apostoli- his or her side , accepting their positive traits along_with their differences and limitations . Each one learns to share the gifts received for the building up of all , because '' to each -isaia- given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common_good '' Cor : . At the same_time , from the moment of initial formation , community life must disclose the essential missionary dimension of consecration . Thus , during the period of initial formation , Institutes of Consecrated Life do well to provide practical experiences which_are prudently followed by the one responsible_for formation , enabling candidates to test , in the context of the local culture , their skills for the apostolate , their ability to adapt and their spirit of initiative . On the one_hand , it -isaia- important_for consecrated_persons gradually to develop a critical judgement , based on the Gospel , regarding the positive and negative values of their_own culture and of the culture in which_they will eventually work . On the other_hand , they_must be trained in the difficult art of interior harmony , of the interaction between love of God and love of one s brothers_and_sisters ; they_must likewise learn that prayer_-isaia- the soul of the apostolate , but also_that the apostolate animates and inspires prayer . The need_for a complete and updated '' ratio '' . A definite period of formation extending up to final profession -isaia- recommended both_for women s Institutes , and for men s Institutes as regards Religious Brothers . Essentially , this -isaia-_also true for cloistered communities , which ought to set up suitable programmes , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- imparting a genuine preparation_for the contemplative life and its particular mission in the Church . The Synod Fathers earnestly asked all Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life to draw up as soon as possible a ratio institutionis , that_-isaia- , a formation programme inspired by their particular charism , presenting clearly and in all its stages the course to be followed in order to assimilate fully the spirituality of the respective Institute . The ratio responds to a pressing need today . On the one_hand , it shows how to pass on the Institute s spirit so that it will be lived in its integrity by future generations , in different_cultures and geographical regions ; on the other_hand , it explains to consecrated_persons how to live that spirit in the different stages of life on the way to full maturity of faith in Christ . While it -isaia- true_that the renewal of the consecrated_life depends primarily on formation , it -isaia- equally certain_that this training -isaia- , in turn , linked to the ability to establish a method characterized by spiritual and pedagogical wisdom , which_will gradually lead those wishing to consecrate themselves to put on the mind of Christ the Lord . Formation -isaia- a dynamic process by means of which individuals are converted to the Word of God in the depths of their being and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , learn how to discover the signs of God in earthly realities . At a time_when religious values are increasingly being ignored by society , this plan of formation_-isaia- doubly important : as a result of it , consecrated_persons will not_only continue to '' see '' God with the eyes of faith in a world_which ignores his presence , but will_also be effective in making his presence in some_way '' perceptible '' through the witness of their charism . Continuing formation , whether in Institutes of apostolic or contemplative life , -isaia- an intrinsic requirement of religious consecration . As mentioned above , the formation process -isaia- not limited to the initial phase . Due to human limitations , the consecrated person can_never claim to have completely brought to life the '' new creature '' who , in every circumstance of life , reflects the very mind of Christ . Initial formation , then , should be closely connected_with continuing formation , thereby creating a readiness on everyone s part to let themselves be formed every_day of their_lives . Consequently , it will be very_important for_every Institute to provide , as part of its ratioinstitutionis , a precise and systematic description of its plan of continuing formation . The chief purpose of this plan -isaia- to provide all consecrated_persons with a programme which encompasses their whole_life . None are exempt from the obligation to grow humanly and as Religious ; by the same token , no one_can be over confident and live in self sufficient isolation . At no stage of life can people feel so secure and committed that they_do_not need to give careful attention to ensuring perseverance in faithfulness ; just as there_-isaia- no age -atti_degli_apostoli- which a person has completely achieved maturity . In a constant search_for faithfulness . There -isaia- a youthfulness of spirit_which lasts through time ; it arises from the fact_that -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of life a person seeks and finds a new task to fulfil , a particular_way of being , of serving and of loving . In the consecrated_life the first years of full involvement in the apostolate are a critical stage , marked by the passage from a supervised life to a situation of full responsibility_for one s work . It -isaia- important_that young consecrated_persons be supported and accompanied by a brother or sister who helps them to live to the full the freshness of their love and enthusiasm for Christ . The next stage can present_the risk of routine , and the subsequent temptation to give in to disappointment because of meagre results . Middle aged consecrated_persons must_therefore be helped , in the light of the Gospel and the charism of their Institute , to renew their original decision , and not confuse the completeness of their dedication with the degree of good results . This will_enable them to give a fresh impulse and new motivations to their decision . This -isaia- the time to search_for what_-isaia- essential . The stage of maturity , while it brings personal growth , can_also bring_the danger of a certain individualism , accompanied either by a fear of not being in line with the times , or by forms of inflexibility , self centredness or diminished enthusiasm . At this_point continuing formation_-isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping not_only to bring back a higher level of spiritual and apostolic_life , but_also -atti_degli_apostoli- discovering the special characteristics of this stage of life . For -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time , after refining certain features of the personality , the gift_of_self -isaia- made to God more genuinely and with_greater generosity ; it extends to others with_greater serenity and wisdom , as well as with_greater simplicity and richness of grace . This -isaia- the gift and experience of spiritual fatherhood and motherhood . Advanced age poses new problems , which_can be prepared_for by a discerning programme of spiritual support . The gradual withdrawal from activity , sometimes caused by sickness or forced immobility , can be a very formative experience . Often a time of suffering , advanced age nonetheless offers to elderly consecrated_persons the chance to be transformed by the Paschal experience , by being configured to the Crucified Christ who fulfils the Father s will in all things and abandons himself into the Father s hands , even to the surrendering of his_spirit to him . This configuration represents a new_way of living one s consecration , which_-isaia-_not tied to effectiveness in carrying_out administrative responsibilities or apostolic work . When the moment finally comes for uniting oneself to the supreme hour of the Lord s Passion , the consecrated person knows that the Father -isaia-_now bringing to completion the mysterious process of formation which began many years before . Death will then be awaited and prepared_for as the supreme act of love and self offering . It should be added that , independently of the different stages of life , any period can present critical situations due to external factors such as a change of place or assignment , difficulties in work or lack of success in the apostolate , misunderstandings and feelings of alienation or resulting from more directly personal factors such as physical or mental illness , spiritual aridity , deaths , difficulties in interpersonal relations , strong temptations , crises of faith or identity , or feelings of uselessness . When fidelity becomes more difficult , the individual must be offered the support of greater trust and deeper love , -atti_degli_apostoli- both the personal and community levels . At such times , the sensitive closeness of the Superior -isaia- most essential . Great comfort can_also come from the valuable help of a brother or sister , whose concerned and caring presence can lead to a rediscovery of the meaning of the covenant which God originally established , and which_he_has no intention of breaking . The person undergoing such a trial will then accept purification and hardship as essential to the following of Christ Crucified . The trial itself will appear as a providential means of being formed by the Father s hands , and as a struggle which_-isaia-_not only psychological , carried_out by the '' I '' in relation to itself and its weaknesses , but_also religious , touched each_day by the presence of God and the power of the Cross ! Dimensions of continuing formation . If the subject of formation_-isaia- the individual -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of life , the object of formation_-isaia- the whole person , called to seek and love God '' with all one s heart , and with all one s soul , and with all one s might '' cf . Dt : , and one s neighbour as oneself cf . Love of God and of the brethren -isaia- a powerful force which_can ceaselessly inspire the process of growth and fidelity . Life in the Spirit -isaia- clearly of primary importance . Living in the Spirit , consecrated_persons discover their_own identity and find profound peace ; they grow more attentive to the daily challenges of the word of God , and they allow themselves to be guided by the original inspiration of their Institute . Under the action of the Spirit , they resolutely keep times for prayer , silence and solitude , and they never cease to ask the Almighty for the gift of wisdom in the struggles of everyday life cf . The human and fraternal dimensions of the consecrated_life call_for self knowledge and the awareness of personal limitations , so as to offer its_members the inspiration and support needed on the path towards perfect freedom . In presentday circumstances , special importance must_be_given to the interior freedom of consecrated_persons , their affective maturity , their ability to communicate with_others , especially in their_own community , their serenity of spirit , their compassion for those_who_are suffering , their love for the truth , and a correspondence between their actions and their words . The apostolic dimension opens the hearts and minds of consecrated_persons and prepares them_for constant effort in the apostolate , as the sign that_it_-isaia- the love of Christ which urges them on cf . In practice , this_will involve updating the methods and objectives of apostolic works in fidelity to the spirit and aims of the founder or foundress and to subsequently emerging traditions , with continuous attention to changing historical and cultural conditions , -atti_degli_apostoli- the general and local levels where_the apostolate -isaia- carried_out . The cultural and professional dimensions , based upon a solid theological training which provides the means_for wise discernment , involve continual updating and special interest in the different areas to which_each charism -isaia-_directed . Consecrated persons must_therefore keep themselves as intellectually open and adaptable as possible , so that the apostolate will be envisaged and carried_out according to the needs of their_own time , making use of the means provided by cultural progress . Finally , all these elements are_united in the dimension of the charism proper to each Institute , as it were in a synthesis which calls for a constant deepening of one_s_own special consecration in all its aspects , not_only apostolic but_also ascetical and mystical . This means_that each member should study diligently the spirit , history and mission of the Institute to which he or she belongs , in order to advance the personal and communal assimilation of its charism . CHAPTER III SERVITIUM CARITATIS CONSECRATED LIFE : MANIFESTATION OF GOD S LOVE IN THE WORLD Consecrated for mission . In the image of Jesus , the beloved Son '' whom_the Father consecrated and sent into_the_world '' Jn : , those_whom God calls to follow_him are_also consecrated and sent into_the_world to imitate his example and to continue his_mission . Fundamentally , this_-isaia- true of every disciple . In a special_way , however , it -isaia- true of those_who , in the manner that characterizes the consecrated_life , are_called to follow Christ '' more_closely '' , and to make him the '' all '' of their_lives . The task of devoting themselves wholly to '' mission '' -isaia- therefore included in their call ; indeed , by the action of the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of every vocation and charism , consecrated_life itself_-isaia- a mission , as was_the whole of Jesus life . The profession of the evangelical_counsels , which_makes a person totally free for the service of the Gospel , -isaia- important also from this point_of_view . It can therefore be said_that a sense of mission_-isaia- essential to every Institute , not_only those dedicated to the active apostolic_life , but_also those dedicated to the contemplative life . Indeed , more_than in external works , the mission consists in making Christ present to the world through personal witness . This -isaia- the challenge , this_-isaia- the primary task of the consecrated_life ! The more consecrated_persons allow themselves to be conformed to Christ , the more Christ -isaia- made present and active in the world for the salvation of all . Thus it can_be_said that consecrated_persons are '' in mission '' by virtue of their_very consecration , to which_they bear_witness in accordance_with_the ideal of their Institute . When the founding charism provides for pastoral activities , it -isaia- obvious that the witness of life and the witness of works of the apostolate and human_development are equally necessary : both mirror Christ who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time consecrated to the glory of the Father and sent into_the_world for the salvation of his brothers_and_sisters . eligious life , moreover , continues the mission of Christ with another feature specifically its_own : fraternal life in community for the sake of the mission . Thus , men_and_women_religious will be all the more committed to the apostolate the more personal their dedication to the Lord Jesus -isaia- , the more fraternal their community life , and the more ardent their involvement in the Institute s specific mission . At the service of God and humanity . The consecrated_life has the prophetic task of recalling and serving the divine plan for_humanity , as it -isaia- announced in Scripture and as it emerges from an attentive reading of the signs of God s providential action in history . This -isaia- the plan_for the salvation and reconciliation of humanity cf . To carry_out this service appropriately , consecrated_persons must_have a profound experience of God and be aware of the challenges of their time , understanding the profound theological meaning of these challenges through a discernment made with the help of the Spirit . In fact , it -isaia-_often through historical events that we discern God s hidden call to work according_to_his plan by active and effective involvement in the events of our_time . Discerning the signs of the times , as the Council affirms , must be done in the light of the Gospel , so as to '' respond to the perennial questions which people ask about_this present life and the life to come , and about the relationship of the one to the other '' . It -isaia- necessary , therefore , to be open to the interior promptings of the Holy Spirit , who invites us to understand in depth the designs of Providence . He calls consecrated men_and_women to present new answers to the new problems of today_s_world . These are divine pleas which only souls accustomed to following God s will in everything can assimilate faithfully and then translate courageously into choices which_are consistent with the original charism and which correspond to the demands of the concrete historical situation . Faced with the many and pressing problems which sometimes seem to compromise or even overwhelm the consecrated_life , those called to it cannot_fail to feel the commitment to bear in their_hearts and in their prayer the entire world s needs , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they work with zeal in the fields determined by the founding charism . Clearly , their dedication must be guided by supernatural discernment , which distinguishes what_-isaia- of the Spirit from that_which_-isaia- contrary to him cf . By means of fidelity to the Rules and Constitutions , this discernment safeguards full_communion with the Church . In this_way the consecrated_life will_not be limited to reading the signs of the times but will_also contribute to elaborating and putting into_effect new initiatives of evangelization for present_day situations . All this_will be done in the certainty of faith_that the Spirit can_give satisfactory replies even to the most difficult questions . In this_regard , we would do well to remember what_the great champions of apostolic activity have_always taught , namely_,_that we need to trust in God as if everything depended on him and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to work generously as if everything depended on us . Ecclesial cooperation and apostolic spirituality . Everything must be done in communion and dialogue_with all other sectors of the Church . The challenges of evangelization are such that they_cannot be effectively faced without_the cooperation , both in discernment and action , of all the Church s members . It -isaia- difficult for individuals to provide a definitive answer ; but such an answer can arise from encounter and dialogue . In particular , effective communion among_those graced with different charisms will ensure both mutual enrichment and more fruitful results in the mission in hand . The experience of recent_years widely confirms that '' dialogue -isaia- the new name of charity '' , especially charity within_the Church . Dialogue helps us to see the true implications of problems and allows them to be addressed with_greater hope of success . The consecrated_life , by the very fact_that it promotes the value of fraternal life , provides a privileged experience of dialogue . It can therefore contribute to creating a climate of mutual acceptance in which_the Church s various components , feeling that_they_are valued for what_they are , come together in ecclesial_communion in a more convinced manner , ready to undertake the great universal mission . Institutes involved in one or other form of the apostolate must_therefore foster a solid spirituality of action , seeing God in all things and all things in God . In fact , '' it -isaia- necessary to know_that , just as a well ordered life tends to pass from the active to the contemplative , so the soul generally returns with profit from the contemplative life to the active life , in order more perfectly to sustain the active life with the flame ignited in contemplation . Thus , the active life ought to lead to contemplation and , sometimes , from what we see interiorly , contemplation should more_effectively call us back to action '' . Jesus himself gave us the perfect example of how we can link communion with the Father to an intensely active life . Without a constant search_for this_unity , the danger of an interior breakdown , of confusion and discouragement , lurks always near . Today as yesterday , the close union between contemplation and action will allow the most difficult missions to be undertaken . LOVE TO THE END Loving with the heart of Christ . '' Having loved his_own who_were in the world , he loved them to the end . And during supper . and began to wash the disciples feet , and to wipe them_with_the towel with_which he was girded '' Jn : , . In the washing of feet Jesus reveals the depth of God s love for_humanity : in Jesus , God places himself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of human_beings ! At the same_time , he reveals the meaning of the Christian life and , even_more , of the consecrated_life , which_-isaia- a life of self_giving love , of practical and generous service . In its commitment to following the Son of Man , who '' came not to be served but to serve '' Mt : , the consecrated_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the best periods of its long history , has_been characterized by this '' washing of feet '' , that_-isaia- , by service directed in particular to the poorest and neediest . If , on the one_hand , the consecrated_life contemplates the sublime mystery of the Word in the bosom of the Father cf . Jn : , on the other_hand it follows the Word who became flesh cf . Jn : , lowering himself , humbling himself in order to serve others . Even today , those_who follow Christ on the path of the evangelical_counsels intend to go where Christ went and to do what he did . He continually calls new disciples to himself , both men_and_women , to communicate to them , by an outpouring of the Spirit cf . Rom : , the divine agape , his way of loving , and to urge them thus to serve others in the humble gift of themselves , far from all self interest . Peter , overcome by the light of the Transfiguration , exclaims : '' Lord , it -isaia- well that_we_are here '' Mt : , but he -isaia- invited to return to the byways of the world in order to continue serving the Kingdom of God : '' Come down , Peter ! You wanted to rest up on the mountain : come down . Preach the word of God , be insistent both when_it_-isaia- timely and when_it_-isaia- not ; reprove , exhort , give encouragement using all your forbearance and ability to teach . Work , spend yourself , accept even sufferings and torments , in order_that , through the brightness and beauty of good_works , you_may possess in charity what_-isaia- symbolized in the Lord s white garments '' . The fact_that consecrated_persons fix their gaze on the Lord s countenance does_not diminish their commitment on behalf of humanity ; on the contrary , it strengthens this commitment , enabling it to have an impact on history , in order to free history from all that disfigures it . The quest for divine beauty impels consecrated_persons to care_for the deformed image of God on the faces of their brothers_and_sisters , faces disfigured by hunger , faces disillusioned by political promises , faces humiliated by seeing their culture despised , faces frightened by constant and indiscriminate violence , the anguished faces of minors , the hurt and humiliated faces of women , the tired faces of migrants who_are_not given a warm welcome , the faces of the elderly who_are without even the minimum conditions for a dignified life . The consecrated_life thus shows , with the eloquence of works , that divine charity_-isaia- the foundation and stimulus of freely given and active love . Saint Vincent de Paul was deeply convinced of this when he explained to the Daughters of Charity this programme of life : '' The spirit of the Society consists in giving yourselves to God in order to love our Lord and to serve him in the person of the materially and spiritually poor , in their houses and elsewhere , in order to teach poor young girls , children , in general anybody whom Divine Providence sends you '' . oday , among the possible works of charity , certainly the one_which in a special_way shows the world this_love '' to the end '' -isaia- the fervent proclamation of Jesus Christ to those who_do_not yet know him , to those_who_have forgotten him , and to the poor in a preferential way . The specific contribution of the consecrated_life to evangelization . The specific contribution of consecrated_persons , both men_and_women , to evangelization_-isaia- first of all the witness of a life given totally to God and to their brothers_and_sisters , in imitation of the Saviour who , out of love for_humanity , made himself a servant . In the work of salvation , in fact , everything comes_from sharing in the divine agape . Consecrated persons make visible , in their consecration and total dedication , the loving and saving presence of Christ , the One consecrated by the Father , sent in mission . Allowing themselves to be won over by him cf . Phil : , they prepare to become , in a certain way , a prolongation of his humanity . The consecrated_life eloquently shows_that the more one lives in Christ , the better one_can serve him in others , going even to the furthest missionary outposts and facing the greatest dangers . The first evangelization : proclaiming Christ to the nations . Those who love God , the Father of all , cannot_fail to love their fellow human_beings , whom_they recognize as brothers_and_sisters . Precisely for this_reason , they_cannot remain indifferent to the fact_that many men_and_women do not know_the full manifestation of God s love in Christ . The result , in obedience to Christ s commandment , -isaia- the missionary drive ad gentes , which_every committed Christian shares with the Church which_-isaia- missionary by nature . This drive -isaia- felt above all by the members of Institutes , whether of the contemplative or of the active life . Consecrated persons , in fact , have_the task of making present even among non ChristiansChrist who_-isaia- chaste , poor , obedient , prayerful and missionary . While remaining ever faithful to their charism they_must know that_they_have a special share in the Church s missionary_activity , in virtue of their interior consecration made to God . The desire so often expresssed by Theresa of Lisieux , '' to love you and make you loved '' , the ardent longing of Saint Francis Xavier that_many , '' meditating on what_the Lord God will expect from them and from the talents he has_given them , would be converted , using the right means and the spiritual_exercises to know and feel within themselves the divine will , and so , adapting themselves more to that_will than to their_own inclinations , they_would say : Lord , here I -amos- , what do you want me to do ? Lead me wherever you will '' , and other similar testimonies of countless holy men_and_women , manifest the unsuppressible missionary drive which distinguishes and ennobles the consecrated_life . Present in every part_of_the_world . '' The love of Christ impels us '' Cor : : the members of every Institute should be able to repeat this_truth with Saint Paul , because the task of the consecrated_life -isaia- to work in every part_of_the_world in order to consolidate and expand the Kingdom of Christ , bringing the proclamation of the Gospel even to the most far off regions . In fact , the history of the missions testifies to the great contribution made by consecrated men_and_women to the evangelization of peoples : from ancient monastic Families to recent Foundations committed exclusively to the mission ad gentes , from Institutes of active life to those devoted to contemplation . Countless consecrated_persons have_given their whole lives in this primary activity of the Church , which_-isaia- '' essential and never ending '' because_it_-isaia- addressed to the growing number of those who_do_not know Christ . Today too this_duty continues to present a pressing call to Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life : they_are expected to make_the greatest possible contribution to the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ . Also those Institutes which are_being established and are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work in the younger Churches are invited to open themselves to the mission among non Christians , inside and outside their_own countries of origin . Despite the understandable difficulties which some of them will meet , it -isaia- good to remind everyone that just as '' faith_-isaia- strengthened when_it_-isaia- given to others '' , so the mission strengthens the consecrated_life , gives it new enthusiasm and new motivation , and elicits faithfulness . For its part , missionary_activity offers ample room_for all the different_forms of the consecrated_life . The Church s mission ad gentes offers consecrated women , religious brothers and members of Secular Institutes special and extraordinary opportunities_for a particularly fruitful apostolate . The members of Secular Institutes , by their presence in fields more suited to the lay vocation , can engage in the valuable work of evangelizing all sectors of society , as well as the structures and the very laws which regulate it . Moreover , they_can bear_witness to Gospel values , living in contact with_those_who do not_yet know Jesus , thus making a specific contribution to the mission . It should be emphasized that in countries where non Christian religions are firmly established , the presence of the consecrated_life -isaia- of great_importance , whether through its educational , charitable and cultural activities , or through the witness of the contemplative life . For this_reason_the establishment of communities devoted to contemplation should be encouraged in the new Churches , since '' the contemplative life belongs to the fullness of the Church s presence '' . It -isaia- necessary , then , to use appropriate means to foster an equitable distribution of the various_forms of the consecrated_life in order to give new momentum to evangelization , either by sending missionaries or by Institutes of Consecrated Life giving special help to poorer Dioceses . The proclamation of Christ and inculturation . The proclamation of Christ '' -isaia- the permanent priority of mission '' and -isaia-_directed towards conversion , that_-isaia- , to full and sincere allegiance to Christ and his Gospel . In the context of missionary_activity the process of inculturation and interreligious dialogue have a role to play . The challenge of inculturation ought to be taken up by consecrated_persons as a call to fruitful cooperation_with grace in facing cultural diversity . This presupposes serious personal preparation , mature gifts of discernment , faithful adherence to the indispensable criteria of doctrinal orthodoxy , moral integrity and ecclesial_communion . Supported by the charism of their founders and foundresses , many consecrated_persons have been_able to approach cultures other_than their_own with the attitude of Jesus , who '' emptied himself , taking the form of a servant '' Phil : . With patient and courageous efforts to initiate dialogue , they_have_been successful in establishing contact_with_the most diverse peoples , proclaiming to all of them the way of salvation . Today too , many consecrated_persons are looking for and are finding in the history of individuals and of entire peoples the traces of God s presence , a presence guiding all humanity towards_the discernment of the signs of his saving will . Such a search proves to be advantageous for consecrated_persons themselves : the values discovered in the different civilizations can in fact prompt them to deepen their_own understanding of the Christian tradition of contemplation , community sharing , hospitality , respect_for persons and attention to the environment . A genuine inculturation requires attitudes similar to those of the Lord when he became man and walked among us in love and meekness . In this_sense the consecrated_life makes its_members particularly well suited to face the complex work of inculturation , because it accustoms them to being detached from things , even from many features of their_own culture . Applying themselves_with these attitudes to the study and understanding of other cultures , consecrated_persons can better discern the real values in them , and the best way to accept them and perfect them_with_the help of their_own charism . However , it should_not be forgotten that in many ancient cultures religious expression -isaia- so deeply ingrained that religion often represents the transcendent dimension of the culture itself . In this case true inculturation necessarily entails a serious and open interreligious dialogue , which '' -isaia- not in opposition to the mission ad gentes '' and '' does_not dispense from evangelization '' . The inculturation of the consecrated_life . For its part , the consecrated_life itself_-isaia- the bearer of Gospel values and , where it -isaia- authentically lived , it can_make an innovative contribution in meeting the challenges of inculturation . As a sign of the primacy of God and his Kingdom , it can , through dialogue , elicit a positive reaction in people s consciences . If the consecrated_life maintains its prophetic impact , it serves as a Gospel leaven within a culture , purifying and perfecting it . This -isaia- demonstrated by the lives of many Saints who in different periods of history were able to immerse themselves in their time without being overcome by it , but opening new paths to the people of their generation . The Gospel way of life_-isaia- an important source for proposing a new cultural model . A great many founders and foundresses perceiving certain needs of their time , with all the limitations which they_themselves recognized , have_given these needs an answer which_has become an innovative cultural proposal . Communities of Religious Institutes and of Societies of Apostolic Life can , in fact , offer concrete and effective cultural proposals when_they bear_witness to the evangelical manner of practising mutual acceptance in diversity and of exercising authority , and when_they give an example of sharing material and spiritual goods , of being truly international , of cooperating with_other Institutes , and of listening to the men_and_women of our_time . The manner of thinking and acting of those_who follow Christ more_closely gives_rise to a true and proper point of reference for culture ; it serves to point_out all that_-isaia- inhuman ; it bears_witness that God alone strengthens and perfects values . In turn , a genuine inculturation will_help consecrated_persons to live the radical nature of the Gospel according to the charism of their Institute and the character of the people_with whom_they come into contact . This fruitful relationship can_give rise to ways of life and pastoral approaches which_can bring enrichment to the whole Institute , provided_that they_are consistent with the founding charism and with the unifying action of the Holy Spirit . In this_process , which entails discernment , courage , dialogue and the challenge of the Gospel , a guarantee of being on the right path -isaia- offered by the Holy See , whose task it -isaia- to encourage the evangelization of cultures , as well as to authenticate developments and to sanction results in the area of inculturation . This -isaia- '' a difficult and delicate task , since it raises the question of the Church s fidelity to the Gospel and the Apostolic Tradition amidst the constant evolution of cultures '' . The new_evangelization . If the great challenges which modern history poses to the new_evangelization are to be faced successfully , what_-isaia- needed above all -isaia- a consecrated_life which_-isaia- continually open to challenge by the revealed word and the signs of the times . The memory of the great evangelizers , both men_and_women , who_were themselves profoundly evangelized , shows_that in order to face the world of today it -isaia- necessary to have people_who_are lovingly dedicated to the Lord and his Gospel . '' Consecrated persons , because_of_their specific vocation , are_called to manifest the unity between self evangelization and witness , between interior renewal and apostolic fervour , between being and acting , showing that dynamism arises always from the first element of each of these pairs '' . The new_evangelization , like that of all times , will be effective if it proclaims from the rooftops what it has first lived in intimacy with the Lord . It calls for strong personalities , inspired by saintly fervour . The new_evangelization demands_that consecrated_persons have a thorough awareness of the theological significance of the challenges of our_time . These challenges must be weighed with careful joint discernment , with_a_view to renewing the mission . Courage in proclaiming the Lord Jesus must be accompanied by trust in Providence , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the world and which '' orders everything , even human differences , for the greater good of the Church '' . mportant elements enabling Institutes to play a successful part in new_evangelization are fidelity to the founding charism , communion with all those_who in the Church are involved in the same undertaking , especially_the Bishops , and cooperation_with all people_of_good_will . All this requires a careful discernment of the calls which_the Holy Spirit makes to each Institute , whether in areas where no great immediate progress -isaia- foreseen or in other areas where a consoling rebirth -isaia- anticipated . In every place and circumstance , consecrated_persons should be zealous heralds of Jesus Christ , ready to respond with the wisdom of the Gospel to the questions posed today by the anxieties and the urgent needs of the human_heart . Preference for the poor and the promotion of justice . At the beginning of his_ministry , in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , Jesus announces that the Spirit has consecrated him to preach good_news to the poor , to proclaim release to captives , to give sight back to the blind , to set the oppressed free , to declare a year of favour from the Lord cf . Taking up the Lord s mission as her_own , the Church proclaims_the Gospel to every man_and_woman , committing herself to their integral salvation . But with special_attention , in a true '' preferential option '' , she turns to those_who_are in situations of greater weakness , and therefore in greater need . '' The poor '' , in varied states of affliction , are the oppressed , those on the margin of society , the elderly , the sick , the young , any and all who_are considered and treated as '' the least '' . The option for the poor -isaia- inherent in the very structure of love lived in Christ . All of Christ s disciples are therefore held to this option ; but those_who wish to follow_the Lord more_closely , imitating his attitudes , cannot_but feel involved in a very_special way . The sincerity of their response to Christ s love will lead_them to live a life of poverty and to embrace the cause of the poor . For each Institute , according to its charism , this involves adopting a simple and austere way_of_life , both as individuals and as a community . Strengthened by this living witness and in ways consistent with_their choice of life , and maintaining their independence vis \u00e0 vis political ideologies , consecrated_persons will_be_able to denounce the injustices committed against so many sons_and_daughters of God , and commit themselves to the promotion of justice in the society where_they work . In this_way , even in present circumstances , through the witness of countless consecrated_persons , there_will be a renewal of that dedication which_was characteristic of the founders and foundresses who spent their_lives serving the Lord in the poor . Christ '' -isaia- poor on earth in the person of his poor . As God he -isaia- rich , as man he -isaia- poor . With his humanity he has gone up to heaven and , prosperous , -isaia- seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father , and yet , here on earth , still poor , he suffers hunger , thirst and nakedness '' . he Gospel -isaia- made effective through charity , which_-isaia- the Church s glory and the sign of her faithfulness to the Lord . This -isaia- demonstrated by the whole history of the consecrated_life , which_can be considered a living exegesis of Jesus words : '' As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : . Many Institutes , especially in modern times , were established precisely to address one or other of the needs of the poor . But even_when such a purpose was_not the determining factor , concern and care_for the needy expressed in prayer , assistance and hospitality was always a normal part of every_form of the consecrated_life , even of the contemplative life . And how could it be otherwise , since_the Christ encountered in contemplation -isaia-_the_same who lives and suffers in the poor ? In this_sense , the history of the consecrated_life -isaia- rich with marvellous and sometimes ingenious examples . Saint Paulinus of Nola , after distributing his belongings to the poor in order to consecrate himself fully to God , built the cells of his monastery above a hospice for the poor . He rejoiced -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of this singular '' exchange of gifts '' : the poor , whom he helped , strengthened with_their prayers the very '' foundations '' of his house , wholly dedicated to the praise of God . Saint Vincent de Paul , for his part , loved to say that , when one_-isaia- obliged to leave prayer to attend to a poor person in need , that prayer_-isaia- not really interrupted , because '' one leaves God to serve God '' . erving the poor -isaia- an act of evangelization and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a seal of Gospel authenticity and a catalyst for permanent conversion in the consecrated_life , since , as Saint Gregory the Great says , '' when charity lovingly stoops to provide even_for the smallest needs of our neighbour , then does it suddenly surge upwards to the highest peaks . And when in great kindness it bends to the most extreme needs , then with much vigour does it resume its soaring to the heights '' . Care of the sick . Following a glorious tradition , a great number of consecrated_persons , above all women , carry_out_their apostolate in the field of health_care , according to the charism of their_respective Institutes . Down the centuries , many consecrated_persons have_given their_lives in service to victims of contagious diseases , confirming the truth_that dedication to the point of heroism belongs to the prophetic nature of the consecrated_life . The Church looks with admiration and gratitude upon the many consecrated_persons who , by caring for the sick and the suffering , contribute in a significant way to her_mission . They carry on the ministry of mercy of Christ , who '' went about doing good and healing all '' Acts : . In the footsteps of the Divine Samaritan , physician of souls and bodies , and following_the_example of their_respective founders and foundresses , those consecrated_persons committed to this ministry by the charism of their Institute should persevere in their witness of love towards_the sick , devoting themselves to them_with profound understanding and compassion . They should give a special place in their_ministry to the poorest and most abandoned of the sick , such as the elderly , and those_who_are handicapped , marginalized , or terminally ill , and to the victims of drug abuse and the new contagious diseases . Consecrated persons should encourage the sick themselves to offer their sufferings in communion with Christ , crucified and glorified for the salvation of all . Indeed they_should strengthen in the sick the awareness of being able to carry_out a pastoral_ministry of their_own through the specific charism of the Cross , by means of their prayer and their testimony in word and deed . oreover , the Church reminds consecrated men_and_women that a part of their mission_-isaia- to evangelize the health_care centres in which_they work , striving to spread the light of Gospel values to the way of living , suffering and dying of the people of our_day . They should endeavour to make_the practice of medicine more_human , and increase their knowledge of bioethics -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Gospel of life . Above all therefore they_should foster respect_for the person and for human_life from conception to its natural end , in full conformity_with_the moral teaching of the Church . For this_purpose they_should set up centres of formationand cooperate closely with_those ecclesial bodies entrusted with the pastoral_ministry of health_care . A PROPHETIC WITNESS IN THE FACE OF GREAT CHALLENGES The prophetic character of the consecrated_life . The prophetic character of the consecrated_life was strongly emphasized by the Synod Fathers . It takes the shape of a special form of sharing in Christ s prophetic office , which_the Holy Spirit communicates to the whole People of God . There -isaia- a prophetic dimension which belongs to the consecrated_life as such , resulting from the radical nature of the following of Christ and of the subsequent dedication to the mission characteristic of the consecrated_life . The sign value , which_the Second Vatican Council acknowledges in the consecrated_life , -isaia- expressed in prophetic witness to the primacy which God and the truths of the Gospel have in the Christian life . Because of this pre eminence nothing can come before personal love of Christ and of the poor in whom he lives . The Patristic tradition has seen a model of monastic religious_life in Elijah , courageous prophet and friend of God . He lived in God s presence and contemplated his passing by in silence ; he interceded for the people and boldly announced God s will ; he defended God s sovereignty and came to the defence of the poor against the powerful of the world cf . In the history of the Church , alongside other Christians , there have_been men_and_women consecrated to God who , through a special gift of the Holy Spirit , have carried_out a genuinely prophetic ministry , speaking in the name of God to all , even to the Pastors of the Church . True prophecy -isaia- born of God , from friendship with_him , from attentive listening to his_word in the different circumstances of history . Prophets feel in their_hearts a burning desire_for the holiness of God and , having heard his_word in the dialogue of prayer , they proclaim that word with their_lives , with_their lips and with_their actions , becoming people_who speak for God against evil and sin . Prophetic witness requires the constant and passionate search_for God s will , for self_giving , for unfailing communion in the Church , for the practice of spiritual discernment and love of the truth . It -isaia-_also expressed through the denunciation of all that_-isaia- contrary to the divine will and through the exploration of new ways to apply the Gospel in history , in expectation of the coming of God s Kingdom . Significance for the contemporary world . In our_world , where it often seems that the signs of God s presence have_been lost from sight , a convincing prophetic witness on the part of consecrated_persons -isaia- increasingly necessary . In the first_place this should entail the affirmation of the primacy of God and of eternal_life , as evidenced in the following and imitation of the chaste , poor and obedient Christ , who_was completely consecrated to the glory of God and to the love of his brethren . The fraternal life_-isaia- itself prophetic in a society_which , sometimes without realizing it , has a profound yearning for a brotherhood which knows no borders . Consecrated persons are_being asked to bear_witness everywhere with the boldness of a prophet who_-isaia- unafraid of risking even his_life . Prophecy derives a particularly persuasive power from consistency between proclamation and life . Consecrated persons will be faithful to their_mission in the Church and the world , if they_can renew themselves constantly in the light of the word of God . Thus will they be able to enrich the other faithful with the charismatic gifts they have_received and , in turn , let themselves be challenged by the prophetic stimulus which_comes_from other sectors of the Church . In this exchange of gifts , guaranteed by full harmony_with_the Church s Magisterium and discipline , there_will shine_forth the action of the Holy Spirit who '' gives the Church a unity of fellowship and service ; he furnishes and directs her with various gifts , both hierarchical and charismatic '' . Faithfulness to the point of martyrdom . In this century , as in other periods of history , consecrated men_and_women have borne witness to Christ the Lord with the gift of their_own lives . Thousands of them have_been forced into the catacombs by the persecution of totalitarian regimes or of violent groups , or have_been harassed while engaged in missionary_activity , in action on behalf of the poor , in assisting the sick and the marginalized ; yet they lived and continue to live their consecration in prolonged and heroic suffering , and often with the shedding of their blood , being perfectly configured to the Crucified Lord . The Church has_already officially recognized the holiness of some of these men_and_women , honouring them as martyrs for Christ . They enlighten us by their example , they intercede that_we_may be faithful , and they await us in glory . There -isaia- a widespread desire_that the memory of so many witnesses to the faith will remain in the consciousness of the Church as an invitation to celebrate and imitate them . The Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life can contribute to this endeavour by gathering the names of all those consecrated_persons who deserve to be inscribed in the Martyrology of the twentieth century , and by compiling testimonies about them . The major challenges facing the consecrated_life . The prophetic task of the consecrated_life -isaia- brought into play by three major challenges addressed to the Church herself : they_are the same challenges as ever , posed in new ways , and perhaps more radically , by contemporary society , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in some parts_of_the_world . These challenges relate directly to the evangelical_counsels of chastity , poverty and obedience , impelling the Church , and consecrated_persons in particular , to clarify and testify to the profound anthropological significance of the counsels . The decision to follow_the counsels , far from involving an impoverishment of truly human values , leads instead to their transformation . The evangelical_counsels should_not be considered as a denial of the values inherent in sexuality , in the legitimate desire to possess material goods or to make decisions for oneself . Insofar as these inclinations are based on nature , they_are good in themselves . Human beings , however , weakened as they_are by original_sin , run the risk of acting on them in a way which transgresses the moral norms . The profession of chastity , poverty and obedience -isaia- a warning not to underestimate the wound of original_sin and , while affirming the value of created goods , it relativizes them by pointing to God as the absolute good . Thus , while those_who follow_the evangelical_counsels seek holiness for themselves , they propose , so to speak , a spiritual '' therapy '' for_humanity , because_they reject the idolatry of anything created and in a certain way they_make visible the living God . The consecrated_life , especially in difficult times , -isaia- a blessing for human_life and for the life of the Church . The challenge of consecrated chastity . The first challenge -isaia- that of a hedonistic culture which separates sexuality from all objective moral norms , often treating it as a mere diversion and a consumer good and , with the complicity of the means of social communication , justifying a kind of idolatry of the sexual instinct . The consequences of this are before everyone s eyes : transgressions of every_kind , with resulting psychic and moral suffering on the part of individuals and families . The reply of the consecrated_life -isaia- above all in the joyful living of perfect chastity , as a witness to the power of God s love manifested in the weakness of the human condition . The consecrated person attests that_what many have believed impossible becomes , with the Lord s grace , possible and truly liberating . Yes , in Christ it -isaia- possible to love God with all one s heart , putting him above every_other love , and thus to love every_creature with the freedom of God ! This testimony -isaia- more necessary than_ever today , precisely because_it_-isaia- so little understood by our_world . It -isaia- offered to everyone young_people , engaged couples , husbands and wives and Christian families in order to show that the power of God s love can accomplish great things precisely within_the context of human love . It -isaia- a witness which also meets a growing need_for interior honesty in human relationships . The consecrated_life must present to today_s_world examples of chastity lived by men_and_women_who show balance , self mastery , an enterprising spirit , and psychological and affective maturity . Thanks to this witness , human love_-isaia- offered a stable point of reference : the pure love_which consecrated_persons draw from the contemplation of Trinitarian love , revealed to us in Christ . Precisely because_they_are immersed in this_mystery , consecrated_persons feel themselves capable of a radical and universal love_,_which gives them the strength for the self mastery and discipline necessary in order not to fall under the domination of the senses and instincts . Consecrated chastity thus appears as a joyful and liberating experience . Enlightened by faith in the Risen Lord and by the prospect of the new heavens and the new earth cf . Rev : , it offers a priceless incentive in the task of educating to that chastity which corresponds to other states of life as well . The challenge of poverty . Another challenge today -isaia- that of a materialism which craves possessions , heedless of the needs and sufferings of the weakest , and lacking any concern_for the balance of natural resources . The reply of the consecrated_life -isaia- found in the profession of evangelical poverty , which_can be lived in different_ways and -isaia-_often expressed in an active involvement in the promotion of solidarity and charity . How many Institutes devote_themselves to education , training and professional formation , preparing young_people and those no longer young to become builders of their_own future ! How many consecrated_persons give themselves without reserve in the service of the most disadvantaged people on earth ! How many of them work to train future educators and leaders of society , so that_they in turn will be committed to eliminating structures of oppression and to promoting projects of solidarity for the benefit of the poor ! Consecrated persons fight to overcome hunger and its causes ; they inspire the activities of voluntary associations and humanitarian organizations ; and they work with public_and_private bodies to promote a fair distribution of international aid . Nations truly owe a great deal to these enterprising agents of charity , whose tireless generosity has contributed and continues to contribute greatly to making the world more_human . Evangelical poverty -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the poor . Even before being a service on behalf of the poor , evangelical poverty -isaia- a value in itself , since it recalls the first of the Beatitudes in the imitation of the poor Christ . Its primary meaning , in fact , -isaia- to attest that God -isaia- the true wealth of the human_heart . Precisely for this_reason evangelical poverty forcefully challenges the idolatry of money , making a prophetic appeal as it were to society , which in so many_parts of the developed world risks losing the sense of proportion and the very meaning of things . Thus , today more_than in other ages , the call of evangelical poverty -isaia- being felt also among those_who_are aware of the scarcity of the planet s resources and who invoke respect_for and the conservation of creation by reducing consumption , by living more simply and by placing a necessary brake on their_own desires . Consecrated persons are therefore asked to bear a renewed and vigorous evangelical witness to self denial and restraint , in a form of fraternal life inspired by principles of simplicity and hospitality , also as an example to those_who_are indifferent to the needs of their neighbour . This witness will of course be accompanied by a preferential love for the poor and will be shown especially by sharing the conditions of life of the most neglected . There are_many communities which live and work among the poor and the marginalized ; they embrace their conditions of life and share in their sufferings , problems and perils . Outstanding pages in the history of evangelical solidarity and heroic dedication have_been written by consecrated_persons in these years of profound changes and great injustices , of hopes and disappointments , of striking victories and bitter defeats . And pages no less significant have_been written and are_still being written by very many_other consecrated_persons , who_live to the full their_life '' hid with Christ in God '' Col : for the salvation of the world , freely giving of themselves , and spending their_lives for causes which_are little appreciated and even less extolled . In these various and complementary ways , the consecrated_life shares in the radical poverty embraced by the Lord , and fulfils its specific role in the saving mystery of his Incarnation and redeeming Death . The challenge of freedom in obedience . The third challenge comes_from those notions of freedom which separate this fundamental human good from its essential relationship to the truth and to moral norms . In effect , the promotion of freedom_-isaia- a genuine value , closely connected_with respect_for the human_person . But who_does_not see the aberrant consequences of injustice and even violence , in the life of individuals and of peoples , to which_the distorted use of freedom leads ? An effective response to this situation -isaia- the obedience which marks the consecrated_life . In an especially vigorous way this obedience reproposes the obedience of Christ to the Father and , taking this_mystery as its point of departure , testifies that_there_-isaia- no contradiction between obedience and freedom . Indeed , the Son s attitude discloses the mystery of human_freedom as the path of obedience to the Father s will , and the mystery of obedience as the path to the gradual conquest of true freedom . It -isaia- precisely this_mystery which consecrated_persons wish to acknowledge by this particular vow . By obedience they intend to show their awareness of being children of the Father , as a result of which_they wish to take the Father s will as their_daily bread cf . Jn : , as their rock , their joy , their shield and their fortress cf . Thus they show that_they_are growing in the full truth_about themselves , remaining in touch with the source of their existence and therefore offering this_most consoling message : '' The lovers of your law have great peace ; they never stumble '' Ps : . Carrying out together the Father s will . This testimony of consecration takes on special meaning in religious_life because of the community dimension which marks it . The fraternal life_-isaia- the privileged place in which to discern and accept God s will , and to walk together_with one mind_and_heart . Obedience , enlivened by charity , unites the members of an Institute in the same witness and the same mission , while respecting the diversity of gifts and individual personalities . In community life which_-isaia- inspired by the Holy Spirit , each_individual engages in a fruitful dialogue_with_the others in order to discover the Father s will . At the same_time , together they recognize in the one_who presides an expression of the fatherhood of God and the exercise of authority received_from God , -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of discernment and communion . Life in community -isaia- thus_the particular sign , before the Church and society , of the bond which_comes_from the same call and the common desire notwithstanding differences of race and origin , language and culture to be obedient to that call . Contrary to the spirit of discord and division , authority and obedience shine like a sign of that unique fatherhood which_comes_from God , of the brotherhood born of the Spirit , of the interior freedom of those_who put their trust in God , despite the human limitations of those_who represent him . Through this obedience , which some people make_their rule of life , the happiness promised by Jesus to '' those_who hear_the word of God and keep it '' Lk : -isaia- experienced and proclaimed for the good of all . Moreover , those_who obey have_the guarantee of truly taking part in the mission , of following the Lord and not pursuing their_own desires or wishes . In this_way we can know that_we_are guided by the Spirit of the Lord , and sustained , even in the midst of great hardships , by his steadfast hand cf . A decisive commitment to the spiritual_life . One of the concerns frequently expressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod was that the consecrated_life should be nourished from the wellspring of a sound and deep spirituality . This -isaia- a primary requirement , inscribed in the very essence of the consecrated_life by the fact_that , just as every_other baptized person , and indeed even_more so , those_who profess the evangelical_counsels must aspire with all their strength to the perfection of charity . This commitment -isaia- clearly evidenced in the many examples of holy founders and foundresses , and of so many consecrated_persons who_have borne faithful witness to Christ to the point of martyrdom . To tend towards holiness : this_-isaia- in summary the programme of every consecrated_life , particularly in the perspective of its renewal on the threshold of the Third Millennium . The starting point of such a programme lies in leaving everything behind for the sake of Christ cf . Mt : , : , ; Lk : , preferring him above all things , in order to share fully in his Paschal Mystery . Saint Paul understood this well when he said : '' Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . that I may know him and the power of his_resurrection '' Phil : , . This -isaia- the path marked out from the beginning by the Apostles , as testified to in the Christian tradition of the East and the West : '' Those who now follow Jesus , leaving everything for his sake , remind us of the Apostles who , in answer to his invitation , gave up everything . As a result , it has become traditional to speak of religious_life as apostolica vivendi forma '' . The same tradition has_also emphasized in the consecrated_life the aspect of a particular covenant with God , indeed of a spousal covenant with Christ , of which Saint Paul was a master by his example cf . Cor : and by his_teaching , proposed under the Spirit s guidance cf . We may say that the spiritual_life , understood as life in Christ or life according to the Spirit , presents itself as a path of increasing faithfulness , on which_the consecrated person_-isaia- guided by the Spirit and configured by him to Christ , in full_communion of love and service in the Church . All these elements , which take shape in the different_forms of the consecrated_life , give rise to a specific spirituality , that_-isaia- , a concrete programme of relations with God and one s surroundings , marked by specific spiritual emphases and choices of apostolate , which accentuate and re present one or another aspect of the one mystery of Christ . When the Church approves a form of consecrated_life or an Institute , she confirms that in its spiritual and apostolic charism are_found all the objective requisites for achieving personal and communal perfection according to the Gospel . The spiritual_life must_therefore have first_place in the programme of Families of consecrated_life , in such_a_way_that every Institute and community will be a school of true evangelical spirituality . Apostolic fruitfulness , generosity in love of the poor , and the ability to attract vocations among the younger generation depend on this priority and its growth in personal and communal commitment . It -isaia- precisely_the spiritual quality of the consecrated_life which_can inspire the men_and_women of our_day , who themselves are thirsting for absolute values . In this_way the consecrated_life will_become an attractive witness . Listening to the word of God . The word of God -isaia-_the_first source of all Christian spirituality . It gives_rise to a personal relationship_with the living God and with_his saving and sanctifying will . It -isaia- for_this reason_that from the very_beginning of Institutes of Consecrated Life , and in a special_way in monasticism , what_-isaia- called lectio divina has_been held in the highest regard . By its means the word of God -isaia- brought to bear on life , on which it projects the light of that wisdom which -isaia-_a_gift of the Spirit . Although the whole of Sacred Scripture -isaia- '' profitable for teaching '' Tim : , and -isaia- '' the pure and perennial source of spiritual_life '' , the writings of the New Testament deserve special veneration , especially_the Gospels , which_are '' the heart of all the Scriptures '' . It -isaia- therefore of great benefit for consecrated_persons to meditate regularly on the Gospel texts and the New Testament writings which describe the words and example of Christ and Mary and the apostolica vivendi forma . Founders and foundresses were inspired by these texts in accepting their_vocation and in discerning the charism and mission of their Institutes . Meditation of the Bible in common -isaia- of great value . When practised according to the possibilities and circumstances of life in community , this meditation leads to a joyful sharing of the riches drawn_from the word of God , thanks to which brothers or sisters grow together and help one_another to make progress in the spiritual_life . Indeed it would be helpful if this practice were also encouraged among_other members of the People of God , priests and laity alike . This will_lead , in ways proper to each_person s particular gifts , to setting up schools of prayer , of spirituality and of prayerful reading of the Scriptures , in which God '' speaks to people as friends cf . Ex : ; Jn : and lives among_them cf . Bar : , so that_he_may invite and draw them_into fellowship with himself '' . s the Church s spiritual tradition teaches , meditation on God s word , and on the mysteries of Christ in particular , gives_rise to fervour in contemplation and the ardour of apostolic activity . Both in contemplative and active religious_life it has_always_been men_and_women of prayer , those_who truly interpret and put into_practice the will of God , who do great works . From familiarity with God s word they draw the light needed_for that individual and communal discernment which helps them to seek the ways of the Lord in the signs of the times . In this_way they acquire a kind of supernatural intuition , which allows them to avoid being conformed to the mentality of this_world , but_rather to be renewed in their_own mind , in order to discern God s will about what_-isaia-_good , perfect and pleasing to him cf . In communion with Christ . An indispensable means of effectively sustaining communion with Christ -isaia- assuredly the Sacred Liturgy , and especially_the celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours . In the first_place , the Eucharist '' contains the Church s entire spiritual wealth , that_-isaia- , Christ himself , our Passover and living bread , who , through_his very flesh , made vital and vitalizing by the Holy Spirit , offers life '' to the human_family . This -isaia- the heart of the Church s life , and also of the consecrated_life . How can those_who_are called , through the profession of the evangelical_counsels , to choose Christ as the only meaning of their_lives , not desire to establish an ever_more profound communion with_him by sharing daily in the Sacrament which_makes him present , in the sacrifice which actualizes the gift of his_love on Golgotha , the banquet which nourishes and sustains God s pilgrim people ? By its_very nature the Eucharist -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the consecrated_life , both_for individuals and for communities . It -isaia- the daily viaticum and source of the spiritual_life for the individual and for the Institute . By means of the Eucharist all consecrated_persons are_called to live Christ s Paschal Mystery , uniting themselves to him by offering their_own lives to the Father through the Holy Spirit . Frequent and prolonged adoration of Christ present in the Eucharist enables us in some_way to relive Peter s experience -atti_degli_apostoli- the Transfiguration : '' It -isaia- well that_we_are here '' . In the celebration of the mystery of the Lord s Body and Blood , the unity and charity of those_who_have consecrated their_lives to God are strengthened and increased . Alongside the Eucharist , and intimately connected_with it , the Liturgy of the Hours , celebrated in union with the prayer of the Church , either in community or individually according to the nature of each Institute , expresses the call proper to consecrated_persons to raise their_hearts in praise and intercession . The Eucharist -isaia-_also closely connected_with_the commitment to continual conversion and necessary purification which consecrated_persons bring to maturity in the Sacrament of Reconciliation . By their frequent encounter_with God s mercy , they purify and renew their_hearts , and through the humble recognition of their sins achieve openness in their relationship_with him . The joyful experience of sacramental forgiveness , on the journey shared with one s brothers_and_sisters , makes_the heart eager to learn and encourages growth in faithfulness . Confident and humble recourse to spiritual direction -isaia- of great help on the path of fidelity to the Gospel , especially in the period of formation and -atti_degli_apostoli- certain other times in life . Through it individuals are helped to respond with generosity to the movements of the Spirit , and to direct themselves resolutely towards holiness . Finally , I exhort all consecrated_persons , according_to_their own traditions , to renew daily their_spiritual union with the Blessed Virgin Mary , reliving with_her the mysteries of her Son , especially by saying the Rosary . SOME NEW FIELDS OF MISSION Presence in the world of education . The Church has_always recognized that education -isaia- an essential dimension of her_mission . The Master of her inner life_-isaia- the Holy Spirit , who penetrates the innermost depths of every_human heart and knows the secret unfolding of history . The whole Church -isaia- enlivened by the Holy Spirit and with_him carries out her educational work . Within the Church , however , consecrated_persons have a specific duty . They are_called to bring to bear on the world of education their radical witness to the values of the Kingdom , proposed to everyone in expectation of the definitive meeting with the Lord of history . Because of their special consecration , their particular experience of the gifts of the Spirit , their constant listening to the word of God , their practice of discernment , their rich heritage of pedagogical traditions built up since_the establishment of their Institute , and their profound grasp of spiritual truth cf . Eph : , consecrated_persons are_able to be especially effective in educational activities and to offer a specific contribution to the work of other educators . Equipped with this charism , consecrated_persons can_give life to educational undertakings permeated by the Gospel spirit of freedom and charity , in which young_people are helped to mature humanly under the action of the Spirit . In this_way a community of learning becomes an experience of grace , where_the teaching programme contributes to uniting into a harmonious whole the human and the divine , the Gospel and culture , faith and life . The history of the Church , from antiquity down to our_own day , -isaia- full of admirable examples of consecrated_persons who_have sought and continue to seek holiness through_their involvement in education , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time proposing holiness as the goal of education . Indeed , many of them have achieved the perfection of charity through teaching . This -isaia- one_of_the_most precious gifts which consecrated_persons today can_offer to young_people , instructing them in a way that_-isaia- full of love , according to the wise counsel of Saint John Bosco : '' Young people should_not only be loved , but should_also know that_they_are loved '' . Need for a renewed commitment in the field of education . With respectful sensitivity and missionary boldness , consecrated men_and_women should show that_faith in Jesus Christ enlightens the whole enterprise of education , never disparaging human values but_rather confirming and elevating them . Thus do consecrated_persons become witnesses and instruments of the power of the Incarnation and the vitality of the Spirit . This task of theirs -isaia- one_of_the_most significant manifestations of that motherhood which_the Church , in the image of Mary , exercises on behalf of all her_children . It -isaia- for_this reason_that the Synod emphatically urged consecrated_persons to take up again , wherever possible , the mission of education in schools of every_kind and level , and in Universities and Institutions of higher learning . Making my own the proposal of the Synod , I warmly invite members of Institutes devoted to education to be faithful to their founding charism and to their traditions , knowing that the preferential love for the poor finds a special application in the choice of means capable of freeing people from that grave form of poverty which_-isaia- the lack of cultural and religious training . Because of the importance that Catholic and ecclesiastical universities and faculties have in the field of education and evangelization , Institutes which_are responsible_for their direction should be conscious of their responsibility . They should ensure the preservation of their unique Catholic identity in complete fidelity to the Church s Magisterium , all the while engaging in active dialogue_with present_day cultural trends . Moreover , depending on the circumstances , the members of these Institutes and Societies should readily become involved in the educational structures of the State . Members of Secular Institutes in particular , because_of_their specific calling , are_called to this_kind of cooperation . Institutes of Consecrated Life have_always had great influence in the formation and transmission of culture . This was true in the Middle Ages , when monasteries became places for the study of the cultural riches of the past , and for the development of a new humanistic and Christian culture . The same has happened every time the light of the Gospel has spread to new nations and peoples . Many consecrated_persons have_been promoters of culture , and frequently have studied and defended indigenous cultures . The need to contribute to the promotion of culture and to the dialogue_between culture and faith_-isaia- deeply felt in the Church today . Consecrated persons cannot_fail to feel challenged by this pressing need . In their proclamation of the word of God , they too are_called to discover the methods most suited to the needs of the different social groups and various professional categories , so that the light of Christ will penetrate all sectors of society and the leaven of salvation will transform society from within , fostering the growth of a culture imbued_with Gospel values . At the threshold of the Third Christian Millennium , such a commitment will_enable consecrated men_and_women to renew their response to the will of God , who reaches out to all those_who , knowingly or not , are searching for the Truth and the Life cf . But in addition to this service of others , within_the consecrated_life itself there_-isaia-_a_need for a renewed and loving commitment to the intellectual life , for dedication to study as a means of integral formation and as a path of asceticism which_-isaia- extraordinarily timely , in the face of present_day cultural diversity . A lessened commitment to study can have grave consequences for the apostolate , by giving rise to a sense of marginalization and inferiority , or encouraging superficiality and rash initiatives . With all respect_for the diversity of charisms and the actual resources of individual Institutes , the commitment to study cannot be limited to initial formation or to the gaining of academic_degrees and professional qualifications . Rather , study -isaia- an expression of the unquenchable desire_for an ever deeper knowledge of God , the source of light and all human truth . Consequently , a commitment to study does_not isolate consecrated_persons in an abstract intellectualism , or confine them within a suffocating narcissism ; rather , it -isaia- an incentive to dialogue and cooperation , a training in the capacity_for judgment , a stimulus to contemplation and prayer in the constant quest for the presence and activity of God in the complex reality of today_s_world . When they allow themselves to be transformed by the Holy Spirit , consecrated_persons can broaden the horizons of narrow human aspirations and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time understand more_deeply people and their_life stories , going beyond_the most obvious but often superficial aspects . Countless challenges are today emerging in the world of ideas , in new areas as well as those in which_the consecrated_life has traditionally been present . There -isaia- an urgent_need to maintain fruitful contacts with all cultural realities , with a watchful and critical attitude , but also_with confident attention to those_who face the particular difficulties of intellectual work , especially_when , in response to the unprecedented problems of our_times , new efforts of analysis and synthesis have to be attempted . A serious and effective evangelization of these new areas where culture -isaia- developed and transmitted cannot take_place without active cooperation_with the laity involved in them . Presence in the field of social_communications . Just as in the past consecrated_persons successfully used all kinds of means -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of evangelization and skilfully met difficulties , today too they_are challenged anew by the need to bear_witness to the Gospel through the communications media . The media , thanks to impressive developments in technology , have reached every corner of the earth . Consecrated persons , especially_those who have_the institutional charism of working in this_field , have a duty to learn the language of the media , in order to speak effectively of Christ to our contemporaries , interpreting their '' joys and hopes , their griefs and anxieties '' , and thus contributing to the building up of a society in which all people sense that_they_are brothers_and_sisters making their_way to God . Nevertheless , it -isaia- necessary to be vigilant with_regard to the distorted use of the media , especially given their extraordinary power of persuasion . The problems which_can result for the consecrated_life should_not be ignored ; instead they_should be faced_with careful discernment . The Church s response -isaia- above all educational : it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- promoting a correct understanding of the dynamics underlying the media and a careful ethical assessment of their programmes , as well as the development of healthy habits in their use . In this_work of education , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- training discerning listeners and expert communicators , consecrated_persons are_called to offer their_specific witness regarding the relative nature of all created realities . In this_way they help people to use the media wisely and in accordance_with God s plan , but_also to free themselves from an obsessive interest in '' the form of this_world which_-isaia- passing away '' Cor : . All efforts in this important new field of the apostolate should be encouraged , so that the Gospel of Christ may be proclaimed also through these modern means . The various Institutes should be ready to cooperate , by contributing resources and personnel , in order to implement joint projects in all sectors of social_communications . Furthermore , consecrated_persons , especially members of Secular Institutes , should willingly lend their help , wherever pastorally appropriate , for the religious formation of leaders and workers in the field of public_and_private social_communications . This should be done in order to offset the inappropriate use of the media and to promote higher quality programmes , the contents of which_will be respectful of the moral_law and rich in human and Christian values . ENGAGED IN DIALOGUE WITH EVERYONE At the service of Christian unity . Christ s prayer to the Father before his Passion , that his_disciples may be one cf . Jn : , lives on in the Church s prayer and activity . How can those called to the consecrated_life not feel themselves involved ? The wound of disunity still existing between believers in Christ and the urgent_need to pray and work_for the promotion of Christian unity were deeply felt -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod . The ecumenical sensitivity of consecrated_persons -isaia- heightened also by the awareness_that in other Churches and Ecclesial Communities monasticism has_been preserved and -isaia- flourishing , as -isaia- the case in the Eastern Churches , and that_there_-isaia- a renewal of the profession of the evangelical_counsels , as in the Anglican Communion and in the Communities of the Reformation . The Synod emphasized the close connection_between the consecrated_life and the cause of ecumenism , and the urgent_need for a more intense witness in this area . Since the soul of ecumenism -isaia- prayer and conversion , Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life certainly have a special duty to foster this commitment . There -isaia- an urgent_need for consecrated_persons to give more space in their_lives to ecumenical prayer and genuine evangelical witness , so that by the power of the Holy Spirit the walls of division and prejudice between Christians can be broken down . Forms of ecumenical dialogue . Sharing of the lectio divina in the search_for the truth , a participation in common prayer , in which_the Lord assures us of his presence cf . Mt : , the dialogue of friendship and charity_which makes us feel how pleasant it -isaia- when brothers dwell in unity cf . Ps , cordial hospitality shown to brothers_and_sisters of the various Christian confessions , mutual knowledge and the exchange of gifts , cooperation in common undertakings of service and of witness : these_are among the many forms of ecumenical dialogue . They are actions pleasing to our_common Father , which show the will to journey together towards perfect unity along the path of truth and love . Likewise , the knowledge of the history , doctrine , liturgy , and charitable and apostolic activity of other Christians cannot_but help to make ecumenical activity ever_more fruitful . I wish to encourage those Institutes which , either because_they were founded for this_purpose or because of a later calling , are dedicated to promoting Christian unity and therefore foster initiatives of study and concrete action . Indeed , no Institute of Consecrated Life should feel itself dispensed from working for_this cause . My thoughts likewise turn to the Eastern Catholic Churches with the hope_that also through the monastic life of both men_and_women the flourishing of which_-isaia- a grace to be constantly prayed for they_may help to bring_about unity with the Orthodox Churches , through the dialogue of charity and the sharing of a common spirituality , itself the heritage of the undivided Church of the first millennium . In a special_way , I entrust to the monasteries of contemplative life the spiritual ecumenism of prayer , conversion of heart , and charity . To this_end I encourage their presence wherever Christian communities of different confessions live side by side , so that_their total devotion to the '' one_thing needful '' cf . Lk : to the worship of God and to intercession for the salvation of the world , together_with their witness of evangelical life according_to_their special charisms will inspire everyone to abide , after_the image of the Trinity , in that unity_which Jesus willed and asked of the Father for all his_disciples . Because '' interreligious dialogue -isaia- a part of the Church s evangelizing mission '' , Institutes of Consecrated Life cannot exempt themselves from involvement also in this_field , each in accordance_with its_own charism and following the directives of ecclesiastical authority . The first form of evangelization in relation to our_brothers_and_sisters of other_religions should be the testimony of a life of poverty , humility and chastity , imbued_with fraternal love for all . At the same_time , the freedom of spirit proper to the consecrated_life will favour that '' dialogue of life '' which embodies a basic model of mission and of the proclamation of Christ s Gospel . In order to foster reciprocal knowledge , respect and charity , Religious Institutes can_also promote appropriate forms of dialogue , marked by cordial friendship and mutual sincerity , with the monastic communities of other_religions . Another area for cooperation_with men_and_women of different religious traditions -isaia- that of a shared concern_for human_life , extending from compassion for those_who_are suffering physically and spiritually to commitment to justice , peace and the protection of God s creation . In these areas , Institutes of active life especially will seek an understanding with members of other_religions , through that '' dialogue of action '' which prepares the way_for more profound exchanges . A particular field for successful common action with people of other religious traditions -isaia- that of efforts to promote the dignity of women . In view of the equality and authentic complementarity of men_and_women , a valuable service can be rendered above all by consecrated women . hese and other ways in which consecrated_persons are engaged in the service of interreligious dialogue require an appropriate training , both in initial formation and in continuing formation . They require study and research , since in this_very delicate area a profound knowledge of Christianity and of other_religions -isaia- needed , accompanied by solid faith and by spiritual and personal maturity . Spirituality as a response to the search_for the sacred and the desire_for God . Because of the very nature of their choice , all who embrace the consecrated_life , men_and_women alike , become privileged partners in the search_for God which has_always stirred the human_heart and has led to the different_forms of asceticism and spirituality . Today , in many places , this search -isaia- insistently emerging as a response to cultural forces which tend to marginalize the religious dimension of life , if not actually to deny it . When consecrated_persons live consistently and fully their freely assumed commitments , they are_able to offer a response to the longings of their contemporaries , and can_help to free them_from solutions which_are for the most part illusory and often involve a denial of the saving Incarnation of Christ cf . Jn : , such as those proposed , for example , by the sects . By practising a personal and communal asceticism which purifies and transfigures their entire existence , they bear_witness , against the temptation to self centredness and sensuality , to the true nature of the search_for God . They constitute a warning against confusing that search with a subtle search_for self or a flight into gnosticism . Every consecrated person_-isaia- committed to strengthening the interior life_,_which in no way involves withdrawal from reality or a turning in upon oneself . Listening in obedience to the word , of which_the Church -isaia- the guardian and interpreter , the consecrated person points to Christ loved above all things and to the mystery of the Trinity as the response to the profound longings of the human_heart and the ultimate goal of every religious journey sincerely open to transcendence . For this_reason , consecrated_persons are in duty bound to offer a generous welcome and spiritual support to all those_who , moved by a thirst_for God and a desire to live the demands of faith , turn to them . CONCLUSION Unbounded generosity . Many people today are puzzled and ask : What -isaia- the point of the consecrated_life ? Why embrace this_kind of life , when there_are so many urgent needs in the areas of charity and of evangelization itself , to which one_can respond even without assuming the particular commitments of the consecrated_life ? Is the consecrated_life not a kind of '' waste '' of human energies which might be used more efficiently for a greater good , for the benefit of humanity and the Church ? These questions are asked more frequently in our_day , as a consequence of a utilitarian and technocratic culture which_-isaia- inclined to assess the importance of things and even of people in relation to their immediate '' usefulness '' . But such questions have_always existed , as -isaia- eloquently demonstrated by the Gospel episode of the anointing -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethany : '' Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with_her hair ; and the house was filled_with_the fragrance of the ointment '' Jn : . When Judas , using the needs of the poor as an excuse , complained about such waste , Jesus replied : '' Let her alone ! '' Jn : . This -isaia- the perennially valid response to the question which many_people , even in good faith , are asking about the relevance of the consecrated_life : Could one not invest one s life in a more efficient and reasonable way_for the betterment of society ? This -isaia- how Jesus replies : '' Let her alone ! '' Those who_have_been given the priceless gift of following the Lord Jesus more_closely consider it obvious that he can and must be loved with an undivided heart , that_one can devote to him one s whole_life , and not merely certain actions or occasional moments or activities . The precious ointment poured out as a pure act of love , and thus transcending all '' utilitarian '' considerations , -isaia- a sign of unbounded generosity , as expressed in a life spent in loving and serving the Lord , in order to devote oneself to his person and his Mystical Body . From such a life '' poured out '' without reserve there spreads a fragrance which fills the whole house . The house of God , the Church , today no less_than in the past , -isaia- adorned and enriched by the presence of the consecrated_life . What in people s eyes can seem a waste -isaia- , for the individuals captivated in the depths of their heart by the beauty and goodness of the Lord , an obvious response of love , a joyful expression of gratitude for having_been admitted in a unique way to the knowledge of the Son and to a sharing in his_divine mission in the world . '' If any of God s children were to know and taste divine_love , the uncreated God , the incarnate God , the God who endured suffering , the God who_-isaia- the supreme good , they_would give themselves completely to him , they_would withdraw not_only from other creatures but_even from their_very selves , and with all their being would love this God of love , to the point of being completely transformed into the God man , who_-isaia- the supreme Beloved '' . The consecrated_life in the service of the Kingdom of God . '' What would become of the world if there_were no Religious '' ? Beyond all superficial assessments of its usefulness , the consecrated_life -isaia- important precisely in its being unbounded generosity and love , and this all the more so in a world_which risks being suffocated in the whirlpool of the ephemeral . '' Without this concrete sign there_would be a danger that the charity_which animates the entire Church would grow cold , that the salvific paradox of the Gospel would be blunted , and that the ? salt of faith would lose its savour in a world undergoing secularization '' . The Church and society itself need people capable of devoting themselves totally to God and to others for the love of God . The Church can in no way renounce the consecrated_life , for it eloquently expresses her inmost nature as '' Bride '' . In the consecrated_life the proclamation of the Gospel to the whole_world finds fresh enthusiasm and power . There -isaia-_a_need for people able to show the fatherly face of God and the motherly face of the Church , people_who spend their_lives so that others can have life and hope . The Church needs consecrated_persons who , even before committing themselves to the service of this or that noble cause , allow themselves to be transformed by God s grace and conform themselves fully to the Gospel . The whole Church finds in her hands this_great gift and gratefully devotes herself to promoting it with_respect , with prayer , and with the explicit invitation to accept it . It -isaia- important_that Bishops , priests and deacons , convinced of the evangelical superiority of this_kind of life , should strive to discover and encourage the seeds of vocation through preaching , discernment and wise spiritual guidance . All the faithful_are asked to pray constantly for consecrated_persons , that_their fervour and their capacity to love may grow continually and thus contribute to spreading in today s society the fragrance of Christ cf . The whole Christian community pastors , laity and consecrated_persons -isaia- responsible_for the consecrated_life , and for welcoming and supporting new vocations . To you , young_people , I say : if you hear_the Lord s call , do not reject it ! Dare to become part of the great movements of holiness which renowned saints have launched in their following of Christ . Cultivate the ideals proper to your age , but readily accept God s plan_for you if he invites you to seek holiness in the consecrated_life . Admire all God s works in the world , but be ready to fix your eyes on the things destined never to pass away . The Third Millennium awaits the contribution of the faith and creativity of great numbers of young consecrated_persons , that_the_world may be made more peaceful and able to welcome God and , in him , all his sons_and_daughters . I address you , Christian families . Parents , give thanks to the Lord if he has called one of your children to the consecrated_life . It -isaia- to be considered a great honour as it always has_been that the Lord should look upon a family and choose to invite one of its_members to set_out on the path of the evangelical_counsels ! Cherish the desire to give the Lord one of your children so that God s love can spread in the world . What fruit of conjugal love could be more beautiful than_this ? We must remember_that if parents do not live the values of the Gospel , the young_man or woman will_find it very difficult to discern the calling , to understand_the need_for the sacrifices which_must be faced , and to appreciate the beauty of the goal to be achieved . For it -isaia- in the family that young_people have_their first experience of Gospel values and of the love which_gives itself to God and to others . They also need to be trained in the responsible use of their_own freedom , so that_they_will be prepared to live , as their_vocation demands , in accordance_with_the loftiest spiritual realities . I pray that_you , Christian families , united with the Lord through prayer and the sacramental life , will create homes where vocations are welcomed . To men_and_women of good_will . To all the men_and_women_who are willing to listen to my voice , I wish to address an invitation to seek the paths which lead to the living and true God , including the path marked out by the consecrated_life . Consecrated persons bear_witness to the fact_that '' whoever follows after Christ , the perfect man , becomes himself more of a man '' . How many consecrated men_and_women have bent down , and continue to bend down , as Good Samaritans , over the countless wounds of the brothers_and_sisters whom_they meet on their_way ! Look -atti_degli_apostoli- these_people seized by Christ , who show that in self mastery , sustained by grace and God s love , lies the remedy for the craving to possess , to seek pleasure , to dominate . Do not forget the charisms which_have shaped remarkable '' seekers of God '' and benefactors of humanity , who_have provided sure paths for those_who seek God with a sincere heart . Consider the great number of saints who_have flourished in this way_of_life ; consider_the good done to the world , in the past and in the present , by those_who_have devoted themselves to God ! Does not this_world of ours need joyful witnesses and prophets of the beneficent power of God s love ? Does it not also need men_and_women_who , by their_lives and their_work , are_able to sow seeds of peace and fraternity ? To consecrated_persons . But it -isaia- above all to you , consecrated women and men , that -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this Exhortation I appeal with trust : live to the full your dedication to God , so that this_world may never be without a ray of divine beauty to lighten the path of human_existence . Christians , immersed in the cares and concerns of this_world but_also called to holiness , need to discover in you purified hearts which in faith '' see '' God , people docile to the working of the Holy Spirit who resolutely press on in fidelity to the charism of their call and mission . You know well that_you have set_out on a journey of continual conversion , of exclusive dedication to the love of God and of your brothers_and_sisters , in order to bear ever_more splendid witness to the grace_which transfigures Christian life . The world and the Church seek authentic witnesses to Christ . And the consecrated_life -isaia-_a_gift which God offers in order_that everyone can recognize_the '' one_thing necessary '' cf . To bear_witness to Christ by one s life , works and words -isaia- the particular mission of the consecrated_life in the Church and in the world . You know_the one in whom_you have put your trust cf . Tim : : give him everything ! Young people will_not be deceived : when_they come to you , they want to see what they_do_not see elsewhere . An immense task awaits you in the future : in a special_way young consecrated_persons , by witnessing to their consecration , can lead their contemporaries to a renewal of their_lives . An impassioned love of Jesus Christ -isaia- a powerful attraction for those other young_people whom Christ in his goodness -isaia- calling to follow_him closely and for ever . Our contemporaries want to see in consecrated_persons the joy which_comes_from being with the Lord . Consecrated women and men , old and young alike , live faithfully your commitment to God , in mutual edification and mutual support ! Despite the difficulties you_may occasionally encounter , and despite the lessening of esteem_for the consecrated_life in certain quarters , you have_the task of once_more inviting the men_and_women of our_time to lift their_eyes , not to let themselves be overwhelmed by everyday things , to let themselves be captivated by the fascination of God and of his Son s Gospel . Do not forget_that you , in a very_special way , can and must say that_you not_only belong to Christ but_that '' you have_become Christ '' ! Looking to the future . You have_not only a glorious history to remember and to recount , but_also a great history still to be accomplished ! Look to the future , where_the Spirit -isaia- sending you in order to do even greater things . Make your lives a fervent expectation of Christ ; go forth to meet him like the wise virgins setting out to meet_the Bridegroom . Be always ready , faithful to Christ , the Church , to your Institute and to the men_and_women of our_time . In this_way you will day_by_day be renewed in Christ , in order with_his Spirit to build fraternal communities , to join him in washing the feet of the poor , and to contribute in your_own unique way to the transfiguration of the world . As it enters the new Millennium , may our_world , entrusted to human hands , become ever more_human and just , a sign and anticipation of the world to come , in which_the Lord , humble and glorified , poor and exalted , will be the full and lasting joy for us and for our_brothers_and_sisters , together_with_the Father and the Holy Spirit . Prayer to the Holy Trinity . Most Holy Trinity , blessed and the source of all blessedness , bless your sons_and_daughters whom_you have called to praise the greatness of your love , your merciful goodness and your beauty . Father Most Holy , sanctify the sons_and_daughters who_have consecrated themselves to you , for the glory of your name . Enfold them_with your power , enabling them to bear_witness that_you are the Origin of all things , the one Source of love and freedom . We thank you for the gift of the consecrated_life , which in faith seeks you and in its universal mission invites all people to draw near to you . Jesus our Saviour , Incarnate Word , as you_have entrusted your_own way_of_life to those_whom you_have called , continue to draw to yourself men_and_women_who will be , for the people of our_time , dispensers of mercy , heralds of your return , living signs of the Resurrection and of its treasures of virginity , poverty and obedience . May no tribulation separate them_from you and from your love ! Holy Spirit , Love poured into our_hearts , who grant grace and inspiration to our minds , the perennial Source of life , who bring to fulfilment the mission of Christ by means of many charisms , we pray to you for all consecrated_persons . Fill their_hearts with the deep certainty of having_been chosen to love , to praise and to serve . Enable them to savour your friendship , fill them_with your joy and consolation , help_them to overcome moments of difficulty and to rise up again with trust after they_have fallen ; make_them mirrors of the divine beauty . Give them the courage to face the challenges of our_time and the grace to bring to all mankind the goodness and loving kindness of our Saviour Jesus Christ cf . Invocation of the Blessed Virgin Mary . Mary , image of the Church , the Bride without spot or wrinkle , which by imitating you '' preserves with virginal purity an integral faith , a firm hope and a sincere charity '' , sustain consecrated_persons on their journey towards_the sole and eternal Blessedness . To you , Virgin of the Visitation , do we entrust them , that_they_may go forth to meet human needs , to bring help , but_above all to bring Jesus . Teach them to proclaim_the mighty things_which the Lord accomplishes in the world , that all peoples may extol the greatness of his_name . Support them in their_work for the poor , the hungry , those without hope , the little ones and all who seek your Son with a sincere heart . To you , our Mother , who desire the spiritual and apostolic renewal of your sons_and_daughters in a response of love and complete dedication to Christ , we address our confident prayer . You who did the will of the Father , ever ready in obedience , courageous in poverty and receptive in fruitful virginity , obtain from your divine Son that all who have_received the gift of following him in the consecrated_life may be enabled to bear_witness to that gift by their transfigured lives , as they joyfully make_their way with all their brothers_and_sisters towards our heavenly homeland and the light_which will_never grow dim . We ask you this , that in everyone and in everything glory , adoration and love may be given to the Most High Lord of all things , who_-isaia- Father , Son and Holy Spirit .

'' I will_give you shepherds after my own heart '' Jer . In these_words from the prophet Jeremiah , God promises his_people that he will_never leave them without shepherds to gather them together and guide them : '' I will set shepherds over them my sheep who_will care_for them , and they_shall fear no more , nor be dismayed Jer . The Church , the People of God , constantly experiences the reality of this prophetic message and continues joyfully to thank God for it . She knows that Jesus Christ himself_-isaia- the living , supreme and definitive fulfillment of God s promise : '' I -amos- the good_shepherd '' Jn . He , '' the great shepherd of the sheep '' Heb . : , entrusted to the apostles and their successors the ministry of shepherding God s flock cf . Without priests the Church would_not be able to live that fundamental obedience which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of her existence and her_mission in history , an obedience in response to the command of Christ : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations '' Mt . : and '' Do this in remembrance of me '' Lk . e : , an obedience to the command to announce the Gospel and to renew daily the sacrifice of the giving of his_body and the shedding of his_blood for the life of the world . By faith we know_that the Lord s promise cannot_fail . This very promise -isaia- the reason and force underlying the Church s rejoicing -atti_degli_apostoli- the growth and increase of priestly vocations now taking place in some parts_of_the_world . It -isaia-_also the foundation and impulse for a renewed act of faith and fervent hope in the face of the grave shortage of priests which_-isaia- being felt in other parts_of_the_world . Everyone -isaia- called_upon to share complete trust in the unbroken fulfillment of God s promise , which_the synod_fathers expressed in clear and forceful terms : '' The synod , with complete trust in the promise of Christ who_has said : Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age Mt . : , and aware of the constant activity of the Holy Spirit in the Church , firmly believes that_there will_never be a complete lack of sacred ministers in the Church . Even though in a number of regions there_-isaia- a scarcity of clergy , the action of the Father , who raises up vocations , will nonetheless always be -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church . '' At the conclusion of the synod , I said_that in the face of a crisis of priestly vocations '' the first answer which_the Church gives lies in a total act of faith in the Holy Spirit . We are deeply convinced_that this trusting abandonment will_not disappoint if we remain faithful to the graces we have_received . To remain faithful to the grace received ! This gift of God does_not cancel human_freedom ; instead it gives_rise to freedom , develops freedom and demands freedom . For this_reason , the total trust in God s unconditional faithfulness to his promise -isaia- accompanied in the Church by the grave responsibility to cooperate in the action of God who calls , and to contribute toward creating and preserving the conditions in which_the good seed , sown by God , can take root and bring forth abundant fruit . The Church must_never cease to pray to the Lord of the harvest that he send laborers into_his harvest , cf . She must propose clearly and courageously to each new generation the vocational call , help people to discern the authenticity of their call from God and to respond to it generously , and give particular care to the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . The formation of future priests , both diocesan and religious , and lifelong assiduous care_for their_personal sanctification in the ministry and for the constant updating of their pastoral commitment -isaia- considered by the Church one_of_the_most demanding and important tasks for the future of the evangelization of humanity . The Church s work of formation_-isaia- a continuation in time of Christ s own work , which_the evangelist Mark illustrates in these_words : '' And he went up on the mountain , and called to him those_whom he desired ; and they came to him . And he appointed twelve , to be with_him , and to be sent out to preach and have authority to cast out demons '' Mk . It can_be_said that_through her work of forming candidates to the priesthood and priests themselves , the Church throughout her history has continued to live this passage of the Gospel in various_ways and with varying intensity . Today , however , the Church feels called to relive with a renewed commitment all that the Master did with his_apostles urged on as she_-isaia- by the deep and rapid transformations in the societies and culture of our_age ; by the multiplicity and diversity of contexts in which_she announces the Gospel and witnesses to it ; by the promising number of priestly vocations being seen in some dioceses around_the world ; by the urgency of a new look -atti_degli_apostoli- the contents and methods of priestly formation ; by the concern of bishops and their communities about a persisting scarcity of clergy ; and by the absolute necessity that the '' new_evangelization '' have priests as its initial '' new evangelizers . '' It -isaia- precisely in this cultural and historical context that the last ordinary_general_assembly of the Synod of Bishops took_place . Dedicated to '' the formation of priests in circumstances of the present_day , '' its purpose was to put into_practice the Council s teaching on this_matter , making it more up to date and incisive in present circumstances , twenty five years after_the Council itself . Following the texts of the Second Vatican Council regarding the ministry of priests and their formation , and with the intention of applying to various situations their rich and authoritative teaching , the Church has on various occasions dealt_with the subject of the life , ministry and formation of priests She has done this in a more solemn way during the Synods of Bishops . Already in October , the first general ordinary assembly_of_the_synod devoted five general congregations to the subject of the renewal of seminaries . This work gave a decisive impulse to the formulation of the document of the Congregation for Catholic Education titled Fundamental Norms for Priestly Formation . The second ordinary_general_assembly held in spent half its time on the ministerial priesthood . The fruit of the lengthy synodal discussion , incorporated and condensed in some '' recommendations , '' which_were submitted to my predecessor Pope Paul VI and read -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening of the synod , referred principally to the teaching on the ministerial priesthood and to some aspects of priestly spirituality and ministry . On many_other occasions the Church s magisterium has shown its concern_for the life and ministry of priests . It may be said_that in the years since_the Council there_has not_been any subject treated by the magisterium which_has not in some_way , explicitly or implicitly , had to do with the presence of priests in the community as well as their role and the need_for them in the life of the Church and the world . In recent_years some have voiced a need to return to the theme of the priesthood , treating it from a relatively new point_of_view , one_that was more adapted to present ecclesial and cultural circumstances . Attention has shifted from the question of the priest s identity to that connected_with_the process of formation for the priesthood and the quality of priestly life . The new generation of those called to the ministerial priesthood display different characteristics in comparison to those of their immediate predecessors . In addition , they live in a world_which in many respects -isaia- new and undergoing rapid and continual evolution . All of this cannot be ignored when it comes to programming and carrying_out the various phases of formation for those approaching the ministerial priesthood . Moreover , priests who_have_been actively involved in the ministry for a more_or_less lengthy period of time seem to be suffering today from an excessive loss of energy in their ever_increasing pastoral activities . Likewise , faced_with the difficulties of contemporary culture and society , they feel compelled to re examine their way_of_life and their pastoral priorities , and they_are more_and_more aware of their need_for ongoing_formation . The concern of the Synod of Bishops and its discussion focused on the increase of vocations to the priesthood and the formation of candidates in an attempt to help_them come to know and follow Jesus as they prepare to be ordained and to live the sacrament of holy_orders , which configures them to Christ the head and shepherd , the servant and spouse of the Church . At the same_time , the synod searched for forms of ongoing_formation to provide realistic and effective means of support for priests in their_spiritual life and ministry . This same synod also sought to answer a request which_was made -atti_degli_apostoli- the previous synod on the vocation and mission of the laity in the Church and in the world . Lay people themselves had asked that priests commit themselves to their formation so that_they , the laity , could be suitably helped to fulfill their role in the ecclesial mission which_-isaia- shared by all . Indeed , '' the more the lay apostolate develops , the more strongly -isaia- perceived the need to have well formed holy priests . Thus the very life of the People of God manifests the teaching of the Second Vatican Council concerning the relationship_between_the common priesthood and the ministerial or hierarchical priesthood . For within_the mystery of the Church the hierarchy has a ministerial character cf . The more the laity s own sense of vocation -isaia- deepened , the more what_-isaia- proper to the priest stands out . In the ecclesial experience that_-isaia- typical of the synod i . , '' a unique experience on a universal basis of episcopal communion , which strengthens the sense of the universal Church and the sense_of_responsibility of the bishops toward_the universal Church and her_mission , in affective and effective communion around Peter '' , the voice of the various particular_churches and in this synod , for the first time , the voices of some churches from the East were clearly heard and taken to heart . The churches have proclaimed their_faith in the fulfillment of God s promise : '' I will_give you shepherds after my own heart '' Jer . : , and they_have renewed their pastoral commitment to care_for vocations and for the formation of priests aware_that on this depends the future of the Church , her development and her universal mission of salvation . In this post_synodal_apostolic_exhortation , I take up anew the rich legacy resulting from the reflections , endeavors and indications which_were made during the synod s preparation , as well as those_which accompanied the work of the synod_fathers , and as the bishop of Rome and successor of Peter I add my voice to theirs addressing it to each_and_every one of the faithful , and in particular to each priest and to those involved in the important yet demanding ministry of their formation . Yes , in this_exhortation l wish to meet with each_and_every priest , whether diocesan or religious . Quoting from the '' Final Message of the Synod to the People of God , '' I make my own the words and the sentiments expressed by the synod_fathers : '' Brother priests , we want to express our appreciation to you , who_are our most important collaborators in the apostolate . Your priesthood -isaia- absolutely vital . There -isaia- no substitute for it . You carry the main burden of priestly_ministry through your day to day service of the faithful . You are ministers of the Eucharist and ministers of God s mercy in the sacrament_of_penance . It -isaia- you_who bring comfort to people and guide them in difficult moments in their_lives . '' We acknowledge your work and thank you once_again , urging you to continue on your chosen path willingly and joyfully . No one_should be discouraged as we are doing God s work ; the same God who calls us , sends us and remains with us every_day of our_lives . We are ambassadors of Christ . '' CHAPTER I CHOSEN FROM AMONG METhe Challenges Facing Priestly Formation -atti_degli_apostoli- the Conclusion of the Second Millennium The Priest in His Time . '' Every high_priest chosen from among_men -isaia- appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God '' Heb . The Letter to the Hebrews clearly affirms the '' human character '' of God s minister he comes_from_the human community and -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- its service , imitating Jesus Christ '' who in every respect has_been tempted as we are , yet without sin '' Heb . God always calls his priests from specific human and ecclesial contexts , which inevitably influence them ; and to these same contexts the priest_-isaia- sent for the service of Christ s Gospel . For this_reason_the synod desired to '' contextualize '' the subject of priests , viewing it in terms of today s society and today s Church in preparation_for the third_millennium . This -isaia- indicated in the second part of the topic s formulation : '' The formation of priests in the circumstances of the present_day . '' Certainly '' there_-isaia- an essential aspect of the priest that does_not change : the priest of tomorrow , no less_than the priest of today , must resemble Christ . When Jesus lived on this earth , he manifested in himself_the definitive role of the priestly establishing a ministerial priesthood with_which_the apostles were_the first to be invested . This priesthood -isaia- destined to last in endless succession throughout history . In this_sense the priest of the third_millennium will_continue the work of the priests_who , in the preceding millennia , have animated the life of the Church . In the third_millennium the priestly vocation will_continue to be the call to live the unique and permanent priesthood of Christ . '' It -isaia- equally certain_that the life and ministry of the priest must_also '' adapt to every era and circumstance of life . For our part we must_therefore seek to be as open as possible to light from on high from the Holy Spirit , in order to discover the tendencies of contemporary society , recognize_the deepest spiritual needs , determine the most important concrete tasks and the pastoral methods to adopt , and thus respond adequately to human expectations . '' With the duty of bringing together the permanent truth of the priestly_ministry and the characteristic requirements of the present_day , the synod_fathers sought to respond to a few necessary questions : What are the positive and negative elements in socio cultural and ecclesial contexts which affect boys , adolescents and young_men who throughout their_lives are_called to bring to maturity a project of priestly life ? What difficulties are posed by our_times , and what new possibilities are offered for the exercise of a priestly_ministry which corresponds to the gift received in the sacrament and the demands of the spiritual_life which_-isaia- consistent with it ? I now mention some comments taken from the synod_fathers analysis of the situation fully aware_that the great variety of socio cultural and ecclesial circumstances in different countries limits by necessity our treatment to only the most evident and widespread phenomena , particularly those relating to the question of education and priestly formation . The Gospel Today : Hopes and Obstacles . A number of factors seem to be working toward making people today more_deeply aware of the dignity_of_the_human_person and more open to religious values , to the Gospel and to the priestly_ministry . Despite many contradictions , society_-isaia- increasingly witnessing a powerful thirst_for justice_and_peace ; a more lively sense_that humanity must care_for creation and respect nature ; a more open search_for truth ; a greater effort to safeguard human_dignity ; a growing commitment in many sectors of the world population to a more specific international solidarity and a new ordering of the world in freedom and justice . Parallel to the continued development of the potential offered by science and technology and the exchange of information and interaction of cultures , there_-isaia- a new call_for ethics , that_-isaia- , a quest for meaning and therefore for an objective standard of values_which will delineate the possibilities and limits of progress . In the more specifically religious and Christian sphere , ideological prejudice and the violent rejection of the message of spiritual and religious values are crumbling and there_are arising new and unexpected possibilities of evangelization and the rebirth of ecclesial life in many parts_of_the_world . These are evident in an increased love of the sacred Scriptures ; in the vitality and growing vigor of many_young churches and their ever larger role in the defense and promotion of the values of human_life and the person ; and in the splendid witness of martyrdom provided by the churches of Central and Eastern Europe as well as that of the faithfulness and courage of other_churches which are_still forced to undergo persecution and tribulation for the faith . The thirst_for God and for an active meaningful relationship_with him -isaia- so strong today that , where there_-isaia- a lack of a genuine and full proclamation of the Gospel of Christ , there_-isaia- a rising spread of forms of religiosity without God and the proliferation of many sects . For all children of the Church , and for priests especially , the increase of these phenomena , even in some traditionally Christian environments , -isaia-_not_only a constant motive to examine our consciences as to the credibility of our witness to the Gospel but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time -isaia- a sign of how deep and widespread -isaia- the search_for God . Mingled with_these and other positive factors , there_are also , however , many problematic or negative elements . Rationalism -isaia- still very widespread and , in the name of a reductive concept of '' science , '' it renders human_reason insensitive to an encounter_with revelation and with divine transcendence . We should_take note also of a desperate defense of personal subjectivity which tends to close it off in individualism , rendering it incapable of true human relationships . As a result , many especially children and young_people seek to compensate for_this loneliness with substitutes of various kinds , in more_or_less acute forms of hedonism or flight from responsibility . Prisoners of the fleeting moment , they seek to '' consume '' the strongest and most gratifying individual experiences -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of immediate emotions and sensations , inevitably finding themselves indifferent and '' paralyzed '' as it were when_they come face to face with the summons to embark upon a life project which includes a spiritual and religious dimension and a commitment to solidarity . Furthermore , despite the fall of ideologies which_had made materialism a dogma and the refusal of religion a program , there_-isaia- spreading in every part_of_the_world a sort of practical and existential atheism which coincides with a secularist outlook on life and human destiny . The individual , '' all bound up in himself , this man_who makes himself not_only the center of his every interest , but dares to propose himself as the principle and reason of all reality , '' finds himself ever_more bereft of that '' supplement of soul '' which_-isaia- all the more necessary to him in proportion as a wide availability of material goods and resources deceives him about his self sufficiency . There -isaia-_no_longer a need to fight against God ; the individual feels he -isaia- simply able to do without him . In this_context special mention should be made of the breakup of the family and an obscuring or distorting of the true meaning of human sexuality . That phenomena have a very negative effect on the education of young_people and on their openness to any_kind of religious vocation . Furthermore , one_should mention the worsening of social injustices and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few , the fruit of an inhuman capitalism which increasingly widens the gap between affluent and indigent peoples . In this_way tension and unrest are introduced into everyday life , deeply disturbing the lives of people and of whole communities . There are_also worrying and negative factors within_the Church herself which_have a direct influence on the lives and ministry of priests . For example : the lack of due knowledge of the faith among many believers ; a catechesis which_has little practical effect , stifled as it -isaia- by the mass_media whose messages are_more widespread and persuasive ; an incorrectly understood pluralism in theology , culture and pastoral teaching which though starting out -atti_degli_apostoli- times with_good intentions ends up by hindering ecumenical dialogue and threatening the necessary unity of faith ; a persistent diffidence toward and almost unacceptance of the magisterium of the hierarchy ; the one sided tendencies which reduce the richness of the Gospel message and transform the proclamation and witness to the faith into an element of exclusively human and social liberation or into an alienating flight into superstition and religiosity without God . A particularly important phenomenon , even_though it -isaia- relatively recent in many traditionally Christian countries , -isaia- the presence within_the same territory of large concentrations of people of different races and religions , thereby resulting in multiracial and multi religious societies . While on the one_hand this_can be an opportunity_for a more frequent and fruitful exercise of dialogue , open mindedness , good relations and a just tolerance on the other_hand the situation can_also result in confusion and relativism , above all among people and populations whose faith_has not matured . Added to these factors , and closely linked_with the growth of individualism , -isaia- the phenomenon of subjectivism in matters of faith . An increasing number of Christians seem to have a reduced sensitivity to the universality and objectivity of the doctrine_of_the_faith because_they_are subjectively attached to what pleases them ; to what corresponds to their_own experience ; and to what does_not impinge on their_own habits . In such a context , even the appeal to the inviolability of the individual conscience in itself a legitimate appeal may be dangerously , marked by ambiguity . This situation also gives_rise to the phenomenon of belonging to the Church in ways which_are ever_more partial and conditional , with a resulting negative influence on the birth of new vocations to the priesthood , on the priest s own self awareness and on his_ministry within_the community . Finally , in many_parts of the Church today it -isaia- still the scarcity of priests which creates the most serious problem . The faithful_are often left to themselves for long periods , without sufficient pastoral support . As a result their growth as Christians suffers , not to mention their capacity to become better promoters of evangelization . Young People : Vocation and Priestly Formation . The many contradictions and potentialities marking our societies and cultures as well as ecclesial_communities are perceived , lived and experienced by our young_people with a particular intensity and have immediate and very acute repercussions on their_personal growth . Thus , the emergence and development of priestly vocations among boys , adolescents and young_men are continually under pressure and facing obstacles . The lure of the so called '' consumer society '' -isaia- so strong among young_people that_they become totally dominated and imprisoned by an individualistic , materialistic and hedonistic interpretation of human_existence . Material '' well_being , '' which_-isaia- so intensely sought after , becomes_the one ideal to be striven for in life , a well_being which_-isaia- to be attained in any_way and -atti_degli_apostoli- any price . There -isaia- a refusal of anything that speaks of sacrifice and a rejection of any effort to look for and to practice spiritual and religious values . The all determining '' concern '' for having supplants the primacy of being , and consequently personal and interpersonal values are interpreted and lived not according to the logic of giving and generosity but according to the logic of selfish possession and the exploitation of others . This -isaia- particularly reflected in that outlook on human sexuality according to which sexuality s dignity in service to communion and to the reciprocal donation between persons becomes degraded and thereby reduced to nothing_more than a consumer good . In this case , many young_people undergo an affective experience which , instead of contributing to a harmonious and joyous growth in personality which opens them outward in an act of self_giving , becomes a serious psychological and ethical process of turning inward toward self , a situation which_cannot fail to have grave consequences on them in the future . In the case of some young_people a distorted sense of freedom lies -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of these tendencies . Instead of being understood as obedience to objective and universal truth , freedom_-isaia- lived out as a blind acquiescence to instinctive forces and to an individual s will to power . Therefore , on the level of thought and behavior , it -isaia- almost natural to find an erosion of internal consent to ethical principles . On the religious level , such a situation , if it does not_always lead to an explicit refusal of God , causes widespread indifference and results in a life_which , even in its more significant moments and more decisive choices , -isaia- lived as if God did not_exist . In this_context it -isaia- difficult not_only to respond fully to a vocation to the priesthood but_even to understand its_very meaning as a special witness to the primacy of '' being '' over '' having , '' and as a recognition that the significance of life consists in a free and responsible giving of oneself to others , a willingness to place oneself entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- the Service of the Gospel and the kingdom of God as a priest . Often the world of young_people -isaia- a '' problem in the Church community itself . In fact , if in them more so than in adults there_-isaia- present a strong tendency to subjectivize the Christian faith and to belong only partially and conditionally to the life_and_mission of the Church , and if the Church community -isaia- slow for a variety of reasons to initiate and sustain an up to date and courageous pastoral_care for young_people , they risk being left to themselves , -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of their psychological frailty ? dissatisfied and critical of a world of adults who , in failing to live the faith in a consistent and mature fashion , do not appear to them as credible models . Thus we see_how difficult it -isaia- to present young_people with a full and penetrating experience of Christian and ecclesial life and to educate them in it . So , the prospect of having a vocation to the priesthood -isaia- far from the actual everyday interests which young_men have in life . Nevertheless , there_are positive situations and tendencies which bring_about and nurture in the heart of adolescents and young_men a new readiness , and even a genuine search , for ethical and spiritual values . These naturally offer favorable conditions for embarking on the journey of a vocation which_leads toward_the total gift_of_self to Christ and to the Church in the priesthood . First of all , mention should be made of the decrease of certain phenomena which_had caused many problems in the recent past , such as radical rebellion , libertarian tendencies , utopian claims , indiscriminate forms of socialization and violence . It must be recognized , moreover , that today s young_people , with the vigor and vitality typical of their age , are_also bearers of ideals which_are coming to the fore in history : the thirst_for freedom ; the recognition of the inestimable value of the person ; the need_for authenticity and sincerity ; a new conception and style of reciprocity in the rapport between men_and_women ; a convinced and earnest seeking after a more just , sympathetic and united world ; openness and dialogue_with all ; and the commitment to peace . The fruitful and active development among so many young_people today of numerous and varied forms of voluntary service , directed toward_the most forgotten and forsaken of our society , represents in these times a particularly important resource for personal growth . It stimulates and sustains young_people in a style of life which_-isaia- less self interested and more open and sympathetic toward_the poor . This way_of_life can_help young_men perceive , desire and accept a vocation to stable and total service of others , following the path of complete consecration to God as a priest . The recent collapse of ideologies , the heavily critical opposition to a world of adults who do not_always offer a witness of a life based on moral and transcendent values , and the experience of companions who seek escape through drugs and violence contribute in no small fashion to making more keen and inescapable the fundamental question as to what values are truly capable of giving the fullest meaning to life , suffering and death . For many young_people the question of religion and the need_for spirituality are becoming more explicit . This -isaia- illustrated in the desire_for '' desert experiences '' and for prayer , in the return to a more personal and regular reading of the word of God and in the study of theology . As has happened in their involvement in the sphere of voluntary social service , young_people are becoming more actively involved as leaders in the ecclesial_community , above all through_their membership in various groups whether traditional but renewed ones or of more_recent origin . Their experience of a Church challenged to undertake a '' new_evangelization '' by virtue of her faithfulness to the Spirit who animates her and in response to the demands of a world far from Christ but in need of him , as well as their experience of a Church ever_more united with individuals and peoples in the defense and promotion of the dignity of the person and of the human_rights of each_and_every one these experiences open the hearts and lives of the young to the exciting and demanding ideals which_can find_their concrete fulfillment in following Christ and in embracing the priesthood . Naturally it -isaia- not_possible to ignore this human and ecclesial situation characterized by strong ambivalence not_only in the pastoral_care of vocations and the formation of future priests , but_also in the care of priests in their_life and ministry and their ongoing_formation . At the same_time , while it -isaia- possible to detect various_forms of '' crisis '' to which priests_are subjected today in their_ministry , in their_spiritual life and indeed in the very interpretation of the nature and significance of the ministerial priesthood mention must likewise be made , in a spirit of joy and hope , of the new positive possibilities which_the present historical moment -isaia- offering to priests for the fulfillment of their_mission . The complex situation of the present_day , briefly outlined above in general terms and examples , needs not_only to be known but_also and above all to be interpreted . Only in this_way can an adequate answer can be given to the fundamental question : How can we form priests_who are truly able to respond to the demands of our_times and capable of evangelizing the world of today ? Knowledge of the situation -isaia- important . However , simply to provide data -isaia-_not_enough ; what_-isaia- needed -isaia- a '' scientific '' inquiry in order to sketch a precise and concrete picture of today s socio cultural and ecclesial circumstances . Even more_important -isaia- an interpretation of the situation . Such an interpretation -isaia- required because of the ambivalence and -atti_degli_apostoli- times contradictions which_are characteristic of the present situation where there_-isaia- a mixture of difficulties and potentialities , negative elements and reasons for hope , obstacles and alternatives , as in the field mentioned in the Gospel where good seed and weeds are both sown and '' co exist '' cf . It -isaia- not_always easy to give an interpretive reading capable of distinguishing good from evil or signs of hope from threats . In the formation of priests it -isaia- not sufficient simply to welcome the positive factors and to counteract the negative ones . The positive factors themselves need to be subjected to a careful work of discernment , so that they_do_not become isolated and contradict one_another , becoming absolutes and -atti_degli_apostoli- odds with one_another . The same -isaia- true for the negative factors , which_are not to be rejected en bloc and without distinction , because in each_one there_may lie hidden some value which awaits liberation and restoration to its_full truth . For a believer the interpretation of the historical situation finds_its principle for understanding and its criterion for making practical choices in a new and unique reality , that_-isaia- , in a Gospel discernment . This interpretation -isaia- a work which_-isaia- done in the light and strength provided by the true and living Gospel , which_-isaia- Jesus Christ , and in virtue of the gift of the Holy Spirit . In such_a_way , Gospel discernment gathers from the historical situation from its events and circumstances not_just a simple '' fact '' to be precisely recorded yet capable of leaving a person indifferent or passive , but a '' task , '' a challenge to responsible freedom both of the individual person and of the community . It -isaia- a '' challenge '' which_-isaia- linked to a '' call '' which God causes to sound in the historical situation itself . In this situation , and also through it , God calls the believer and first of all the Church to ensure_that '' the Gospel of vocation and priesthood '' expresses its perennial truth in the changing circumstances of life . In this case , the words of the Second Vatican Council are_also applicable to the formation of priests : '' The Church has_always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel so that in a language intelligible to every generation , she_can respond to the perennial questions which people ask about_this present life and the life to come , and about the relationship of the one to the other . We must_therefore recognize and understand_the world in which we live , it s expectations , its longings and its often dramatic characteristics . '' This Gospel discernment -isaia- based on trust in the love of Jesus Christ , who always and tirelessly cares for his Church cf . : , he the Lord and Master , the key , the center and the purpose of the whole of human_history . This discernment -isaia- nourished by the light and strength of the Holy Spirit who evokes everywhere and in all circumstances , obedience to the faith , the joyous courage of following Jesus , and the gift of wisdom , which judges all things and -isaia- judged by no one cf . It rests on the fidelity of the Father to his promises . In this_way the Church feels that_she can face the difficulties and challenges of this_new period of history and can_also provide , in the present and in the future , priests_who are_well trained to be convinced and fervent ministers of the '' new_evangelization , '' faithful and generous servants of Jesus Christ and of the human_family . We are_not unmindful of difficulties in this_regard ; they_are neither few nor insignificant . However , to surmount these difficulties we have -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal our_hope , our_faith in the unfailing love of Christ , and our certainty_that the priestly_ministry in the life of the Church and in the world knows no substitute . CHAPTER II HE HAS ANOINTED ME AND HAS SENT ME FORTHThe Nature and Mission of the Ministerial Priesthood A Look -atti_degli_apostoli- the Priest . '' The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him '' Lk . What the evangelist Luke says about the people in the synagogue -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth that Sabbath , listening to Jesus commentary on the words of the prophet Isaiah which_he_had just read , can be applied to all Christians . They are always called to recognize in Jesus of Nazareth the definitive fulfillment of the message of the prophets : '' And he began to say to them , Today this Scripture has_been fulfilled in your hearing '' Lk . The '' Scripture '' he had read was this : '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor . He has_sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty those_who_are oppressed , to proclaim_the acceptable year of the Lord '' Lk . Jesus thus presents himself as filled_with_the Spirit , '' consecrated with an anointing , '' '' sent to preach good_news to the poor . '' He -isaia- the Messiah , the Messiah who_-isaia- priest , prophet and king . These are the features of Christ upon which_the eyes of faith and love of Christians should be fixed . Using this '' contemplation '' as a starting point and making continual reference to it , the synod_fathers reflected on the problem of priestly formation in present_day circumstances . This problem cannot be solved without previous reflection upon the goal of formation , that_-isaia- , the ministerial priesthood , or more precisely , the ministerial priesthood as a participation in the Church in the very priesthood of Jesus Christ . Knowledge of the nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood -isaia- an essential presupposition , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the surest guide and incentive toward_the development of pastoral activities in the Church for fostering and discerning vocations to the priesthood and training those called to the ordained ministry . A correct and in depth awareness of the nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood -isaia- the path which must_be_taken and in fact the synod did take it in order to emerge from the crisis of priestly identity . In the final address to the synod I stated : '' This crisis arose in the years immediately following the Council . It was based on an erroneous understanding of and sometimes even a conscious bias against the doctrine of the conciliar magisterium . Undoubtedly , herein lies one of the reasons for the great number of defections experienced then by the Church , losses which did serious harm to pastoral_ministry and priestly vocations , especially missionary vocations . It -isaia- as though the synod rediscovering , by means of the many statements which we heard in this hall , the full depth of priestly identity has striven to instill hope in the wake of these sad losses . These statements showed an awareness of the specific ontological bond which unites the priesthood to Christ the high_priest and good_shepherd . This identity -isaia- built upon the type of formation which_must be provided for priesthood and then endure throughout_the priest s whole_life . This was_the precise purpose of the synod . '' For this_reason_the synod considered it necessary to summarize the nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood , as the Church s faith_has acknowledged them down_the_centuries of its history and as the Second Vatican Council has presented them anew to the people of our_day . In the Church as Mystery , Communion and Mission . '' The priest s identity , '' as the synod_fathers wrote , '' like every Christian identity , has its source in the Blessed Trinity , '' which -isaia-_revealed and -isaia- communicated to people in Christ , establishing , in him and through the Spirit , the Church as '' the seed and the beginning of the kingdom . '' The apostolic_exhortation Christifideles Laici , summarizing the Council s teaching , presents the Church as mystery , communion and mission : '' She -isaia- mystery because the very life and love of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit are the gift gratuitously offered to all those_who_are born of water and the Spirit cf . : and called to relive the very communion of God and to manifest it and communicate it in history mission . '' It -isaia- within_the Church s mystery , as a mystery of Trinitarian communion in missionary tension , that_every Christian identity -isaia-_revealed , and likewise the specific identity of the priest and his_ministry . Indeed , the priest , by virtue of the consecration which he receives in the sacrament of orders , -isaia- sent forth by the Father through the mediatorship of Jesus Christ , to whom he -isaia- configured in a special_way as head and shepherd of his_people , in order to live and work by the power of the Holy Spirit in service of the Church and for the salvation of the world . In this_way the fundamentally '' relational '' dimension of priestly identity can be understood . Through the priesthood which arises from the depths of the ineffable mystery of God , that_-isaia- , from the love of the Father , the grace of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit s gift of unity , the priest sacramentally enters into communion with the bishop and with_other priests in order to serve the People of God who_are the Church and to draw all mankind to Christ in accordance_with_the Lord s prayer : '' Holy Father , keep them in your name , which_you have_given me , that_they_may be one , even as we are_one . even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that_they also may be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn . Consequently , the nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood cannot be defined except through_this multiple and rich interconnection of relationships which arise from the Blessed Trinity and are prolonged in the communion of the Church , as a sign and instrument of Christ , of communion with God and of the unity of all humanity . In this_context the ecclesiology of communion becomes decisive for understanding the identity of the priest , his essential dignity , and his vocation and mission among the People of God and in the world . Reference to the Church -isaia- therefore necessary , even if not primary , in defining the identity of the priest . As a mystery , the Church -isaia- essentially related to Jesus Christ . She -isaia-_his fullness , his_body , his spouse . She -isaia- the '' sign '' and living '' memorial '' of his permanent presence and activity in our midst and on our behalf . The priest finds the full truth of his identity in being a derivation , a specific participation in and continuation of Christ himself , the one high_priest of the new and eternal covenant . The priest_-isaia- a living and transparent image of Christ the priest . The priesthood of Christ , the expression of his absolute '' newness '' in salvation history , constitutes the one source and essential model of the priesthood shared by all Christians and the priest in particular . Reference to Christ -isaia- thus_the absolutely necessary key for understanding the reality of priesthood . The Fundamental Relationship With Christ the Head and Shepherd . Jesus Christ has revealed in himself_the perfect and definitive features of the priesthood of the new Covenant . He did this throughout his earthly life , but especially in the central event of his_passion , death_and_resurrection . As the author of the letter to the Hebrews writes , Jesus , being a man like us and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the only_begotten Son of God , -isaia- in his_very being the perfect mediator between_the Father and humanity cf . Thanks to the gift of his Holy Spirit he gives us immediate access to God : '' God has_sent the Spirit of his Son into our_hearts , crying , Abba ! Father ! '' Gal . : Jesus brought his role as mediator to complete fulfillment when he offered himself on the cross , thereby opening to us , once and for all , access to the heavenly sanctuary , to the Father s house cf . Compared with Jesus , Moses and all other '' mediators '' between God and his_people in the Old Testament kings , priests and prophets are no more_than '' figures '' and '' shadows of the good things to come '' instead of '' the true form of these realities '' cf . Jesus -isaia- the promised good_shepherd cf . , who knows each_one of his sheep , who offers his_life for them and who wishes to gather them together as one flock with one shepherd cf . He -isaia- the shepherd who_has come '' not to be served but to serve '' Mt . : , who in the paschal action of the washing of the feet cf . : leaves to his_disciples a model of service to one_another and who freely offers himself as the '' innocent lamb '' sacrificed for our redemption cf . With the one definitive sacrifice of the cross , Jesus communicated to all his_disciples the dignity and mission of priests of the new and eternal covenant . And thus_the promise which God had made to Israel was fulfilled : '' You shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation '' Ex . Peter , the whole_people of the new_covenant -isaia- established as '' a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ '' Pt . The baptized are '' living stones '' who build the spiritual edifice by keeping close to Christ , '' that living stone . in God s sight chosen and precious '' Pt . The new priestly people which_-isaia- the Church not_only has its authentic image in Christ , but_also receives from him a real ontological share in his one eternal priesthood , to which_she must conform every aspect of her_life . For the sake of this universal priesthood of the new_covenant Jesus gathered disciples during his earthly mission cf . : , and with a specific and authoritative mandate he called and appointed the Twelve '' to be with_him , and to be sent out to preach and have authority to cast out demons '' Mk . For this_reason , already during his public ministry cf . : , and then most fully after_his death_and_resurrection cf . ; , Jesus had conferred on Peter and the Twelve entirely special powers with_regard to the future community and the evangelization of all peoples . After having called them to follow_him , he kept them -atti_degli_apostoli- his side and lived with_them , imparting his_teaching of salvation to them through word and example , and finally he sent them out to all mankind . To enable them to carry_out this_mission Jesus confers upon the apostles , by a specific paschal outpouring of the Holy Spirit , the same messianic authority which_he_had received_from_the Father , conferred in its fullness in his_resurrection : '' All authority in heaven and on earth has_been_given to me . Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you ; and lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt . Jesus thus established a close relationship_between_the ministry entrusted to the apostles and his_own mission : '' He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him_who sent me '' Mt . : ; '' He who hears you hears me , and he who rejects you rejects me , and he who rejects me rejects him_who sent me '' Lk . Indeed , in the light of the paschal event of the death_and_resurrection , the fourth Gospel affirms this with_great force and clarity : '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn . Just as Jesus has a mission which_comes to him directly from God and makes present_the very authority of God cf . : ; : , so too the apostles have a mission which_comes to them_from Jesus . And just as '' the Son can do nothing of his_own accord '' Jn . : such that_his teaching_-isaia- not his_own but the teaching of the One who sent him cf . : , so Jesus says to the apostles : '' Apart from me you can do nothing '' Jn . Their mission_-isaia- not theirs but -isaia-_the_same mission of Jesus . All this_-isaia- possible not as a result of human abilities , but only_with the '' gift '' of Christ and his Spirit , with the '' sacrament '' : '' Receive the Holy Spirit . If you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of any , they_are retained '' Jn . And so the apostles , not by any special merit of their_own , but_only through a gratuitous participation in the grace of Christ , prolong throughout history to the end of time the same mission of Jesus on behalf of humanity . The sign and presupposition of the authenticity and fruitfulness of this mission_-isaia- the apostles unity with Jesus and , in him , with one_another and with the Father as the priestly prayer of our Lord , which sums up his_mission , bears_witness cf . In their turn , the apostles , appointed by the Lord , progressively carried_out their_mission by calling in various but complementary ways other men as bishops , as priests and as deacons in order to fulfill the command of the risen Jesus who sent them forth to all people in every_age . The writings of the New Testament are unanimous in stressing that it -isaia-_the_same Spirit of Christ who introduces these_men chosen from among their brethren into the ministry Through the laying on of hands cf . : which transmits the gift of the Spirit , they_are_called and empowered to continue the same ministry of reconciliation , of shepherding the flock of God and of teaching cf . Therefore , priests_are called to prolong the presence of Christ , the one high_priest , embodying his way_of_life and making him visible in the midst of the flock entrusted to their care . We find this clearly and precisely stated in the first letter of Peter : '' I exhort the elders among_you , as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as well as a partaker in the glory that_-isaia- to be revealed . Tend the flock of God that_-isaia- your charge , not by constraint but willingly , not_for shameful gain but eagerly , not as domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock . And when_the chief Shepherd -isaia- manifested you will obtain the unfading crown of glory '' Pt . In the Church and on behalf of the Church , priests_are a sacramental representation of Jesus Christ the head and shepherd authoritatively proclaiming his_word , repeating his acts of forgiveness and his offer of salvation particularly in baptism , penance and the Eucharist , showing his loving concern to the point of a total gift_of_self for the flock , which_they gather into unity and lead to the Father through Christ and in the Spirit . In a word , priests exist and act in order to proclaim_the Gospel to the world and to build up the Church in the name and person of Christ the head and shepherd . This -isaia- the ordinary and proper way_in_which ordained ministers share in the one priesthood of Christ . By the sacramental anointing of holy_orders , the Holy Spirit configures them in a new and special_way to Jesus Christ the head and shepherd ; he forms and strengthens them_with his pastoral_charity ; and he gives them an authoritative role in the Church as servants of the proclamation of the Gospel to every people and of the fullness of Christian life of all the baptized . The truth of the priest as it emerges from the Word of God , that_-isaia- , from Jesus Christ himself and from his constitutive plan_for the Church , -isaia- thus proclaimed with joyful gratitude by the Preface of the liturgy of the Chrism Mass : '' By your Holy Spirit you anointed your only Son high_priest of the new and eternal covenant . With wisdom and love you_have planned that_this one priesthood should continue in the Church . Christ gives the dignity of a royal priesthood to the people he has made his_own . From these , with a brother s love , he chooses men to share his sacred_ministry by the laying on of hands . He appointed them to renew in his_name the sacrifice of redemption as they set before your family his paschal meal . He calls them to lead your holy people in love , nourish them by your word and strengthen them through the sacraments . Father , they_are to give their live in your service and for the salvation of your_people as they strive to grow in the likeness of Christ and honor you by their courageous witness of faith and love . '' Serving the Church and the World . The priest s fundamental relationship -isaia- to Jesus Christ , head and shepherd . Indeed , the priest participates in a specific and authoritative way in the '' consecration anointing '' and in the '' mission '' of Christ cf . But intimately linked to this relationship -isaia- the priest s relationship_with the Church . It -isaia- not a question of '' relations '' which_are merely juxtaposed , but_rather of ones which_are interiorly united in a kind of mutual immanence . The priest s relation to the Church -isaia- inscribed in the very relation which_the priest has to Christ , such that the '' sacramental representation '' to Christ serves as the basis and inspiration for the relation of the priest to the Church . In this_sense the synod_fathers wrote : '' Inasmuch as he represents Christ the head , shepherd and spouse of the Church , the priest_-isaia- placed not_only in the Church but_also in the forefront of the Church . The priesthood , along_with the word of God and the sacramental signs which it serves , belongs to the constitutive elements of the Church . The ministry of the priest_-isaia- entirely on behalf of the Church ; it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- promoting the exercise of the common priesthood of the entire People of God ; it -isaia- ordered not_only to the particular Church but_also to the universal Church Presbyterorum Ordinis , , in communion with the bishop , with Peter and under Peter . Through the priesthood of the bishop , the priesthood of the second order -isaia- incorporated in the apostolic structure of the Church . In this_way priests , like the apostles , act as ambassadors of Christ cf . This -isaia- the basis of the missionary character of every priest . '' Therefore , the ordained ministry arises with the Church and has in bishops , and in priests_who are related to and are in communion with_them , a particular relation to the original ministry of the apostles to which it truly '' succeeds '' even_though with_regard to the latter it assumes different_forms . Consequently , the ordained priesthood ought not to be thought of as existing prior to the Church , because_it_-isaia- totally -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church . Nor should it be considered as posterior to the ecclesial_community , as if the Church could be imagined as already established without this priesthood . The relation of the priest to Jesus Christ , and in him to his Church , -isaia- found in the very being of the priest by virtue of his sacramental consecration anointing and in his activity , that_-isaia- , in his_mission or ministry . In particular , '' the priest minister -isaia- the servant of Christ present in the Church as mystery , communion and mission . In virtue of his participation in the anointing and mission of Christ , the priest can continue Christ s prayer , word , sacrifice and salvific action in the Church . In this_way , the priest_-isaia- a servant of the Church as mystery because he actuates the Church s sacramental signs of the presence of the risen Christ . He -isaia- a servant of the Church as communion because in union with the bishop and closely related to the presbyterate he builds up the unity of the Church community in the harmony of diverse vocations , charisms and services . Finally , the priest_-isaia- a servant to the Church as mission because he makes_the community a herald and witness of the Gospel . '' Thus , by his_very nature and sacramental mission , the priest appears in the structure of the Church as a sign of the absolute priority and gratuitousness of the grace given to the Church by the risen Christ . Through the ministerial priesthood the Church becomes aware in faith_that her being comes not from herself but_from the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit . The apostles and their successors , inasmuch as they exercise an authority which_comes to them_from Christ , the head and shepherd , are placed with their_ministry in the fore front of the Church as a visible continuation and sacramental sign of Christ in his_own position before the Church and the world , as the enduring and ever_new source of salvation , he '' who_-isaia- head of the Church , his_body , and -isaia- himself its savior '' Eph . By its_very nature , the ordained ministry can be carried_out only to the extent_that the priest_-isaia- united to Christ through sacramental participation in the priestly order , and thus to the extent that_he_-isaia- in hierarchical communion with_his own bishop . The ordained ministry has a radical '' communitarian form '' and can_only be carried_out as '' a collective work . '' The Council dealt extensively with this communal aspect of the nature of the priesthood , examining in succession the relationship of the priest with_his own bishop , with_other priests and with the lay_faithful . The ministry of priests -isaia- above all communion and a responsible and necessary cooperation_with the bishop s ministry , in concern_for the universal Church and for the individual particular_churches , for whose service they form with the bishop a single presbyterate . Each priest , whether diocesan or religious , -isaia- united to the other members of this presbyterate on the basis of the sacrament of holy_orders and by particular bonds of apostolic charity , ministry and fraternity All priests in fact , whether diocesan or religious , share in the one priesthood of Christ the head and shepherd ; '' they work_for the same cause , namely , the building up of the body of Christ , which demands a variety of functions and new adaptations , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , '' and -isaia- enriched down_the_centuries by ever_new charisms . Finally , because their role and task within_the Church do not replace but promote the baptismal priesthood of the entire People of God , leading it to its_full ecclesial realization , priests have a positive and helping relationship to the laity . Priests are there to serve the faith , hope and charity of the laity . They recognize and uphold , as brothers and friends , the dignity of the laity as children of God and help_them to exercise fully their_specific role in the overall context of the Church s mission . The ministerial priesthood conferred by the sacrament of holy_orders and the common or '' royal '' priesthood of the faithful , which differ essentially and not_only in degree , are ordered one to the other for each in its_own way derives from the one priesthood of Christ . Indeed , the ministerial priesthood does_not of itself signify a greater degree of holiness with_regard to the common priesthood of the faithful ; through it Christ gives to priests , in the Spirit , a particular gift so that_they_can help the People of God to exercise faithfully and fully the common priesthood which it has_received . As the Council points_out , '' the spiritual gift_which priests have_received in ordination does_not prepare them merely for a limited and circumscribed mission , but_for the fullest , in fact the universal , mission of salvation to the end of the earth . The reason -isaia- that_every priestly_ministry shares in the fullness of the mission entrusted by Christ to the apostles . '' By the very nature of their_ministry they_should therefore be penetrated and animated by a profound missionary spirit and '' with_that truly Catholic spirit_which habitually looks beyond_the boundaries of diocese , country or rite to meet_the needs of the whole Church , being prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel everywhere . '' Furthermore , precisely_because within_the Church s life the priest_-isaia- a man of communion , in his relations with all people he must be a man of mission and dialogue . Deeply rooted in the truth and charity of Christ , and impelled by the desire and imperative to proclaim Christ s salvation to all , the priest_-isaia- called to witness in all his relationships to fraternity , service and a common quest for the truth , as well as a concern_for the promotion of justice_and_peace . This -isaia- the case above all with the brethren of other_churches and Christian denominations , but it also extends to the followers of other_religions , to people_of_good_will and in particular to the poor and the defenseless , and to all who yearn even if they_do_not know it or cannot express it for the truth and the salvation of Christ , in accordance_with_the words of Jesus who said : '' Those who are_well have no need of a physician , but those_who_are sick ; I came not to call the righteous , but sinners '' Mk . Today , in particular , the pressing pastoral task of the new_evangelization calls for the involvement of the entire People of God , and requires a new fervor , new methods and a new expression for the announcing and witnessing of the Gospel . This task demands priests_who are deeply and fully immersed in the mystery of Christ and capable of embodying a new style of pastoral life , marked by a profound communion with the pope , the bishops and other priests , and a fruitful cooperation_with the lay_faithful , always respecting and fostering the different roles , charisms and ministries present within_the ecclesial_community . '' Today this scripture has_been fulfilled in your hearing '' Lk . Let us listen once_again to these_words of Jesus in the light of the ministerial priesthood which_we_have presented in its_nature and mission . The '' today '' to which Jesus refers , precisely_because it belongs to and defines the '' fullness_of_time , '' the time of full and definitive salvation , indicates the time of the Church . The consecration and mission of Christ '' The Spirit of the Lord . has anointed me and has_sent me to preach good_news to the poor '' cf . : are the living branch from which bud the consecration and mission of the Church , the '' fullness '' of Christ cf . In the rebirth of baptism , the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- poured out on all believers , consecrating them as a spiritual temple and a holy priesthood and sending them forth to make known the marvels of him_who out of darkness has called them_into his marvelous light cf . The priest shares in Christ s consecration and mission in a specific and authoritative way , through the sacrament of holy_orders , by virtue of which he -isaia- configured in his being to Jesus Christ , head and shepherd , and shares in the mission of '' preaching the good_news to the poor '' in the name and person of Christ himself . In their final message the synod_fathers summarized briefly but eloquently the '' truth , '' or better the '' mystery '' and '' gift '' of the ministerial priesthood , when_they stated : '' We derive our identity ultimately from the love of the Father , we turn our gaze to the Son , sent by the Father as high_priest and good_shepherd . Through the power of the Holy Spirit , we are_united sacramentally to him in the ministerial priesthood . Our priestly life and activity continue the life and activity of Christ himself . Here lies our identity , our true dignity , the source of our joy , the very basis of our life . '' CHAPTER III THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON METhe Spiritual Life of the Priest A '' Specific '' Vocation to Holiness . '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me '' Lk . The Spirit -isaia- not_simply '' upon '' the Messiah , but he '' fills '' him , penetrating every_part of him and reaching to the very depths of all that_he_-isaia- and does . Indeed , the Spirit -isaia- the principle of the '' consecration '' and '' mission '' of the Messiah : '' Because he has anointed me and sent me to preach good_news to the poor '' cf . Through the Spirit , Jesus belongs totally and exclusively to God and shares in the infinite holiness of God , who calls him , chooses him and sends him forth . In this_way the Spirit of the Lord -isaia-_revealed as the source of holiness and of the call to holiness . This name '' Spirit of the Lord '' -isaia- '' upon '' the entire People of God , which becomes established as a people '' consecrated '' to God and '' sent '' by God to announce the Gospel of salvation . The members of the People of God are '' inebriated '' and '' sealed '' with the Spirit cf . : ; : and called to holiness . In particular , the Spirit reveals to us and communicates the fundamental calling which_the Father addresses to everyone from all eternity : the vocation to be '' holy and blameless before him . in love , '' by virtue of our predestination to be his adopted children through Jesus Christ cf . This -isaia- not all . By revealing and communicating this vocation to us , the Spirit becomes within us the principle and wellspring of its fulfillment . He , the Spirit of the Son cf . : , configures us to Christ Jesus and makes us sharers in his_life as Son , that_-isaia- , sharers in his_life of love for the Father and for our_brothers_and_sisters . '' If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit '' Gal . In these_words the apostle Paul reminds us that a Christian life_-isaia- a '' spiritual_life , '' that_-isaia- , a life enlivened and led by the Spirit toward holiness or the perfection of charity . The Council s statement that '' all Christians in any state or walk of life are_called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity '' applies in a special_way to priests . They are_called not only_because they_have_been baptized , but_also and specifically because_they_are priests , that_-isaia- , under a new title and in new and different_ways deriving from the sacrament of holy_orders . The Council s Decree on Priestly Life and Ministry gives us a particularly rich and thought provoking synthesis of the priest s '' spiritual_life '' and of the gift and duty to become '' saints '' : '' By the sacrament of orders priests_are configured to Christ the priest so that as ministers of the head and co workers with the episcopal order they_may build up and establish his whole_body which_-isaia- the Church . Like all Christians they have_already received in the consecration of baptism the sign and gift of their great calling and grace_which enables and obliges them even in the midst of human weakness to seek perfection cf . : , according to the Lord s word : You , therefore , must be perfect , as your heavenly Father -isaia- perfect Mt . But priests_are bound in a special_way to strive for_this perfection , since_they are consecrated to God in a new_way by their ordination . They have_become living instruments of Christ the eternal priest , so that_through the ages they , can accomplish his wonderful work of reuniting the whole_human_race with heavenly power . Therefore , since every priest in his_own way represents the person of Christ himself , he -isaia- endowed_with a special grace . By this grace the priest , through_his service of the people committed to his care and all the People of God , -isaia- able the better to pursue the perfection of Christ , whose place he takes . The human weakness of his flesh -isaia- remedied by the holiness of him_who became for us a high_priest holy , innocent , undefiled , separated_from sinners Heb . '' The Council first affirms the '' common '' vocation to holiness . This vocation -isaia- rooted in baptism , which characterizes the priest as one of the '' faithful '' Christifedelis , as a '' brother among brothers , '' a member of the People of God , joyfully sharing in the gifts of salvation cf . : and in the common duty of walking '' according to the Spirit '' in the footsteps of the one master and Lord . We recall_the celebrated words of St . Augustine : '' For you I -amos- a bishop , with you I -amos- a Christian . The former title speaks of a task undertaken , the latter of grace ; the former betokens danger , the latter salvation . '' With the same clarity the conciliar text also speaks of a '' specific '' vocation to holiness , or more precisely of a vocation based on the sacrament of holy_orders as a sacrament proper and specific to the priest and thus involving a new consecration to God through ordination . Augustine also alludes to this specific vocation when , after_the words '' For you I -amos- a bishop , with you I -amos- a Christian , he goes on to say : '' If therefore it -isaia- to me a greater cause for joy to have_been rescued with you than to have_been placed as your leader , following the Lord s command , I will devote myself to the best of my abilities to serve you , so as not to show myself ungrateful to him_who rescued me with_that price which_has made me your fellow servant . '' The conciliar text goes on to point_out some elements necessary_for defining what constitutes the '' specific quality '' of the priest s spiritual_life . These are elements connected_with_the priest s '' consecration , '' which configures him to Christ the head and shepherd of the Church , with the '' mission '' or ministry peculiar to the priest ; which equips and obliges him to be a '' living instrument of Christ the eternal priest '' and to act '' in the name and in the person of Christ himself '' and with_his entire '' life , '' called to manifest and witness in a fundamental way the '' radicalism of the Gospel . '' Configuration to Christ , the Head and Shepherd , and Pastoral Charity . By sacramental consecration the priest_-isaia- configured to Jesus Christ as head and shepherd of the Church , and he -isaia- endowed_with a '' spiritual power '' which_-isaia- a share in the authority with_which Jesus Christ guides the Church through_his Spirit . By virtue of this consecration brought_about by the outpouring of the Spirit in the sacrament of holy_orders , the spiritual_life of the priest_-isaia- marked , molded and characterized by the way of thinking and acting proper to Jesus Christ , head and shepherd of the Church , and which_are summed up in his_pastoral charily . Jesus Christ -isaia- head of the Church his_body . He -isaia- the '' head '' in the new and unique sense of being a '' servant , '' according_to_his own words : '' The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mk . Jesus service attains its fullest expression in his_death on the cross , that_-isaia- , in his total gift_of_self in humility and love . '' He emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men . And being found in human form , he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even death on a cross '' Phil . The authority of Jesus Christ as head coincides then with_his service , with_his gift , with_his total , humble and loving dedication on behalf of the Church . All this he did in perfect obedience to the Father ; he -isaia-_the_one true Suffering Servant of God , both priest and victim . The spiritual existence of every priest receives its life and inspiration from exactly this type of authority , from service to the Church , precisely inasmuch as it -isaia- required by the priest s configuration to Jesus Christ Head and Servant of the Church . Augustine once reminded a bishop on the day of his ordination : '' He who_-isaia- head of the people must in the first_place realize that_he_-isaia- to be the servant of many . And he should_not disdain being such ; I say it once_again , he should_not disdain being the servant of many , because the Lord of Lords did_not disdain to make himself our servant . '' The spiritual_life of the ministers of the New Testament should therefore be marked by this fundamental attitude of service to the People of God cf . : , freed from all presumption of desire of '' lording over '' those in their charge cf . The priest_-isaia- to perform this service freely and willingly as God desires . In this_way the priests , as the ministers , the '' elders '' of the community , will be in their person the '' model '' of the flock , which for its part -isaia- called to display this_same priestly attitude of service toward_the world in order to bring to humanity the fullness of life and complete liberation . The figure of Jesus Christ as shepherd of the Church , his flock , takes up and represents in new and more evocative terms the same content as that of Jesus Christ as head and servant . Fulfilling the prophetic proclamation of the Messiah and savior joyfully announced by the psalmist and the prophet Ezekiel cf . , Jesus presents himself as '' the good_shepherd '' Jn . : , , not_only of Israel but of all humanity cf . His whole life_-isaia- a continual manifestation of his '' pastoral_charity , '' or rather , a daily enactment of it . He feels compassion for the crowds because_they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd cf . He goes in search of the straying and scattered sheep cf . : and joyfully celebrates their return . He gathers and protects them . He knows them and calls each_one by name cf . He leads them to green pastures and still waters cf . and spreads a table for them , nourishing them_with his own_life . The good_shepherd offers this_life through_his own death_and_resurrection , as the Church sings out in the Roman liturgy : '' The good_shepherd -isaia- risen ! He who laid_down his_life for his sheep , who died for his flock , he -isaia- risen , alleluia . '' The author of the first letter of Peter calls Jesus the '' chief Shepherd '' Pt . : because his_work and mission continue in the Church through the apostles cf . : and their successors cf . , and through priests . By virtue of their consecration , priests_are configured to Jesus the good_shepherd and are_called to imitate and to live out his_own pastoral_charity . Christ s gift of himself to his Church , the fruit of his_love , -isaia- described in terms of that unique gift_of_self made by the bridegroom to the bride , as the sacred texts often suggest . Jesus -isaia- the true bridegroom who offers to the Church the wine of salvation cf . He who_-isaia- '' the head of the Church , his_body , and -isaia- himself its savior '' Eph . : '' loved the Church and gave himself up for_her , that_he_might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word , that_he_might present_the Church to himself in splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that_she might be holy and without blemish '' Eph . The Church -isaia- indeed the body in which Christ the head -isaia- present and active , but she -isaia-_also the bride who proceeds like a new Eve from the open side of the redeemer on the cross . Hence Christ stands '' before '' the Church and '' nourishes and cherishes her '' Eph . : , giving his_life for_her . The priest_-isaia- called to be the living image of Jesus Christ , the spouse of the Church . Of course , he will_always remain a member of the community as a believer alongside his other brothers_and_sisters who_have_been called by the Spirit , but in virtue of his configuration to Christ , the head and shepherd , the priest stands in this spousal relationship_with regard to the community . '' Inasmuch as he represents Christ , the head , shepherd and spouse of the Church , the priest_-isaia- placed not_only in the Church but_also in the forefront of the Church . '' In his spiritual_life , therefore , he -isaia- called to live out Christ s spousal love toward_the Church , his bride . Therefore , the priest s life ought to radiate this spousal character , which demands_that he be a witness to Christ s spousal love and thus be capable of loving people_with a heart which_-isaia- new , generous and pure with genuine self detachment , with full , constant and faithful dedication and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with a kind of '' divine jealousy '' cf . : and even with a kind of maternal tenderness , capable of bearing '' the pangs of birth '' until '' Christ be formed '' in the faithful cf . The internal principle , the force which animates and guides the spiritual_life of the priest inasmuch as he -isaia- configured to Christ the head and shepherd , -isaia- pastoral_charity , as a participation in Jesus Christ s own pastoral_charity , a gift freely bestowed by the Holy Spirit and likewise a task and a call which demand a free and committed response on the part of the priest . The essential content of this pastoral_charity -isaia- the gift_of_self , the total gift_of_self to the Church , following_the_example of Christ . '' Pastoral charity_-isaia- the virtue by which we imitate Christ in his self_giving and service . It -isaia- not_just what we do , but our gift_of_self , which manifests Christ s love for his flock . Pastoral charity determines our way of thinking and acting , our way of relating to people . It makes special demands on us . '' The gift_of_self , which -isaia-_the_source and synthesis of pastoral_charity , -isaia-_directed toward_the Church . This was true of Christ who '' loved the Church and gave himself up for_her '' Eph . : , and the same must be true for the priest . With pastoral_charity , which distinguishes the exercise of the priestly_ministry as an amoris officium , '' the priest , who welcomes the call to ministry , -isaia- in a position to make_this a loving choice , as a result of which_the Church and souls become his_first interest , and with this concrete spirituality he becomes capable of loving the universal Church and that part of it entrusted to him_with the deep love of a husband for his wife . '' The gift_of_self has no limits , marked as it -isaia- by the same apostolic and missionary zeal of Christ , the good_shepherd , who said : '' And I have other sheep , that_are not of this fold ; I must bring them also , and they_will heed my voice . So there shall be one flock , one shepherd '' Jn . Within the Church community the priest s pastoral_charity impels and demands in a particular and specific way his personal relationship_with the presbyterate , united in and with the bishop , as the Council explicitly states : '' Pastoral charity requires that a priest always work in the bond of communion with the bishop and with his_brother priests , lest his efforts be in vain . '' The gift_of_self to the Church concerns her insofar as she_-isaia- the body and the bride of Jesus Christ . In this_way the primary point of reference of the priest s charity_-isaia- Jesus Christ himself . Only in loving and serving Christ the head and spouse will charity become a source , criterion , measure and impetus for the priest s love and service to the Church , the body and spouse of Christ . The apostle Paul had a clear and sure understanding of this_point . Writing to the Christians of the church in Corinth , he refers to '' ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake '' Cor : . Above all , this_was the explicit and programmatic teaching of Jesus when he entrusted to Peter the ministry of shepherding the flock only after_his threefold affirmation of love , indeed only after he had expressed a preferential love : '' He said to him the third time , Simon , son of John , do you love me ? Peter . said to him , Lord , you_know everything ; you know_that I love you . Jesus said to him , Feed my sheep . : Pastoral charity , which_has its specific source in the sacrament of holy_orders , finds_its full expression and its supreme nourishment in the Eucharist . As the Council states : '' This pastoral_charity flows mainly from the eucharistic_sacrifice , which_-isaia- thus_the center and root of the whole priestly life . The priestly soul strives thereby to apply to itself the action which takes_place on the altar of sacrifice . '' Indeed , the Eucharist re presents , makes once_again priest , the sacrifice of the cross , the full gift of Christ to the Church , the gift of his_body given and his_blood shed , as the supreme witness of the fact that_he_-isaia- head and shepherd , servant and spouse of the Church . Precisely because of this , the priest s pastoral_charity not_only flows from the Eucharist but finds in the celebration of the Eucharist its highest realization just as it -isaia- from the Eucharist that he receives the grace and obligation to give his whole_life a '' sacrificial '' dimension . This same pastoral_charity -isaia- the dynamic inner principle capable of unifying the many_different activities of the priest . In virtue of this pastoral_charity the essential and permanent demand for_unity between_the priest s interior life and all his external actions and the obligations of the ministry can be properly fulfilled , a demand particularly urgent in a socio cultural and ecclesial context strongly marked by complexity , fragmentation and dispersion . Only by directing every moment and every_one of his acts toward_the fundamental choice to '' give his_life for the flock '' can the priest guarantee this_unity which_-isaia- vital and indispensable for his harmony and spiritual balance . The Council reminds us that '' priests attain to the unity of their_lives by uniting themselves_with Christ whose food was to fulfill the will of him_who sent him to do his_work . In this_way , by assuming the role of the good_shepherd they_will find in the very exercise of pastoral_charity the bond of priestly perfection which_will unify their_lives and activities . '' The Spiritual Life in the Exercise of the Ministry . The Spirit of the Lord anointed Christ and sent him forth to announce the Gospel cf . The priest s mission_-isaia- not extraneous to his consecration or juxtaposed to it , but represents its intrinsic and vital purpose : Consecration -isaia- for mission . In this_sense , not_only consecration but mission as well -isaia- under the seal of the Spirit and the influence of his sanctifying power . This was_the case in Jesus life . This was_the case in the lives of the apostles and their successors . This -isaia- the case for the entire Church and within her for priests : All have_received the Spirit as a gift and call to holiness in and through the carrying_out of the mission . Therefore , an intimate bond exists between_the priest s spiritual_life and the exercise of his_ministry , a bond which_the Council expresses in this fashion : '' And so it -isaia- that_they_are grounded in the life of the Spirit while they exercise the ministry of the Spirit and of justice cf . : , as long as they_are docile to Christ s Spirit , who_gives them life and guidance . For by their everyday sacred actions , as by the entire ministry which_they exercise in union with the bishop and their fellow priests , they are_being directed toward perfection of life . Priestly holiness itself contributes very greatly to a fruitful fulfillment of the priestly_ministry . '' '' Live the mystery that_has_been placed in your hands ! '' This -isaia- the invitation and admonition which_the Church addresses to the priest in the Rite of Ordination , when_the offerings of the holy people for the eucharistic_sacrifice are placed in his hands . The '' mystery '' of which_the priest_-isaia- a '' steward '' cf . : -isaia- definitively Jesus Christ himself , who in the Spirit -isaia-_the_source of holiness and the call to sanctification . This '' mystery '' seeks expression in the priestly life . For this to be so , there_-isaia- need_for great vigilance and lively awareness . Once again , the Rite of Ordination introduces these_words with this recommendation : '' Beware of what_you will be doing . '' In the same_way Paul had admonished Timothy , '' Do not neglect the gift you_have '' Tm . The relation between a priest s spiritual_life and the exercise of his_ministry can_also be explained on the basis of the pastoral_charity bestowed by the sacrament of holy_orders . The ministry of the priest , precisely_because of its participation in the saving ministry of Jesus Christ the head and shepherd , cannot_fail to express and live out his pastoral_charity which_-isaia- both the source and spirit of his service and gift_of_self . In its objective reality the priestly_ministry -isaia- an '' amoris officium '' , according to the previously quoted expression of St . This objective reality itself serves as both the basis and requirement for a corresponding ethos , which_can be none other_than a life of love , as St . Augustine himself points_out : Sit amoris officium pascere dominicum gregem . This ethos , and as a result the spiritual_life , -isaia- none other_than embracing consciously and freely that_-isaia- to say in one s mind_and_heart , in one s decisions and actions the '' truth '' of the priestly_ministry as an amoris officium . For a spiritual_life that grows through the exercise of the ministry , it -isaia- essential that the priest should continually renew and deepen his awareness of being a minister of Jesus Christ by virtue of sacramental consecration and configuration to Christ the head and shepherd of the Church . This awareness -isaia-_not_only in accordance_with_the very nature of the mission which_the priest carries out on behalf of the Church and humanity , but it also provides a focus for the spiritual_life of the priest who carries out that mission . Indeed , the priest_-isaia- chosen by Christ not as an '' object '' but as a '' person . '' In other_words , he -isaia- not inert and passive , but_rather -isaia- a '' living instrument , '' as the Council states , precisely in the passage where it refers to the duty to pursue this perfection The Council also speaks of priests as '' companions and helpers '' of God who_-isaia- '' the holy one and sanctifier . '' In this_way the exercise of his_ministry deeply involves the priest himself as a conscious , free and responsible person . The bond with Jesus Christ assured by consecration and configuration to him in the sacrament of orders gives_rise to and requires in the priest the further bond which_comes_from his '' intention , '' that_-isaia- , from a conscious and free choice to do in his ministerial activities what_the Church intends to do . This bond tends by its_very nature to become as extensive and profound as possible , affecting one s way of thinking , feeling and life_itself : in other_words , creating a series of moral and spiritual '' dispositions '' which correspond to the ministerial actions performed by the priest . There can be no doubt_that the exercise of the priestly_ministry , especially in the celebration of the sacraments , receives its saving effects from the action of Christ himself who becomes present in the sacraments . But so as to emphasize the gratuitous nature of salvation which_makes a person both '' saved '' and a '' savior '' always and only in Christ God s plan has ordained that the efficacy of the exercise of the ministry -isaia-_also conditioned by a greater or lesser human receptivity and participation . In particular , the greater or lesser degree of the holiness of the minister has a real effect on the proclamation of the word , the celebration of the sacraments and the leadership of the community in charity . This was clearly stated by the Council : '' The very holiness of priests -isaia- of the greatest benefit for the fruitful fulfillment of their_ministry . While it -isaia- possible_for God s grace to carry_out the work of salvation through unworthy ministers , yet God ordinarily prefers to show his wonders through those men_who are_more submissive to the impulse and guidance of the Holy Spirit and who , because_of_their intimate_union with Christ and their holiness of life , are_able to say with St . Paul : It -isaia-_no_longer I who_live , but Christ who lives in me Gal . '' The consciousness that one_-isaia- a minister of Jesus Christ the head and shepherd also brings with it a thankful and joyful awareness_that one has_received a singular grace and treasure from Jesus Christ : the grace of having_been freely chosen by the Lord to be a '' living instrument '' in the work of salvation . This choice bears_witness to Jesus Christ s love for the priest . This love , like other loves and yet even_more so , demands a response . After his_resurrection , Jesus asked Peter the basic question about love : '' Simon , son of John , do you love me more_than these ? '' And following his response Jesus entrusts Peter with the mission : '' Feed my lambs '' Jn . Jesus first asks Peter if he loves him so as to be able to entrust his flock to him . However , in reality it was Christ s own love , free and unsolicited , which gave rise to his question to Peter and to his act of entrusting '' his '' sheep to Peter . Therefore , every ministerial action while it leads to loving and serving the Church provides an incentive to grow in ever_greater love and service of Jesus Christ the head , shepherd and spouse of the Church , a love which_-isaia- always a response to the free and unsolicited love of God in Christ . Growth in the love of Jesus Christ determines in turn the growth of love for the Church : '' We are your shepherds pascimus vobis , with you we receive nourishment pascimur vobiscum . May the Lord give us the strength to love you to the extent of dying for you , either in fact or in desire aut effectu aut affectu . Thanks to the insightful teaching of the Second Vatican Council , we can grasp the conditions and demands , the manifestations and fruits of the intimate bond_between the priest s spiritual_life and the exercise of his threefold ministry of word , sacrament and pastoral_charity . The priest_-isaia- first of all a minister of the word of God . He -isaia- consecrated and sent forth to proclaim_the good_news of the kingdom to all , calling every_person to the obedience of faith and leading believers to an ever_increasing knowledge of and communion in the mystery of God , as revealed and communicated to us in Christ . For this_reason , the priest himself ought first of all to develop a great personal familiarity with the word of God . Knowledge of its linguistic or exegetical aspects , though certainly necessary , -isaia-_not_enough . He needs to approach the word with a docile and prayerful heart so that_it_may deeply penetrate his thoughts and feelings and bring_about a new outlook in him '' the mind of Christ '' Cor . : such that his_words and his choices and attitudes may_become ever_more a reflection , a proclamation and a witness to the Gospel . Only if he '' abides '' in the word will the priest become a perfect disciple of the Lord . Only then will he know_the truth and be set truly free , overcoming every conditioning which_-isaia- contrary or foreign to the Gospel cf . The priest ought to be the first '' believer '' in the word , while being fully aware_that the words of his_ministry are_not '' his , '' but those of the One who sent him . He -isaia- not the master of the word , but its servant . He -isaia- not the sole possessor of the word ; in its regard he -isaia- in debt to the People of God . Precisely because he can and does evangelize , the priest like every_other member of the Church ought to grow in awareness_that he himself_-isaia- continually in need of being evangelized . He proclaims_the word in his capacity as '' minister , '' as a sharer in the prophetic authority of Christ and the Church . As a result , in order_that he himself may possess and give to the faithful the guarantee that_he_-isaia- transmitting the Gospel in its fullness , the priest_-isaia- called to develop a special sensitivity , love and docility to the living tradition of the Church and to her magisterium . These are_not foreign to the word , but serve its_proper interpretation and preserve its authentic meaning . It -isaia- above all in the celebration of the sacraments and in the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours that the priest_-isaia- called to live and witness to the deep unity between_the exercise of his_ministry and his spiritual_life . The gift of grace offered to the Church becomes_the principle of holiness and a call to sanctification . For the priest as well , the truly central place , both in his_ministry and spiritual_life , belongs to the Eucharist , since in it -isaia- contained '' the whole spiritual good of the Church , namely Christ himself our pasch and the living bread which_gives life to men through_his flesh that flesh which_-isaia- given life and gives_life through the Holy Spirit . Thus people_are invited and led to offer themselves , their works and all creation with Christ . '' From the various sacraments , and in particular from the specific grace proper to each of them , the priest s spiritual_life receives certain features . It -isaia- built up and molded by the different characteristics and demands of each of the sacraments as he celebrates them and experiences them . I would_like to make special mention of the sacrament_of_penance , of which priests_are the ministers , but ought also to be its beneficiaries , becoming themselves witnesses of God s mercy toward sinners . Once again , I would_like to set_forth what I wrote in the exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia : '' The priest s spiritual and pastoral life , like that of his brothers_and_sisters , lay and religious , depends , for its quality and fervor , on the frequent and conscientious personal practice of the sacrament_of_penance . The priest s celebration of the Eucharist and administration of the other sacraments , his_pastoral zeal , his relationship_with the faithful , his communion with his_brother priests , his collaboration with_his bishop , his_life of prayer in a word , the whole of his priestly existence , suffers an inexorable decline if by negligence or for some other reason he fails to receive the sacrament_of_penance -atti_degli_apostoli- regular intervals and in a spirit of genuine faith and devotion . If a priest were no longer to go to confession or properly confess his sins , his priestly being and his priestly action would feel its effects very soon , and this_would also be noticed by the community of which he was_the pastor . '' Finally , the priest_-isaia- called to express in his_life the authority and service of Jesus Christ the head and priest of the Church by encouraging and leading the ecclesial_community , that_-isaia- , by gathering together '' the family of God as a fellowship endowed_with the spirit of unity '' and by leading it '' in Christ through the Spirit to God the Father . '' This munus regendi represents a very delicate and complex duty which , in addition to the attention which must_be_given to a variety of persons and their vocations , also involves the ability to coordinate all the gifts and charisms which_the Spirit inspires in the community , to discern them and to put them to good use for the upbuilding of the Church in constant union with the bishops . This ministry demands of the priest an intense spiritual_life , filled_with those qualities and virtues which_are typical of a person_who '' presides over '' and '' leads '' a community , of an '' elder '' in the noblest and richest sense of the word : qualities and virtues such as faithfulness , integrity , consistency , wisdom , a welcoming spirit , friendliness , goodness of heart , decisive firmness in essentials , freedom from overly subjective viewpoints , personal disinterestedness , patience , an enthusiasm for daily tasks , confidence in the value of the hidden workings of grace as manifested in the simple and the poor cf . Priestly Life and the Radicalism of the Gospel . '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me '' Lk . The Holy Spirit poured out in the sacrament of holy_orders -isaia- a source of holiness and a call to sanctification . This -isaia- the case not only_because it configures the priest to Christ , the head and shepherd of the Church , entrusting him_with a prophetic , priestly and royal mission to be carried_out in the name and person of Christ , but also_because it inspires and enlivens his daily existence , enriching it with gifts and demands , virtues and incentives which_are summed up in pastoral_charity . This charity_-isaia- a synthesis which unifies the values and virtues contained in the Gospel and likewise a power which sustains their development toward Christian perfection . For all Christians without exception , the radicalism of the Gospel represents a fundamental , undeniable demand flowing from the call of Christ to follow and imitate him by virtue of the intimate communion of life with_him brought_about by the Spirit cf . This same demand -isaia- made anew to priests , not_only because_they_are '' in '' the Church , but because_they_are '' in the forefront '' of the Church inasmuch as they_are configured to Christ , the head and shepherd . equipped for and committed to the ordained ministry , and inspired by pastoral_charity . Within and as a manifestation of the radicalism of the Gospel one can_find a blossoming of many virtues and ethical demands which_are decisive for the pastoral and spiritual_life of the priest , such as faith , humility in relation to the mystery of God , mercy and prudence . A particularly significant expression of the radicalism of the Gospel -isaia- seen in the different '' evangelical_counsels '' which Jesus proposes in the Sermon on the Mount cf . , and among_them the intimately related counsels of obedience , chastity and poverty . The priest_-isaia- called to live these counsels in accordance_with those ways and , more specifically , those goals and that basic meaning which derive from and express his_own priestly identity . '' Among the virtues most necessary_for the priestly_ministry must be named that disposition of soul by which priests_are always ready to seek not their_own will , but the will of him_who sent them cf . '' It -isaia- in the spiritual_life of the priest that obedience takes on certain special characteristics . First of all , obedience -isaia- '' apostolic '' in the sense_that it recognizes , loves and serves the Church in her hierarchical structure . Indeed , there_can be no genuine priestly_ministry except in communion with the supreme pontiff and the episcopal college , especially with one_s_own diocesan bishop , who deserves that '' filial respect and obedience '' promised during the rite of ordination . This '' submission '' to those invested with ecclesial authority_-isaia- in no way a kind of humiliation . It flows instead from the responsible freedom of the priest who accepts not_only the demands of an organized and organic ecclesial life , but also_that grace of discernment and responsibility in ecclesial decisions which_was assured by Jesus to his_apostles and their successors for the sake of faithfully safeguarding the mystery of the Church and serving the structure of the Christian community among its common path toward salvation . Authentic Christian obedience , when_it_-isaia- properly motivated and lived without servility , helps the priest to exercise in accordance_with_the Gospel the authority entrusted to him for his_work with the People of God : an authority free_from authoritarianism or demagoguery . Only the person_who knows how to obey in Christian really able to require obedience from others in accordance_with_the Gospel . Priestly obedience has_also a '' community '' dimension : It -isaia- not the obedience of an individual who alone relates to authority , but_rather an obedience which_-isaia- deeply a part of the unity of the presbyterate , which as such_-isaia- called to cooperate harmoniously with the bishop and , through_him , with Peter s successor . This aspect of the priest s obedience demands a marked spirit of asceticism , both in the sense of a tendency not to become too bound up in one_s_own preferences or points of view and in the sense of giving brother priests the opportunity to make good use of their talents , and abilities , setting aside all forms of jealousy , envy and rivalry . Priestly obedience should be one of solidarity , based on belonging to a single presbyterate . Within the presbyterate , this obedience -isaia- expressed in co responsibility regarding directions to be taken and choices to be made . Finally , priestly obedience has a particular '' pastoral '' character . It -isaia- lived in an atmosphere of constant readiness to allow oneself to be taken up , as it were '' consumed , '' by the needs and demands of the flock . These last ought to be truly reasonable and -atti_degli_apostoli- times they_need to be evaluated and tested to see_how genuine they_are . But it -isaia- undeniable that the priest s life_-isaia- fully '' taken up '' by the hunger for the Gospel and for faith , hope and love for God and his mystery , a hunger which_-isaia- more_or_less consciously present in the People of God entrusted to him . Referring to the evangelical_counsels , the Council states that '' preeminent among_these counsels -isaia- that precious gift of divine_grace given to some by the Father cf . : in order more_easily to devote_themselves to God alone with an undivided heart cf . This perfect continence for love of the kingdom_of_heaven has_always_been held in high esteem by the Church as a sign and stimulus of love , and as a singular source of spiritual fertility in the world . '' In virginity and celibacy , chastity retains its original meaning , that_-isaia- , of human sexuality lived as a genuine sign of and precious service to the love of communion and gift_of_self to others . This meaning -isaia- fully found in virginity which_makes evident , even in the renunciation of marriage , the '' nuptial meaning '' of the body through a communion and a personal gift to Jesus Christ and his Church which prefigures and anticipates the perfect and final communion and self_giving of the world to come : '' In virginity or celibacy , the human_being -isaia- awaiting , also in a bodily way , the eschatological marriage of Christ with the Church , giving himself or herself completely to the Church in the hope_that Christ may give himself to the Church in the full truth of eternal_life . '' In this light one_can more_easily understand and appreciate the reasons behind the centuries old choice which_the Western Church has made and maintained despite all the difficulties and objections raised down_the_centuries of conferring the order of presbyter only on men_who have_given proof that_they_have been_called by God to the gift of chastity in absolute and perpetual celibacy . The synod_fathers clearly and forcefully expressed their thought on this_matter in an important proposal which deserves to be quoted here in full : '' While in no way interfering with the discipline of the Oriental churches , the synod , in the conviction_that perfect chastity in priestly celibacy -isaia- a charism , reminds priests that celibacy -isaia- a priceless gift of God for the Church and has a prophetic value for the world today . This synod strongly reaffirms what_the Latin Church and some Oriental rites require that_-isaia- , that the priesthood be conferred only on those men_who have_received from God the gift of the vocation to celibate chastity without prejudice to the tradition of some Oriental churches and particular cases of married clergy who convert to Catholicism , which_are admitted as exceptions in Pope Paul VI s encyclical on priestly celibacy , no . The synod does_not wish to leave any doubts in the mind of anyone regarding the Church s firm will to maintain the law that demands perpetual and freely chosen celibacy for present and future candidates_for priestly ordination in the Latin rite . The synod would_like to see celibacy presented and explained in the fullness of its biblical , theological and spiritual richness , as a precious gift given by God to his Church and as a sign of the kingdom which_-isaia-_not of this_world a sign of God s love for this_world and of the undivided love of the priest for God and for God s people , with the result that celibacy -isaia- seen as a positive enrichment of the priesthood . '' It -isaia-_especially important_that the priest understand_the theological motivation of the Church s law on celibacy . Inasmuch as it -isaia- a law , it expresses the Church s will , even before the will of the subject expressed by his readiness . But the will of the Church finds_its ultimate motivation in the link between celibacy and sacred ordination , which configures the priest to Jesus Christ the head and spouse of the Church . The Church , as the spouse of Jesus Christ , wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her head and spouse loved her . Priestly celibacy , then , -isaia- the gift_of_self in and with Christ to his Church and expresses the priest s service to the Church in and with the Lord . For an adequate priestly spiritual_life , celibacy ought not to be considered and lived as an isolated or purely negative element , but as one aspect of the positive , specific and characteristic approach to being a priest . Leaving father and mother , the priest follows Jesus the good_shepherd in an apostolic communion , in the service of the People of God . Celibacy , then , -isaia- to be welcomed and continually renewed with a free and loving decision as a priceless gift from God , as an '' incentive to pastoral_charity '' as a singular sharing in God s fatherhood and in the fruitfulness of the Church , and as a witness to the world of the eschatological kingdom . To put into_practice all the moral , pastoral and spiritual demands of priestly celibacy it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that the priest pray humbly and trustingly , as the Council points_out : '' In the world today , many_people call perfect continence impossible . The more they do so , the more humbly and perseveringly priests should join with the Church in praying for the grace of fidelity . It -isaia- never denied to those_who ask . At the same_time let priests make_use of all the supernatural and natural helps which_are now available to all . '' Once again it -isaia- prayer , together_with_the Church s sacraments and ascetical practice , which_will provide hope in difficulties , forgiveness in failings , and confidence and courage in resuming the journey . On the subject of evangelical poverty , the synod_fathers gave a concise yet important description , presenting it as '' the subjection of all goods to the supreme good of God and his_kingdom . In reality , only the person_who contemplates and lives the mystery of God as the one and supreme good , as the true and definitive treasure , can understand and practice poverty , which_-isaia- certainly not a matter of despising or rejecting material goods but of a loving and responsible use of these goods and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an ability to renounce them with_great interior freedom that_-isaia- , with reference to God and his plan . Poverty for the priest , by virtue of his sacramental configuration to Christ , the head and shepherd , takes on specific '' pastoral '' connotations which_the synod_fathers took up from the Council s teachings and further developed . Among other_things , they wrote : '' Priests , following_the_example of Christ , who , rich though he was , became poor for love of us cf . : should consider_the poor and the weakest as people entrusted in a special_way to them , and they_should be capable of witnessing to poverty with a simple and austere lifestyle , having learned the generous renunciation of superfluous things Optatam Totius , ; Code of Canon Law , Canon . '' It -isaia- true_that '' the workman deserves his wages '' Lk . : and that '' the Lord commanded that_those_who proclaim_the Gospel should get their living by the Gospel '' Cor . : , but_it_-isaia- no less true that_this right of the apostle can in no way be confused with attempts of any_kind to condition service to the Gospel and the Church upon the advantages and interests which_can derive from it . Poverty alone ensures that the priest remains available to be sent wherever his_work will be most useful and needed even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of personal sacrifice . It -isaia- a condition and essential premise of the apostle s docility to the Spirit , making him ready to '' go forth , '' without traveling bag or personalities , following only the will of the Master cf . Being personally involved in the life of the community and being responsible_for it , the priest should_also offer the witness of a total '' honesty '' in the administration of the goods of the community , which he will_never treat as ; f they_were his_own property , but_rather something for_which he will be held accountable by God and his brothers_and_sisters , especially_the poor . Moreover , his awareness of belonging to the one presbyterate will be an incentive for the priest to commit himself to promoting both a more equitable distribution of goods among his fellow priests and a certain common use of goods cf . The interior freedom which_-isaia- safeguarded and nourished by evangelical poverty will_help the priest to stand beside the underprivileged ; to practice solidarity with their_efforts to create a more just society ; to be more sensitive and capable of understanding and discerning realities involving the economic_and_social aspects of life ; and to promote a preferential option for the poor . The latter , while excluding no one from the proclamation and gift of salvation , will assist him in gently approaching the poor , sinners and all those on the margins of society , following the model given by Jesus in carrying_out his prophetic and priestly_ministry cf . Nor should the prophetic significance of priestly poverty be forgotten , so urgently needed in affluent and consumeristic societies : '' A truly poor priest_-isaia- indeed a specific sign of separation from , disavowal of and non submission to the tyranny of a contemporary world_which puts all its trust in money and in material security . '' Jesus Christ , who brought his pastoral_charity to perfection on the cross with a complete exterior and interior emptying of self , -isaia- both the model and source of the virtues of obedience , chastity and poverty which_the priest_-isaia- called to live out as an expression of his pastoral_charity for his brothers_and_sisters . Paul s words to the Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- Philippi , the priest should_have '' the mind which_was in Christ Jesus , '' emptying himself of his_own '' self , '' so as to discover , in a charity_which -isaia- obedient , chaste and poor , the royal road of union with God and unity with_his brothers_and_sisters cf . Membership in and Dedication to the Particular Church . Like every authentically Christian spiritual_life , the spiritual_life of the priest has an essential and undeniable ecclesial dimension which_-isaia- a sharing in the holiness of the Church herself , which we profess in the Creed to be a '' communion of saints . '' The holiness of the Christian has its source in the holiness of the Church ; it expresses that holiness and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time enriches it . This ecclesial dimension takes on special forms , purposes and meanings in the spiritual_life of the priest by virtue of his specific relation to the Church , always as a result of his configuration to Christ the head and shepherd , his ordained ministry and his pastoral_charity . In this perspective , it -isaia- necessary to consider_the priest s membership in and dedication to a particular Church . These two factors are_not the result of purely organizational and disciplinary needs . On the contrary , the priest s relationship_with his bishop in the one presbyterate , his sharing in the bishop s ecclesial concern and his devotion to the evangelical care of the People of God in the specific historical and contextual conditions of a particular Church are elements which must_be_taken into_account in sketching the proper configuration of the priest and his spiritual_life . In this_sense , '' incardination '' cannot be confined to a purely juridical bond , but_also involves a set of attitudes as well as spiritual and pastoral decisions which help to fill out the specific features of the priestly vocation . The priest needs to be aware_that his '' being in a particular Church '' constitutes by its_very nature a significant element in his living a Christian spirituality . In this_sense , the priest finds precisely in his belonging to and dedication to the particular Church a wealth of meaning , criteria for discernment and action which shape both his_pastoral mission and his spiritual_life . Other insights or reference to other traditions of spiritual_life can contribute to the priest s journey toward perfection , for these_are capable of enriching the life of individual priests as well as enlivening the presbyterate with precious spiritual gifts . Such -isaia- the case with many old_and_new Church associations which welcome priests into their_spiritual family : from societies of apostolic_life to priestly secular institutes , and from various_forms of spiritual communion and sharing to ecclesial movements . Priests who belong to religious_orders and congregations represent a spiritual enrichment for the entire diocesan presbyterate , to which_they contribute specific charisms and special ministries , stimulating the particular_church by their presence to be more intensely open to the Church throughout_the_world . The priest s membership in a particular_church and his dedication even to the gift of his_life to the upbuilding of the Church , '' in the person '' of Christ the head and shepherd , in service of the entire Christian community and in a generous and filial relationship_with the bishop , must be strengthened by every charism which becomes part of his priestly life or surrounds it . For the abundance of The Spirit s gifts to be welcomed with_joy and allowed to bear_fruit for the glory of God and the good of the entire Church , each person_-isaia- required first to have a knowledge and discernment of his or her_own charisms and those of others , and always to use these charisms with Christian humility , with firm self control and with the intention , above all else , to help build up the entire community which_each particular charism -isaia- meant to serve . Moreover , all are required to make a sincere effort to live in mutual esteem , to respect others and to hold in esteem all the positive and legitimate diversities present in the presbyterate . This too constitutes part of the priest s spiritual_life and continual practice of asceticism . Membership in and dedication to a particular_church does_not limit the activity and life of the presbyterate to that church : A restriction of this_sort -isaia- not_possible , given the very nature both of the particular_church and of the priestly_ministry . In this_regard the Council teaches_that '' the spiritual gift_which priests received -atti_degli_apostoli- their ordination prepares them_not for_any limited or narrow mission but_for the widest scope of the universal mission of salvation to the end of the earth Acts : . For every priestly_ministry shares in the universality of the mission entrusted by Christ to his_apostles . '' It thus follows_that the spiritual_life of the priest should be profoundly marked by a missionary zeal and dynamism . In the exercise of their_ministry and the witness of their_lives , priests have_the duty to form the community entrusted to them as a truly missionary community . As I wrote in the encyclical Redemptoris Missio , '' all priests must_have the mind_and_heart of missionaries open to the needs of the Church and the world , with concern_for those farthest away and especially_for the non Christian groups in their_own area . They should_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , in their prayers and particularly -atti_degli_apostoli- the eucharistic_sacrifice , the concern of the whole Church for all of humanity . '' If the lives of priests_are generously inspired by this missionary spirit , it will be easier to respond to that increasingly serious demand of the Church today which arises from the unequal distribution of the clergy . In this_regard , the Council was both quite clear and forceful : '' Let priests remember then that_they must_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the care of all the churches . Hence priests belonging to dioceses which_are rich in vocations should show themselves willing and ready , with the permission or -atti_degli_apostoli- the urging of their_own bishop , to exercise their_ministry in other regions , missions or activities which suffer from a shortage of clergy . '' '' Renew in Them the Outpouring of Your Spirit of Holiness '' . '' The Spirit of the Lord -isaia- upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good_news to the poor '' Lk . Even today Christ makes these_words which he proclaimed in the synagogue of Nazareth echo in our priestly hearts . Indeed , our_faith reveals to us the presence of the spirit of Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- work in our being , in our acting and in our living , just as the sacrament of orders has configured , equipped and molded it . Yes , the Spirit of the Lord -isaia- the principal agent in our spiritual_life . He creates our '' new heart , '' inspires it and guides it with the '' new law '' of love , of pastoral_charity . For the development of the spiritual_life it -isaia- essential to be aware_that the priest will_never lack the grace of the Holy Spirit as a totally gratuitous gift and as a task which he -isaia- called to undertake . Awareness of this_gift -isaia- the foundation and support of the priest s unflagging trust amid the difficulties , temptations and weaknesses which he will meet along his spiritual path . Here I would repeat to all priests what I said to so many of them on another occasion : '' The priestly vocation -isaia- essentially a call to holiness in the form which derives from the sacrament of orders . Holiness -isaia- intimacy with God ; it -isaia- the imitation of Christ , who_was poor , chaste and humble ; it -isaia- unreserved love for souls and a giving of oneself on their behalf and for their true good ; it -isaia- love for the Church which_-isaia- holy and wants us to be holy , because this_-isaia- the mission that Christ entrusted to her . Each one of you should_also be holy in order to help your brothers_and_sisters to pursue their_vocation to holiness . '' How can we fail to reflect on . the essential role that the Holy Spirit carries out in this particular call to holiness which_-isaia- proper to the priestly_ministry ? Let us remember the words of the rite of priestly ordination which_are considered to be central in the sacramental formula : Almighty Father , give these your sons the dignity of the priesthood . Renew in them the outpouring of your Spirit of holiness . O Lord , may_they fulfill the ministry of the second degree of priesthood received_from you , and by their example may_they lead all to upright conduct of life . '' Beloved , through ordination , you have_received the same Spirit of Christ , who makes you like him , so that_you can act in his_name and so that his_very mind_and_heart might live in you . This intimate communion with the Spirit of Christ while guaranteeing the efficacy of the sacramental actions which_you perform in persona Christi seeks to be expressed in fervent prayer , in integrity of life , in the pastoral_charity of a ministry tirelessly spending itself for the salvation of the brethren . In a word , it calls for your personal sanctification . '' CHAPTER IV COME AND SEEPriestly Vocation in the Church s Pastoral Work Seek , Follow , Abide . '' Come , and see '' Jn . This was_the reply Jesus gave to the two disciples of John the Baptist who asked him where he was staying . In these_words we find the meaning of vocation . This -isaia- how the evangelist relates the call of Andrew and Peter : '' The next day again John was standing with two of his_disciples ; and he looked -atti_degli_apostoli- Jesus as he walked , and said , Behold , the Lamb of God ! The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Jesus . Jesus turned , and saw them following , and said to them , What do you seek ? Arid they said to him , Rabbi which means Teacher , Where are you staying ? He said to them , Come and see . They came and saw where he was staying ; and they stayed with him_that day , for it was about the tenth hour . '' One of the two who heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter s brother . He first found his_brother , Simon , and said to him , We have found the Messiah which means Christ . He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked -atti_degli_apostoli- him , and said , So you_are Simon the son of John ? You shall be called Cephas which means Peter '' Jn . This Gospel passage -isaia- one of many in the Bible where_the '' mystery '' of vocation -isaia- described , in our case the mystery of the vocation to be apostles of Jesus . This passage of John , which_-isaia- also significant for the Christian vocation as such , has a particular value with_regard to the priestly vocation . As the community of Jesus disciples , the Church -isaia- called to contemplate this scene which in some_way -isaia- renewed constantly down the ages . The Church -isaia- invited to delve more_deeply into the original and personal meaning of the call to follow Christ in the priestly_ministry and the unbreakable bond_between divine_grace and human responsibility which_-isaia- contained and revealed in these_two terms which we find more_than_once in the Gospel : Come follow me cf . She -isaia- asked to discern and to live out he proper dynamism of vocation , its gradual and concrete development in the phases of seeking Christ , finding him and staying with_him . The Church gathers from this '' Gospel of vocation '' the paradigm , strength and impulse behind her pastoral_work of promoting vocations , of her_mission to care_for the birth , discernment and fostering of vocations , particularly those to the priesthood . By the very fact_that '' the lack of priests -isaia- certainly a sad thing for_any Church , '' pastoral_work for vocations needs especially today , to be taken up with a new vigor and more decisive commitment by all the members of the Church , in the awareness that_it_-isaia- not a secondary or marginal matter , or the business of one group only , as if it were but a '' part , '' no matter how important , of the entire pastoral_work of the Church . Rather as the synod_fathers frequently repeated , it -isaia- an essential part of he overall pastoral_work of each Church , a concern which demands to be integrated into and fully identified with the ordinary '' care of souls , '' a connatural and essential dimension of the Church s pastoral_work , of her very life_and_mission . Indeed , concern_for vocations -isaia- a connatural and essential dimension of the Church s pastoral_work . The reason_for this_-isaia- that vocation , in a certain_sense , defines the very being of the Church , even before her activity . In the Church s very name , ecclesia , we find its deep vocational aspect , for the Church -isaia- a '' convocation , '' an assembly of those_who_have been_called : '' All those_who in faith look toward Jesus , the author of salvation and the principle of unity and peace , God has gathered together and established as the Church , that_she may be for each and everyone the visible sacrament of this saving unity . '' A genuinely theological assessment of priestly vocation and pastoral_work in its regard can_only arise from an assessment of the mystery of the Church as a Mysterium vocationis . The Church and the Gift of Vocation . Every Christian vocation finds_its foundation in the gratuitous and prevenient choice made by the Father '' who_has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places , even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that_we_should be holy and blameless before him . He destined us in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ , according to the purpose of his_will '' Eph . Each Christian vocation comes_from God and -isaia- God s gift . However , it -isaia- never bestowed outside of or independently of the Church . Instead it always comes about in the Church and through the Church because , as the Second Vatican Council reminds us , '' God has willed to make men holy and save them , not as individuals without_any bond or link between_them , but_rather to make_them into a people_who might acknowledge him and serve him in holiness . '' The Church not_only embraces in herself all the vocations which God gives her along the path to salvation , but she herself appears as a mystery of vocation , a luminous and living reflection of the mystery of the Blessed Trinity . In truth , the Church , a '' people made one by the unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , '' carries within her the mystery of the Father , who , being neither called nor sent by anyone cf . : , calls all to hallow his_name and do his_will ; she guards within herself the mystery of the Son , who_-isaia- called by the Father and sent to proclaim_the kingdom of God to all and who calls all to follow_him ; and she_-isaia- the trustee of the mystery of the Holy Spirit , who consecrates for mission those_whom the Father calls through_his Son Jesus Christ . The Church , being by her very nature a '' vocation , '' -isaia-_also a begetter and educator of vocations . This -isaia- so because_she -isaia- a '' sacrament , '' a '' sign '' and '' instrument '' in which_the vocation of every Christian -isaia- reflected and lived out . And she_-isaia- so in her activity , in the exercise of her ministry of proclaiming the word , in her celebration of the sacraments and in her service and witness to charity . We can now see the essential dimension of the Christian vocation : Not only does it derive '' from '' the Church and her mediation , not_only does it come to be known and find fulfillment '' in '' the Church , but it also necessarily appears in fundamental service to God as a service '' to '' the Church . Christian vocation , whatever shape it takes , -isaia-_a_gift whose purpose -isaia- to build up the Church and to increase the kingdom of God in the world . What -isaia- true of every vocation -isaia- true specifically of the priestly vocation : The latter -isaia- a call , by the sacrament of holy_orders received in the Church , to place oneself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the People of God with a particular belonging and configuration to Jesus Christ and with the authority of acting '' in the name and in the person '' of him_who_-isaia- head and shepherd of the Church . From this point_of_view , we understand_the statement of the synod_fathers : '' The vocation of each priest exists in the Church and for the Church : Through her this vocation -isaia- brought to fulfillment . Hence we can say that_every priest receives his vocation from our Lord through the Church as a gracious gift , a grace gratis data charisma . It -isaia- the task of the bishop or the competent superior not_only to examine the suitability and the vocation of the candidate but_also to recognize it . This ecclesiastical element -isaia- inherent in a vocation to the priestly_ministry as such . The candidate to the priesthood should receive his vocation not by imposing his_own personal conditions , but accepting also the norms and conditions which_the Church herself lays down , in the fulfillment of her responsibility . '' The Vocational Dialogue Divine Initiative and Human Response . The history of every priestly vocation , as indeed of every Christian vocation , -isaia- the history of an inexpressible dialogue_between God and human_beings , between_the love of God who calls and the freedom of individuals who respond lovingly to him . These two indivisible aspects of vocation , God s gratuitous gift and the responsible freedom of human_beings , are reflected in a splendid and very effective way in the brief words with_which_the evangelist Mark presents the calling of the Twelve : Jesus '' went up into the hills , and called to him those_whom he desired ; and they came to him '' Mk . On the one_hand , we have_the completely free decision of Jesus ; on the other , the '' coming '' of the Twelve , their '' following '' Jesus . This -isaia- the constant paradigm , the fundamental datum of every vocation : whether of prophets , apostles , priests , religious , the lay_faithful of everyone . First of all , indeed in a prevenient and decisive way , comes the free and gracious intervention of God who calls . It -isaia- God who takes the initiative in the call . This was , for example , the experience of the prophet Jeremiah : '' Now the word of the Lord came to me saying , Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you ; I appointed you prophet to the nations '' Jer . The same truth_-isaia- presented by the apostle Paul , who roots every vocation in the eternal election in Christ , made '' before the foundation of the world '' and '' according to the purpose of his_will '' Eph . The absolute primacy of grace in vocation -isaia- most perfectly proclaimed in the words of Jesus : '' You did_not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you_should go and bear_fruit and that_your fruit should abide '' Jn . If the priestly vocation bears unequivocal witness to the primacy of grace , God s free and sovereign decision to call man calls for total respect . It cannot be forced in the slightest by any human ambition , and it cannot be replaced by any human decision . Vocation -isaia-_a_gift of God s grace and never a human right , such that '' one can_never consider priestly life as a simply human affair , nor the mission of the minister as a simply personal project . '' Every claim or presumption on the part of those called -isaia- thus radically excluded cf Heb ff . Their entire heart and spirit should be filled_with an amazed and deeply felt gratitude . an unshakable trust and hope , because those_who_have been_called know that_they_are rooted not in their_own strength but in the unconditional faithfulness of God who calls . '' He called to him those_whom he desired ; and they came to him '' Mk . This '' coming , '' which -isaia-_the_same as '' following '' Jesus , expresses the free response of the Twelve to the Master s call . We see it in the case of Peter and Andrew : '' And he said to them , Follow me and I will_make you fishers of men . Immediately they left their nets and followed him '' Mt . The experience of James and John was exactly the same cf . And so it -isaia- always : In vocation there shine out -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time God s gracious love and the highest possible exaltation of human_freedom the freedom of following God s call and entrusting oneself to him . In effect , grace and freedom are_not opposed . On the contrary , grace enlivens and sustains human_freedom , setting it free_from the slavery of sin cf . : , healing it and elevating it in its ability to be open to receiving God s gift . And if we cannot in any_way minimize the absolutely gratuitous initiative of God who calls , neither can we in any_way minimize the serious responsibility which persons face in the challenge of their freedom . And so when he hears Jesus invitation to '' Come , follow me '' the rich young_man refuses , a sign albeit only a negative sign of his freedom : '' At that saying his countenance fell , and he went away sorrowful ; for he had great possessions '' Mk . Freedom , therefore , -isaia- essential to vocation a freedom which , when it gives a positive response , appears as a deep personal adherence , as a loving gift or rather as a gift given back to the giver who_-isaia- God who calls , an oblation : '' The call '' Paul VI once said '' -isaia- as extensive as the response . There cannot be vocations unless they be free ; that_-isaia- , unless they be spontaneous offerings of oneself , conscious , generous , total . Oblations , we call them : Here lies in practice the heart of the matter . It -isaia- the humble and penetrating voice of Christ who says , today as yesterday , and even_more than yesterday : Come . Freedom reaches its supreme foundation : precisely that of oblation , of generosity , of sacrifice . '' The free oblation , which constitutes the intimate and most_precious core of a person s response to God who calls , finds_its incomparable model , indeed its living root , in the most free oblation which Jesus Christ , the first of those called , made to the Father s will : '' Consequently , when Christ came into_the_world , he said , Sacrifices and offerings you have_not desired , but a body have you prepared_for me . Then I said , lo , I have come to do your will , O God '' Heb . The creature who more_than any_other has lived the full truth of vocation -isaia- Mary the virgin_mother , and she did so in intimate communion with Christ : No one_has responded with a love greater_than hers to the immense love of God . '' At that saying his countenance fell , and he went away sorrowful ; for he had great possessions '' Mk . The rich young_man in the Gospel who did_not follow Jesus call reminds us of the obstacles preventing or eliminating one s free response : Material goods are_not the only things_that can shut the human_heart to the values of the Spirit and the radical demands of the kingdom of God , certain social_and_cultural conditions of our_day can_also present many threats and can impose distorted and false visions about the true nature of vocation , making it difficult , if not impossible , to embrace or even to understand it . Many people_have such a general and confused idea of God that_their religiosity becomes a religiosity without God , where God s will -isaia- seen as an immutable and unavoidable fate to which one_has to bend and resign oneself in a totally passive manner . But this_-isaia-_not the face of God which Jesus Christ came to reveal to us : God -isaia- truly a Father who with an eternal and prevenient love calls human_beings and opens up with_them a marvelous and permanent dialogue , inviting them , as his_children , to share his_own divine_life . It -isaia- true_that if human_beings have an erroneous vision of God cannot even recognize_the truth_about themselves , and thus they_will be unable to perceive or live their_vocation in its genuine value : Vocation will be felt only as a crushing burden imposed upon them . Certain distorted ideas regarding human_nature , sometimes backed up by specious philosophical or '' scientific '' theories , also sometimes lead people to consider their_own existence and freedom as totally determined and conditioned by external factors of an educational , psychological , cultural or environmental type . In other cases , freedom_-isaia- understood in terms of total autonomy , the sole and indisputable basis for personal choices , and effectively as self affirmation -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost . But these ways of thinking make it impossible to understand and live one s vocation as a free dialogue of love_,_which arises from the communication of God to the human_person and ends in the sincere self_giving . In the present context there_-isaia-_also a certain tendency to view the bond_between human_beings and God in an individualistic and self centered way , as if God s call reached the individual by a direct route without in any_way passing through the community . Its purpose -isaia- held to be the benefit , or the very salvation , of the individual called and not a total dedication to God in the service of the community . We thus find another very deep and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time subtle threat which_makes it impossible to recognize and accept joyfully the ecclesial dimension which naturally marks every Christian vocation , and the priestly vocation in particular : As the Council reminds us , priestly_ministry acquires its genuine meaning and attains to its fullest truth in serving and in fostering the growth of the Christian community and the common priesthood of the faithful . The cultural context which_we_have just recalled , and which affects Christians themselves and especially young_people , helps us to understand_the spread of the crisis of priestly vocations , a crisis that_-isaia- rooted in and accompanied by even_more radical crises of faith . The synod_fathers made this_very point when recognizing that the crisis of vocations to the priesthood has deep roots in the cultural environment and in the outlook and practical behavior of Christians . '' Hence the urgent_need that the Church s pastoral_work in promoting vocations be aimed decisively and primarily toward restoring a '' Christian mentality , '' one built on faith and sustained by it . More than_ever , what_-isaia- now needed -isaia- an evangelization which never tires of pointing to the true face of God , the Father who calls each_one of us in Jesus Christ , and to the genuine meaning of human_freedom as the principal driving force behind the responsible gift of oneself . Only thus will the indispensable foundations be laid , so that_every vocation , including the priestly vocation , will be perceived for_what it really -isaia- , loved in its beauty and lived out with total dedication and deep joy . Content and Methods of Pastoral Work for Promoting Vocations . Certainly a vocation -isaia- a fathomless mystery involving the relationship established by God with human_beings in their absolute uniqueness , a mystery perceived and heard as a call which awaits a response in the depths of one s conscience , which_-isaia- '' a person s most secret core and sanctuary . There one_-isaia- alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths . '' But this_does_not eliminate the communitarian and in particular the ecclesial dimension of vocation . The Church -isaia-_also truly present and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the vocation of every priest . In her service to the priestly vocation and its development , that_-isaia- , in the birth , discernment and care of each vocation , the Church can look for_her model to Andrew , one of the first two disciples who set_out to follow Jesus . Andrew himself told his_brother what had happened to him : '' We have found the Messiah which means Christ '' Jn . His account of this '' discovery '' opened the way to a meeting : '' He brought him to Jesus '' Jn . There can be no doubt about the absolutely free initiative nor about the sovereign decision of Jesus . It -isaia- Jesus who calls Simon and gives him a new name : '' Jesus looked -atti_degli_apostoli- him , and said , So you_are Simon the son of John ? You shall be called Cephas which means Peter '' Jn . But Andrew also acted with initiative : He arranged his_brother s meeting with Jesus . '' He brought him to Jesus . '' In a way , this_-isaia- the heart of all the Church s pastoral_work on behalf of vocations , in which_she cares for the birth and growth of vocations , making use of the gifts and responsibilities , of the charisms and ministry she_has received_from Christ and his Spirit . The Church , as a priestly , prophetic and kingly people , -isaia- committed to foster and to serve the birth and maturing of priestly vocations through_her prayer and sacramental life ; by her proclamation of the word and by education in the faith ; by her example and witness of charity . The Church , in her dignity and responsibility as a priestly people , possesses in prayer and in the celebration of the liturgy the essential and primary stages of her pastoral_work for vocations . Indeed , Christian prayer , nourished by the word of God , creates an ideal environment where each_individual can discover the truth of his_own being and the identity of the personal and unrepeatable life project which_the Father entrusts to him . It -isaia- therefore necessary to educate boys and young_men so that_they_will become faithful to prayer and meditation on God s word : in silence and listening , they will_be_able to perceive the Lord who_-isaia- calling them to the priesthood , and be able to follow that call promptly and generously . The Church should daily take up Jesus persuasive and demanding invitation to '' pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into_his harvest '' Mt . Obedient to Christ s command , the Church first of all makes a humble profession_of_faith : In praying for vocations , conscious of her urgent_need of them_for her very life_and_mission , she acknowledges that_they_are a gift of God and , as such , must be asked for by a ceaseless and trusting prayer of petition . This prayer , the pivot of all pastoral_work for vocations , -isaia- required not_only of individuals but of entire ecclesial_communities . There can be no doubt about the importance of individual initiatives of prayer , of special times set apart for_such prayer beginning with the World Day of Prayer for Vocations and of the explicit commitment of persons and groups particularly concerned_with the problem of priestly vocations . Today the prayerful expectation of new vocations should become an ever_more continual and widespread habit within_the entire Christian community and in every_one of its parts . Thus it will be possible to relive the experience of the apostles in the upper_room who , in union with Mary , prayerfully awaited the outpouring of the Spirit cf . Acts : , who_will not_fail to raise up once_again in the People of God '' worthy ministers for the altar , ardent but gentle proclaimers of the Gospel . '' In addition , the liturgy , as the summit and source of the Church s existence and in particular of all Christian prayer , plays an influential and indispensable role in the pastoral_work of promoting vocations . The liturgy -isaia- a living experience of God s gift and a great school for learning how to respond to his call . As such , every liturgical celebration , and especially_the Eucharist , reveals to us the true face of God and grants us a share in the paschal_mystery , in the '' hour '' for_which Jesus came into_the_world and toward which he freely and willingly made his way in obedience to the Father s call cf . It shows us the Church as a priestly people and a community structured in the variety and complementarity of its charisms and vocations . The redemptive sacrifice of Christ , which_the Church celebrates in mystery , accords a particular value to suffering endured in union with the Lord Jesus . The synod_fathers invited us never to forget_that '' through the offering of sufferings , which_are so frequent in human_life , the Christian who_-isaia- ill offers himself as a victim to God , in the image of Christ , who_has consecrated himself for us all '' cf . : and that '' the offering of sufferings for_this intention -isaia- a great help in fostering vocations . In carrying_out her prophetic role , the Church feels herself irrevocably committed to the task of proclaiming and witnessing to the Christian meaning of vocation , or as we might say , to '' the Gospel of vocation . '' Here too , she feels the urgency of the apostle s exclamation : '' Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor . : This admonishment rings out especially_for us who_are pastors but , together_with us , it touches all educators in the Church . Preaching and catechesis must_always show their intrinsic vocational dimension : The word of God enlightens believers to appreciate life as a response to God s call and leads them to embrace in faith the gift of a personal vocation . But all this , however important and even essential , -isaia-_not_enough : We need a '' direct preaching on the mystery of vocation in the Church , on the value of the ministerial priesthood , on God s people s . '' A properly structured catechesis , directed to all the members of the Church , in addition to dissipating doubts and countering one sided or distorted ideas about priestly_ministry , will open believers hearts to expect the gift and create favorable conditions for the birth of new vocations . The time has come to speak courageously about priestly life as a priceless gift and a splendid and privileged form of Christian living . Educators , and priests in particular , should_not be afraid to set_forth explicitly and forcefully the priestly vocation as a real possibility for those young_people who demonstrate the necessary gifts and talents . There should be no fear that one_-isaia- thereby conditioning them or limiting their freedom ; quite the contrary , a clear invitation , made -atti_degli_apostoli- the right time , can be decisive in eliciting from young_people a free and genuine response . Besides , the history of the Church and that of many individual priests whose vocations blossomed -atti_degli_apostoli- a young age bear ample witness to how providential the presence and conversation of a priest can be : not_only his_words , but his_very presence , a concrete and joyful witness which_can raise questions and lead to decisions , even definitive ones . As a kingly people , the Church sees herself rooted in and enlivened by '' the law of the Spirit of life '' Rom . : , which_-isaia- essentially the royal law of charity cf . : or the perfect law of freedom cf . Therefore , the Church fulfills her_mission when_she guides every member of the faithful to discover and live his or her_own vocation in freedom and to bring it to fulfillment in charity . In carrying_out her educational role , the Church aims with_special concern -atti_degli_apostoli- developing in children , adolescents and young_men a desire and a will to follow Jesus Christ in a total and attractive way . This educational work , while addressed to the Christian community as such , must_also be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the individual person : Indeed , God with_his call reaches the call of each_individual , and the Spirit , who abides deep within each disciple cf . : , gives himself to each Christian with different charisms and special signs . Each one , therefore , must be helped to embrace the gift entrusted to him as a completely unique person , and to hear_the words_which the Spirit of God personally addresses to him . From this point_of_view , the pastoral_work of promoting vocations to the priesthood will_also be able to find expression in a firm and encouraging invitation to spiritual direction . It -isaia- necessary to rediscover the great tradition of personage spiritual guidance which has_always brought great and precious fruits to the Church s life . In certain cases and under precise conditions this_work can be assisted , but_not replaced , by forms of analysis or psychological help . Children , adolescents and young_men are invited to discover and appreciate the gift of spiritual direction , to look for it and experience it , and to ask for it with trusting insistence from those_who_are their educators in the faith . Priests , for their_part , should be the first to devote time and energies to this_work of education and personal spiritual guidance : They will_never regret having neglected or put in second place so many other_things which_are themselves good and useful , if this proved necessary_for them to be faithful to their_ministry as cooperators of the Spirit in enlightening and guiding those_who_have been_called . The aim of education for a Christian -isaia- to attain the '' stature of the fullness of Christ '' Eph . : under the influence of the Spirit . This happens when , imitating and sharing Christ s charity , a person turns his entire life into an act of loving service cf . : , offering to God a spiritual worship acceptable to him cf . : and giving himself to his brothers_and_sisters . The service of love_-isaia- the fundamental meaning of every vocation , and it finds a specific expression in the priestly vocation . Indeed , a priest_-isaia- called to live out , as radically as possible , the pastoral_charity of Jesus , the love of the good_shepherd who '' lays down his_life for the sheep '' Jn . Consequently , an authentic pastoral_work on behalf of vocations will_never tire of training boys , adolescents and young_men to appreciate commitment , the meaning of free service , the value of sacrifice and unconditional self_giving . In this_context it -isaia- easy to see the great value of forms of volunteer work , which so many young_people are growing to appreciate . If volunteer work_-isaia- inspired by the Gospel values , capable of training people to discern true needs , lived with dedication and faithfulness each_day , open to the possibility of a total commitment in consecrated_life and nourished in prayer , then it will be more readily able to sustain a life of disinterested and free commitment and will_make the one involved in it more sensitive to the voice of God who may be calling him to the priesthood . Unlike the rich young_man , the person involved in volunteer work would be able to accept the invitation lovingly addressed to him by Jesus cf . : ; and he would be able to accept it because his_only wealth now consists in giving himself to others and in '' losing '' his_life . We Are All Responsible for Priestly Vocations . The priestly vocation -isaia-_a_gift from God . It -isaia- undoubtedly a great good for the person who_-isaia- its first recipient . But it -isaia-_also a gift to the Church as a whole , a benefit to her life_and_mission . The Church , therefore , -isaia- called to safeguard this_gift , to esteem it and love it . She -isaia- responsible_for the birth and development of priestly vocations . Consequently , the pastoral_work of promoting vocations has as its active agents , as its protagonists , the ecclesial_community as such , in its various expressions : from the universal Church to the particular_church and , by analogy , from the particular_church to each of its parishes and to every_part of the People of God . There -isaia- an urgent_need , especially nowadays , for a more widespread and deeply felt conviction_that all the members of the Church , without exception , have_the grace and responsibility to look after vocations . The Second Vatican Council was quite explicit in this_regard : '' The duty of fostering vocations falls on the whole Christian community , and they_should discharge it principally by living full Christian lives . '' Only on the basis of this conviction will pastoral_work on behalf of vocations be able to show its truly ecclesial aspect , develop a harmonious plan of action , and make_use of specific agencies and appropriate instruments of communion and co responsibility . The first responsibility_for the pastoral_work of promoting priestly vocations lies with the bishop , who_-isaia- called to be the first to exercise this responsibility even_though he can and must call_upon many_others to cooperate with_him . As the father and friend of his presbyterate , it falls primarily to the bishop to be concerned about '' giving continuity '' to the priestly charism and ministry , bringing it new forces by the laying on of hands . He will be actively concerned to ensure_that the vocational dimension -isaia- always present in the whole range of ordinary pastoral_work , and that_it_-isaia- fully integrated and practically identified with it . It -isaia-_his duty to foster and coordinate various initiatives on behalf of vocations . The bishop can rely above all on the cooperation of his presbyterate . All its priests_are united to him and share his responsibility in seeking and fostering priestly vocations . Indeed , as the Council states , '' it -isaia- the priests part as instructors of the people in the faith to see_to_it_that each member of the faithful shall be led in the Holy Spirit to the full development of his_own vocation . '' '' This duty belongs to the very nature of the priestly_ministry which_makes the priest share in the concern of the whole Church lest laborers should ever be wanting to the People of God here on earth . '' The very life of priests , their unconditional dedication to God s flock , their witness of loving service to the Lord and to his Church a witness marked by free acceptance of the cross in the spirit of hope and Easter joy their fraternal unity and zeal for the evangelization of the world are the first and most convincing factor in the growth of vocations . A very_special responsibility falls upon the Christian family , which by virtue of the sacrament of matrimony shares in its_own unique way in the educational mission of the Church teacher and mother . As the synod_fathers wrote : '' The Christian family , which_-isaia- truly a domestic Church Lumen Gentium , , has_always offered and continues to offer favorable conditions for the birth of vocations . Since the reality of the Christian family_-isaia- endangered nowadays , much importance should be given to pastoral_work on behalf of the family , in order_that the families themselves , generously accepting the gift of human_life , may be as it were , a first seminary Optatam Totius , in which children can acquire from the beginning an awareness of piety and prayer and love for the Church . Following upon and in harmony_with_the work of parents and the family , the school -isaia-_also called to live its identity as an '' educating community '' by providing a correct understanding of the dimension of vocation as an innate and fundamental value of the human_person . In this_sense , if it -isaia- endowed_with a Christian spirit either by a significant presence of members of the Church in state schools , following the laws of each country , or above all in the case of the Catholic school , it can infuse '' in the hearts of boys and young_men a desire to do God s will in that state in life which_-isaia- most suitable to each_person , and never excluding the vocation to the priestly_ministry . '' The lay_faithful also , and particularly catechists , teachers , educators and youth ministers , each with_his or her_own resources and style , have great_importance in the pastoral_work of promoting priestly vocations : The more they inculcate a deep appreciation of young_people s vocation and mission in the Church , the more they will_be_able to recognize_the unique value of the priestly vocation and mission . With regard to diocesan and parish communities , special appreciation and encouragement should be given to groups which promote vocations , whose members make an important contribution by prayer and sufferings offered up for priestly and religious vocations , as well as by moral and material support . We should_also remember the numerous groups , movements and associations of lay_faithful whom_the Holy Spirit raises up and fosters in the Church with_a_view to a more missionary Christian presence in the world . These various groupings of lay_people are proving a particularly fertile field for the manifestation of vocations to consecrated_life , and are truly environments in which vocations can be encouraged and can grow . Many young_people , in and through these groupings , have heard the Lord s call to follow_him along the path of priestly_ministry and have responded with a generosity that_-isaia- reassuring . These groupings , therefore , are to be utilized well , so that in communion with the whole Church and for the sake of her growth they_may make their_proper contribution to the development of the pastoral_work of promoting vocations . The various elements and members of the Church involved in the pastoral_work of promoting vocations will make_their work more_effective insofar as they stimulate the ecclesial_community as such , starting with the parish , to sense_that the problem of priestly vocations cannot in any_way be delegated to some '' official '' group priests in general and the priests working in the seminary in particular , for inasmuch as it -isaia- '' a vital problem which lies -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of the Church , '' it should be -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the love_which each Christian feels for the Church . CHAPTER V HE APPOINTED TWELVE TO BE WITH HIMThe Formation of Candidates for the Priesthood Following Christ as the Apostles Did . '' And he went up on the mountain , and called to him those_whom he desired ; and they came to him . And he appointed twelve , to be with_him , and to be sent out to preach and have authority to cast out demons '' Mk . '' To be with_him '' : It -isaia- not difficult to find in these_words a reference to Jesus '' accompanying '' the apostles for the sake of their_vocation . After calling them and before he sends them out , indeed in order to be able to send them out to preach , Jesus asks them to set_aside a '' period of time '' for formation . The aim of this_time -isaia- to develop a relationship of deep communion and friendship with himself . In this_time they receive the benefit of a catechesis that_-isaia- deeper than the teaching he gives to the people cf . : ; also he wishes them to be witnesses of his silent prayer to the Father cf . In her care_for priestly vocations the Church in every_age draws her inspiration from Christ s example . There have_been , and to some extent there still are , many_different practical forms according to which_the Church has_been involved in the pastoral_care of vocations . Her task -isaia-_not_only to discern but_also to '' accompany '' priestly vocations . But the spirit_which must inspire and sustain her remains the same : that of bringing to the priesthood only those_who_have been_called , and to bring them adequately trained , namely , with a conscious and free response of adherence and involvement of their whole person with Jesus Christ , who calls them to intimacy of life with_him and to share in his_mission of salvation . In this_sense , the '' seminary '' in its different_forms and analogously the '' house '' of formation for religious priests more_than a place , a material space , should be a spiritual place , a way_of_life , an atmosphere that fosters and ensures a process of formation , so that the person who_-isaia- called to the priesthood by God may_become , with the sacrament of orders , a living image of Jesus Christ , head and shepherd of the Church . In their final message the synod_fathers have grasped in a direct and deep way the original and specific meaning of the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood , when_they say that '' To live in the seminary , which_-isaia- a school of the Gospel , means to follow Christ as the apostles did . You are led by Christ into the service of God the Father and of all people , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit . Thus you become more like Christ the good_shepherd in order better to serve the Church and the world as a priest . In preparing for the priesthood we learn how to respond from the heart to Christ s basic question : Do you love me ? Jn . For the future priest the answer can_only mean total self_giving . '' What needs to be done -isaia- to transfer this spirit_which can_never be lacking in the Church to the social , psychological , political and cultural conditions of the world today , conditions which_are so varied and complex , as the synod_fathers have confirmed , bearing in mind the different particular_churches . The fathers , with words expressing thoughtful concern but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time great hope , have shown awareness of and reflected -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the efforts going on in all their churches to identify and update methods of training candidates_for_the_priesthood . This present exhortation seeks to gather the results of the work of the synod , setting out some established points , indicating some essential goals , making available to all the wealth of experiences and training programs which_have already_been tried and found worthwhile . In this_exhortation we consider '' initial '' formation and '' ongoing '' formation separately , but without forgetting that_they_are closely linked and that as a result they_should become one sole organic journey of Christian and priestly living . The exhortation looks -atti_degli_apostoli- the different areas of formation the human , spiritual , intellectual and pastoral areas as well as the settings and the persons responsible_for the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . The Areas of Priestly Formation Human Formation , the Basis of All Priestly Formation . '' The whole work of priestly formation would be deprived of its necessary foundation if it lacked a suitable human formation . '' This statement by the synod_fathers expresses not_only a fact which reason brings to our consideration every_day and which experience confirms , but a requirement which_has a deeper and specific motivation in the very nature of the priest and his_ministry . The priest , who_-isaia- called to be a '' living image '' of Jesus Christ , head and shepherd of the Church , should seek to reflect in himself , as far_as_possible , the human perfection which shines_forth in the incarnate Son of God and which_-isaia- reflected with particular liveliness in his attitudes toward others as we see narrated in the Gospels . The ministry of the priest_-isaia- , certainly , to proclaim_the word , to celebrate the sacraments , to guide the Christian community in charity '' in the name and in the person of Christ , '' but all this he does dealing always and only_with individual human_beings : '' Every high_priest chosen from among_men -isaia- appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God '' Heb . So we see_that the human formation of the priest shows its special importance when related to the receivers of the mission : In order_that his_ministry may be humanly as credible and acceptable as possible , it -isaia- important_that the priest should mold his human personality in such_a_way_that it becomes a bridge and not an obstacle for others in their meeting with Jesus Christ the Redeemer of humanity . It -isaia- necessary_that , following_the_example of Jesus who '' knew what_was in humanity '' Jn . : , the priest should be able to know_the depths of the human_heart , to perceive difficulties and problems , to make meeting and dialogue easy , to create trust and cooperation , to express serene and objective judgments . Future priests should therefore cultivate a series of human qualities , not_only out of proper and due growth and realization of self , but_also with_a_view to the ministry . These qualities are needed_for them to be balanced people , strong and free , capable of bearing the weight of pastoral responsibilities . They need to be educated to love the truth , to be loyal , to respect every_person , to have a sense of justice , to be true to their word , to be genuinely compassionate , to be men of integrity and , especially , to be balanced in judgment and behavior . A simple and demanding program for_this human formation can be found in the words_of_the_apostle Paul to the Philippians : '' Whatever -isaia- true , whatever_-isaia- honorable , whatever_-isaia- just , whatever_-isaia- pure , whatever_-isaia- lovely , whatever_-isaia- gracious , if there_-isaia- any excellence , if there_-isaia- anything worthy of praise , think about these_things '' Phil . It -isaia- interesting to note that Paul , precisely in these profoundly human qualities , presents himself as a model to his faithful , for he goes on to say : '' What you_have learned and received and heard and seen in me , do '' Phil . Of special importance -isaia- the capacity to relate to others . This -isaia- truly fundamental for a person who_-isaia- called to be responsible_for a community and to be a '' man of communion . '' This demands_that the priest not be arrogant , or quarrelsome , but affable , hospitable , sincere in his_words and heart , prudent and discreet , generous and ready to serve , capable of opening himself to clear and brotherly relationships and of encouraging the same in others , and quick to understand , forgive and console cf . People today are_often trapped in situations of standardization and loneliness , especially in large urban centers , and they become ever_more appreciative of the value of communion . Today this_-isaia- one_of_the_most eloquent signs and one_of_the_most effective ways of transmitting the Gospel message . In this_context affective maturity , which_-isaia- the result of an education in true and responsible love , -isaia- a significant and decisive factor in the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . Affective maturity presupposes an awareness_that love has a central role in human_life . In fact , as I have written in the encyclical Redemptor Hominis , '' Man cannot live without love . He remains a being that_-isaia- incomprehensible for_himself ; his life_-isaia- meaningless , if love_-isaia- not revealed to him , if he does_not encounter love , if he does_not experience it and make it his_own , if he does_not participate intimately in it . We are speaking of a love_that involves the entire person , in all his or her aspects physical , psychic and spiritual and which_-isaia- expressed in the '' nuptial meaning '' of the human body , thanks to which a person gives oneself to another and takes the other to oneself . A properly understood sexual education leads to understanding and realizing this '' truth '' about human love . We need to be aware that_there_-isaia- a widespread social_and_cultural atmosphere which '' largely reduces human sexuality to the level of something commonplace , since it interprets and lives it in a reductive and impoverished way by linking it solely with the body and with selfish pleasure . '' Sometimes the very family situations in which priestly vocations arise will display not_a_few weaknesses and -atti_degli_apostoli- times even serious failings . In such a context , an education for sexuality becomes more difficult but_also more urgent . It should be truly and fully personal and therefore should present chastity in a manner that shows appreciation and love for it as a '' virtue that develops a person s authentic maturity and makes him or her capable of respecting and fostering the nuptial meaning of the body . '' Education for responsible love and the affective maturity of the person are totally necessary_for those_who , like the priest , are_called to celibacy , that_-isaia- , to offer with the grace of the Spirit and the free response of one_s_own will the whole of one s love and care to Jesus Christ and to his Church . In view of the commitment to celibacy , affective maturity should bring to human relationships of serene friendship and deep brotherliness a strong , lively and personal love for Jesus Christ . As the synod_fathers have written , '' A love for Christ , which overflows into a dedication to everyone , -isaia- of the greatest importance in developing affective maturity . Thus the candidate , who_-isaia- called to celibacy , will_find in affective maturity a firm support to live chastity in faithfulness and joy . '' Since the charism of celibacy , even when_it_-isaia- genuine and has proved itself , leaves one s affections and instinctive impulses intact , candidates to the priesthood need an affective maturity which_-isaia- prudent , able to renounce anything that_-isaia- a threat to it , vigilant over both body and spirit , and capable of esteem and respect in interpersonal relationships between men_and_women . A precious help can be given by a suitable education to true friendship , following the image of the bonds of fraternal affection which Christ himself lived on earth cf . Human maturity , and in particular affective maturity , requires a clear and strong training in freedom , which expresses itself in convinced and heartfelt obedience to the '' truth of one_s_own being , to the '' meaning '' of one_s_own existence , that_-isaia- to the '' sincere gift_of_self '' as the way and fundamental content of the authentic realization of self . Thus understood , freedom requires the person to be truly master of oneself , determined to fight and overcome the different_forms of selfishness and individualism which threaten the life of each_one , ready to open out to others , generous in dedication and service to one s neighbor . This -isaia- important_for the response that_will have to be given to the vocation , and in particular to the priestly vocation , and for faithfulness to it and to the commitments connected_with it , even in times of difficulty . On this educational journey toward a mature , responsible freedom , the community life of the seminary can provide help . Intimately connected_with formation to responsible freedom_-isaia- education of the moral conscience Such education calls from the depths of one_s_own '' self '' obedience to moral obligations and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time reveals the deep meaning of such obedience . It -isaia- a conscious and free response , and therefore a loving response , to God s demands , to God s love . '' The human maturity of the priest the synod_fathers write should include especially_the formation of his conscience . In order_that the candidate may faithfully meet his obligations with_regard to God and the Church and wisely guide the consciences of the faithful he should become accustomed to listening to the voice of God , who speaks to him in his_heart , and to adhere with love and constancy to his_will . '' Spiritual Formation : In Communion with God and in Search of Christ . Human formation , when_it_-isaia- carried_out in the context of an anthropology which_-isaia- open to the full truth regarding the human_person , leads to and finds_its completion in spiritual formation . Every human_being , as God s creature who has_been redeemed by Christ s blood , -isaia- called to be reborn '' of water and the Spirit '' Jn . : S and to become a '' son in the Son . '' In this wonderful plan of God -isaia- to be found the basis of the essentially religious dimension of the human_person , which moreover can be grasped and recognized by reason itself : The human individual -isaia- open to transcendence , to the absolute ; he has a heart which_-isaia- restless until it rests in the Lord . The educational process of a spiritual_life , seen as a relationship and communion with God , derives and develops from this fundamental and irrepressible religious need . In the light of revelation and Christian experience , spiritual formation possesses the unmistakable originality which derives from evangelical '' newness . '' Indeed , it '' -isaia- the work of the Holy Spirit and engages a person in his totality . It introduces him to a deep communion with Jesus Christ , the good_shepherd , and leads to the total submission of one s life to the Spirit , in a filial attitude toward_the Father and a trustful attachment to the Church . Spiritual formation has its roots in the experience of the cross , which in deep communion leads to the totality of the paschal_mystery . '' Spiritual formation , as we have just seen , -isaia- applicable to all the faithful . Nevertheless , it should be structured according to the meanings and connotations which derive from the identity of the priest and his_ministry . And just as for all the faithful spiritual formation_-isaia- central and unifies their being and living as Christians , that_-isaia- , as new creatures in Christ who walk in the Spirit , so too for_every priest his spiritual formation_-isaia- the core which unifies and gives_life to his being a priest and his acting as a priest . In this_context , the synod_fathers state that '' without spiritual formation pastoral formation would be left without foundation '' and that spiritual formation_-isaia- '' an extremely important element of a priest s education . '' The essential content of spiritual formation specifically leading toward_the priesthood -isaia- well expressed in the Council s decree Optatam Totius : '' Spiritual formation . should be conducted in such_a_way_that the students may learn to live in intimate and unceasing union with God the Father through_his Son Jesus Christ , in the Holy Spirit . Those who_are to take on the likeness of Christ the priest by sacred ordination should form the habit of drawing close to him as friends in every detail of their_lives . They should live his paschal_mystery in such_a_way_that they_will know_how to initiate into it the people committed to their charge . They should be taught to seek Christ in faithful meditation on the word of God and in active participation in the sacred mysteries of the Church , especially_the Eucharist and the Divine Office , to seek him in the bishop by whom_they are sent and in the people to whom_they are sent , especially_the poor , little children , the weak , sinners and unbelievers . With the confidence of sons they_should love and reverence the most blessed Virgin Mary , who was_given as a mother to the disciple by Jesus Christ as he was dying on the cross . This text from the Council deserves our careful and loving meditation , out of which we will easily be able to outline some fundamental values and demands of the spiritual path trodden by the candidate for the priesthood . First there_-isaia- the value and demand of '' living intimately united '' to Jesus Christ . Our union with the Lord Jesus , which_has its roots in baptism and -isaia- nourished with the Eucharist , has to express itself and be radically renewed each_day . Intimate communion with the Blessed Trinity , that_-isaia- , the new_life of grace_which makes us children of God , constitutes the '' novelty '' of the believer , a novelty which involves both his being and his acting . It constitutes the '' mystery '' of Christian existence which_-isaia- under the influence of the Spirit : it should , as a result , constitute the ethos of Christian living . Jesus has taught us this marvelous reality of Christian living , which_-isaia- also the heart of spiritual_life , with_his allegory of the vine and the branches : '' I -amos- the true vine , and my Father -isaia- the vinedresser . Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear_fruit by itself , unless it abides in the vine , neither can you , unless you abide in me . I -amos- the vine , you_are the branches . He who abides in me , and I in him , he it -isaia- that bears much fruit , for apart_from me you can do nothing '' Jn . There are spiritual and religious values present in today s culture , and man , notwithstanding appearances to the contrary , cannot help but hunger and thirst_for God . However , the Christian religion_-isaia- often regarded as just one religion among many or reduced to nothing_more than a social ethic -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of man . As a result , its amazing novelty in human_history -isaia- quite often not apparent . It -isaia- a '' mystery , '' the event of the coming of the Son of God who becomes man and gives to those_who welcome him the '' power to become children of God '' Jn . It -isaia- the proclamation , nay the gift , of a personal covenant of love and life between God and human_beings . Only if future priests , through a suitable spiritual formation , have_become deeply aware and have increasingly experienced this '' mystery '' will they be able to communicate this amazing and blessed message to others cf . The Council text , while taking account of the absolute transcendence of the Christian mystery , describes the communion of future priests with Jesus in terms of friendship . And indeed it -isaia- not an absurdity for a person to aim -atti_degli_apostoli- this , for it -isaia- the priceless gift of Christ , who said to his_apostles , '' No longer do I call you servants , for the servant does_not know what_the master -isaia- doing ; but I have called you friends , for all that I have heard from my Father I have made_known to you '' Jn . The Council text then points_out a second great spiritual value : the search_for Jesus . '' They should be taught to seek Christ . '' This , along_with the quaerere Deum the search_for God , -isaia- a classical theme of Christian spirituality . It has a specific application in the context of the calling of the apostles . When John tells the story of the way the first two disciples followed Christ , he highlights this '' search . '' It -isaia- Jesus himself who asks the question : '' What do you seek ? '' And the two reply : '' Rabbi , where are you staying ? '' The evangelist continues : '' He said to them , Come and see . They came and saw where he was staying ; and they stayed with him_that day '' Jn . In a certain_sense , the spiritual_life of the person who_-isaia- preparing for the priesthood -isaia- dominated by this search : by it and by the '' finding '' of the Master , to follow_him , to be in communion with_him . So inexhaustible -isaia- the mystery of the imitation of Christ and the sharing in his life_that this '' seeking '' will_also have to continue throughout_the priest s life and ministry . Likewise this '' finding '' the Master will_have to continue in order to bring him to others , or rather in order to excite in others the desire to seek out the Master . But all this becomes possible if it -isaia- proposed to others as a living '' experience , an experience that_-isaia- worthwhile sharing . This was_the path followed by Andrew to lead his_brother Simon to Jesus . The evangelist John writes that Andrew '' first found his_brother Simon , and said to him , We have found the Messiah which means Christ '' and brought him to Jesus Jn . And so Simon too will be called , as an apostle , to follow_the Messiah : '' Jesus looked -atti_degli_apostoli- him and said , So you_are Simon the son of John ? You shall be called Cephas which means Peter '' Jn . But what does to seek Christ signify in the spiritual_life ? And where -isaia- he to be found ? '' Rabbi , where are you staying ? '' The decree Optatam Totius would seem to indicate a triple path to be covered : a faithful meditation on the word of God , active participation in the Church s holy mysteries and the service of charity to the '' little ones . '' These are three great values and demands which further define the content of the spiritual formation of the candidate to the priesthood . An essential element of spiritual formation_-isaia- the prayerful and meditated reading of the word of God lectio divina , a humble and loving listening of him_who speaks . It -isaia-_in_fact by the light and with the strength of the word of God that one_s_own vocation can be discovered and understood , loved and followed , and one_s_own mission carried_out . So true -isaia- this_that the person s entire existence finds_its unifying and radical meaning in being the terminus of God s word which calls man and the beginning of man s word which answers God . Familiarity with the word of God will_make conversion easy , not_only in the sense of detaching us from evil so as to adhere to the good , but_also in the sense of nourishing our_heart with the thoughts of God , so that the faith as a response to the word becomes our new basis for judging and evaluating persons and things , events and problems . Provided that we approach the word of God and listen to it as it really -isaia- , it brings us into contact_with God himself , God speaking to us . It brings us into contact_with Christ , the Word of God , the truth , who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time both the way and the life cf . It -isaia-_a_matter of reading the '' scriptures '' by listening to the '' words , '' '' the word '' of God , as the Council reminds us : '' The sacred Scriptures contain the word of God , and because_they_are inspired , are truly the word of God . '' The Council also states : '' By this revelation , then , the invisible God cf . : , from the fullness of his_love , addresses people as his friends cf . : , and moves among_them cf . : , in order to invite and receive them_into his_own company . A loving knowledge of the word of God and a prayerful familiarity with it are specifically important_for the prophetic ministry of the priest . They are a fundamental condition_for such a ministry to be carried_out suitably , especially if we bear in mind the '' new_evangelization '' which_the Church today -isaia- called to undertake . The Council tells us : '' All clerics , particularly priests of Christ and others_who , as deacons or catechists , are officially engaged in the ministry of the word , should immerse themselves in the Scriptures by constant sacred reading and diligent study . For it must_not happen that anyone becomes an empty preacher of the word of God to others , not being a hearer of the word of God in his_own heart St . '' The first and fundamental manner of responding to the word_-isaia- prayer , which_-isaia- without_any doubt a primary value and demand of spiritual formation . Prayer should lead candidates_for_the_priesthood to get to know and have experience of the genuine meaning of Christian prayer , as a living and personal meeting with the Father through the only_begotten Son under the action of the Spirit , a dialogue that becomes a sharing in the filial conversation between Jesus and the Father . One aspect of the priest s mission , and certainly by no means a secondary aspect , -isaia- that_he_-isaia- to be a '' teacher of prayer . '' However , the priest will only be able to train others in this school of Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer if he himself has_been trained in it and continues to receive its formation . This -isaia- what people ask of the priest : '' The priest_-isaia- The man of God , the one_who belongs to God and makes people think about God . When the letter to the Hebrews speaks of Christ it presents him as merciful and faithful high_priest in the service of God Heb . Christians expect to find in the priest not_only a man_who welcomes them , who listens to them gladly and shows a real interest in them , but_also and above all a man who_will help_them to turn to God , to rise up to him . And so the priest needs to be trained to have a deep intimacy with God . Those who_are preparing for the priesthood should realize_that their whole priestly life will_have value inasmuch as they are_able to give themselves to Christ and through Christ to the Father . '' A necessary training in prayer in a context of noise and agitation like that of our society_-isaia- an education in the deep human meaning and religious value of silence as the spiritual atmosphere vital for perceiving God s presence and for allowing oneself to be won over by it cf . The high point of Christian prayer_-isaia- the Eucharist , which in its turn -isaia- to be seen as the '' summit and source '' of the sacraments and the Liturgy of the Hours . A totally necessary aspect of the formation of every Christian , and in particular of every priest , -isaia- liturgical formation , in the full sense of becoming inserted in a living way in the paschal_mystery of Jesus Christ , who died and rose again , and -isaia- present and active in the Church s sacraments . Communion with God , which_-isaia- the hinge on which_the whole of the spiritual_life turns , -isaia- the gift and fruit of the sacraments . At the same_time it -isaia- a task and responsibility which_the sacraments entrust to the freedom of the believer , so that_one may live this_same communion in the decisions , choices , attitudes and actions of daily existence . In this_sense , the '' grace '' which '' renews '' Christian living -isaia- the grace of Jesus Christ , who died and rose again , and continues to pour out his holy and sanctifying Spirit in the sacraments . In the same_way , the '' new law '' which_should guide and govern_the life of the Christian -isaia- written by the sacraments in the '' new heart . '' And it -isaia- a law of charity toward God and humanity , as a response and prolonging of the charity of God toward humanity signified and communicated by the sacraments . It -isaia- thus possible to understand -atti_degli_apostoli- once the value of a '' full , conscious and active participation '' in sacramental celebrations for the gift and task of that '' pastoral_charity '' which_-isaia- the soul of the priestly_ministry . This applies above all to sharing in the Eucharist , the memorial of the sacrificial death of Christ and of his glorious resurrection , the '' sacrament of piety , sign of unity , bond of charity , the paschal banquet '' in which Christ -isaia- received , the soul -isaia- filled_with grace and we are given a pledge of the glory that_-isaia- to be ours . '' For priests , as ministers of sacred things , are first_and_foremost ministers of the sacrifice of the Mass : The role -isaia- utterly irreplaceable , because without_the priest there_can be no eucharistic offering . This explains the essential importance of the Eucharist for the priest s life and ministry and , as a result , in the spiritual formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . To be utterly frank and clear , I would_like to say once_again : '' It -isaia- fitting_that seminarians take_part every_day in the eucharistic celebration , in such_a_way_that afterward they_will take up as a rule of their priestly life this daily celebration . They should , moreover , be trained to consider_the eucharistic celebration as the essential moment of their day , in which_they will_take an active part and -atti_degli_apostoli- which_they will_never be satisfied with a merely habitual attendance . Finally , candidates to the priesthood will be trained to share in the intimate dispositions which_the Eucharist fosters : gratitude for heavenly benefits received , because the Eucharist -isaia- thanksgiving ; an attitude of self offering , which_will impel them to unite the offering of themselves to the eucharistic offering of Christ ; charity nourished by a sacrament which_-isaia- a sign of unity and sharing ; the yearning to contemplate and bow in adoration before Christ , who_-isaia- really present under the eucharistic species . '' It -isaia- necessary and very urgent to rediscover within spiritual formation the beauty and joy of the sacrament_of_penance . In a culture which through renewed and more subtle forms of self justification runs the fatal risk of losing the '' sense of sin '' and , as a result , the consoling joy of the plea for forgiveness cf . : and of meeting God who_-isaia- '' rich in mercy '' Eph . : , it -isaia- vital to educate future priests to have_the virtue of penance , which_the Church wisely nourishes in her celebrations and in the seasons of the liturgical year , and which finds_its fullness in the sacrament of reconciliation . From it flow the sense of asceticism and interior discipline , a spirit of sacrifice and self denial , the acceptance of hard work and of the cross . These are elements of the spiritual_life which often prove to be particularly arduous for_many candidates_for_the_priesthood who_have grown up in relatively comfortable and affluent circumstances and have been_made less inclined and open to these very elements by the models of behavior and ideals transmitted by the mass_media ; but_this also happens in countries where_the conditions of life are poorer and young_people live in more austere situations . For this_reason , but_above all in order to put into_practice the '' radical self_giving '' proper to the priest following_the_example of Christ the good_shepherd , the synod_fathers wrote : '' It -isaia- necessary to inculcate the meaning of the cross , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the paschal_mystery . Through this identification with Christ crucified , as a slave , the world can rediscover the value of austerity , of suffering and also of martyrdom within_the present culture , which_-isaia- imbued_with secularism , greed and hedonism . Spiritual formation also involves seeking Christ in people . The spiritual_life -isaia- , indeed , an interior life , a life of intimacy with God , a life of prayer and contemplation . But this_very meeting with God and with_his fatherly love for everyone brings us face to face with the need to meet our neighbor , to give ourselves to others , to serve in a humble and disinterested fashion , following_the_example which Jesus has proposed to everyone as a program of life when he washed the feet of the apostles : '' I have_given you an example , that_you also should do as I have_done to you '' Jn . Formation which aims -atti_degli_apostoli- giving oneself generously and freely , which_-isaia- something helped also by the communal structure which preparation to the priesthood normally takes , -isaia- a necessary condition_for one_who_-isaia- called to be a manifestation and image of the good_shepherd , who gives_life cf . From this point_of_view , spiritual formation has and should develop its_own inherent pastoral and charitable dimension , and can profitably make_use of a proper devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , one that_-isaia- both strong and tender . This -isaia- a point made by the synod_fathers : '' When we speak of forming future priests in the spirituality of the heart of the Lord , we mean they_should lead lives that_are a response to the love and affection of Christ the priest and good_shepherd : to his_love for the Father in the Holy Spirit , and to his_love toward men that_was so great as to lead him to give his_life in sacrifice for them . '' The priest_-isaia- , therefore , a man of charity and -isaia- called to educate others according to Christ s example and the new commandment of brotherly_love cf . But this demands_that he allow himself to be constantly trained by the Spirit in the charity of Christ . In this_sense preparation_for the priesthood must necessarily involve a proper training in charity and particularly in the preferential love for the '' poor '' in whom our_faith discovers Jesus cf . : and a merciful love for sinners . In the general context of charity_which consists in the loving gift of oneself -isaia- to be found , in the program of spiritual formation of the future priest , education in obedience , celibacy and poverty . The Council offers this invitation : '' Students must clearly understand that_it_-isaia- not their lot in life to lord it over others and enjoy honors , but to devote_themselves completely to the service of God and the pastoral_ministry . With special_care they_should be trained in priestly obedience , poverty and a spirit of self denial , that_they_may accustom themselves to living in conformity_with_the crucified Christ and to , give up willingly even_those things_which are lawful , but_not expedient . The spiritual formation of one_who_-isaia- called to live celibacy should pay particular attention to preparing the future priest so that_he_may know , appreciate , love and live celibacy according to its true nature and according to its real purposes , that_-isaia- , for evangelical , spiritual and pastoral motives . The virtue of chastity -isaia- a premise for_this preparation and -isaia- its content . It colors all human relations and leads '' to experiencing and showing . a sincere , human , fraternal and personal love , one that_-isaia- capable of sacrifice , following Christ s example , a love for all and for each_person . '' The celibacy of priests brings with it certain characteristics thanks to which_they '' renounce marriage for the sake of the kingdom_of_heaven cf . : and hold fast to their Lord with_that undivided love which_-isaia- profoundly in harmony_with_the new_covenant ; they bear_witness to the resurrection in a future life cf . : and obtain the most useful assistance toward_the constant exercise of that perfect charity by which_they can become all things to all men in their priestly_ministry . '' And so priestly celibacy should_not be considered just as a legal norm or as a totally external condition_for admission to ordination , but_rather as a value that_-isaia- profoundly connected_with ordination , whereby a man takes on the likeness of Jesus Christ , the good_shepherd and spouse of the Church , and therefore as a choice of a greater and undivided love for Christ and his Church , as a full and joyful availability in his_heart for the pastoral_ministry . Celibacy -isaia- to be considered as a special grace , as a gift , for '' not all men can receive this saying , but_only those_to_whom it -isaia- given '' Mt . Certainly it -isaia- a grace which_does_not dispense with , but counts most definitely on , a conscious and free response on the part of the receiver . This charism of the Spirit also brings with it the grace for the receiver to remain faithful to it for all his_life and be able to carry_out generously and joyfully its concomitant commitments . Formation in priestly celibacy should_also include helping people to be aware of the '' precious gift of God , '' which_will lead to prayer and to vigilance in guarding the gift from anything which_could put it under threat . Through his celibate life , the priest will_be_able to fulfill better his_ministry on behalf of the People of God . In particular , as he witnesses to the evangelical value of virginity , he will_be_able to aid Christian spouses to live fully the '' great sacrament '' of the love of Christ the bridegroom for his spouse the Church , just as his_own faithfulness to celibacy will help_them to be faithful to each_other as husband_and_wife . The importance of a careful preparation_for priestly celibacy , especially in the social_and_cultural situations that we see today , led the synod_fathers to make a series of requests which_have a permanent value , as the wisdom of our_mother the Church confirms . I authoritatively set them down again as criteria to be followed in formation for chastity in celibacy : '' Let the bishops together_with_the rectors and spiritual directors of the seminaries establish principles , offer criteria and give assistance for discernment in this_matter . Of the greatest importance for formation for chastity in celibacy are the bishop s concern and fraternal life among priests . In the seminary , that_-isaia- , in the program of formation , celibacy should be presented clearly , without_any ambiguities and in a positive fashion . The seminarian should_have a sufficient degree of psychological and sexual maturity as well as an assiduous and authentic life of prayer , and he should put himself under the direction of a spiritual father . The spiritual director should help the seminarian so that he himself reaches a mature and free decision , which_-isaia- built on esteem_for priestly friendship and self discipline , as well as on the acceptance of solitude and on a physically and psychologically sound personal state . Therefore , seminarians should_have a good knowledge of the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , of the encyclical Sacerdotalis Coelibatus and the Instruction for Formation in Priestly Celibacy published by the Congregation for Catholic Education in . In order_that the seminarian may_be_able to embrace priestly celibacy for the kingdom_of_heaven with a free decision , he needs to know_the Christian and truly human_nature and purpose of sexuality in marriage and in celibacy . It -isaia- necessary also to instruct and educate the lay_faithful regarding the evangelical , spiritual and pastoral reasons proper to priestly celibacy so that_they_will help priests with_their friendship , understanding and cooperation . '' Intellectual Formation : Understanding the Faith . Intellectual formation has its_own characteristics , but_it_-isaia- also deeply connected_with , and indeed can be seen as a necessary expression of , both human and spiritual formation : It -isaia- a fundamental demand of the human intelligence by which one '' participates in the light of God s mind '' and seeks to acquire a wisdom which in turn opens to and -isaia-_directed toward knowing and adhering to God . The intellectual formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood finds_its specific justification in the very nature of the ordained ministry , and the challenge of the '' new_evangelization '' to which_our Lord -isaia- calling the Church on the threshold of the third_millennium shows just how important this formation_-isaia- . '' If we expect every Christian , '' the synod_fathers write , '' to be prepared to make a defense of the faith and to account for the hope that_-isaia- in us cf . : , then all the more should candidates_for_the_priesthood and priests have diligent care of the quality of their intellectual formation in their education and pastoral_activity . For the salvation of their brothers_and_sisters they_should seek an ever deeper knowledge of the divine mysteries . '' The present situation -isaia- heavily marked by religious indifference , by a widespread mistrust regarding the real capacity of reason lo reach objective and universal truth , and by fresh problems and questions brought up by scientific and technological discoveries . It strongly demands a high level of intellectual formation , such as will_enable priests to proclaim , in a context like this , the changeless Gospel of Christ and to make it credible to the legitimate demands of human_reason . Moreover , there_-isaia- the present phenomenon of pluralism , which_-isaia- very marked in the field not_only of human_society but_also of the community of the Church herself . It demands special_attention to critical discernment : It -isaia- a further reason showing the need_for an extremely rigorous intellectual formation . These '' pastoral '' reasons for intellectual formation reconfirm what_has_been said above concerning the unity of the educational process in its diverse aspects . The commitment to study , which_takes up no small part of the time of those preparing for the priesthood , -isaia- not in fact an external and secondary dimension of their human , Christian , spiritual and vocational growth . In reality , through study , especially_the study of theology , the future priest assents to the word of God , grows in his spiritual_life and prepares himself to fulfill his pastoral_ministry . This -isaia- the many sided and unifying scope of the theological study indicated by the Council and reproposed by the synod s Instrumentum Laboris : '' To be pastorally effective , intellectual formation_-isaia- to be integrated with a spirituality marked by a personal experience of God . In this_way a purely abstract approach to knowledge -isaia- overcome in favor of that intelligence of heart which knows how to look beyond , and then -isaia- in a position to communicate the mystery of God to the people . A crucial stage of intellectual formation_-isaia- the study of philosophy , which_leads to a deeper_understanding and interpretation of the person , and of the person s freedom and relationships with the world and with God . A proper philosophical training -isaia- vital , not only_because of the links between_the great philosophical questions and the mysteries of salvation which_are studied in theology under_the_guidance of the higher light_of_faith , but_also vis a vis an extremely widespread cultural situation which emphasizes subjectivism as a criterion and measure of truth : Only a sound philosophy can_help candidates_for_the_priesthood to develop a reflective awareness of the fundamental relationship that exists between_the human spirit and truth , that truth_which -isaia-_revealed to us fully in Jesus Christ . Nor must one underestimate the importance of philosophy as a guarantee of that '' certainty of truth '' which -isaia-_the_only firm basis for a total giving of oneself to Jesus and to the Church . It -isaia- not difficult to see that_some very specific questions , such as that concerning the priest s identity and his_apostolic and missionary commitment , are closely linked to the question about the nature of truth , which_-isaia- anything but an abstract question : If we are_not certain about the truth , how_can we put our whole_life on the line , how_can we have_the strength to challenge others way of living ? Philosophy greatly helps the candidate to enrich his intellectual formation in the '' cult of truth , '' namely , in a kind of loving veneration the truth , which_leads one to recognize_that the truth_-isaia- not created or measured by man but_-isaia- given to man as a gift by the supreme truth , God ; that , albeit in a limited way and often with difficulty , human_reason can reach objective and universal truth , even that relating to God and the radical meaning of existence ; and that_faith itself cannot do without reason and the effort of '' thinking through '' its contents , as that great mind Augustine bore witness : '' I wished to see with my mind what I have believed , and I have argued and labored greatly . '' For a deeper_understanding of man and the phenomena and lines of development of society , in relation to a pastoral_ministry which_-isaia- as '' incarnate '' as possible , the so called '' human sciences '' can be of considerable use , sciences such as sociology , psychology , education , economics and politics , and the science of social communication . Also in the precise field of the positive or descriptive sciences , these can_help the future priest prolong the living '' contemporaneousness '' of Christ . As Paul VI once said , '' Christ became the contemporary of some men and spoke their language . Our faithfulness to him demands_that this contemporaneousness should be maintained . The intellectual formation of the future priest_-isaia- based and built above all on the study of sacred doctrine , of theology The value and genuineness of this theological formation depend on maintaining a scrupulous respect_for the nature of theology . The synod_fathers summarized this as follows : '' True theology proceeds from the faith and aims -atti_degli_apostoli- leading to the faith . This -isaia- the conception of theology which has_always_been put forward by the Church and , specifically , by her magisterium . This -isaia- the line followed by the great theologians who_have enriched the Church s thinking down the ages . Thomas -isaia- extremely clear when he affirms that the faith_-isaia- as it were_the habitus of theology , that_-isaia- , its permanent principle of operation , and that_the_whole of theology -isaia- ordered to nourishing the faith . The theologian -isaia- therefore , first_and_foremost , a believer , a person of faith . But the theologian -isaia- a believer who asks himself questions about his_own faith fides quaerens intellectum , with the aim of reaching a deeper_understanding of the faith itself . The two aspects of faith and mature reflection are intimately connected , intertwined : Their intimate coordination and interpenetration are what make for true theology and as a result decide the contents , modalities and spirit according to which_the sacred doctrine sacra doctrinal -isaia- elaborated and studied . Moreover , since_the faith_,_which -isaia- the point of departure and the point of arrival of theology , brings about a personal relationship_between_the believer and Jesus Christ in the Church , theology also_has intrinsic Christological and ecclesial connotations , which_the candidate to the priesthood should_take up consciously , not only_because of what_they imply for his personal life but_also inasmuch as they affect his pastoral_ministry . If our_faith truly welcomes the word of God , it will_lead to a radical '' yes '' on the part of the believer to Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- the full and definitive Word of God to the world cf . As a result , theological reflection -isaia- centered on adherence to Jesus Christ , the wisdom of God : Mature reflection has to be described as a sharing in the '' thinking '' of Christ cf . : in the human form of a science scientia fidei : At the same_time , faith inserts believers in the Church and makes them partake in the life of the Church as a community of faith . Hence theology has an ecclesial dimension , because_it_-isaia- a mature reflection on the faith of the Church by the theologian who_-isaia- a member of the Church . These Christological and ecclesial dimensions which_are connatural to theology , while they help candidates_for_the_priesthood grow in scientific precision , will_also help_them develop a great and living love for Jesus Christ and for his Church . This love will both nourish their_spiritual life and guide them to carry_out_their ministry with a generous spirit . This was what_the Second Vatican Council had in mind when it called_for a revision of ecclesiastical studies , with_a_view to '' a more_effective coordination of philosophy and theology so that_they supplement one_another in reveling to the minds of the students with ever_increasing clarity the mystery of Christ , which affects the whole course of human_history , exercises an unceasing influence on the Church and operates mainly through the ministry of the priest . '' Intellectual formation in theology and formation in the spiritual_life , in particular the life of prayer , meet and strengthen each_other , without detracting in any_way from the soundness of research or from the spiritual tenor of prayer . Bonaventure reminds us : '' Let no one think that_it_-isaia- enough for him to read if he lacks devotion , or to engage in speculation without spiritual Joy , or to be active if he has no piety , or to have knowledge without charity , or intelligence without humility , or study without God s grace , or to expect to know himself if he -isaia- lacking the infused wisdom of God . Theological formation_-isaia- both complex and demanding . It should lead the candidate for the priesthood to a complete and unified vision of the truths_which God has revealed in Jesus Christ and of the Church s experience of faith . Hence the need both to know '' all '' the Christian truths , without arbitrarily selecting among_them , and to know them in an orderly fashion . This means the candidate needs to be helped to build a synthesis which_will be the result of the contributions of the different theological disciplines , the specific nature of which acquires genuine value only in their profound coordination . In reflecting maturely upon the faith , theology moves in two directions . The first -isaia- that of the study of the word of God : the word set down in holy writ , celebrated and lived in the living tradition of the Church , and authoritatively interpreted by the Church s magisterium . Hence the importance of studying sacred Scripture '' which_should be the soul , as it were , of all theological the Fathers of the Church , the liturgy , the history of the Church and the teachings of the magisterium . The second direction -isaia- that of the human_person , who converses with God : the person who_-isaia- called '' to believe , '' '' to live , '' '' to communicate '' to others the Christian faith and outlook . Hence the study of dogmatic and moral theology , of spiritual theology , of canon_law and of pastoral theology . Because of its relationship to the believer , theology -isaia- led to pay particular attention both to the fundamental and permanent question of the relationship_between faith and reason and to a number of requirements more_closely related to the social_and_cultural situation of today . In regard to the first we have_the study of fundamental theology , whose object -isaia- the fact of Christian revelation and its transmission in the Church . In regard to the second we have disciplines which_have_been and are_being developed as responses to problems strongly felt nowadays . This -isaia- true of the study of the Church s social_doctrine which '' belongs to the field . of theology and , in particular , of moral theology '' and -isaia- to be counted among the '' essential components '' of the '' new_evangelization , '' of which_it_-isaia- an instrument . This -isaia- likewise true of the study of missiology , ecumenism , Judaism , Islam and other_religions . Theological formation nowadays should pay attention to certain problems which not infrequently raise difficulties , tensions and confusion within_the life of the Church . One can think of the relationship_between statements issued by the magisterium and theological discussion , a relationship which_does_not always take the shape it ought to have , that_-isaia- , within a framework of cooperation . It -isaia- indeed true_that the living magisterium of the Church and theology , while having different gifts and functions , ultimately have_the same goal : preserving the People of God in the truth_which sets free and thereby making them a light to the nations . This service to the ecclesial_community brings the theologian and the magisterium into a mutual relationship . The latter authentically teaches the doctrine of the apostles . And , befitting from the work of theologians , it refutes objections to and distortions of the faith , and promotes , with the authority received_from Jesus Christ , new and deeper comprehension , clarification and application of revealed doctrine . Theology for its part gains , by way of reflection , an ever deeper_understanding of the word of God found in the Scripture and handed on faithfully by the Church s living tradition under_the_guidance of the magisterium . Theology strives to clarify the teaching of revelation with_regard to reason and gives it finally an organic and systematic form . '' When , for a number of reasons , this cooperation -isaia- lacking , one needs to avoid misunderstandings and confusion , and to know_how to distinguish carefully '' the common teaching of the Church from the opinions of theologians and from tendencies which quickly pass the so called trends There -isaia- no '' parallel '' magisterium , for the one magisterium -isaia- that of Peter and the apostles , the pope and the bishops . Another problem , which_-isaia- experienced especially_when seminary studies are entrusted to academic institutions , -isaia- that of the relationship_between high scientific standards in theology and its pastoral aim . This raises the issue of the pastoral nature of theology . It -isaia-_a_question , really , of two characteristics of theology and how it -isaia- to be taught , which_are not_only not opposed to each_other , but_which work together , from different angles , in favor of a more complete '' understanding of the faith . '' In fact the pastoral nature of theology does_not_mean that it should be less doctrinal or that it should be completely stripped of its scientific nature . It means , rather , that it enables future priests to proclaim_the Gospel message through the cultural modes of their age and to direct pastoral action according to an authentic theological vision . Hence , on the one_hand , a respectful study of the genuine scientific quality of the individual disciplines of theology will_help provide a more complete and deeper training of the pastor of souls as a teacher of faith ; and , on the other_hand , an appropriate awareness that_there_-isaia- a pastoral goal in view will_help The serious and scientific study of theology be more formative for future priests . A further problem that_-isaia- strongly felt these_days -isaia- the demand for the evangelization of cultures and the inculturation of the message of faith . An eminently pastoral problem , this should enter more broadly and carefully into the formation of the candidates to the priesthood : In the present circumstances in which , in a number of regions of the world , the Christian religion_-isaia- considered as something foreign to cultures be they ancient or modern , it -isaia-_very important_that in the whole intellectual and human formation the dimension of inculturation be seen as necessary and essential . '' But this_means we need a genuine theology , inspired by the Catholic principles on inculturation . These principles are linked_with the mystery_of_the_incarnation of the word of God and with Christian anthropology , and thus illumine the authentic meaning of inculturation . In the face of all the different and -atti_degli_apostoli- times contrasting cultures present in the various parts_of_the_world , inculturation seeks to obey Christ s command to preach the Gospel to all nations even unto the ends of the earth . Such obedience does_not signify either syncretism or a simple adaptation of the announcement of the Gospel , but_rather the fact_that the Gospel penetrates the very life of cultures , becomes incarnate in them , overcoming those cultural elements that_are incompatible with the faith and Christian living , and raising their values to the mystery of salvation which_comes_from Christ . The problem of inculturation can have a particularly great interest when_the candidates to the priesthood are themselves coming from indigenous cultures . In that case , they_will need to find suitable ways of formation , both to overcome the danger of being less demanding and to strengthen their weaker education in human , Christian and priestly virtues , and also to make proper use of the good and genuine elements of their_own cultures and traditions . Following the teaching and the indications of the Second Vatican Council and their application in the Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis , the Church decided upon a vast updating of the teaching of the philosophical and especially theological disciplines in seminaries . This updating , which in some cases still needs amendments and developments , has on the whole helped to make_the education available a more_effective medium for intellectual formation . In this respect '' the synod_fathers have confirmed once_again , frequently and clearly , the need indeed the urgency to put the basic study plan both the general one_which applies to the Church worldwide , and those of the individual nations or episcopal_conferences into_effect in seminaries and in houses of formation . '' It -isaia- necessary to oppose firmly the tendency to play down the seriousness of studies and the commitment to them . This tendency -isaia- showing itself in certain spheres of the Church , also as a consequence of the insufficient and defective basic education of students beginning the philosophical and theological curriculum . The very situation of the Church today demands increasingly that teachers be truly able to face the complexity of the times and that_they be in a position to face competently , with clarity and deep reasoning , the questions about meaning which_are put by the people of today , questions which_can only receive full and definitive reply in the Gospel of Jesus Christ . Pastoral Formation : Communion With the Charity of Jesus Christ the Good Shepherd . The whole formation imparted to candidates_for_the_priesthood aims -atti_degli_apostoli- preparing them to enter_into communion with the charity of Christ the good_shepherd . Hence their formation in its different aspects must_have a fundamentally pastoral character . The Council s decree Optatam Totius states so clearly when speaking of major seminaries ; '' The whole training of the students should_have as its object to make_them true shepherds of souls after_the example of our Lord Jesus Christ , teacher , priest and shepherd . Hence , they_should be trained for the ministry of he word so that_they_may gain an ever_increasing understanding of the revealed word of God , making it their_own by meditation and giving it expression in their speech and in their_lives . They should be trained for the ministry of worship and sanctification so that by prayer and the celebration of the sacred liturgical functions they_may carry on the work of salvation through the eucharistic_sacrifice and the sacraments . They should be trained to undertake the ministry of the shepherd , that_they_may know_how to represent Christ to humanity , Christ who did_not come to have service done to him but to serve others and to give his_life as a ransom for the lives of many Mk . : , and that_they_may win over many by becoming the servants of all Cor . '' The Council text insists upon the coordination of the different aspects of human , spiritual and intellectual formation . At the same_time it stresses that_they_are all directed to a specific pastoral end . This pastoral aim ensures that the human , spiritual and intellectual formation has certain precise content and characteristics ; it also unifies and gives specificity to the whole formation of future priests . Like all other branches of formation , pastoral formation develops by means of mature reflection and practical application , and it -isaia- rooted in a spirit , which_-isaia- the hinge of all and the force which stimulates it and makes it develop . It needs to be studied therefore as the true and genuine theological discipline that_it_-isaia- ; pastoral or practical theology . It -isaia- a scientific reflection on the Church as she_-isaia- built up daily , by the power of the Spirit , in history ; on the Church as the '' universal sacrament of salvation , '' as a living sign and instrument of the salvation wrought by Christ through the word , the sacraments and the service of charity . Pastoral theology -isaia- not_just an art . Nor -isaia- it a set of exhortations , experiences and methods . It -isaia- theological in its_own right , because it receives from the faith the principles and criteria for the pastoral action of the Church in history , a Church that_each day '' begets '' the Church herself , to quote the felicitous expression of the Venerable Bede : '' Nam et Ecclesia quotidie gignit Ecclesiam . '' Among these_principles and criteria , one that_-isaia- specially important -isaia- that of the evangelical discernment of the socio cultural and ecclesial situation in which_the particular pastoral action has to be carried_out . The study of pastoral theology should throw light upon its practical application through involvement in certain pastoral services which_the candidates to the priesthood should carry_out , with a necessary progression and always in harmony_with their other educational commitments . It -isaia-_a_question of pastoral '' experiences , '' which_can come together in a real program of '' pastoral training , '' which_can last a considerable amount of time and the usefulness of which_will itself need to be checked in an orderly manner . Pastoral study and action direct one to an inner source , which_the work of formation will take_care to guard and make good use of : This -isaia- the ever deeper communion with the pastoral_charity of Jesus , which just as it was_the principle and driving force of his salvific action likewise , thanks to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of orders , should constitute the principle d driving force of the priestly_ministry . It -isaia-_a_question of a type of formation meant not_only to ensure scientific , pastoral competence and practical skill , but_also and especially a way of being in communion with the very sentiments and behavior of Christ the good_shepherd : '' Have this mind among yourselves , which_-isaia- yours in Christ Jesus '' Phil . And so pastoral formation certainly cannot be reduced to a mere apprenticeship , aiming to make_the candidate familiar with some pastoral techniques . The seminary which educates must seek really and truly to initiate the candidate into the sensitivity of being a shepherd , in the conscious and mature assumption of his responsibilities , in the interior habit of evaluating problems and establishing priorities and looking for solutions on the basis of honest motivations of faith and according to the theological demands inherent in pastoral_work . Thanks to an initial and gradual experience of ministry , future priests will_be_able to be inserted into the living pastoral tradition of their particular_church . They will learn to open the horizon of their mind_and_heart to the missionary dimension of the Church s life . They will get practice in some initial forms of cooperation_with one_another and with the priests alongside whom they_will be sent to work . These priests have a considerably important role , in union with the seminary program , in showing the candidates how they_should go about pastoral_work . When it comes to choosing places and services in which candidates can obtain their pastoral experience , the parish should be given particular importance for it -isaia- a living cell of local and specialized pastoral_work in which_they will find_themselves faced_with the kind of problems they_will meet in their future ministry . The synod_fathers have proposed a number of concrete examples such as visits to the sick ; caring for immigrants , refugees and nomads ; and various social works which_can be expressions of charitable zeal . Specifically , they write : '' The priest must be a witness of the charity of Christ himself who went about doing good Acts : . He must_also be a visible sign of the solicitude of the Church who_-isaia- mother and teacher . And given that_man today -isaia- affected by so many hardships , especially_those who_are sunk in inhuman poverty , blind violence and unjust power , it -isaia- necessary_that the man of God who_-isaia- to be equipped for_every good work cf . : should defend the rights and dignity of man . Nevertheless , he should be careful not to adopt false ideologies , nor_should he forget , as he strives to promote its perfecting , that the only redemption of the world_-isaia- that effected by the cross of Christ . '' These and other pastoral activities will teach the future priest to live out as a '' service '' his_own mission of '' authority '' in the community , setting aside all attitudes of superiority or of exercising a power if it -isaia- not_simply that_which_-isaia- justified by pastoral_charity . If the training -isaia- to be suitable , the different experiences which candidates_for_the_priesthood have should assume a clear '' ministerial '' character and should be intimately linked_with all the demands_that befit preparation to the priesthood and certainly not neglecting their studies in relation to the services of the proclamation of the word , of worship and of leadership . These services can become a specific way of experiencing the ministries of lector , acolyte and deacon . Since pastoral action -isaia- destined by its_very nature to enliven the Church , which_-isaia- essentially '' mystery , '' '' communion '' and '' mission , '' pastoral formation should be aware of and should live these ecclesial aspects in the exercise of the ministry . Of fundamental importance -isaia- awareness_that the Church -isaia- a '' mystery , '' that_-isaia- , a divine work , fruit of the Spirit of Christ , an effective sign of grace , the prescience of the Trinity in the Christian community . This awareness , while never lessening the pastor s genuine sense_of_responsibility , will convince him_that the Church grows thanks to the gratuitous work of the Spirit and that_his service thanks to the very grace of God that_-isaia- entrusted to the free responsibility of man_-isaia- the Gospel service of the '' unworthy servant '' cf . Awareness of the Church as '' communion '' will prepare the candidate for the priesthood to carry_out his pastoral_work with a community spirit , in heartfelt cooperation_with the different members of the Church : priests and bishop , diocesan and religious priests , priests and lay_people . Such a cooperation presupposes a knowledge and appreciation of the different gifts and charisms , of the diverse vocations and responsibilities which_the Spirit offers and entrusts to the members of Christ s body . It demands a living and precise consciousness of one_s_own identity in the Church and of the identity of others . It demands mutual trust , patience , gentleness and the capacity_for understanding and expectation . It finds_its roots above all in a love for the Church that_-isaia- deeper than love for self and the group or groups one may belong to . It -isaia- particularly important to prepare future priests for cooperation_with the laity . The Council says : '' They should be willing to listen to lay_people , give brotherly consideration to their wishes and recognize their experience and competence in the different fields of human activity . In this_way they will_be_able to recognize with_them the signs of the times . '' The recent synod too has insisted upon pastoral solicitude for the laity : '' The student should become capable of proposing and introducing the lay_faithful , the young especially , to the different vocations marriage , social services , apostolate , ministries and other responsibilities in pastoral_activity , the consecrated_life , involvement in political and social leadership , scientific_research , teaching . Above all it -isaia- necessary_that he be able to teach and support the laity in their_vocation to be present in and to transform the world with the light of the Gospel , by recognizing this_task of theirs and showing respect_for it . '' Lastly , awareness of the Church as a '' missionary '' communion will_help the candidate ; for the priesthood to love and live the essential missionary dimension of the Church and her different pastoral activities . He should be open and available to all the possibilities offered today for the proclamation of the Gospel , not forgetting the valuable service which_can and should be given by the media . He should prepare himself for a ministry which_may mean in practice that_his readiness to follow_the indications of the Holy Spirit and of his bishop will_lead him to be sent to preach the Gospel even beyond_the frontiers of his_own country . The Setting of Priestly Formation The Major Seminary A Formation Community . The need_for the major seminary and by analogy for the religious house for the formation of candidates_for priesthood , was affirmed with authority by the Second Vatican Council and has_been reaffirmed by the synod as follows : '' The institution of the major seminary , as the best place_for formation , -isaia- to be certainly reaffirmed as the normal place , in the material sense as well , for a community and hierarchical life , indeed as the proper home for the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood , with superiors who_are truly dedicated to this service . This institution has produced many good results down the ages and continues to do so all over the world . '' The seminary can be seen as a place and a period in life . But it -isaia- above all an educational community in progress : It -isaia- a community established by the bishop to offer to those called by the Lord to serve as apostles the possibility of re living the experience of formation which_our Lord provided for the Twelve . In fact , the Gospels present a prolonged and intimate sharing of life with Jesus as a necessary premise for the apostolic ministry . Such an experience demands of the Twelve the practice of detachment in a particularly clear and specific fashion , a detachment that in some_way -isaia- demanded of all the disciples , a detachment from their roots , from their usual work , from their nearest and dearest cf . On several occasions we have referred to the Marcan tradition which stresses the deep link that unites the apostles to Christ and to one_another : Before being sent out to preach and to heal , they_are_called '' to be with_him '' Mk . In its deepest identity the seminary -isaia- called to be , in its_own way , a continuation in the Church of the apostolic community gathered about Jesus , listening to his_word , proceeding toward_the Easter experience , awaiting the gift of the Spirit for the mission . Such an identity constitutes the normative ideal which stimulates the seminary in the many diverse forms and varied aspects which it assumes historically as a human institution , to find a concrete realization , faithful to the Gospel values from which it takes its inspiration and able to respond to the situations and needs of the times . The seminary -isaia- , in itself , an original experience of the Church s life . In it the bishop_-isaia- present through the ministry of the rector and the service of co responsibility and communion fostered by him_with the other teachers , for the sake of the pastoral and apostolic growth of the students . The various members of the seminary community , gathered by the Spirit into a single brotherhood , cooperate , each according_to_his own gift in the growth of all in faith and charity so that_they_may prepare suitably for the priesthood and so prolong in the Church and in history the saving presence of Jesus Christ , the good_shepherd . The human point_of_view , the major seminary should strive to become '' a community built on deep friendship and charity so that it can be considered a true family living in joy . '' As a Christian institution , the seminary should become as the synod_fathers continue an '' ecclesial_community , '' a '' community of the disciples of the Lord in which_the one same liturgy which imbues life with a spirit of prayer_-isaia- celebrated ; a community molded daily in the reading and meditation of the word of God and with the sacrament of the Eucharist , and in the practice of fraternal charity and justice ; a community in which , as its life and the life each of its_members progresses , there shine_forth the Spirit of Christ and love for the Church . '' This ecclesial aspect of the seminary -isaia- confirmed and concretized by the fathers when_they add : '' As an ecclesial_community , be it diocesan or interdiocesan , or even religious , the seminary should nourish the meaning of communion_between the candidates and their bishop and presbyterate , in such_a_way_that they share in their hopes and anxieties and learn to extend this openness to the needs of the universal Church . '' It -isaia- essential for the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood and the pastoral_ministry , which by its_very nature_-isaia- ecclesial , that the seminary should be experienced not as something external and superficial , or simply a place in which to live and study , but in an interior and profound way . It should be experienced as a community , a specifically ecclesial_community , a community that relives the experience of the group of Twelve who_were united to Jesus . The seminary -isaia- , therefore , an educational ecclesial_community , indeed a particular educating community . And it -isaia- the specific goal which determines its physiognomy : the vocational accompanying of future priests , and therefore discernment of a vocation ; the help to respond to it and the preparation to receive the sacrament of orders with its_own graces and responsibilities , by which_the priest_-isaia- configured to Jesus Christ head and shepherd and -isaia- enabled and committed to share the mission of salvation in the church and in the world . Inasmuch as it -isaia- an educating community , the seminary and its entire life in all its different expressions -isaia- committed to formation , the human , spiritual , intellectual and pastoral formation of future priests . Although this formation has many aspects in common with the human and Christian formation of all the members of the Church , it has , nevertheless , contents , modalities and characteristics which relate specifically to the aim of preparation_for the priesthood . The content and form of the educational work require that the seminary should_have a precise program , a program of life characterized by its being organized and unified , by its being in harmony or correspondence with one aim which justifies the existence of the seminary : preparation of future priests . In this_regard , the synod_fathers write : '' As an educational community , the seminary should follow a clearly defined program which_will have , as a characteristic , a unity of leadership expressed in the figure of the rector and his cooperators , a consistency in the ordering of life , formational activity and the fundamental demands of community life_,_which also involves the essential aspects of the task of formation . This program should be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the specific finality which alone justify the existence of the seminary , and it should do so without hesitation or ambiguity . That aim -isaia- the formation of future priests , pastors of the Church . '' And in order to ensure_that the programming -isaia- truly apt and effective , the fundamental outlines of the program will_have to be translated into more concrete details , with the help of particular norms that_are aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- regulating community life , establishing certain precise instruments and timetables . A further aspect -isaia- to be stressed here : The educational work_-isaia- by its_nature an accompanying of specific individual persons_who are proceeding to a choice of and commitment to precise ideals of life . For this_very reason , the work of education should be able to bring together into a harmonious whole a clear statement of the goal to be achieved , the requirement that candidates proceed seriously toward_the goal , and third , attention to the '' journeyer , '' that_-isaia- , the individual person who_-isaia- embarked on this adventure , and therefore attention to a series of situations , problems , difficulties and different rates of progress and growth . This requires a wise flexibility . And this does_not_mean compromising , either as regards values or as regards the conscious and free commitment of the candidates . What it does mean -isaia- a true love and a sincere respect_for the person_who , in conditions which_are very personal , -isaia- proceeding toward_the priesthood . This applies not_only to individual candidates , but_also to the diverse social_and_cultural contexts in which seminaries exist and to the different life histories which_they_have . In this_sense the educational work requires continual renewal . The synod_fathers have brought this out forcefully also when speaking about the structure of seminaries : '' Without questioning the validity of the classical forms of seminaries , the synod desires that the work of consultation of the episcopal_conferences on the present_day needs of formation should proceed as -isaia- established in the decree Optatam Totius no . , and in the synod . The rationes of the different nations or rites should be revised where opportune whether on the occasion of requests made by the episcopal_conferences or in relation to apostolic visitations of the seminaries of different countries , in order to bring into them diverse forms of formation that_have proved successful , as well as to respond to the needs of people_with so called indigenous cultures , the needs of the vocations of adult men and the needs of vocations for the missions , etc . The purpose and specific educational form of the major seminary demand_that candidates_for_the_priesthood have a certain prior preparation before entering it . Such preparation , -atti_degli_apostoli- least until a few decades ago , did_not create particular problems . In those days most candidates to the priesthood came from minor seminaries , and the Christian life of the community offered all , in general , a suitable Christian instruction and education . The situation in many places has changed . There -isaia- a considerable discrepancy between on the one_hand the style of life and basic preparation of boys , adolescents and young_men , even when_they_are Christians and -atti_degli_apostoli- times have_been involved in Church life , and on the other_hand the style of life of the seminary with its formational demands . In this_context , together_with_the synod_fathers I ask that_there be a sufficient period of preparation prior to seminary formation : '' It -isaia- a good thing that_there be a period of human , Christian , intellectual and spiritual preparation_for the candidates to the major seminary . These candidates should , however , have certain qualities : a right intention , a sufficient degree of human maturity , a sufficiently broad knowledge of the doctrine_of_the_faith , some introduction into the methods of prayer and behavior in conformity_with Christian tradition . They should_also have attitudes proper to their regions , through_which they_can express their effort to find God and the faith cf . '' The '' sufficiently broad knowledge of the doctrine_of_the_faith '' which_the synod_fathers mention -isaia- a primary condition_for theology . It simply -isaia- not_possible to develop an '' intelligentia fidei '' an understanding of he faith , if the content of the '' fides '' -isaia- not known . Such a gap can be filled more_easily when_the forthcoming Universal Catechism appears . While there_-isaia- increasing consensus regarding the need_for preparation prior to the major seminary , there_are different ideas as to what such preparation should contain and what its characteristics should be : Should it be directed mainly to spiritual formation to discern the vocation or to intellectual and cultural formation ? On the other_hand , we cannot overlook the many and deep diversities that exist , not_only among the individual candidates but_also in the different regions and countries . This implies the need_for a period of study and experimentation in order to define as clearly and suitably as possible the different elements of this prior preparation or '' propaedeutic period '' : the duration , place , form , subject matter of this period , all of which_will have to be coordinated with the subsequent years of formation offered by the seminary . In this_sense I take up and propose to the Congregation for Catholic Education a request expressed by the synod_fathers : '' The synod asks that the Congregation for Catholic Education gather all the information on experiments of such initial formation that have_been done or are_being done . At a suitable time , the congregation -isaia- requested to communicate its findings on this_matter to the episcopal_conferences . '' The Minor Seminary and Other Forms of Fostering Vocations . As long experience shows , a priestly vocation tends to show itself in the preadolescent years or in the earliest years of youth . Even in people_who decide to enter_the seminary later on it -isaia- not infrequent to find that God s call had_been perceived much earlier . The Church s history gives constant witness of calls which_the Lord directs to people of tender age . Thomas , for example , explains Jesus special love for St . John the Apostle '' because of his tender age '' and draws the following conclusion : '' This explains that God loves in a special_way those_who give themselves to his service from their earliest youth . '' The Church looks after these seeds of vocations sown in the hearts of children by means of the institution of minor seminaries , providing a careful though preliminary discernment and accompaniment . In a number of parts_of_the_world , these seminaries continue to carry_out a valuable educational work , the aim of which_-isaia- to protect and develop the seeds of a priestly vocation so that the students may more_easily recognize it and be in a better position to respond to it . The educational goal of such seminaries tends to favor in a timely and gradual way the human , cultural and spiritual formation which_will lead the young person to embark on the path of the major seminary with an adequate and solid foundation . '' To be prepared to follow Christ the Redeemer with generous souls and pure hearts '' : This -isaia- the purpose of the minor seminary as indicated by the Council in the decree Optatam Totius , which thus outlines its educational aspect : The students '' under the fatherly supervision of the superiors the parents too playing their appropriate part should lead lives suited to the age , mentality and development of young_people . Their way_of_life should be fully in keeping_with_the standards of sound psychology and should include suitable experience of the ordinary affairs of daily_life and contact_with their_own families . '' The minor seminary can_also be in the diocese a reference point for vocation work , with suitable forms of welcome and the offering of opportunities_for information to adolescents who_are looking into the possibility of a vocation or who , having already made up their mind to follow their_vocation , have to delay entry into the seminary for various family or educational reasons . In those cases where it -isaia- not_possible to run minor seminaries which '' in many regions seem necessary and very useful '' , other '' institutions '' need to be provided , as for example vocational groups for adolescents and young_people . While they lack the quality of permanence , such groups can_offer a systematic guide , in a community context , with_which to check the existence and development of vocations . While such young_people live -atti_degli_apostoli- home and take_part in the activities of the Christian community which helps them along the path of formation , they_should not be left alone . They need a particular group or community to refer to and where_they can_find support to follow through the specific vocational journey which_the gift of the Holy Spirit has initiated in them . We should_also mention the phenomenon of priestly vocations arising among people of adult age after some years of experience of lay life and professional involvement . This phenomenon , while not new in the Church s history , -atti_degli_apostoli- present appears with some novel features and with a certain frequency . It -isaia- not_always possible and often it -isaia- not_even convenient to invite adults to follow_the educative itinerary of the major seminary . Rather , after a careful discernment of the genuineness of such vocations , what needs to be provided -isaia- some kind of specific program to accompany them_with formation in order to ensure , bearing in mind all the suitable adaptations , that_such persons receive the spiritual and intellectual formation they require . A suitable relationship_with other candidates to the priesthood and periods spent in the community of the major seminary can be a way of guaranteeing that_these vocations are fully inserted in the one presbyterate and are in intimate and heartfelt communion with it . The Agents of Priestly Formation The Church and the Bishop . Given that the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood belongs to the Church s pastoral_care of vocations , it must be said_that the Church as such_-isaia- the communal subject which_has the grace and responsibility to accompany those_whom the Lord calls to become his ministers in the priesthood . In this_sense the appreciation of the mystery of the Church helps us to establish more precisely_the place and role which her different members have be it individually or as members of a body in the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . The Church -isaia- by her very nature the '' memorial '' or '' sacrament '' of the presence and action of Jesus Christ in our midst and on our behalf . The call to the priesthood depends on his saving presence : not_only the call , but_also the accompanying so that the person called can recognize_the Lord s grace and respond to it freely and lovingly . It -isaia- the Spirit of Jesus that throws light on and gives strength to vocational discernment and the journey to the priesthood . So we can say that_there cannot exist any genuine formational work_for the priesthood without_the influence of the Spirit of Christ . Everyone involved in the work of formation should be fully aware of this . How can we fail to appreciate this utterly gratuitous and completely effective '' resource , '' which_has its_own decisive '' weight '' in the effort to train people for the priesthood ? How can we not rejoice when we consider_the dignity of every_human_being involved in formation , who for the candidate to the priesthood becomes , as it were , the visible representative of Christ ? If training for the priesthood -isaia- , as it should be , essentially the preparation of future '' shepherds '' in the likeness of Jesus Christ the good_shepherd , who better_than Jesus himself , through the outpouring of his Spirit , can give_them and fully develop in them that pastoral_charity which he himself lived to the point of total self_giving cf . : ; : and which he wishes all priests to live in their turn ? The first representative of Christ in priestly formation_-isaia- the bishop . What Mark the evangelist tells us , in the text we have_already quoted more_than_once , can be applied to the bishop , to every bishop : '' He called to him those_whom he desired ; and they came to him . And he appointed twelve to be with_him , and to be sent out '' Mk . The truth_-isaia- that the interior call of the Spirit needs to be recognized as the authentic call of the bishop . Just as all can '' go '' to the bishop , because he -isaia- shepherd and father to all , his priests_who share_with him the one priesthood and ministry can do so in a special_way : The bishop , the Council tell us should consider them and treat them as '' brothers '' and friends . '' By analogy the same can_be_said of those_who_are preparing for the priesthood . As for '' being with_him , '' with the bishop , the bishop should make a point of visiting them often and in some_way '' being '' with_them as a way of giving significant expression to his responsibility_for the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . The presence of the bishop -isaia-_especially valuable , not only_because it helps the seminary community live its insertion in the particular_church and its communion with the pastor who guides it , but also_because verifies and encourages the pastoral purpose which_-isaia- what specifies the entire formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . In particular , with_his presence and by his sharing with candidates_for_the_priesthood all that_has to do with the pastoral progress of the particular_church , the bishop offers a fundamental contribution to formation in the '' sensus ecclesiae , '' as a central spiritual and pastoral value in the exercise of the priestly_ministry . The Seminary as an Educational Community . The educational community of the seminary -isaia- built round the various people involved in formation : the rector , the spiritual father or spiritual director , the superiors and professors . These people should feel profoundly united to the bishop , whom_they represent in their different roles and in various_ways . They should_also maintain among_themselves a frank and genuine communion . The unity of the educators not_only helps the educational program to be put into_practice properly , but_also and above all it offers candidates_for_the_priesthood a significant example and a practical introduction to that ecclesial_communion which_-isaia- a fundamental value of Christian living and of the pastoral_ministry . It -isaia- evident_that much of the effectiveness of the training offered depends on the maturity and strength of personality of those entrusted with formation , both from the human and from the Gospel points of view . And so it -isaia-_especially important both to select them carefully and to encourage them to become ever_more suitable for carrying_out the task entrusted to them . The synod_fathers were very aware_that the future of the preparation of candidates_for_the_priesthood depends on the choice and formation of those entrusted with the work of formation , and so they describe -atti_degli_apostoli- length the qualities sought for in them . Specifically they wrote : '' The task of formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood requires not_only a certain special preparation of those_to_whom this work_-isaia- entrusted , one that_-isaia- professional , pedagogical , spiritual , human and theological , but_also a spirit of communion and of cooperating together to carry_out the program , so that the unity of the pastoral action of the seminary -isaia- always maintained under the leadership of the rector . The body of formation personnel should witness to a truly evangelical lifestyle and total dedication to the Lord . It should enjoy a certain stability , and its_members as a rule should live in the seminary community . They should be intimately joined to the bishop , who -isaia-_the_first one responsible_for the formation of the priests . '' The bishops first of all should feel their grave responsibility_for the formation of those_who_have been_given the task of educating future priests . For this ministry , priests of exemplary life should be chosen , men with a number of qualities : '' human and spiritual maturity , pastoral experience , professional competence , stability in their_own vocation , a capacity to work with_others , serious preparation in those human sciences psychology especially which relate to their office , a knowledge of how to work in groups . '' While safeguarding the distinctions between internal and external forum , and maintaining a suitable freedom in the choice of confessors and the prudence and discretion which_should be a feature of the ministry of the spiritual director , the priestly community of teachers should feel united in the responsibility of educating candidates_for_the_priesthood . It -isaia- their_duty , always with_regard to the authoritative evaluation made by the bishop and the rector together , to foster and verify in the first_place the suitability of the candidates in regard to their_spiritual , human and intellectual endowments , above all in regard to their spirit of prayer , their deep assimilation of the doctrine_of_the_faith , their capacity_for true fraternity and the charism of celibacy . Bearing in mind as the synod_fathers have indeed done the indications of the exhortation Christifideles Laici and of the apostolic_letter Mulieris Dignitatem , which stress the suitability of a healthy influence of lay spirituality and of the charism of femininity in every educational itinerary , it -isaia- worthwhile to involve , in ways that_are prudent and adapted to the different cultural contexts , the cooperation also of lay_faithful , both men_and_women , in the work of training future priests . They are to be selected with care , within_the framework of Church laws and according_to_their particular charisms and proven competence . We can expect beneficial fruits from their cooperation , provided it -isaia- suitably coordinated and integrated in the primary educational responsibilities of those entrusted with the formation of future priests , fruits for a balanced growth of the sense of the Church and a more precise perception of what it -isaia- to be a priest on the part of the candidates to the priesthood . The Professors of Theology . Those who by their teaching of theology introduce future priests to sacred doctrine and accompany them in it have a particular educational responsibility . Experience teaches_that they often have a greater influence on the development of the priest s personality than other educators . The responsibility of the teachers of theology will lead_them , even before they consider_the teaching relationship they_are to establish with candidates_for_the_priesthood , to look into the concept they_themselves should_have of the nature of theology and the priestly , ministry , and also of the spirit and style in which they_should carry_out_their teaching of theology . In this_sense the synod_fathers have rightly affirmed that '' the theologian must_never forget_that as a teacher he -isaia- not presenting his personal doctrines but opening to and communicating to others the understanding of the faith , in the last analysis in the name of the Lord and his Church . In such_a_way , the theologian , using all the methods and techniques provided by his science , carries out his task -atti_degli_apostoli- the mandate of the Church and cooperates with the bishop in his task of teaching . Since theologians and bishops are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church herself in promoting the faith , they_should develop and foster trust in each_other and , in this_spirit , overcome tensions and conflicts for fuller treatment , cf . Instruction of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on The Ecclesial Vocation of the Theologian . '' The teacher of theology , like any_other teacher , should remain in communion and sincerely cooperate with all the other people_who_are involved in the formation of future priests and offer with scientific precision , generosity , humility and enthusiasm his_own original and expert contribution , which_-isaia-_not simply the communication of doctrine even_though it be sacred doctrine but_-isaia- above all the presentation of the point_of_view which unifies , in the plan of God , all the different branches of human knowledge and the various expressions of life . In particular , the formative effect of the teachers of theology will depend , above all , on whether_they are '' men of faith who_are full of love for the Church , convinced_that the one_who really knows the Christian mystery -isaia- the Church as such and , therefore_,_that their task of teaching_-isaia- really and truly an ecclesial ministry , men who_have a richly developed pastoral sense which enables them to discern not_only content but forms that_are suitable for the exercise of their_ministry . In particular , what_-isaia- expected of the teachers -isaia- total fidelity to the magisterium ; for they teach in the name of the Church , and because of this they_are witnesses to the faith . Communities of Origin and Associations and Youth Movements . The communities from which_the candidate for the priesthood comes continue , albeit with the necessary detachment which_-isaia- involved by the choice of a vocation , to bear considerable influence on the formation of the future priest . They should therefore be aware of their_specific share of responsibility . Let us mention first of all the family : Christian parents , as also brothers_and_sisters and the other members of the family , should never seek to call back the future priest within_the narrow confines of a too human if not worldly logic , no matter how supported by sincere affection that logic may be cf . Instead , driven by the same desire '' to fulfill the will of God , '' they_should accompany the formative journey with prayer , respect , the good example of the domestic virtues and spiritual and material help , especially in difficult moments . Experience teaches_that , in so many cases , this multiple help has proved decisive for candidates_for_the_priesthood . Even in the case of parents or relatives who_are indifferent or opposed to the choice of a vocation , a clear and calm facing of the situation and the encouragement which derives from it can be a great help to the deeper and more determined maturing of a priestly vocation . Closely linked_with the families -isaia- the parish community . Both it and the family are connected in education in the faith . Often , afterward , the parish , with its specific pastoral_care for young_people and vocations , supplements the family s role . Above all , inasmuch as it -isaia-_the_most immediate local expression of the mystery of the Church , the parish offers an original and especially valuable contribution to the formation of a future priest . The parish community should continue to feel_that the young_man on his way to the priesthood -isaia- a living part of itself ; it should accompany him_with its prayer , give him a cordial welcome during the holiday periods , respect and encourage him to form himself in his identity as a priest , and offer him suitable opportunities and strong encouragement to try out his vocation for the priestly mission . Associations and youth movements , which_are a sign and confirmation of the vitality which_the Spirit guarantees to the Church , can and should contribute also to the formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood , in particular of those_who_are the product of the Christian , spiritual and apostolic experience of these groups . Young people_who have_received their basic formation in such groups and look to them_for their experience of the Church should_not feel they are_being asked to uproot themselves from their past or to break their links with the environment which_has contributed to their decision to respond to their_vocation , nor_should they erase the characteristic traits of the spirituality which_they_have learned and lived there in all that_they contain that_-isaia- good , edifying and rich . For them too , this environment from which_they come continues to be a source of help and support on the path of formation toward_the priesthood . The Spirit offers to many young_people opportunities to be educated in the faith and to grow as Christians and as members of the Church through many kinds of groups , movements and associations inspired in different_ways by the Gospel message . These should be felt and lived as a nourishing gift of a soul within_the institution and -atti_degli_apostoli- its service . A movement or a particular spirituality '' -isaia- not an alternative structure to the institution . It -isaia- rather a source of a presence which constantly regenerates the existential and historical authenticity of the institution . The priest should therefore find within a movement the light and warmth which_make him capable of fidelity to his bishop and which_make him ready for the duties of the institution and mindful of ecclesiastical discipline , thus making the reality of his faith more fertile and his faithfulness more joyful . '' It -isaia- therefore necessary , in the new community of the seminary in which_they_are gathered by the bishop , that young_people coming from associations and ecclesial movements should learn '' respect_for other spiritual paths and a spirit of dialogue and cooperation , '' should_take in genuinely and sincerely the indications for their training imparted by the bishop and the teachers in the seminary , abandoning themselves_with real confidence to their guidance and assessments . '' Such an attitude will prepare and in some_way anticipate a genuine priestly choice to serve the entire People of God in the fraternal communion of the presbyterate and in obedience to the bishop . The fact_that seminarians and diocesan priests take_part in particular spiritualities or ecclesial groupings -isaia- indeed , in itself , a factor which helps growth and priestly fraternity . Such participation , however , should_not be an obstacle , but_rather a help to the ministry and spiritual_life which_are proper to the diocesan priest , who '' will_always remain the shepherd of all . Not only -isaia- he a permanent shepherd , available to all , but he presides over the gathering of all so that all may find the welcome which_they_have a right to expect in the community and in the Eucharist that unites them , whatever be their religious sensibility or pastoral commitment . '' The Candidate Himself . Lastly , we must_not forget_that the candidate himself_-isaia- a necessary and irreplaceable agent in his_own formation : All formation , priestly formation included , -isaia- ultimately a self formation . No one_can replace us in the responsible freedom that_we_have as individual persons . And so the future priest also , and in the first_place , must grow in his awareness_that the agent par excellence of his formation_-isaia- the Holy Spirit , who by the gift of a new heart configures and conforms him to Jesus Christ the good_shepherd . In this_way the candidate to the priesthood will affirm in the most radical way possible his freedom to welcome the molding action of the Spirit . But to welcome this action implies also , on the part of the candidate , a welcome for the human '' mediating '' forces which_the Spirit employs . As a result , the actions of the different teachers become truly and fully effective only if the future priest offers his_own convinced and heartfelt cooperation to this_work of formation . CHAPTER VI I REMIND YOU TO REKINDLE THE GIFT OF GOD THAT IS WITHIN YOU The Ongoing Formation of Priests Theological Reasons Behind Ongoing Formation . '' I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that_-isaia- within you '' Tm . Paul to Timothy can appropriately be applied to the ongoing_formation to which all priests_are called by virtue of the '' gift of God '' which_they_have received -atti_degli_apostoli- their ordination . The passage helps us to grasp the full truth , the absolute uniqueness of the permanent formation of priests . Here we are_also helped by another text of St . Paul , who once_more writes to Timothy : '' Do not neglect the gift you_have , which was_given you by prophetic utterance when_the elders laid their hands upon you . Practice these duties , devote yourself to them , so that all may see your progress . Take heed to yourself and to your teaching ; hold to that , for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers '' Tm . Paul asks Timothy to '' rekindle , '' or stir into flame , the divine gift he has_received , much as one might do with the embers of a fire , in the sense of welcoming it and living it out without ever losing or forgetting that '' permanent novelty '' which_-isaia- characteristic of every gift from God , who makes all things new cf . : , and thus living it out in its unfading freshness and original beauty . But this '' rekindling '' -isaia-_not_only the outcome of a task entrusted to the personal responsibility of Timothy , nor only the result of his efforts to use his mind and will . It -isaia-_also the effect of a dynamism of grace intrinsic to God s gift . God himself , in other_words , rekindles his_own gift , so as better to release all the extraordinary riches of grace and responsibility contained in it . With the sacramental outpouring of the Holy Spirit who consecrates and sends forth , the priest_-isaia- configured to the likeness of Jesus Christ , head and shepherd of the Church , and -isaia- sent forth to carry_out a pastoral_ministry . In this_way the priest_-isaia- marked permanently and indelibly in his inner being as a minister of Jesus and of the Church . He comes to share in a permanent and irreversible way_of_life and -isaia- entrusted with a pastoral_ministry which , because_it_-isaia- rooted in his being and involves his entire life , -isaia- itself permanent . The sacrament of holy_orders confers upon the priest sacramental grace_which gives him a share not_only in Jesus saving '' power '' and '' ministry '' but_also in his_pastoral '' love . '' At the same_time it ensures that the priest can count on all the actual graces he needs , whenever they_are necessary and useful for the worthy and perfect exercise of the ministry he has_received . We thus see_that the proper foundation and original motivation for ongoing formation_-isaia- contained in the dynamism of the sacrament of holy_orders . Certainly there_are also purely human reasons which call_for the priest to engage in ongoing_formation . This formation_-isaia- demanded by his_own continuing personal growth . Every life_-isaia- a constant path toward maturity , a maturity which_cannot be attained except by constant formation . It -isaia-_also demanded by the priestly_ministry seen in a general way and taken in common with_other professions , that_-isaia- , as a service directed to others . There -isaia- no profession , job or work which_does_not require constant updating if it -isaia- to remain current and effective . The need to '' keep pace '' with the path of history -isaia- another human_reason justifying ongoing_formation . But these and other motivations are taken up and become even clearer by the theological motivations mentioned previously and which demand further reflection . The sacrament of holy_orders , by its_nature common to all the sacraments as a '' sign '' may be considered , and truly -isaia- , a word of God . It -isaia- a word of God which calls and sends forth . It -isaia- the strongest expression of the priest s vocation and mission . By the sacrament of holy_orders , God calls the candidate '' to '' the priesthood '' coram ecclesia . '' The '' come , follow me '' of Jesus -isaia- proclaimed fully and definitively in the sacramental celebration of his Church . It -isaia- made manifest and communicated by the Church s voice , which_-isaia- heard in the words of the bishop who prays and imposes his hands . The priest then gives his response , in faith , to Jesus call . '' I -amos- coming , to follow you . '' From this moment there begins that response which , as a fundamental choice , must be expressed anew and reaffirmed through the years of his priesthood in countless other responses , all of them rooted in and enlivened by that '' yes '' of holy_orders . In this_sense one_can speak of a vocation '' within '' the priesthood The fact -isaia- that God continues to call and send forth , revealing his saving plan in the historical development of the priest s life and the life of the Church and of society . It -isaia- in this perspective that the meaning of ongoing_formation emerges . Permanent formation_-isaia- necessary in order to discern and follow this constant call or will of God . Thus the apostle Peter -isaia- called to follow Jesus even after_the risen Lord has_entrusted his flock to him : '' Jesus said to him , Feed my sheep . Truly , truly , I say to you , when_you were young , you girded yourself and walked where you would ; but_when you_are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go . This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God . And after this he said to him , Follow me . Consequently there_-isaia- a '' follow me '' which accompanies the apostle s whole life_and_mission . It -isaia- a '' follow me '' in line with the call and demand of faithfulness unto death cf . : , a '' follow me '' which_can signify a sequela Christi to the point of total self_giving in martyrdom . The synod_fathers explained the reason justifying the need_for ongoing_formation , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time revealing its deep nature as '' faithfulness '' to the priestly_ministry and as a '' process of continual conversion . '' It -isaia- the Holy Spirit , poured out in the sacrament , who sustains the priest in this faithfulness and accompanies him and encourages him along this path of unending conversion . The gift of the Spirit does_not take away the freedom of the priest . It calls on the priest to make_use of his freedom in order to cooperate responsibly and accept permanent formation as a task entrusted to him . Thus permanent formation_-isaia- a requirement of the priest s own faithfulness to his_ministry , to his_very being . It -isaia- love for Jesus Christ and fidelity to oneself . But it -isaia-_also an act of love for the People of God , -atti_degli_apostoli- whose service the priest_-isaia- placed . Indeed , an act of true and proper justice : The priest owes it to God s people , whose fundamental '' right '' to receive the word of God , the sacraments and the service of charity , the original and irreplaceable content of the priest s own pastoral_ministry , he -isaia- called to acknowledge and foster . Ongoing formation_-isaia- necessary to ensure_that the priest can properly respond to this right of the People of God . The heart and form of the priest s ongoing formation_-isaia- pastoral_charity : The Holy Spirit , who infuses pastoral_charity , introduces and accompanies the priest to an ever deeper knowledge of the mystery of Christ , which_-isaia- unfathomable in its richness cf . and , in turn , to a knowledge of the mystery of Christian priesthood . Pastoral charity itself impels the priest to an ever deeper knowledge of the hopes , the needs , the problems , the sensibilities of the people to whom he ministers , taken in their_specific situations , as individuals , in their_families , in society and in history . All this constitutes the object of ongoing_formation , understood as a conscious and free decision to live out the dynamism of pastoral_charity and of the Holy Spirit who_-isaia- its first source and constant nourishment . In this_sense ongoing formation_-isaia- an intrinsic requirement of the gift and sacramental ministry received ; and it proves necessary in every_age . It -isaia- particularly urgent today , not only_because of rapid changes in the social_and_cultural conditions of individuals and peoples among whom priestly_ministry -isaia- exercised , but also_because of that '' new_evangelization '' which constitutes the essential and pressing task of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium . Different Dimensions of Ongoing Formation . The ongoing_formation of priests , whether diocesan or religious , -isaia- the natural and absolutely necessary continuation of the process of building priestly personality which began and developed in the seminary or the religious house with the training program which aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- ordination . It -isaia- particularly important to be aware of and to respect the intrinsic link between formation before ordination to the priesthood and formation after ordination . Should there be a break in continuity , or worse a complete difference between these_two phases of formation , there_would be serious and immediate repercussions on pastoral_work and fraternal communion among priests , especially_those in different age groups . Ongoing formation_-isaia- not a repetition of the formation acquired in the seminary , simply reviewed or expanded with new and practical suggestions . Ongoing formation involves relatively new content and especially methods ; it develops as a harmonious and vital process which rooted in the formation received in the seminary calls for adaptations , updating and modifications , but without sharp breaks in continuity . On the other_hand , long term preparation_for ongoing_formation should_take place in the major seminary , where encouragement needs to be given to future priests to look forward to it , seeing its necessity , its advantages and the spirit in which it should be undertaken , and appropriate conditions for its realization need to be ensured . By the very fact_that ongoing formation_-isaia- a continuation of the formation received in the seminary , its aim cannot be the inculcation of a purely '' professional '' approach , which_could be acquired by learning a few new pastoral techniques . Instead its aim must be that of promoting a general and integral process of constant growth , deepening each of the aspects of formation human , spiritual , intellectual and pastoral as well as ensuring their active and harmonious integration , based on pastoral_charity and in reference to it . Fuller development -isaia- first required in the human aspect of priestly formation . Through his daily contact_with people , his sharing ill their_daily lives , the priest needs to develop and sharpen his human sensitivity so as to understand more_clearly their needs , respond to their demands , perceive their unvoiced questions and share the hopes and expectations , the joys and burdens which_are part of life : Thus he will_be_able to meet and enter_into dialogue_with all people . In particular , through coming to know and share , through making his_own the human experience Or suffering in its many_different manifestations , from poverty to illness , from rejection to ignorance , loneliness and material or moral poverty , the priest can cultivate his_own humanity and make it all the more genuine and clearly apparent by his increasingly ardent love for his fellow men_and_women . In this_task of bringing his human formation to maturity , the priest receives special assistance from the grace of Jesus Christ . The charity of the good_shepherd was revealed not_only by his gift of salvation to mankind , but_also by his desire to share our life : Thus , the Word who became '' flesh '' cf . : desired to know joy and suffering , to experience weariness , to share feelings , to console sadness . Living as a man among and with men , Jesus Christ offers the most complete , genuine and perfect expression of what it means to be human . We see him celebrating -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding feast of Cana , a friend s family , moved by the hungry crowd who follow_him , giving sick or even dead children back to their_parents , weeping for the death of Lazarus , and so on . The People of God should be able to say about the priest , who_has increasingly matured in human sensitivity , something similar to what we read about Jesus in the letter to the Hebrews : '' For we have_not a high_priest who_-isaia- unable to sympathize with_our weaknesses , but_one who in every respect has_been tempted as we are , yet without sinning '' Heb . The formation of the priest in its spiritual dimension -isaia- required by the new Gospel life to which_he_has been_called in a specific way by the Holy Spirit , poured out in the sacrament of holy_orders . The Spirit , by consecrating the priest and configuring him to Jesus Christ , head and shepherd , creates a bond which , located in the priest s very being , demands to be assimilated and lived out in a personal , free and conscious way through an ever richer communion of life and love and an ever broader and more radical sharing in the feelings and attitudes of Jesus Christ . In this bond_between the Lord Jesus and the priest , an ontological and psychological bond , a sacramental and moral bond , -isaia- the foundation and likewise the power for that '' life according to the Spirit '' and that '' radicalism of the Gospel '' to which_every priest_-isaia- called today and which_-isaia- fostered by ongoing_formation in its spiritual aspect . This formation proves necessary also_for the priestly_ministry to be genuine and spiritually fruitful . '' Are you exercising the care of souls ? '' St . Charles Borromeo once asked in a talk to priests . And he went on to say : '' Do not thereby neglect yourself . Do not give yourself to others to such an extent_that nothing_-isaia- left of yourself for yourself . You should certainly keep in mind the souls whose pastor you_are , but without forgetting yourself . My brothers , do not forget_that there_-isaia-_nothing so necessary to all churchmen that the meditation which precedes , accompanies and follows all our actions : I will sing , says the prophet , and I will meditate cf . If you administer the sacraments , my brother , meditate upon what_you are doing . If you celebrate Mass , meditate on what_you are offering . If you recite the psalms in choir , meditate to whom and of what_you are speaking . If you_are guiding souls , meditate in whose blood they_have_been cleansed . And let all be done among_you in charity Cor . Thus we will_be_able to overcome the difficulties we meet , countless as they_are , each_day . In any event , this_-isaia-_what -isaia- demanded of us by the task entrusted to us . If we act thus , we will_find the strength to give birth to Christ in ourselves and in others . '' The priest s prayer life in particular needs to be continually '' reformed . '' Experience teaches_that in prayer one_cannot live off past gains . Every day we need not_only to renew our external fidelity to times of prayer , especially_those devoted to the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours and those left to personal choice and not reinforced by fixed times of liturgical service , but_also to strive constantly for the experience of a genuine personal encounter_with Jesus , a trusting dialogue_with_the Father and a deep experience of the Spirit . What the apostle Paul says of all Christians , that_they must attain '' to mature manhood , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ '' Eph . : , can be applied specifically to priests , who are_called to the perfection of charity and therefore to holiness , even_more so because their pastoral_ministry itself demands_that they be living models for all the faithful . The intellectual dimension of formation likewise needs to be continually fostered through the priest s entire life , especially by a commitment to study and a serious and disciplined familiarity with modern culture . As one_who shares in the prophetic mission of Jesus and -isaia-_part of the mystery of the Church , the teacher of truth , the priest_-isaia- called to reveal to others , in Jesus Christ , the true face of God , and as a result the true face of humanity . '' This demands_that the priest himself seek God s face and contemplate it with loving veneration cf . Only thus will he be able to make others know him . In particular , continuing theological study -isaia- necessary if the priest_-isaia- to faithfully carry_out the ministry of the word , proclaiming it clearly and without ambiguity , distinguishing it from mere human opinions , no matter how renowned and widespread these might be . Thus he will_be_able to stand -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the People of God , helping them to give an account , to all who ask , of their Christian hope cf . Furthermore , the priest '' in applying himself conscientiously and diligently to theological study -isaia- in a position to assimilate the genuine richness of the Church in a sure and personal way . Therefore , he can faithfully discharge the mission which_-isaia- incumbent on him when responding to difficulties about authentic Catholic doctrine and overcome the inclination , both in himself and others , which_leads to dissent and negative attitudes toward_the magisterium and sacred tradition . '' The pastoral aspect of ongoing formation_-isaia- well expressed by the words_of_the_apostle Peter : '' As each has_received a gift , employ it for one_another , as good stewards of God s varied grace '' Pt . If he -isaia- to live daily according to the graces he has_received , the priest must be ever_more open to accepting the pastoral_charity of Jesus Christ granted him by Christ s Spirit in the sacrament he has_received . Just as all the Lord s activity was_the fruit and sign of pastoral_charity , so should the priest s ministerial activity be . Pastoral charity_-isaia- a gift , but_it_-isaia- likewise a task , a grace and a responsibility to which we must be faithful . We have , therefore , to welcome it and live out its dynamism even to its most radical demands . This pastoral_charity , as has been_said , impels the priest and stimulates him to become ever better acquainted with the real situation of the men_and_women to whom he -isaia- sent , to discern the call of the Spirit in the historical circumstances in which he finds himself and to seek the most suitable methods and the most useful forms for carrying_out his_ministry today . Thus pastoral_charity encourages and sustains the priest s human efforts for pastoral_activity that_-isaia- relevant , credible and effective . But this demands some kind of permanent pastoral formation . The path toward maturity does not_simply demand_that the priest deepen the different aspects of his formation . It also demands above all that he be able to combine ever_more harmoniously all these aspects , gradually achieving their inner unity . This will be made possible by pastoral_charity . Indeed , pastoral_charity not_only coordinates and unifies the diverse aspects , but it makes them more specific , marking them out as aspects of the formation of the priest as such , that_-isaia- , of the priest as a clear and living image , a minister of Jesus the good_shepherd . Ongoing formation helps the priest to overcome the temptation to reduce his_ministry to an activism which becomes an end in itself , to the provision of impersonal services , even if these_are spiritual or sacred , or to a businesslike function which he carries out for the Church . Only ongoing_formation enables the priest to safeguard with vigilant love the '' mystery '' which he bears within his_heart for the good of the Church and of mankind . The Profound Meaning of Ongoing Formation The different and complementary dimensions of ongoing_formation help us to grasp its profound meaning . Ongoing formation helps the priest to be and act as a priest in the spirit and style of Jesus the good_shepherd . Truth needs to be put into_practice ! St . James tells us as much : '' Be doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves '' Jas . Priests are_called to '' live the truth '' of their being , that_-isaia- to live '' in love '' cf . : their identity and ministry in the Church and for the Church . They are_called to become ever_more aware of the gift of God and to live it out constantly . This -isaia- the invitation Paul makes to Timothy : '' Guard the truth that_has_been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit which dwells within us '' Tm . In the ecclesiological context which_we_have recalled more_than_once , we can consider_the profound meaning of ongoing priestly formation in relation to the priest s presence and activity in the Church as mysterium , communio et missio . Within the Church as '' mystery '' the priest_-isaia- called , by his ongoing_formation , to safeguard and develop in faith his awareness of the total and marvelous truth of his being : He -isaia- a minister of Christ and steward of the mysteries of God cf . Paul expressly asks Christians to consider him in this_way . But even before that , he himself lives in the awareness of the sublime gift he has received_from_the Lord . This should be the case with every priest , if he wishes to remain true to his being . But this_-isaia- possible only in faith , only by looking -atti_degli_apostoli- things through the eyes of Christ . In this_sense it can_be_said that ongoing_formation has as its aim that the priest become a believer and ever_more of one : that he grow in understanding of who he truly -isaia- , seeing things with the eyes of Christ . The priest must safeguard this_truth with grateful and joyful love . He must renew his faith when he exercises his priestly_ministry ; he must feel himself a minister of Christ , a sacrament of the love of God for mankind , every time that_he_-isaia- the means and the living instrument for conferring God s grace upon men_and_women . He must recognize this_same truth in his fellow priests , for this_-isaia- the basis of his respect and love for other priests . Ongoing formation helps priests , within_the Church as '' communion , '' to deepen their awareness_that their_ministry -isaia- ultimately aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- gathering together the family of God as a brotherhood inspired by charity and to lead it to the Father through Christ in the Holy Spirit . The priest should grow in awareness of the deep communion uniting him to the People of God : He -isaia-_not_only '' in the forefront of '' the Church , but_above all '' in '' the Church . He -isaia- a brother among brothers . By baptism , which marks him_with the dignity and freedom of the children of God in the only_begotten Son , the priest_-isaia- a member of the one_body of Christ cf . His consciousness of this communion leads to a need to awaken and deepen co responsibility in the one common mission of salvation , with a prompt and heartfelt esteem_for all the charisms and tasks which_the Spirit gives believers for the building up of the Church . It -isaia- above all in the exercise of the pastoral_ministry , directed by its_very nature to the good of the People of God , that the priest must live and give witness to his profound communion with all . As Pope Paul VI wrote : '' We must become brothers to all -atti_degli_apostoli- the very same_time as we wish to be their shepherds , fathers and teachers . The climate of dialogue -isaia- friendship . Indeed it -isaia- service . '' More specifically , the priest_-isaia- called to deepen his awareness of being a member of the particular_church in which he -isaia- incardinated , joined by a bond that_-isaia- juridical , spiritual and pastoral . This awareness presupposes a particular love for his_own church and it makes that_love grow . This -isaia- truly the living and permanent goal of the pastoral_charity which_should accompany the life of the priest and lead him to share in the history or life experience of this_same particular_church , in its riches and in its weaknesses , in its difficulties and in its hopes , working in it for its growth . And thus to feel himself both enriched by the particular_church and actively involved in building it up , carrying on as an individual and together_with other priests that pastoral involvement typical of his_brother priests_who have gone before him . A necessary requirement of this pastoral_charity toward one_s_own particular_church and its future ministry -isaia- the concern which_the priest should_have to find , so to speak , someone to replace him in the priesthood . The priest must grow in his awareness of the communion existing between_the various particular_churches , a communion rooted in their_very being as churches which_make present in various places Christ s one universal Church . This awareness of the communion of the particular_churches will foster an '' exchange of gifts , '' beginning with living and personal gifts , such as priests themselves . There should be a readiness , indeed a generous commitment , to provide_for a fair distribution of clergy . Among these particular_churches , those should be kept in mind which , because_they_are '' deprived of freedom , cannot have_their own vocations , '' as well as those '' churches which_have emerged recently from persecution and poor churches which_have_been given help already for_many years and from many sources with_great hearted brotherliness and still receive help . Within the ecclesial_communion , the priest_-isaia- called in particular to grow , thanks to his ongoing_formation , in and with_his own presbyterate in union with_his bishop . The presbyterate , in the fullness of its truth , -isaia- a mysterium : It -isaia-_in_fact a supernatural reality because_it_-isaia- rooted in the sacrament of holy_orders . This -isaia- its source and origin . This -isaia- its '' place '' of birth and of its growth . Indeed , '' priests by means of the sacrament of orders are tied with a personal and indissoluble bond to Christ the one priest . The sacrament of holy_orders -isaia- conferred upon each of them as individuals , but_they are inserted into the communion of the presbyterate united with the bishop Lumen Gentium , ; Presbyterorum Ordinis , and . '' This sacramental origin -isaia- reflected and continued in the sphere of priestly_ministry : from mysterium to ministerium . '' Unity among the priests with the bishop and among_themselves -isaia- not something added from the outside to the nature of their service , but expresses its essence inasmuch as it -isaia- the care of Christ the priest for the people gathered in the unity of the Blessed Trinity . '' This unity among priests , lived in a spirit of pastoral_charity , makes priests witnesses of Jesus Christ , who prayed to the Father '' that_they_may all be one '' Jn . The presbyterate thus appears as a true family , as a fraternity whose ties do not arise from flesh and blood but_from the grace of holy_orders . This grace takes up and elevates the human and psychological bonds of affection and friendship , as well as the spiritual bonds which exist between priests . It -isaia- a grace that grows ever_greater and finds expression in the most varied forms of mutual assistance , spiritual and material as well . Priestly fraternity excludes no one . However it can and should_have its preferences , those of the Gospel , reserved for those_who_have greatest need of help and encouragement . This fraternity '' takes special_care of the young priests , maintains a kind and fraternal dialogue_with those of the middle and older age groups , and with_those_who for whatever reasons are facing difficulties , as for those priests_who have_given up this way_of_life or are_not following it -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time , this brotherhood does_not forget them but follows them all the more with fraternal solicitude . '' Religious clergy who_live and work in a particular_church also belong to the one presbyterate , albeit under a different title . Their presence -isaia- a source of enrichment for all priests . The different particular charisms which_they live , while challenging all priests to grow in the understanding of the priesthood itself , help to encourage and promote ongoing priestly formation . The gift of religious_life , in the framework of the diocese , when accompanied by genuine esteem and rightful respect_for the particular features of each institute and each spiritual tradition , broadens the horizon of Christian witness and contributes in various_ways to an enrichment of priestly spirituality , above all with_regard to the proper relationship and interplay between_the values of the particular_church and those of the whole People of God . For their_part , religious will be concerned to ensure a spirit of true ecclesial_communion , a genuine participation in the progress of the diocese and the pastoral decisions of the bishop , generously putting their_own charism -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of building up everyone ; in charity . Finally , it -isaia- in the context of the Church as communion and in the context of the presbyterate that_we_can best discuss the problem of priestly loneliness treated by the synod_fathers . There -isaia- a loneliness which all priests experience and which_-isaia- completely normal . But there_-isaia- another loneliness which_-isaia- the product of various difficulties and which in turn creates further difficulties . With regard to the latter , '' active participation in the diocesan presbyterate , regular contact_with_the bishop and with the other priests , mutual cooperation , common life or fraternal dealings between priests , as also friendship and good relations with the lay faithful_who are active in parish life are_very useful means to overcome the negative effects of loneliness which_the priest can sometimes experience . '' Loneliness does_not however create only difficulties ; it can_also offer positive opportunities_for the priestly life : '' When it -isaia- accepted in a spirit of oblation and -isaia- seen as an opportunity_for greater intimacy with Jesus Christ the Lord , solitude can be an opportunity_for prayer and study , as also a help for sanctification and also for_human growth . '' It should be added that a certain type of solitude -isaia- a necessary element in ongoing_formation . Jesus often went off alone to pray cf . The ability to handle a healthy solitude -isaia- indispensable for caring for one s interior life . Here we are speaking of a solitude filled_with_the presence of the Lord who puts us in contact_with_the Father , in the light of the Spirit . In this_regard , concern_for silence and looking for places and times of '' desert '' are necessary_for the priest s permanent formation , whether in the intellectual , spiritual or pastoral areas . In this_regard too , it can_be_said that_those unable to have a positive experience of their_own solitude are incapable of genuine and fraternal fellowship . Ongoing formation aims -atti_degli_apostoli- increasing the priest s awareness of his share in the Church s saving mission . In the Church s '' mission , '' the priest s permanent formation appears not_only as a necessary condition but_also as an indispensable means_for constantly refocusing on the meaning of his_mission and for ensuring that_he_-isaia- carrying it out with fidelity and generosity . By this formation , the priest_-isaia- helped to become aware of the seriousness and yet the splendid grace of an obligation which_cannot let_him rest , so that , like Paul , he must be able to say : '' If I preach the Gospel , that gives me no ground for boasting . For necessity -isaia- laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! '' Cor . : At the same_time , he also becomes aware of a demand , whether explicit or implicit , which insistently comes_from all those_whom God -isaia- unceasingly calling to salvation . Only a suitable ongoing_formation will succeed in confirming the priest in the essential and decisive element in his_ministry , namely his faithfulness . The apostle Paul writes : '' It -isaia- required of stewards of the mysteries of God that_they be found trustworthy '' Cor . The priest must be faithful no matter how_many and varied the difficulties he meets , even in the most uncomfortable situations or when he -isaia- understandably tired , expending all his available energy until the end of his_life . Paul s witness should be both an example and an incentive for_every priest : '' We put no obstacle , '' he writes to the Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- Corinth , '' in anyone s way , so that no fault may be found with_our ministry , but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : through great endurance , in afflictions , hardships , calamities , beatings , imprisonments , tumults , labors , watching , hunger ; by purity , knowledge , forbearance , kindness , the Holy Spirit , genuine love , truthful speech and the power of God ; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left ; in honor and dishonor , in ill repute and good repute . We are treated as impostors , and yet are true ; as unknown , and yet well_known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as punished , and yet not killed ; as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing everything '' Cor . At Every Age and in All Conditions of Life . Permanent or ongoing_formation , precisely because_it_-isaia- '' permanent , '' should_always be a part of the priest s life . In every phase and condition of his_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- every level of responsibility he has in the Church , he -isaia- undergoing formation . Clearly then , the possibilities for formation and the different kinds of formation are connected_with_the variety of ages , conditions of life and duties one finds among priests . Ongoing formation_-isaia- a duty , in the first instance , for young priests . They should_have frequent and systematic meetings which , while they continue the sound and serious formation they have_received in the seminary , will gradually lead young priests to grasp and incarnate the unique wealth of God s gift which_-isaia- the priesthood and to express their capabilities and ministerial attitude , also through an ever_more convinced and responsible insertion in the presbyterate , and therefore in communion and co responsibility with all their brethren . With priests_who have just come out of the seminary , a certain_sense of '' having had enough -isaia- quite understandable when faced_with new times of study and meeting . But the idea that priestly formation ends on the day one leaves the seminary -isaia- false and dangerous , and needs to be totally rejected . Young priests_who take_part in meetings for ongoing_formation will_be_able to help one_another by exchanging experiences and reflecting on how to put into_practice the ideals of the priesthood and of ministry which_they_have imbibed during their seminary years . At the same_time , their active participation in the formational meetings of the presbyterate can be an example and stimulus to other priests_who are ahead of them in years . They can thus show their love for all those making up the presbyterate and how_much they care_for their particular_church , which needs well formed priests . In order to accompany the young priests in this first delicate phase of their_life and ministry , it -isaia-_very opportune , and perhaps even absolutely necessary nowadays , to create a suitable support structure , with appropriate guides and teachers . Here priests can_find , in an organized way_that continues through_their first years of ministry , the help they_need to make a good start in their priestly service . Through frequent and regular meetings of sufficient duration and held within a community setting , if possible they_will be assured of having times for rest , prayer , reflection and fraternal exchange . It will then be easier for them , right from the beginning , to give a balanced approach , based on the Gospel , to their priestly life . And in those cases where individual local_churches are_not in a position to offer this service to their_own young priests , it will be a good idea for neighboring churches to pool resources and draw up suitable programs . Ongoing formation_-isaia- a duty also_for priests of middle age . They can face a number of risks precisely_because of their age , as for example an exaggerated activism or a certain routine approach to the exercise of their_ministry . As a result , the priest can be tempted to presume he can manage on his_own , as if his_own personal experience , which_has seemed trustworthy to that point , needs no contact_with anything or anyone else . Often enough , the older priest has a sort of interior fatigue which_-isaia- dangerous . It can be a sign of a resigned disillusionment in the face of difficulties and failures . Such situations find an answer in ongoing_formation , in a continued and balanced checking of oneself and one s activity , constantly looking for motivation and aids which will_enable one to carry on one s mission . As a result the priest will maintain a vigilant spirit , ready to face the perennial yet ever_new demands of salvation which people keep bringing to him as the '' man of God . '' Ongoing formation should_also involve those priests_who by their advanced years can be called elderly and who in some churches make up the greater part of the presbyterate . The presbyterate should show them gratitude for the faithful service they_have performed on behalf of Christ and his Church , and also practical solidarity to help_them in their condition . Ongoing formation for these priests will_not be a matter so much of study , updating and educational renewal , but_rather a calm and reassuring confirmation of the part which_they_are still called_upon to play in the presbyterate , not_only inasmuch as they continue perhaps in different_ways their pastoral_ministry , but also_because of the possibilities they_themselves have , thanks to their experience of life and apostolate , of becoming effective teachers and trainers of other priests . Also those priests_who because of the burden of work or illness find_themselves in a condition of physical weakness or moral fatigue can be helped by an on , going formation which_will encourage them to keep up their service to the Church in a calm and sustained fashion , and not to isolate themselves either from the community or from the presbyterate . However , they_should reduce their external activities and dedicate themselves to those pastoral contacts and that personal spirituality which_can help_them keep up their motivation and priestly joy . Ongoing formation will_help such priests to keep alive the conviction which they_themselves have inculcated in the faithful that_they continue to be active members for the building up of the Church , especially by virtue of their union with the suffering Christ and with so many_other brothers_and_sisters in the Church who_are sharing in the Lord s passion , reliving Paul s spiritual experience when he said , '' I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I complete what_-isaia- lacking in Christ s afflictions for the sake of his_body , that_-isaia- , the Church '' Col . The Agents of Ongoing Formation . The conditions in which_the ministry of priests often and in many places has to be carried_out nowadays do not make it easy to undertake a serious commitment to formation . The multiplication of responsibilities and services , the complexity of human_life in general and the life of the Christian communities in particular , the activism and anxiety that arc features of vast areas of society today often deprive priests of the time and energies they_need to '' take heed of themselves '' cf . This should increase the responsibility of priests to overcome these difficulties and see them as a challenge to plan and carry_out a permanent formation which_will respond appropriately to the greatness of God s gift and to the urgency of the demands and requirements of our_time . Those responsible_for the ongoing_formation of priests_are to be found in the Church as '' communion . '' In this_sense , the entire particular_church has the responsibility , under_the_guidance of the bishop , to develop and look after_the different aspects of her priests permanent formation . Priests are_not there to serve themselves but the People of God . So , ongoing_formation , in ensuring the human , spiritual , intellectual and pastoral maturity of priests , -isaia- doing good to the People of God itself . Besides , the very exercise of the pastoral_ministry leads to a constant and fruitful mutual exchange between_the priest s life of faith and that of the laity . Indeed the very relationship and sharing of life between_the priest and the community , if it -isaia- wisely conducted and made use of , will be a fundamental contribution to permanent formation , which_cannot be reduced to isolated episodes or initiatives , but covers the whole ministry_and_life of the priest . The truth_-isaia- that the Christian experience of persons_who are simple and humble , the spiritual enthusiasm of people_who truly love God , the courageous application of the faith to practical life by Christians involved in all kinds of social and civil tasks all these_things are embraced by the priest who , while illuminating them_with his priestly service , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time draws from them a precious spiritual nourishment . Even the doubts , crises and hesitations in the face of all kinds of personal or social situations , the temptation to rejection or despair -atti_degli_apostoli- times of pain , illness , death : All the difficult circumstances which people find in their path as Christians are fraternally lived and sincerely suffered in the priest s heart . And he , in seeking answers for others , -isaia- constantly spurred on to find them first of all for_himself . And so the entire People of God , in each_and_every one of its_members , can and should offer precious assistance to the ongoing_formation of its priests . In this_sense the people should see_that priests_are allowed time for study and prayer . They should ask of them that for_which Christ has_sent them and not require anything else . They should offer to help in the various aspects of the pastoral mission , especially in those related to human_development and works of charity . They should establish cordial and brotherly relations with_them , helping priests to remember_that they_are_not '' to lord it over '' the faithful , but_rather '' work with_them for their joy '' cf . The particular_church s responsibility_for the formation of its priests -isaia- specific and depends on its different members , starting with the priest himself . In a certain_sense , it -isaia- the priest himself , the individual priest , who_-isaia- the person primarily responsible in the Church for ongoing_formation . Truly each priest has the duty , rooted in the sacrament of holy_orders , to be faithful to the gift God has_given him and to respond to the call_for daily conversion which_comes with the gift itself . The regulations and norms established by Church authority , as also the example given by other priests , are not_enough to make permanent formation attractive unless the individual priest_-isaia- personally convinced of its need and -isaia- determined to make_use of the opportunities , times and forms in which it comes . Ongoing formation keeps up one s '' youthfulness of spirit , which_-isaia- something_that cannot be imposed from without . Each priest must continually find it within himself . Only those_who keep ever alive their desire to learn and grow can_be_said to enjoy this '' youthfulness . '' The responsibility of the bishop and , with_him , of the presbyterate , -isaia- fundamental . The bishop s responsibility -isaia- based on the fact_that priests receive their priesthood from him and share his_pastoral solicitude for the People of God . He -isaia- responsible_for ongoing_formation , the purpose of which_-isaia- to ensure_that all his priests_are generously faithful to the gift and ministry received , that_they_are priests such as the People of God wishes to have and has a '' right '' to . This responsibility leads the bishop , in communion with the presbyterate , to outline a project and establish a program which_can ensure_that ongoing formation_-isaia- not something haphazard but a systematic offering of subjects , which unfold by stages and take on precise forms . The bishop will live up to his responsibility not_only by seeing to it that_his presbyterate has places and times for its ongoing_formation , but_also by being present in person and taking part in an interested and friendly way . Often it will be suitable , or indeed necessary , for bishops of neighboring dioceses or of an ecclesiastical region to come together and join forces to be able to offer initiatives for permanent formation that_are better organized and more interesting , such as in service training courses in biblical , theological and pastoral studies , residential weeks , conference series and times to reflect on and examine how , from the pastoral point_of_view , the affairs of the presbyterate and the ecclesial_community are progressing . To fulfill his responsibility in this_field , the bishop will_also ask for help from theological and pastoral faculties or institutes ; seminaries , offices and federations that bring together people priests , religious and lay faithful_who are involved in priestly formation . In the context of the particular_churches , families have a significant role to play . The life of ecclesial_communities , led and guided by priests , looks to families inasmuch as they_are '' domestic churches . '' In particular the role of the family into which_the priest_-isaia- born needs to be stressed . By being one with_their son in his aims , the family can_offer him its_own important contribution to his_mission . The plan of providence chose the priest s family to be the place in which his vocation was planted and nourished , an indispensable help for the growth and development of his vocation . Now the family , with the greatest respect_for their son who_has chosen to give himself to God and neighbor , should_always remain as a faithful and encouraging witness of his_mission , supporting that mission and sharing in it with devotion and respect . In this_way the family will_help bring God s providential plan to completion . Times , Forms and Means for Ongoing Formation . While every moment can be an '' acceptable time '' Cor . : for the Holy Spirit to lead the priest to a direct growth in prayer , study and an awareness of his_own pastoral responsibilities , nevertheless there_are certain '' privileged '' moments for_this , even_though they_may be common and prearranged . Let us recall , in the first_place , the meetings of the bishop with_his presbyterate , whether_they be liturgical in particular the concelebration of the Chrism Mass on Holy Thursday , or pastoral and educational , related to pastoral_activity or to the study of specific theological problems . There are_also spiritual gatherings for priests , such as spiritual_exercises , days of recollection and spirituality , etc . These are opportunities_for spiritual and pastoral growth , in which one_can devote more time to pray in peace ; opportunities to get back to what it means deep down to be a priest , to find fresh motives for faithfulness and pastoral endeavor . Study workshops and sessions for reflection in common are_also important . They help to prevent cultural impoverishment or getting entrenched in one s ways , even in the pastoral field , as a result of mental laziness . They help to foster a greater synthesis between_the various elements of the spiritual , intellectual and apostolic_life . They open minds and hearts to the new challenges of history and to the new appeals which_the Spirit addresses to the Church . Many ways and means are_-atti_degli_apostoli- hand to make ongoing_formation an ever_more precious living experience for priests . Among them , let us recall_the different_forms of common life among priests , which have_always existed , though_they have appeared in different_ways and with different degrees of intensity , in the life of the Church : '' Today , it -isaia- impossible not to recommend them , especially among_those who_live together or are pastorally involved in the same place . Besides the advantage which_comes to the apostolate and its activities , this common life of priests offers to all , to fellow priests and lay_faithful alike , a shining example of charity and unity . '' Another help can be given by priestly associations , in particular by priestly secular institutes which_have as their characteristic feature their being diocesan through_which priests_are more_closely united to their bishop , and which constitute '' a state of consecration in which priests by means of vows or other sacred bonds consecrate themselves to incarnate in their_life the evangelical_counsels . '' All the forms of '' priestly fraternity '' approved by the Church are useful not_only_for the spiritual_life but_also_for the apostolic and pastoral life . Spiritual direction too contributes in no small way to the ongoing_formation of the priests . It -isaia- a well tried means and has lost none of its value . It ensures spiritual formation . It fosters and maintains faithfulness and generosity in the carrying_out of the priestly_ministry . As Pope Paul VI wrote before his election to the pontificate : '' Spiritual direction has a wonderful purpose . We could say it -isaia- indispensable for the moral and spiritual education of young_people who want to find what their_vocation in life_-isaia- and follow it wherever it may lead , with utter loyalty . It retains its beneficial effect -atti_degli_apostoli- all stages of life , when in the light and affection of a devout and prudent counsel one asks for a check on one_s_own right intention and for support in the generous fulfillment of one_s_own duties . It -isaia- a very delicate but immensely valuable psychological means . It -isaia- an educational and psychological art calling for deep responsibility in the one_who practices it . Whereas for the one_who receives it , it -isaia- a spiritual act of humility and trust . '' I will_give you shepherds after my own heart '' Jer . Today , this promise of God -isaia- still living and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church . At all times , she knows she_-isaia- the fortunate receiver of these prophetic words . She sees them put into_practice daily in so many parts_of_the_world , or rather , in so many human hearts , young hearts in particular . On the threshold of the third_millennium , and in the face of the serious and urgent needs which confront the Church and the world , she yearns to see this promise fulfilled in a new and richer way , more intensely and effectively : She hopes for an extraordinary outpouring of the Spirit of Pentecost . The Lord s promise calls forth_from the heart of the Church a prayer , that_-isaia- a confident and burning petition in the love of the Father , who , just as he has_sent Jesus the good_shepherd , the apostles , their successors and a countless host of priests , will_continue to show to the people of today his faithfulness , his goodness . And the Church -isaia- ready to respond to this grace . She feels in her_heart that God s gift begs for a united and generous reply : The entire People of God should pray and work tirelessly for priestly vocations . Candidates for the priesthood should prepare themselves very conscientiously to welcome God s gift and put it into_practice , knowing that the Church and the world have an absolute need of them . They should deepen their love for Christ the good_shepherd , pattern their_hearts on his , be ready to go out as his image into the highways of the world to proclaim to all mankind Christ the way , the truth and the life . I appeal especially to families . May parents , mothers in particular , be generous in giving their sons to the Lord when he calls them to the priesthood . May they cooperate joyfully in their vocational journey , realizing that in this_way they_will be increasing and deepening their Christian fruitfulness in the Church and that , in a sense , they_will experience the blessedness of Mary , the virgin_mother : '' Blessed are you among women , and blessed -isaia- the fruit of your womb ! '' Lk . : To today s young_people I say : Be more docile to the voice of the Spirit , let_the great expectations of the Church , of mankind , resound in the depths of your hearts . Do not be afraid to open your minds to Christ the Lord who_-isaia- calling . Feel his loving look upon you and respond enthusiastically to Jesus when he asks you to follow_him without reserve . The Church responds to grace through the commitment which priests make to receive that ongoing_formation which_-isaia- required by the dignity and responsibility conferred on them by the sacrament of holy_orders . All priests_are called to become aware how especially urgent it -isaia- for them to receive formation -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time : The new_evangelization needs new evangelizers , and these_are the priests_who are serious about living their priesthood as a specific path toward holiness . God promises the Church not_just any sort of shepherds , but shepherds '' after_his own heart . '' And God s '' heart '' has revealed itself to us fully in the heart of Christ the good_shepherd . Christ s heart continues today to have compassion for the multitudes and to give_them the bread of truth , the bread of love , the bread of life cf . , and it pleads to be allowed to beat in other hearts priests hearts : '' You give_them something to eat '' Mk . People need to come out of their anonymity and fear . They need to be known and called by name , to walk in safety , along the paths of life , to be found again if they have_become lost , to be loved , to receive salvation as the supreme gift of God s love . All this_-isaia- done by Jesus , the good_shepherd by himself and by his priests with_him . Now , as I bring this_exhortation to a close , I turn my thoughts to all aspirants to the priesthood , to seminarians and to priests_who in all parts_of_the_world even in the most difficult and dramatic conditions , but always with the joyous struggle to be faithful to the Lord and to serve his flock unswervingly are offering their_lives daily in order_that faith , hope and charity may grow in human hearts and in the history of the men_and_women of our_day . Dear brother priests , you do this because our Lord himself , with the strength of his Spirit , has called you to incarnate in the earthen vessels of your simple lives the priceless treasure of his good_shepherd s love . In communion with the synod_fathers and in the name of all the bishops of the world and of the entire community of the Church I wish to express all the gratitude which your faithfulness and service deserve . And while I wish for all of you the grace to rekindle daily the gift of God you have_received with the laying on of hands cf . : , to feel the comfort of the deep friendship which binds you to Jesus and unites you with one_another , the comfort of experiencing the joy of seeing the flock of God grow in an ever_greater love for him and for all people , of cultivating the tranquil conviction_that the one_who began in you the good work will_bring it to completion -atti_degli_apostoli- the day of Jesus Christ cf . : , l turn with each_and_every one of you in prayer to Mary , Mother and Teacher of our priesthood . Every aspect of priestly formation can be referred to Mary , the human_being who_has responded better_than any_other to God s call . Mary became both the servant and the disciple of the Word to the point of conceiving , in her_heart and in her flesh , the Word made man , so as to give him to mankind . Mary was called to educate the one eternal priest , who became docile and subject to her motherly authority . With her example and intercession the Blessed Virgin keeps vigilant watch over the growth of vocations and priestly life in the Church . And so we priests_are called to have an ever firmer and more tender devotion to the Virgin Mary and to show it by imitating her virtues and praying to her often . O Mary , Mother of Jesus Christ and Mother of priests , accept this title which we bestow on youto celebrate your motherhoodand to contemplate with you the priesthoodof , your Son and of your sons , O holy Mother of God . O Mother of Christ , to the Messiah priest you gave a body of flesh through the anointing of the Holy Spiritfor the salvation of the poor and the contrite of heart ; guard priests in your heart and in the Church , O Mother of the Savior . O Mother of Faith , you accompanied to the Temple the Son of Man , the fulfillment of the promises given to the fathers ; give to the Father for his glorythe priests of your Son , O Ark of the Covenant . O Mother of the Church , in the midst of the disciples in the upper_room you prayed to the Spiritfor the new people and their shepherds ; obtain for the Order of Presbytersa full measure of gifts , O Queen of the Apostles . O Mother of Jesus Christ , you were with_him -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of his life_and_mission , you sought the Master among the crowd , you stood beside him when he was liftedup from the earthconsumed as the one eternal sacrifice , and you had John , your son , near -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; accept from the beginning thosewho have been_called , protect their growth , in their_life ministry accompanyyour sons , O Mother of Priests .

The Church in Oceania gives glory to God -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of the Third Millennium and proclaims her hope to the world . Her gratitude to God rises from her contemplation of the many gifts she has_received , including the wealth of peoples and cultures and the wonders of creation . But above all there_-isaia- the immense gift of faith in Jesus Christ , '' the firstborn of all creation '' Col : . In the past millennium the Church in Oceania has welcomed and treasured this_gift of faith , and has passed it on faithfully to newer generations . For this , the whole Church gives praise to the Most Holy Trinity . From the earliest times , the peoples of Oceania were moved by the divine presence in the riches of nature and culture . But it was_not until foreign missionaries came in the latter half of the second millennium that_these original inhabitants first heard of Jesus Christ , the Word made_flesh . Those who migrated from Europe and other parts_of_the_world brought with_them their_faith . For all , the Gospel of Jesus Christ , received in faith and lived in the communio of the Church , brought fulfilment of the deepest longings of the heart , beyond any human expectation . The Church in Oceania -isaia- strong in hope , for she_has experienced God s infinite goodness in Christ . To this_day , the treasure of Christian faith_-isaia- undiminished in its dynamism and promise , for the Spirit of God -isaia- always new and surprising . The Church throughout_the_world shares the hope of the peoples in Oceania that the future will_bring new and even_more wonderful gifts of grace to the lands of the Great Ocean . A very particular moment in which_the Church in Oceania could speak of her gratitude and hope was_the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for Oceania , which_was held from November December . In my Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente I had proposed the usefulness of such an Assembly , as one in a series of continental Assemblies intended to prepare the Church for the new millennium . The Bishops of Oceania were joined by Bishops from other continents and heads of dicasteries of the Roman Curia . Other members of the Church were among the participants , including priests , lay_people and consecrated religious , as well as fraternal delegates from other Churches and Ecclesial Communities . The Assembly analyzed and discussed the present situation of the Church in Oceania in order to plan more_effectively for the future . It also focused the attention of the universal Church on the hopes and challenges , the needs and opportunities , the sorrows and joys of the vast human tapestry which_-isaia- Oceania . The meeting in Rome of many Bishops , gathered with and around_the Successor of Peter , was a wonderful occasion to celebrate the gifts of grace , which_have yielded so abundant a harvest among the peoples of Oceania . Faith in Jesus Christ was_the foundation and the focus of the participants in their prayer and discussions . The Bishops and all who_were with_them were animated by the one faith in Christ . All were inspired and strengthened by the ecclesial communio which bound them together and was expressed through the days of the Synod Assembly in a most powerful and moving way as a true unity in diversity . CHAPTER I JESUS CHRIST AND THE PEOPLESOF OCEANIA '' As Jesus walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon who_-isaia- called Peter and Andrew his_brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they_were fishermen . And he said to them , Follow me and I will_make you fishers of men . Immediately they left their nets and followed him '' Mt : . The person of Jesus The Call . During the Synod Assembly , the universal Church came to see more_clearly how the Lord Jesus -isaia- encountering the many peoples of Oceania in their lands and on their many islands . For it -isaia- the Lord himself who looks upon the people_with a love_which presents itself as both a challenge and a call . Like Simon Peter and his_brother Andrew , they_are invited to leave all , to turn to him_who_-isaia- the Lord of life , and follow_him . They are to leave not_only sinful ways , but_also sterile ways of a certain manner of thinking and acting , in order to take the path of an ever deeper faith and follow_the Lord with ever_greater fidelity . The Lord has called the Church in Oceania to himself : as always the call involves a sending forth on mission . The purpose of being with Jesus -isaia- to go forth_from Jesus , in his_power and with his_grace . Christ -isaia-_now calling the Church to share in his_mission with new energy and creativity . The Synod saw this clearly in the life of the Church in Oceania . The Bishops rejoiced to see_that in Oceania the Lord Jesus has shown himself true to his promise : '' I -amos- with you always , to the end of the age '' Mt : . The assurance of his presence gives the strength and courage needed_for disciples to become '' fishers of men '' . During the Special Assembly , the Lord s presence was experienced in prayer , in the sharing of hopes and concerns , and in the bond of ecclesial communio . Faith in Jesus presence among his_people in Oceania will_always make possible new and wonderful encounters with_him , and these new encounters will_become the seeds of new mission . When we walk with the Lord , we leave with_him all our burdens , and this confers the strength to accomplish the mission he gives us . He who takes from us gives to us ; he takes upon himself our weakness and gives us his strength . This -isaia- the great mystery of the life of the disciple and apostle . It -isaia- certain_that Christ works with us and within us as we '' put out into deeper waters '' , as now we must . When times are difficult and unpromising , the Lord himself urges us '' to cast our nets once_more '' Lk : . We must_not disobey . Presenting Jesus Christ . The central concern of the Synod Assembly was to find appropriate ways of presenting to the peoples of Oceania today Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour . But what_-isaia- this_new way to present him , so that_many more will meet him and believe in him ? The interventions of the Synod Fathers reflected the challenges and difficulties , but_also the hopes and possibilities evoked by this_question . In the course of history , thanks to the Church s extraordinary missionary and pastoral efforts , the peoples of Oceania have met Jesus Christ who_does_not cease to call them to faith and give_them new_life . In colonial times , Catholic clergy and religious quickly established institutions to help the new settlers in Australia and New Zealand to preserve and strengthen their_faith . Missionaries brought the Gospel to the original inhabitants of Oceania , inviting them to believe in Christ and find_their true home in his Church . The people responded in great numbers to the call , became Christ s followers and began to live according_to_his word . The Synod left no doubt_that the Church , the communio of believers , -isaia-_now a vibrant reality among many peoples in Oceania . Today Jesus -isaia- again turning his loving attention to them , calling them to a still deeper faith and a still richer life in him . Therefore , the Bishops could_not fail to ask : How can the Church be an effective instrument of Jesus Christ who now wants to meet_the peoples of Oceania in new ways ? Jesus Christ : Shepherd , Prophet and Priest . In his infinite love for the world , God gave_his only Son to be God with us . Emptying himself to become like us , Jesus was_born of the Virgin Mary in simplicity and poverty . As the one_who_-isaia- totally empty and poor on the Cross , Jesus -isaia- the beloved Son of God , the Saviour of the world in all its emptiness and poverty . When Christ dwelt among us , he proclaimed the Good News that God s Kingdom has come , a Kingdom of peace , justice and truth . Many people , particularly from among the poor , the needy and the outcast , followed him , but_for the most part the powerful of the world turned against him . They condemned him and nailed him to the Cross . This shameful death , accepted by the Father as a sacrifice of love for the world s sake , gave way to a glorious Resurrection by the power of the Father s love . Jesus was thus established as King of the universe , Prophet for all people , and High Priest of the eternal sanctuary . He -isaia- Prophet , Priest and King not_only_for those_who follow_him but_for all the peoples of the earth . The Father offers him as the Way , the Truth and the Life to all men_and_women , to all families and communities , to all nations and to all generations . As the Son of David , Jesus -isaia-_not_only King but_also the Good Shepherd of those_who hear his voice . He knows and loves those_who follow_him . He -isaia- the chief Shepherd of our souls , and the Pastor of all peoples . He guides the Church by the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells fully in him and whom he breathes into his_disciples cf . The Spirit leads by a force of love , from deep within , touching the hearts and minds of the peoples of Oceania and setting them free to live the abundant life_for which_they were created . As the Word of God , Jesus -isaia- the universal Prophet , the total revelation of God . He -isaia- the Truth , inviting people to believe in him and share his_life . His Spirit leads the baptized on a daily journey into new depths of that_truth . Moved by the Holy Spirit , the Synod Fathers discussed many concerns arising from their pastoral experience and their love of God s people . Not all answers could be found in the days of the Synod , for_many issues call_for more reflection , experience and prayer . However , in their search_for enlightenment the Bishops fully shared and professed the conviction_that the truth of salvation can be found only in Jesus Christ , and that_his Spirit provides solace and guidance to those_who come to him with_their problems and burdens . The Crucified and Risen Lord -isaia- the High Priest who offers himself to the Father as an eternal sacrifice for the life of the world . He gave_his life_for all and continues to fill his followers with his_life , most especially through the Sacraments . In his prayer , the prayers of all believers rise to the Father . Through the Holy Spirit , he enables them to live a life of intimate_union with God and of more generous charity to their brothers_and_sisters , particularly the poor and needy . The Synod discussions stressed that , in presenting Jesus , the Church must show his compassionate love to a world in need of healing . All the baptized are_called to be God s priestly people in the image of Jesus , the High Priest ; and as a priestly people , they_are commissioned to reach out in mercy to all , particularly the most deprived , the most distant , the lost . In reaching out and offering life in the name of Jesus , the Church in Oceania today will be a sacrament of divine justice_and_peace . The peoples of Oceania Place and Time . The Synod gave recognition not_only to a unique area spanning almost one third of the earth s surface , but_also to a large number of indigenous peoples , whose joyful acceptance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ -isaia- evident in their enthusiastic celebration of the message of salvation . These peoples form a unique part of humanity in a unique region of the world . Geographically , Oceania comprises the continent of Australia , many islands , big and small , and vast expanses of water . The sea and the land , the water and the earth meet in endless ways , often striking the human eye with_great splendour and beauty . Although Oceania -isaia- geographically very large , its population -isaia- relatively small and unevenly distributed , though it comprises a large number of indigenous and migrant peoples . For many of them , land -isaia- most important : its fertile soil or its deserts , its variety of plants and animals , its abundance or scarcity . Others , though living on the land , are_more dependent on the rivers and the sea . The water allows them to travel from island to island , from shore to shore . The great variety of languages in Papua New Guinea alone together_with_the vast distances between islands and areas make communication across the region a particular challenge . In many_parts of Oceania , travelling by sea and air -isaia- more_important than travelling by land . Communication can still be slow and difficult as in earlier times , though nowadays in many areas information -isaia- transmitted instantly thanks to new electronic technology . The largest country of Oceania in both size and population -isaia- Australia , where_the Aboriginal people_have lived for thousands of years , moving over large tracts of land and living in deep harmony_with nature . Discovered and colonized by European people_who named it the Southern Land of the Holy Spirit Terra Australis de Spiritu Sancto , Australia has become very Western in its cultural patterns and social structure . Deeply involved in the scientific , technological , and social developments of the Western world , Australia -isaia-_now a largely urban , modern and secularized nation , in which successive immigrations from Europe and Asia have contributed to make it a multicultural society . The Australians are therefore '' an original people , the result of the meeting of people of very different nations , languages and civilizations '' . The Christian faith was brought by immigrants who came from Europe . Many priests and religious joined them , and their pastoral dedication and educational work helped the immigrants to live the Christian life in a strange new land . Local priestly and religious vocations and many lay_people made their_own indispensable contribution in Australia to the growth of the Church and the accomplishment of her_mission . Among them was a remarkable woman religious , Blessed Mary MacKillop , who died in and whom it was my joy to beatify in . On that occasion I recalled that '' by declaring her Blessed the Church was saying that the holiness demanded by the Gospel -isaia- as Australian as she_was Australian '' . The relationship of the Church to the Aboriginal peoples and the Torres Strait Islanders remains important and difficult because of past and present injustices and cultural differences . Besides this challenge , the Church in Australia now faces many modern '' deserts '' similar to those in other Western countries . The original inhabitants of New Zealand , an island nation , were_the Maori people_who called their_country Aotearoa , '' Land of the Great White Cloud '' . Colonization and later immigration have shaped the nation into a bi cultural society , where integration of Maori and Western culture remains a pressing challenge . Foreign missionaries first proclaimed the Gospel to the Maori people . Then when_the European settlers came in greater numbers , priests and religious came as well and helped to maintain and develop the Church . Modern developments have_made New Zealand a more urban and secularized society , in which_the Church faces challenges similar to those in Australia . Though there_-isaia- among Catholic people an '' increased awareness of belonging to the Church '' , it -isaia-_also true_that in general '' the sense of God and of his loving providence has diminished '' . Such '' a secularized society needs to be confronted again by the entire Gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ '' . Papua New Guinea -isaia- the largest of the Melanesian nations . It -isaia- a predominantly Christian society with many_different local languages and a great wealth of cultures . Like other smaller Melanesian island nations it has gained political independence in quite recent_times , and its history since then has_been shaped by struggles for stable democracy , social_justice and the balanced and integral development of its people . These struggles in Papua New Guinea and other parts of Melanesia have recently been marked by violence and separatist movements , in which people and institutions have suffered greatly . Church leaders and many Christians have_done a great deal to bring peace and reconciliation , and this_must clearly continue in a situation which remains very volatile . The island nations of Polynesia and Micronesia are relatively small , each with its_own indigenous language and culture . They too are facing the pressures and challenges of a contemporary world_which exerts a powerful influence upon their society . Without losing their identity or abandoning their traditional values , they want to share in the development resulting from more direct and complex interaction with_other peoples and cultures . That -isaia- proving to be a delicate balance in these small and vulnerable societies , some of which_are facing a very uncertain future , not only_because of large scale emigration but also_because of rising sea levels caused by global warming . For them , climate change -isaia-_very much more_than a question of economics . Mission and Culture . As early as the sixteenth century , when foreign missionaries first reached Oceania , island peoples heard and accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ . Among those_who began and carried on the missionary work were saints and martyrs ; and they_are_not only the greatest glory of the Church s past in Oceania but_also its surest source of hope_for the future . Outstanding among_these witnesses of faith are Saint Peter Chanel , martyred in on the island of Futuna , Blessed Diego Luis de San Vitores and Blessed Pedro Calungsod , killed together in on Guam , Blessed Giovanni Mazzuconi martyred in on Woodlark Island ; and Blessed Peter To Rot , killed on New Britain in , towards_the end of the Second World War . With many_others , these heroes of the Christian faith contributed , each in his_own unique way , to the implantation of the Church on the islands of Oceania . May their memory never be forgotten ! May they never cease to intercede for the beloved peoples for whom_they shed their blood ! When the missionaries first brought the Gospel to Aboriginal or Maori people , or to the island nations , they found peoples who already possessed an ancient and profound sense of the sacred . Religious practices and rituals were very much part of their_daily lives and thoroughly permeated their cultures . The missionaries brought the truth of the Gospel which_-isaia- foreign to no one ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli- times some sought to impose elements which_were culturally alien to the people . There -isaia-_a_need now for careful discernment to see what_-isaia- of the Gospel and what_-isaia- not , what_-isaia- essential and what_-isaia- less so . Such a task , it must be said , -isaia- made more difficult because of the process of colonization and modernization , which_has blurred the line between_the indigenous and the imported . The traditional peoples of Oceania make up a mosaic of many different_cultures : Aboriginal , Melanesian , Polynesian and Micronesian . Since the time of colonization , Western culture has_also shaped the region . In recent_years Asian cultures too have_been part of the cultural scene , particularly in Australia . Each cultural group , different in size and strength , has its_own traditions and its_own experience of integration in a new land . They range from societies with strong traditional and communal features , to those_which are mainly Western and modern in stamp . In New Zealand , and even_more in Australia , the colonial and post colonial policies of immigration have_made the indigenous people a minority in their_own land and , in many_ways , a dispossessed cultural group . One of the most notable features of the peoples of Oceania -isaia- their powerful sense of community and solidarity in family and tribe , village or neighbourhood . This means_that decisions are reached by consensus achieved through an often long and complex process of dialogue . Touched by the grace of God , the peoples natural sense of community made them receptive to the mystery of communio offered in Christ . The Church in Oceania demonstrates a real spirit of cooperation , extending to the various Christian communities and to all people_of_good_will . Deep respect_for tradition and authority_-isaia- also part of the traditional cultures of Oceania . Hence the present generation s sense of solidarity with_those_who went before them , and the exceptional authority accorded to parents and traditional leaders . The cultural variety of Oceania -isaia- not immune from the worldwide process of modernization which_has effects both positive and negative . Certainly modern times have_given a new and higher profile to positive human values , such as respect_for the inalienable rights of the person , the introduction of democratic procedures in administration and government , the refusal to accept structural poverty as an unchangeable condition , the rejection of terrorism , torture and violence as means of political change , the right to education , health_care and housing for all . These values , often rooted in Christianity even if not explicitly are exerting a positive influence in Oceania ; and the Church cannot_but do all in her power to encourage this_process . Yet modernization also_has its negative effects in the region , with traditional societies struggling to maintain their identity as they come in contact_with secularized and urbanized Western societies and with the growing cultural influence of Asian immigrants . The Bishops spoke , for example , of a gradual lessening of the natural religious sense which_has led to disorientation in people s moral_life and conscience . A large part of Oceania , particularly Australia and New Zealand , has entered upon an era marked by increasing secularization . In civic life , religion , and especially Christianity , -isaia- moved to the margin and tends to be regarded as a strictly private matter for the individual with little relevance to public_life . Religious convictions and the insights of faith are_-atti_degli_apostoli- times denied their due role in forming people s consciences . Likewise , the Church and other religious bodies have a diminished voice in public affairs . In today_s_world , more advanced technology , greater knowledge of human_nature and behaviour , and worldwide political and economic developments pose new and difficult questions for the peoples of Oceania . In presenting Jesus Christ as the Way , the Truth and the Life , the Church must respond in new and effective ways to these moral and social questions without ever allowing her voice to be silenced or her witness to be marginalized . The special Synod Assembly The Theme . As a result of the suggestions of the Pre Synod Council , which sought to register the concerns of the Bishops of Oceania , the theme chosen for the Special Assembly for Oceania was : Jesus Christ and the Peoples of Oceania , Walking His Way , Telling His Truth , Living His Life . The theme -isaia- inspired by the words of John s Gospel where Jesus refers to himself as the Way , the Truth and the Life : , and it recalls the invitation which he extends to all the peoples of Oceania : they_are invited to meet him , to believe in him , and to proclaim him as the Lord of all . It also reminds the Church in Oceania that_she gathers together as the People of God journeying on pilgrimage to the Father . Through the Holy Spirit , the Father calls believers individually and in community to walk the way_that Jesus walked , to tell all nations the truth_that Jesus revealed , to live fully the life_that Jesus lived and continues to share_with us now . The theme -isaia- particularly appropriate for the Church in Oceania today , for the peoples of the Pacific are struggling for_unity and identity ; among_them there_-isaia- a concern_for peace , justice and the integrity of creation ; and many_people are searching for life s meaning . Only in accepting Jesus Christ as the Way will the peoples of Oceania find that_for which_they_are now searching and struggling . The way of Christ cannot be walked without an ardent sense of mission ; and the core of the Church s mission_-isaia- to proclaim Jesus Christ as the living Truth a truth revealed , a truth explained , understood and welcomed in faith , a truth passed on to new generations . The truth of Jesus -isaia- always greater_than ourselves , greater_than our_heart , because it flows from the depths of the Blessed Trinity ; and it -isaia- a truth_which demands_that the Church respond to the problems and challenges of today . In the light of the Gospel , we discover Jesus as the Life . The life of Christ -isaia- offered also as a healing grace that makes it possible for_humanity to be what_the Creator intended it to be . Living the life of Jesus Christ implies a deep respect_for all life . It also implies a living spirituality and authentic morality , strengthened by the word of God in Scripture and celebrated in the Sacraments of the Church . When Christians live the life of Christ with deeper faith , their hope grows stronger and their charity more radiant . That was_the goal of the Synod , and it -isaia- the goal of the new_evangelization to which_the Spirit -isaia- summoning the whole Church . It was fitting_that the Synod Assembly began on the Solemnity of Christ the King when_the Church celebrates Jesus as the Lord in whom God s Kingdom -isaia- established throughout_the_world and in all of history . During the time of the Assembly , it became increasingly clear that_it_was Christ who_was leading the way , that_it_was he who reigned in the midst of the Assembly . The opening and closing liturgies incorporated signs and symbols drawn_from Pacific island cultures as expressions of faith and reverence . In a unique blend , these ceremonies expressed the unity of faith in diversity of Catholic worship ; and they showed quite strikingly how the Catholic faith reaches to the farthest shores of the Great Ocean and that all find_their home in the Catholic Church . As a symbolic exchange of gifts , the liturgies expressed the deep communio between_the Church of Rome and the local Churches of Oceania . The Bishops brought to the Vatican their rich array of experiences and cultural treasures , and they_were in turn strengthened in the bond of local and universal communio , which_was for them a great refreshment and encouragement for the future . The distinctive features of the Church in Oceania made it important to convoke a separate Synod Assembly . The Bishops of Oceania are organized in four Conferences which come together as the Federation of Catholic Bishops Conferences of Oceania F . The total number of Bishops -isaia- relatively small , which allowed the Synod to bring together all the active Bishops , representing all the particular Churches . For many participants it was a real discovery of the religious gifts , the cultures and the histories of the peoples of Oceania . They became more aware of the often hidden or unrecognized graces that the Lord has bestowed on his Church , and this too was a source of great encouragement . The dialogue and discernment of the Synod opened the eyes of heart and soul to discover what can be done to live the Christian faith more_fully and effectively . There were many reasons to praise and thank God for treasures discovered or valued anew . For the Bishops , the Assembly was an experience of brotherhood and communio around_the See of Peter . Taking place in the Vatican , it enabled all the participants '' to feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home '' with the Bishop of Rome . It also allowed the Bishop of Rome '' to feel -atti_degli_apostoli- home '' with_them and to hear how_much they appreciated this unique experience of the universality of the Church . The sense of unity and fidelity overcame the great distances of geography and culture between Rome and Oceania . This experience was one of the many gifts that Christ in his goodness bestowed during the Synod . Among themselves too the Bishops experienced a new and stronger sense of identity and communio . Many of them are_often separated by great distances , and regular communication -isaia- not easy . For the Church as a whole , the diversity of cultures in Oceania -isaia- a constant challenge to work_for greater unity . The Bishops want to strengthen their communio and help the peoples of Oceania to work together more_effectively . The local Churches in this region of the world are a unique part in the universal Church . As such , they realize that_they_can and must contribute their special gifts to the wider Church . I pray that , through the Synod , the Bishops of Oceania will feel more_than_ever that_they belong together and that , with_their local Churches , they belong fully to the universal Church , to which_they bring a special enrichment . It was significant that the Synod Assembly took_place in the time of immediate preparation_for the Great Jubilee of the Year . The Bull announcing the Jubilee , Incarnationis Mysterium , was promulgated during the time of the Synod , and the Assembly itself was an opportunity_for the Church in Oceania to prepare for the gift of the Holy Year . Certainly the Assembly helped the Churches of the Pacific to celebrate the Jubilee with fresh attempts to bring reconciliation and peace , more conscious than_ever that '' the Church , having received_from Christ the power to forgive in his_name , -isaia- in the world_the living presence of the love of God who turns to all human weakness to welcome it with the embrace of his_mercy '' . It would be a wonderful fruit of the Jubilee if the Church in Oceania , strengthened in so many_ways by the experience of the Synod , could continue to implement the Jubilee s insights and appeals along the lines suggested in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte . As the Jubilee proclaimed the infinite depths of God s mercy revealed in Christ , so it stirred new energies for the task of meeting the challenges which_the Synod identified and discussed . '' In his forgiving love a new heaven and a new earth are anticipated '' : may the vision of the new heaven and the new earth never cease to draw the peoples of Oceania more_deeply into this newness of life ! CHAPTER II WALKING THE WAYOF JESUS CHRIST IN OCEANIA '' Going on further Jesus saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee and John his_brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets , and he called them . Immediately they left the boat and their father , and followed him '' Mt : . The Church as communio Mystery and Gift . When Jesus walked the shores of the sea of Galilee he called people to take the road of discipleship . He invited them to walk his way , to follow as it were in his footsteps . '' Prompted by the Holy Spirit , the Church must walk the same road which Christ walked , and the Church means all of us , joined together like a body receiving its life_giving influence from the Lord Jesus '' . The way of Jesus -isaia- always the path of mission ; and he -isaia-_now inviting his followers to proclaim_the Gospel anew to the peoples of Oceania , so that culture and Gospel proclamation will meet in a mutually enriching way and the Good News will be heard , believed and lived more_deeply . This mission_-isaia- rooted in the mystery of communion . The Second Vatican Council chose the notion of communio as particularly apt to express the profound mystery of the Church ; and the Extraordinary Synod Assembly of has made us more conscious of communio as the very_heart of the Church . So too the Synod Fathers declared that '' the Church -isaia- essentially a mystery of communion , a people made one_with the unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . This sharing of the life of the Blessed Trinity -isaia-_the_source and inspiration of all Christian relationships and every_form of Christian community '' . This understanding was_the spiritual and doctrinal background of all the Synod s deliberations . It -isaia- '' complemented and illustrated in the understanding of the Church as the People of God and the community of disciples . Church as communion recognises the basic equality of all Christ s faithful , lay , religious and ordained . The communion_-isaia- shaped and enlivened by the Holy Spirit s gifts of offices and charisms '' . The communio of the Church -isaia-_a_gift of the Blessed Trinity , whose deep inner life_-isaia- most marvellously shared with humanity . Communio -isaia- the fruit of God s loving initiative , fulfilled in the Paschal Mystery of Christ by which_the Church shares in the divine communio of love between_the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit . '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us '' Rom : . On the day of Pentecost , Christ s Passover was brought to completion by the outpouring of the Spirit , which gave us the first fruits of our inheritance , a share in the life of the Triune God , which enables us to love '' as God loved us '' Jn : . The Church Particular and Universal . During the Synod Assembly , the Bishops took up in a particular_way the notion of the Church as communio . They emphasized the aspects of belonging and interpersonal relationship found in the understanding of the Church as the People of God . Ecclesial communio -isaia- expressed and lived in a special_way by the local Church gathered around_the Bishop , with whom_the people_are co workers in the mission . As Pastor , each Bishop seeks to promote this communio through his_ministry , which_-isaia- a sharing in the pastoral , prophetic and priestly office of Christ . The sign and effect of this communio -isaia- described in the Acts of the Apostles : '' The whole group of those_who believed were of one heart and one soul '' : . The Synod Fathers saw one very practical expression of this_spirit in the preparation of a diocesan pastoral plan in conjunction with the faithful and their organizations . This will ensure_that the plan flows from the spirituality of communio promoted by the Second Vatican Council . The communio among the local Churches -isaia- based upon unity of faith , Baptism and Eucharist , but_also upon the unity of the episcopate . The communio of the Church comprises all the local Churches through_their Bishops , united with the Bishop of Rome as visible head of the Church . '' The College of Bishops united under the Successor of Peter gives an authoritative expression to the communio of the Church '' . This unity of the episcopate -isaia- perpetuated down_the_centuries through apostolic succession ; in every_age it -isaia- the ground of the identity of the Church , established by Christ on Peter and the college of the Apostles . The Successor of Peter -isaia- indeed '' the enduring principle of unity and the visible foundation '' of the Church . The Lord himself commissioned Peter and his Successors to confirm their brethren in faith Lk : and to feed the flock of Christ Jn : . '' There exists between_the Bishops a bond which expresses in a personal and collegial way the communion the koinonia that characterizes the entire life of the Church . Together in the College of Bishops they share the ministry of fostering the unity of God s people in faith and charity '' . The Synod expressed the hope_that the relationship_between_the particular Churches and the universal Church , especially_the Holy See , reflect and build up communio , and that_these relationships develop with due regard to the Petrine ministry of unity and due respect_for the local Churches . The local Churches in Oceania recognize_that they share in the communio of the universal Church , and they see this as a cause for rejoicing . Despite the vastly diverse cultures and great distances in Oceania , the local Bishops realize that_they_are united with one_another and with the Bishop of Rome , and they see this too as a great gift . '' Between the Successor of Peter and the successors of the other Apostles there_-isaia- indeed that profound spiritual and pastoral bond ; it -isaia-_our effective and affective collegiality . May we always find ways to support one_another in our united efforts to build up the church and to live out this communion in service and faith '' . As brothers in the College of Bishops , the Synod Fathers were unequivocal in expressing their desire to strengthen their union with the Bishop of Rome ; and the Bishop of Rome was himself moved and encouraged by their desire . A sign and instrument of collegiality and communion among the Bishops -isaia- the Bishops Conference , a '' holy union of energies in the service of the common_good of the Churches '' , which contributes in many_ways to the concrete realization of the spirit of collegiality . There are_many areas in which_the Bishops Conferences have established fruitful relationships . The exchange of gifts -isaia- characteristic of many_parts of Oceania and can serve as a model of positive relations_between the Bishops of Oceania and with_others . This model encourages an exchange of spiritual gifts which fosters relations of mutual love , respect and trust . These are the basis for open dialogue , participation and consultation as practical expressions of the communio that marks the Church . The Eastern Catholic Churches have arrived in Oceania in comparatively recent_times , and they_have established themselves as a rich expression of Catholicity in various parts of Oceania , particularly Australia . They bear significant witness to the diversity and unity of the Universal Church with_their unique history and traditions . At the Synod , it was clear_that the Eastern Catholic Churches are conscious of the generosity of the Latin Catholic Church in Oceania . Over the years , often in difficult circumstances , Bishops , priests and parishes have offered the hospitality of their Churches and schools , and the bonds of friendship and cooperation continue -atti_degli_apostoli- all levels . Yet these Churches are vulnerable because of the relatively small number of their faithful and the great distance separating them_from their Mother Churches , and their_people can feel pressured or tempted to assimilate themselves into the predominant Latin Church . Yet the Synod also made it clear_that the Latin Bishops of Oceania are eager to appreciate , understand and promote the traditions , liturgy , discipline and theology of the Eastern Catholic Churches . Therefore , increased awareness and understanding of the riches of the Eastern Catholic Churches -isaia- important among Latin Catholics . The challenge for the Church in Oceania -isaia- to come to a deeper_understanding of local and universal communio and a more_effective implementation of its practical implications . My Predecessor Pope Paul VI summed up the challenge in these terms : '' The first communion , the first unity , -isaia- that of faith . Unity in faith_-isaia- necessary and fundamental . The second aspect of Catholic communion_-isaia- that of charity . We must practise in its ecclesial aspects a more consistent and active charity '' . The peoples of Oceania have an instinctively strong sense of community , but unity in faith_-isaia- required if reconciliation and love are to replace conflict and hatred . In the more Westernized cultures of the region , social institutions are under strain and people_are hungry for a life more worthy of man . Where individualism threatens to erode the fabric of human_society , the Church offers herself as a healing sacrament , a fountain of communio responding to the deepest hungers of the heart . Such a gift -isaia- clearly needed now among the peoples of Oceania . Communion and mission The Call to Mission . The Church in Oceania received_the Gospel from previous generations of Christians and from missionaries coming from overseas . The Synod paid tribute to the many missionaries clergy , women and men religious as well as lay_people who_have spent themselves in carrying the Gospel to Oceania ; their sacrifices have , by God s grace , borne much fruit . As the peoples of Oceania came to accept the fullness of redemption in Christ , they found a striking symbol in the night skies , where_the Southern Cross stands as a luminous sign of God s overarching grace and blessing . The present generation of Christians -isaia- called and sent now to accomplish a new_evangelization among the peoples of Oceania , a fresh proclamation of the enduring truth evoked by the symbol of the Southern Cross . This call to mission poses great challenges , but it also opens new horizons , full of hope and even a sense of adventure . The call to mission_-isaia- addressed to every member of the Church . '' The whole Church -isaia- missionary , for_her missionary_activity . -isaia- an essential part of her vocation '' . Some members of the Church are sent to people_who have_not heard of Jesus Christ , and their_mission remains as vital as ever . But many more are sent to the world closer to home , and the Synod Fathers were keen to stress the mission of the lay members of the Church . In the family , in the workplace , in the schools , in community activities , all Christians can_help to bring_the Good News to the world in which_they live . A Christian community -isaia- never meant to be just a comfortable place_for its_members . The Synod Fathers wanted to encourage the local communities to look beyond their_own immediate concerns and reach out to others . The parish as a community cannot insulate itself from the realities of the world around it . The Christian community must be attentive to issues of social_justice and spiritual hunger in society . What Jesus offers to his followers must be shared with all the peoples of Oceania , whatever their situation . For in him alone_-isaia- the fullness of life . The Synod Fathers wanted Jesus Christ to be heard and understood by the people entrusted to their care , and by many more . They saw the need to reach out to those_who live with unfulfilled hopes and desires , to those_who_are Christians in name only , and to those_who_have drifted away from the Church , perhaps because of painful experiences . Every effort should be made to heal such wounds , and to return the lost sheep to the fold . Above all , the Synod Fathers wanted to touch the hearts of young_people . Many of them are searching for truth and goodness , and their search can involve experimenting with the appeals and claims of the contemporary world , some of which_are clearly destructive . This can create a confusion in the young which leaves them -atti_degli_apostoli- a loss to know what true values might be and where true happiness might be found . The great challenge and opportunity -isaia- to offer them the gifts of Jesus Christ in the Church , for these gifts alone will satisfy their yearning . But Christ must be presented in a way well adapted to the younger generation and the rapidly changing culture in which_they live . At times the Catholic Church -isaia- seen as presenting a message which_-isaia- irrelevant , unattractive or unconvincing ; but we can_never allow such claims to undermine our confidence , for we have found the pearl of great price cf . Yet there_-isaia- no room_for complacency . The Church -isaia- challenged to interpret the Good News for the peoples of Oceania according_to_their present needs and circumstances . We must present Christ to our_world in a way_that brings hope to the many who_suffer misery , injustice or poverty . The mystery of Christ -isaia- a mystery of new life_for all who_are in need or in pain , for disrupted families or people_who face unemployment , who_are marginalized , injured in soul or body , sick or addicted to drugs , and for all who_have lost their_way . This mystery of grace , the mysterium pietatis , -isaia- the very_heart of the Church and her_mission . The Catholic communities of Oceania are increasingly confident about what they_have to offer to the universal Church and , in turn , the Church rejoices in the special gifts that_these communities contribute . Many of them are engaged in missionary outreach in Oceania and beyond , in the Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea , and in Southeast Asia and more distant parts_of_the_world . Local Churches , founded by missionaries , are in turn sending out missionaries , and that_-isaia- an unmistakable sign of maturity . They have understood the missionary message that Pope Paul VI , together_with_the people of Samoa , sent to the Catholic people of the world : '' Listen to the call to become heralds of the good_news of salvation '' . What I expressed as a wish to the Bishops of C . in Suva in has come true : '' The Churches which_have_been established by missionaries will in turn be sending forth missionaries to other nations '' . However , some Dioceses of Oceania still have to depend upon the solidarity of other_local Churches , and their lack of resources should_not be allowed to restrain their generosity in fulfilling their_mission . The sharing of resources for the good of all -isaia- a solemn duty of the Christian life and -atti_degli_apostoli- times an urgent_need in Christian mission . In many islands of Oceania catechists are assisting the ordained ministers in their missionary or pastoral_work . In Australia and New Zealand , catechists teach the faith in the local community , especially to children and catechumens . '' They all are direct witnesses and irreplaceable evangelizers who . represent the basic strength of Christian communities '' . These lay workers are_often effective because_they live and work close to the ordinary people . '' They have_made and continue to make a truly indispensable contribution to the life_and_mission of the Church '' . The catechists in many islands are not_only trained to teach , but_also to lead the community in prayer and to evangelize beyond_the bounds of the Catholic community . In the traditional cultures , the faith -isaia-_often best communicated orally by telling stories , by preaching , by praying in word , song and dance . To guide and develop this_kind of activity , special courses , programmes and retreats are needed . The task now -isaia- to present Jesus Christ to those_whose faith_has grown weak under the pressures of secularization and consumerism and who tend to regard the Church as just another of the many institutions of modern society that influence people s thinking and behaviour . In such a situation , the Church needs well trained leaders and theologians to present Jesus Christ convincingly to the peoples of Oceania . It was a joy during the Assembly to hear many Bishops speaking about programmes of Christian renewal in their Dioceses , and about the deepening of faith among their_people which these provide . One of the remarkable features of these programmes -isaia- the involvement of many lay_people . We are all grateful for the various gifts God has_given lay men_and_women to carry_out_their mission , which_-isaia-_not only a call to action and service but_also a call to prayer . They and their pastors are encouraged to move forward with fresh energy and to proclaim Jesus Christ to their_people with renewed conviction . Catholic communities in Oceania are_already making great efforts to reach out to others in word and deed ; and the Synod Fathers expressed both deep appreciation for these efforts and strong support for those prepared to offer themselves for work in the Church s mission . I join in praying that_these workers in the vineyard of the Lord will_find fulfilment and joy in the work to which God himself has called them . There are many_other challenges facing the Church s members , especially_those entrusted with pastoral responsibility . Aware of the limits of all human effort , the Synod Fathers were_not discouraged but recalled the simple and strong assurance of the Lord . Sending the Apostles forth to preach the Good News to all the nations , the Risen Lord says : '' Know that I -amos- with you always ; yes , to the end of time '' Mt : . This promise of the Lord was a source of fresh hope_for the Bishops as they looked to the many challenges they face in the attempt to preach Jesus Christ , the Way , the Truth and the Life ; and they called_upon all the Catholic people of Oceania to join them in that hope . The Gospel and culture Inculturation . The Synod Fathers frequently emphasized the importance of inculturation for_any authentic Christian life in Oceania . The process of inculturation -isaia- the gradual way_in_which the Gospel -isaia- incarnated in the various cultures . On the one_hand , certain cultural values must be transformed and purified , if they_are to find a place in a genuinely Christian culture . On the other_hand , in various cultures Christian values readily take root . Inculturation -isaia- born out of respect_for both the Gospel and the culture in which_it_-isaia- proclaimed and welcomed . The process of inculturation began in Oceania as immigrant people brought the Christian faith from their homelands . For the indigenous peoples of Oceania , inculturation meant a new conversation between_the world_that they_had known and the faith to which_they had come . As a result , Oceania offers many examples of unique cultural expressions in the areas of theology , liturgy and the use of religious symbols . The Synod Fathers saw further inculturation of the Christian faith as the way leading to the fullness of ecclesial communio . Authentic inculturation of the Christian faith_-isaia- grounded in the mystery of the Incarnation . '' God loved the world so much that he gave_his only Son '' Jn : ; in a particular time_and_place , the Son of God took flesh and was '' born of a woman '' Gal : . To prepare for_this momentous event , God chose a people_with a distinctive culture , and he guided its history on the path towards_the Incarnation . All that God did in the midst of his chosen people revealed what he intended to do for all humanity , for all peoples and cultures . The Scriptures tell us this story of God acting among his_people . Above all , they tell the story of Jesus Christ , in whom God himself entered the world and its many cultures . In all that he said and did , but especially in his Death and Resurrection , Jesus revealed the divine_love for_humanity . From deep within human_history , the story of Jesus speaks to the people not_only of his time and culture but of every time and culture . He -isaia- for ever the Word made_flesh for all the world ; he -isaia- the Gospel that_was brought to Oceania ; and he -isaia- the Gospel that now must be proclaimed anew . The Word made_flesh -isaia- foreign to no culture and must be preached to all cultures . '' From the time the Gospel was first preached the Church has known the process of encounter and engagement with culture '' . Just as the Word made_flesh entered history and dwelt among us , his Gospel enters deeply into the life and culture of those_who hear , listen and believe . Inculturation , the '' incarnation '' of the Gospel in the various cultures , affects the very way_in_which the Gospel -isaia- preached , understood and lived . The Church teaches the unchanging truth of God , addressed to the history and the culture of a particular people . Therefore , in each culture the Christian faith will be lived in a unique way . The Synod Fathers were convinced_that the Church , in her efforts to present Jesus Christ effectively to the peoples of Oceania , must respect each culture and never ask the people to renounce it . '' The Church invites all people to express the living word of Jesus in ways that speak to their heart and minds '' . '' The Gospel -isaia- not opposed to any culture , as if engaging a culture the Gospel would seek to strip it of its native riches and force it to adopt forms which_are alien to it '' . It -isaia- vital that the Church insert herself fully into culture and from within bring_about the process of purification and transformation . An authentic inculturation of the Gospel has a double aspect . On the one_hand , a culture offers positive values and forms which_can enrich the way the Gospel -isaia- preached , understood and lived . On the other_hand , the Gospel challenges cultures and requires that_some values and forms change . Just as the Son of God became like us in all things except sin cf . Heb : , so the Christian faith welcomes and affirms all that_-isaia- genuinely human , while rejecting whatever_-isaia- sinful . The process of inculturation engages the Gospel and culture in '' a dialogue which includes identifying what_-isaia- and what_-isaia- not of Christ '' . Every culture needs to be purified and transformed by the values_which are revealed in the Paschal Mystery . In this_way , the positive values and forms found in the cultures of Oceania will enrich the way the Gospel -isaia- preached , understood and lived . The Gospel '' -isaia- a genuine liberation from all the disorders caused by sin and -isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a call to the fullness of truth . Cultures are not_only not diminished by this encounter ; rather they_are prompted to open themselves to the newness of the Gospel s truth and to be stirred by this_truth to develop in new ways '' . Transformed by the Spirit of Christ , these cultures attain the fullness of life to which their deepest values had always looked and for_which their_people had always hoped . Indeed , without Christ , no human culture can become what it truly -isaia- . The Current Situation . In recent_times the Church has strongly encouraged the inculturation of the Christian faith . In this_regard , Pope Paul VI insisted when he visited Oceania that '' far from smothering what_-isaia-_good and original in every_form of human culture , Catholicism accepts , respects and puts to use the genius of each people , endowing with variety and beauty the one , seamless garment of the Church of Christ '' . These are words_which I echoed when I met the Aboriginal people of Australia : '' The Gospel of Jesus Christ speaks all languages . It esteems and embraces all cultures . It supports them in everything human , and when necessary , it purifies them . Always and everywhere the Gospel uplifts and enriches cultures with the revealed message of a loving and merciful God '' . The Synod Fathers asked that the Church in Oceania develop an understanding and presentation of the truth of Christ drawing on the traditions and cultures of the region . In missionary areas , all missionaries are urged to work in harmony_with_the indigenous Christians to ensure_that the faith and life of the Church are expressed in legitimate forms appropriate to each culture . From the time the first immigrants and missionaries arrived , the Church in Oceania has inevitably been involved in a process of inculturation within_the many cultures of the region , which often exist side by side . Attentive to the signs of the times , the Synod Fathers '' recognized that the many cultures each in different_ways , provide insights which help the Church to understand better and express the Gospel of Jesus Christ '' . To guide this_process , fidelity to Christ and to the authentic Tradition of the Church -isaia- required . Genuine inculturation of the Christian faith must_always be done with the guidance of the universal Church . While remaining wholly faithful to the spirit of communio , local Churches should seek to express the faith and life of the Church in legitimate forms appropriate to indigenous cultures . New expressions and forms should be tested and approved by the competent authorities . Once approved , these authentic forms of inculturation will better enable the peoples of Oceania to experience in their_own way the abundant life offered by Jesus Christ . The Synod Fathers expressed the desire_that future priests , deacons and catechists be thoroughly familiar with the culture of the people they_are to serve . In order to become good Christian leaders they_should be trained in ways that do not separate them_from the circumstances of ordinary people . They are_called to a service of inculturated evangelization , through sensitive pastoral_work which allows the Christian community to welcome , live and pass on the faith in its_own culture in harmony_with_the Gospel and the communion of the universal Church . As their guiding vision , the Synod Fathers evoked the ideal of the many cultures of Oceania forming a rich and distinctive civilization inspired by faith in Jesus Christ . With them , I pray fervently that all the peoples of Oceania will discover the love of Christ , the Way , the Truth and the Life , so that_they_will experience and build together the civilization of love and peace for_which the world of the Pacific has_always longed . CHAPTER III TELLING THE TRUTHOF JESUS CHRIST IN OCEANIA '' While the people pressed upon him to hear_the word of God , he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret . And he saw two boats by the lake ; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets . Getting into one of the boats which_was Simon s , he asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the people from the boat '' Lk : . A New Evangelization Evangelization in Oceania . Evangelization -isaia- the mission of the Church to tell the world_the truth of God revealed in Jesus Christ . The Synod Fathers were eager that communio be the theme and aim of all evangelization in Oceania and the basis for all pastoral planning . In evangelization , the Church expresses her_own inner communion and acts as a single body , striving to bring all humanity to unity in God through Christ . All the baptized have_the responsibility of proclaiming the Gospel in word and action to the world in which_they live . The Gospel must be heard in Oceania by all people , believers and non believers , natives and immigrants , rich and poor , young and old . Indeed all these_people have a right to hear_the Gospel , which means_that Christians have a solemn duty to share it with_them . A new evangelization_-isaia- needed today so that everyone may hear , understand and believe in God s mercy destined for all people in Jesus Christ . During the Special Assembly , the Bishops shared their rich store of pastoral experience and that of the people_with whom_they work most closely ; and thus they discerned together new perspectives for the future of the Church in Oceania . Many of them spoke of the hardships of isolation , of the need to travel immense distances and of living in harsh environments . At the same_time , they_also related very positive experiences of a freshness of faith and communio , when people welcome the Gospel and discover the love of God . The Bishops also spoke of the hopes and fears , the achievements and disappointments and the growth and decline of particular Churches in Oceania . Some felt that the Church in Oceania as a whole -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- a crossroads , requiring important choices for the future . They were aware_that new circumstances in that vast region present great challenges , and that the time -isaia- ripe for a re presentation of the Gospel to the peoples of the Pacific , so that_they_may hear_the word of God with renewed faith and find more abundant life in Christ . But to do this , they agreed , there_-isaia-_a_need for new ways and methods of evangelization , inspired by deeper faith , hope and love of the Lord Jesus . As a first step in the necessary '' renewal of mind '' Rom : , the Bishops spoke very positively of the many efforts to apply the directives of the Second Vatican Council . They insisted that_these must be built upon , and this implies the need_for other initiatives to strengthen the faith of those_who_have grown weak and to present it more convincingly to society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . The call to renewal -isaia- a call to proclaim to the world_the truth of Jesus Christ by bearing_witness to him , even to the point of the supreme sacrifice of martyrdom . It -isaia- to this_that the Church in Oceania -isaia-_now called ; and this_was the underlying reason_for celebrating the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . Given the situation in Oceania , God s call can easily go unheard , because of the global transformation affecting the region s cultural identity and social institutions . Some fear that_these changes might undermine the foundations of the faith , and lead to weariness of spirit and despair . At such times , we need to remind ourselves that the Lord provides the strength to overcome such temptations . Our faith in him -isaia- like a house built on rock . '' The rains may fall , and the floods come , and the winds blow and beat upon that house , it does_not fall , because_it_-isaia- founded on the rock '' Mt : . Through the power of the Holy Spirit , the Church in Oceania -isaia- preparing for a new_evangelization of peoples who today are hungering for Christ . '' This -isaia- the acceptable time ; this_-isaia- the day of salvation '' Cor : . Many Synod Fathers voiced concern about the public standing of the Christian faith in Oceania , noting that it exerts less influence on policies regarding the common_good , public morality and the administration of justice , the status of marriage and family , or the right to life_itself . Some of the Bishops pointed_out that the Church s teaching_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- times questioned even by Catholic people . In so far as this_-isaia- true , it -isaia- hardly surprising that the voice of the Church -isaia- less influential in public_life . The challenges of modernity and post modernity are experienced by all the local Churches in Oceania , but_with particular force by those in societies most powerfully affected by secularization , individualism and consumerism . Many Bishops identified the signs of a dwindling of Catholic faith and practice in the lives of some people to the point where_they accept a completely secular outlook as the norm of judgment and behaviour . In this_regard , Pope Paul VI already cautioned Christians , saying that '' there_-isaia- a danger of reducing everything to an earthly humanism , to forget life s moral and spiritual dimension and to stop caring about our necessary relationship_with the Creator '' . The Church has to fulfill her evangelizing mission in an increasingly secularized world . The sense of God and of his loving Providence has diminished for many_people and even_for whole sections of society . Practical indifference to religious truths and values clouds the face of divine_love . Therefore , '' among the priorities of a renewed endeavour of evangelization there_has to be a return to the sense of the sacred , to an awareness of the centrality of God in the whole of human_existence '' . A new evangelization_-isaia- the first priority for the Church in Oceania . In one sense , her mission_-isaia- simple and clear : to propose once_again to human_society the entire Gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ . She -isaia- sent to the contemporary world , to the men_and_women of our_time , '' to preach the Gospel . lest the Cross of Christ be emptied of its power . For the word of the Cross . -isaia- the power of God '' Cor : . The Agents of Evangelization . Like the Apostles , the Bishops are sent to their Dioceses as the prime witnesses to the Risen Christ . United around_the Successor of Peter , they form a college responsible_for spreading the Gospel throughout_the_world . During the Special Assembly for Oceania , the Bishops recognized that_they_are themselves the first called to a renewed Christian life and witness . More prayerful study of the Scriptures and Tradition will lead_them to a deeper knowledge and love of the faith . In this_way , as Pastors of their_people , they_will contribute still more_effectively to the work of the new_evangelization . As the Acts of the Apostles makes clear , the outstanding characteristic of the apostolic mission inspired by the Holy Spirit -isaia- the courage to proclaim '' the word of God with boldness '' : . This courage was_given to them in response to the prayer of the whole community : '' Grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness '' : . The same Spirit today too enables the Bishops to speak out clearly and courageously when_they face a society that needs to hear_the word of Christian truth . The Catholics of Oceania continue to pray fervently that , like the Apostles , their Pastors will be audacious witnesses to Christ ; and the Successor of Peter joins them in that prayer . With the Bishops , all Christ s faithful clergy , religious and laity are_called to proclaim_the Gospel . Their communio expresses itself in a spirit of cooperation , which_-isaia- itself a powerful witness to the Gospel . Priests are the Bishops closest co workers and greatest support in the work_of_evangelization , particularly in the parish communities entrusted to their care . They offer the Sacrifice of Christ for the needs of the community , reconcile sinners to God and to the community , strengthen the sick on their pilgrimage to eternal_life , and thus enable the whole community to bear_witness to the Gospel in every moment of life and death . Men and women in the consecrated_life are living signs of the Gospel . Their vows of evangelical poverty , chastity and obedience are sure paths to deeper knowledge and love of Christ , and from this intimacy with the Lord comes their consecrated service of the Church , which_has proven such a wonderful grace in Oceania . Lay people also play their_part by consecrating the world to God , and many of them are coming to a deeper sense of their indispensable role in the Church s evangelizing mission . Through the witness of love in the Sacrament of Matrimony or the generous dedication of people called to the single life , through_their activity in the world whatever it might be , lay_people can and must be a true leaven in every corner of society in Oceania . Upon this , the success of the new_evangelization depends in large part . A new proclamation of Christ must arise from an inner renewal of the Church , and all renewal in the Church must_have mission as its goal if it -isaia- not to fall prey to a kind of ecclesial introversion . Every aspect of the Church s mission to the world must be born of a renewal which_comes_from contemplation of the face of Christ . This renewal in turn gives_rise to concrete pastoral strategies ; and in this_regard , the Special Assembly invited the local communities to contribute to the new_evangelization by a spirit of fellowship -atti_degli_apostoli- their liturgies , in their social and apostolic activities ; by reaching out to non practising and alienated Catholics ; by strengthening the identity of Catholic schools ; by providing opportunities_for adults to grow in their_faith through programmes of study and formation ; by teaching and explaining Catholic doctrine effectively to those outside the Christian community ; and by bringing the social_teaching of the Church to bear on civic life in Oceania . As a result of these and allied initiatives , the Gospel will be presented to society more convincingly and influence culture more_deeply . The first Christians were stirred by the Holy Spirit to believe in Christ and to proclaim him as the world s only Saviour , sent by the Father . In every_age , the true agent of renewal and evangelization_-isaia- the Holy Spirit , who surely will not_fail to help the Church now to find the evangelizing energies and methods needed in rapidly changing societies . Nor will the new_evangelization fail to bring to the peoples of Oceania the wonderful fruits of the Holy Spirit as experienced by the first Christians , when_they encountered the Risen Lord and received_the gift of his_love which_-isaia- stronger even than death . The Primacy of Proclamation . The kerygmais God s word proclaimed in order to set humanity right with God through_faith in Christ . We see the power of the kerygma -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the first community in Jerusalem . '' They devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers '' Acts : . This -isaia- the essence of the Church s life , the fruit of the first evangelization . Adherence to Jesus Christ comes through believing his_word proclaimed by the Church . Saint Paul asks , '' How can people preach unless they_are sent ? '' Rom : ; and indeed Christ sent his Apostles whose '' voice went out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world '' Ps : . As '' witnesses of divine and Catholic truth '' , the missionaries in Oceania travelled over land and sea , passed through deserts and floods , and faced great cultural difficulties in accomplishing their remarkable work . Inspired by this story of the Church s birth in Oceania , the Synod Fathers felt the need_for a new and courageous preaching of the Gospel in our_own day . The Church faces a twofold challenge in seeking to proclaim_the Gospel in Oceania : on the one_hand , the traditional religions and cultures , and on the other , the modern process of secularization . In each case , '' the first and most urgent task -isaia- the proclamation of the Risen Christ by way of a personal encounter which_would bring_the listener to conversion of heart and the request for Baptism '' . Whether faced_with traditional religion or refined philosophy , the Church preaches by word and deed that '' the truth_-isaia- in Jesus Christ '' Eph : ; cf . In the light of that_truth , she makes her contribution to discussion about the values and ethical principles_which make for happiness in human_life and peace in society . The faith must_always be presented in a rationally coherent way , so as to favour its capacity to penetrate into ever wider fields of human experience . Faith in fact has the force to shape culture itself by penetrating it to its_very core . Alert to both Christian tradition and contemporary cultural shifts , the word of faith and reason must go hand in hand with the witness of life if evangelization_-isaia- to bear_fruit . Above all , however , what_-isaia- needed -isaia- a fearless proclamation of Christ , '' a parrhesia of faith '' . Evangelization and the Media . In today_s_world , the media of social communication are increasingly powerful as agents of modernization , even in the remotest parts of Oceania . The media have a great impact on the lives of people , on their culture , on their moral thinking and on their religious behaviour ; and , when used indiscriminately , they_can have a harmful effect on traditional cultures . The Synod Fathers called_for a greater awareness of the power of the media , which '' offer an excellent opportunity_for the Church to evangelize , to build community and solidarity '' . Indeed the media often provide the only contact the Church has with non practising Catholics or the wider community . Therefore , they_should be employed in a creative and responsible manner . Where possible , the Church should devise a pastoral plan_for communications -atti_degli_apostoli- the national , diocesan and parish levels . Coordination of the Church s efforts -isaia- necessary to ensure better preparation of those_who represent the Church in the media , and to encourage dedicated lay_people to enter_the media professionally as a vocation . It -isaia- a sign of hope_that Christians working in the media are giving evidence of their commitment to Christian values . With their assistance , religious material and programmes reflecting human and moral values can be professionally produced , even if funding -isaia-_often a problem . A Catholic media centre for the whole of Oceania could be of great help in using the media for the purposes of evangelization . The Bishops also expressed concern about standards of decency in the public media and denounced the level of violence they_have reached . Church leaders need to collaborate when codes of ethics for the media are drawn up ; and families and young_people need assistance in critically evaluating the content of programmes . Catholic educational institutions therefore have a vital role in helping people , especially youth , come to a critical appreciation of the media . The Christian faith challenges us all to become discriminating listeners , viewers and readers . Advertising has great power to encourage both good_and_evil . The process of globalization and the growing pattern of monopolies in the media give it still greater power over people . By means of image and suggestion , advertising often propagates a culture of consumerism , reducing people to what they_have or can acquire . It leads people to believe_that there_-isaia-_nothing beyond what a consumer economy can_offer . '' The greatest concern with this_power -isaia- that , for the most part , it ceaselessly propagates an ideology that_-isaia- clearly in conflict with the vision of the Catholic faith '' . It -isaia- important therefore that_the_faithful , especially_the young , be equipped to deal critically with the advertising which_-isaia- an ubiquitous part of life today . This means_that they must_be_given a clear and strong sense of the human and Christian values_which are fundamental to the Catholic understanding of human_life . The challenge of faith today Catechesis . The Church s mission to '' tell the truth of Jesus Christ '' in Oceania today summons her to renew her catechesis , instruction and formation in the faith . The media s impact on people s lives illustrates how strongly a new social reality demands fresh ways of presenting the faith . Catechesis aims to educate children , young_people and adults in the faith . It includes especially '' the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted in an organic and systematic way with_a_view of initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life '' . The Synod Fathers proposed a greater commitment of both finance and personnel to reach groups that_are easily overlooked . The need_for comprehensive courses for adults and children with_special needs , who_do_not attend Catholic schools , calls for special_care and systematic planning . Basic to all human_rights -isaia- the freedom of religion , which includes the right to be instructed in the faith . '' Every baptized person , precisely by reason of being baptized , has the right to receive from the Church instruction and education enabling him or her to enter on a truly Christian life '' . This requires that governments and school authorities ensure_that this right -isaia- effectively respected . '' Where there_-isaia- a genuine partnership between government and Church in the provision and operation of schools , the education of the nation s children and young_people -isaia- greatly advanced '' . Men and women_religious , lay_people and clergy have laboured to achieve this_end , often with prodigious effort and many sacrifices . Their work needs to be consolidated and extended to ensure_that all the baptized grow in faith and in understanding of the truth of Christ . The Synod Fathers saw disunity among Christians as a great obstacle to the credibility of the Church s witness . They expressed their earnest desire_that the scandal of disunity not continue and that new efforts of reconciliation and dialogue be made , so that the splendour of the Gospel may shine_forth more_clearly . In many missionary areas of Oceania , the differences between Churches and Ecclesial Communities have led in the past to competition and opposition . In recent_times , however , relationships have_been more positive and fraternal . The Church in Oceania has_given ecumenism a high priority and has brought a freshness and openness to ecumenical activities . Opportunities are welcomed for '' a dialogue of salvation '' aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- greater mutual understanding and enrichment . The strong desire_for unity in faith and worship -isaia- one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit to Oceania ; and cooperation in areas of charity and social_justice -isaia- a clear sign of Christian fraternity . Ecumenism found fertile soil in which to take root in Oceania , because in many places local communities are closely knit . A still stronger desire_for unity in faith will_help to keep these communities together . This desire_for deeper communion in Christ was symbolized -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod by the presence of the fraternal delegates from other Churches and Ecclesial Communities . Their contributions were encouraging and helpful in making progress towards_the unity willed by Christ . In the work of ecumenism , it -isaia- essential that Catholics be more knowledgeable about the Church s doctrine , her tradition and history , so that in understanding their_faith more_deeply they_will be better able to engage in ecumenical dialogue and cooperation . There -isaia-_a_need too for '' spiritual ecumenism '' , by which_-isaia- meant an ecumenism of prayer and conversion of heart . Ecumenical prayer will_lead to a sharing of life and service where Christians do as much together as -isaia- possible -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time . '' Spiritual ecumenism '' can_also lead to doctrinal dialogue , or its consolidation where it already exists . The Synod Fathers saw it as very useful to have ecumenically accepted texts of the Scriptures and prayers for common use . They wanted to see greater attention given to the pastoral needs of families whose members belong to different Christian communities . They also encouraged the Church s agencies , where possible , to share social services with_other Christian communities . It -isaia- good that Christian leaders act in concert and make common declarations on religious or social issues , when such declarations are necessary and opportune . Ecumenism needs to be distinguished from the Church s approach to fundamentalist religious groups and movements , some of which_are Christian in inspiration . In some missionary areas , the Bishops are_concerned about the effect that_these religious groups or sects are having on the Catholic community . Some groups base their ideas on a reading of Scripture , often employing apocalyptic images , threats of a dark future for the world , and promises of economic rewards for their followers . While certain of these groups are openly hostile to the Church , others wish to engage in dialogue . In more developed and secularized societies , concern -isaia- growing about fundamentalist Christian groups which draw young_people away from the Church , and even from their_families . Many different movements offer some form of spirituality as a supposed remedy for the harmful effects of an alienating technological culture in which people often feel powerless . The presence and activity of these groups and movements are a challenge to the Church to revitalize her pastoral outreach , and in particular to be more welcoming to young_people and to those in grave spiritual or material need . It -isaia-_also a situation which calls for better biblical and sacramental catechesis and an appropriate spiritual and liturgical formation . There -isaia-_a_need too for a new apologetics in keeping_with_the words of Saint Peter : '' Be ready to give reasons for your hope '' Pt : . In this_way , the faithful will be more confident in their Catholic faith and less susceptible to the allure of these groups and movements , which often deliver the very opposite of what_they promise . Greater travel opportunities and easier migration have resulted in unprecedented encounters among the cultures of the world , and hence_the presence in Oceania of the great non Christian religions . Some cities have Jewish communities , made up of a considerable number of survivors of the Holocaust , and these communities can play an important role in Jewish Christian relations . In some places too there_are long established Muslim communities ; in others , there_are communities of Hindus ; and in still others , Buddhist centres are_being established . It -isaia- important_that Catholics better understand these religions , their teachings , way_of_life and worship . Where parents from_these religions enrol their_children in Catholic schools , the Church has an especially delicate task . The Church in Oceania also needs to study more thoroughly the traditional religions of the indigenous populations , in order to enter more_effectively into the dialogue which Christian proclamation requires . '' Proclamation and dialogue are , each in its_own place , component elements and authentic forms of the one evangelizing mission of the Church . They are both oriented toward_the communication of salvific truth '' . In order to pursue a fruitful dialogue_with these religions , the Church needs experts in philosophy , anthropology , comparative religions , the social sciences and , above all , theology . Hope for society The Church s Social Teaching . The Church regards the social apostolate as an integral part of her evangelizing mission to speak a word of hope to the world ; and her commitment in this_regard -isaia- seen in her contribution to human_development , her promotion of human_rights , the defence of human_life and dignity , social_justice and protection of the environment . The Synod Fathers were one_with their_people in expressing determination to act against injustices , corruption , threats to life and new_forms of poverty . Late in the nineteenth century when an industrial , consumer society was in its early years , the Church in Oceania welcomed papal social_teaching on workers rights to employment and a just wage . In the developing countries of Oceania , the social_doctrine of the Church has_been well received , especially since_the Second Vatican Council , and the Bishops of Oceania have taught this social_doctrine effectively and applied it to current social issues . Statements by the Federation of the Bishops Conferences of Oceania , the Bishops Conferences and individual Bishops reflect the full range of the Church s social_teaching and illustrate how she_has attempted to advance the cause of indigenous peoples and the rights of smaller nations , and to strengthen the bonds of international solidarity . The Church has_also helped to develop democratic forms of government which respect human_rights , the rule of law and its just application . It -isaia- certain_that commitment to social justice_and_peace -isaia- an integral part of the Church s mission in the world . Yet her_mission does_not depend upon political power . '' The Church -isaia- concerned_with the temporal aspects of the common_good because_they_are ordered to the sovereign Good , our ultimate end '' . The Church s social_teaching needs to be taught and implemented still more_effectively in Oceania , especially through structures such as commissions for justice_and_peace . This social teaching_-isaia- to be '' clearly presented to the faithful in easily understandable terms and be witnessed to by a simple life style '' . A more acute analysis of economic injustice and of corruption needs to be made so that adequate measures can be proposed to overcome them . Catholic organizations involved in action for_justice are encouraged to remain attentive to new_forms of poverty and injustice and to help eliminate their causes . The Synod Fathers were keen that the people of Oceania become still_more conscious of human_dignity , which_-isaia- based on the fact_that all are created in God s image cf . Respect for the human_person entails respect_for the inviolable rights that flow from a person s dignity . All basic rights are prior to society and must be recognized by it . Failure to respect the dignity or rights of another person_-isaia- contrary to the Gospel and destructive of human_society . The Church encourages young_people and adults to respond effectively to injustice and to the failure to respect human_rights , some of which_are either under threat in Oceania or need to be more widely respected . Among these -isaia- the right to work and employment , so that people can support themselves and raise and educate a family . Unemployment among youth -isaia- a major concern , leading in some_countries to a rising incidence of youth suicide . Labour unions can perform a unique role in defending workers rights . To be faithful to their calling , politicians , government officials and police must be honest and avoid corruption in all its forms , for it -isaia- always a serious injustice to citizens . By working together_with politicians , business executives and community leaders , Church leaders can_offer valuable assistance in establishing ethical guidelines on issues affecting the common_good and ensuring that_they_are put into_practice . Without claiming to be experts in the field , Church leaders need to be well informed about economic affairs and their impact on society . The Synod Fathers reiterated that '' a theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity -isaia- morally unacceptable '' . So called '' economic rationalism '' -isaia- a tenet which tends increasingly to divide rich and poor nations , communities and individuals . The smaller nations of Oceania are particularly vulnerable to economic policies based on a social philosophy of this_kind , because it has a diminished sense of distributive justice , and -isaia- too little concerned to ensure_that everyone has the necessities of life and an integral human_development . The fact_that families suffer from such economic policies -isaia- particularly worrying . The Bishops pointed_out that another destructive phenomenon in Oceania -isaia- the spread of gambling , especially in casinos which hold out the promise of a quick and spectacular solution to financial woes , only to lead people into an even_more difficult situation . Unjust economic policies are especially damaging to indigenous peoples , young nations and their traditional cultures ; and it -isaia- the Church s task to help indigenous cultures preserve their identity and maintain their traditions . The Synod strongly encouraged the Holy See to continue its advocacy of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . A special case -isaia- that of the Australian Aborigines whose culture struggles to survive . For many thousands of years they_have sought to live in harmony_with_the often harsh environment of their '' big country '' ; but now their identity and culture are gravely threatened . In more recent_times , however , their joint efforts to ensure survival and gain justice have begun to bear_fruit . There was a saying from Australian bush life heard in the Synod Hall : '' If you stay closely united , you_are like a tree standing in the middle of a bush fire sweeping through the timber : the leaves are scorched , the tough bark -isaia- scarred and burned , but inside the tree the -sapienza- still flows , and under the ground the roots are_still strong . Like that tree you_have survived the flames , and you_have still the power to be born . The time for rebirth -isaia-_now '' . The Church will support the cause of all indigenous peoples who seek a just and equitable recognition of their identity and their_rights ; and the Synod Fathers expressed support for the aspirations of indigenous people for a just solution to the complex question of the alienation of their lands . Whenever the truth has_been suppressed by governments and their agencies or even by Christian communities , the wrongs done to the indigenous peoples need to be honestly acknowledged . The Synod supported the establishment of '' Truth Commissions '' , where these can_help resolve historical injustices and bring_about reconciliation within_the wider community or the nation . The past cannot be undone , but honest recognition of past injustices can lead to measures and attitudes which_will help to rectify the damaging effects for both the indigenous community and the wider society . The Church expresses deep regret and asks forgiveness where her_children have_been or still are party to these wrongs . Aware of the shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples in Oceania , the Synod Fathers apologized unreservedly for the part played in these by members of the Church , especially where children were forcibly separated_from their_families . Governments are encouraged to pursue with still greater energy programmes to improve the conditions and the standard of living of indigenous groups in the vital areas of health , education , employment and housing . Just as in the early Church one Christian community was bound to another by hospitality offered to pilgrims , mutual assistance and the sharing of material resources and personnel , practical solidarity between_the local Churches in Oceania makes communio visible to the world . Many national economies in Oceania are_still dependent on international support and need a continuing supply of development aid . While aid for socio economic development -isaia- generously offered by international agencies , the Church finds it more difficult to obtain direct aid for_her pastoral projects , even_though many of these reach far beyond_the bounds of the Catholic community . Given the situation , the Synod recommended that Church related funding agencies review their criteria in order to open up their resources to the apostolic works which_are a necessary pre requisite for the social development needed to improve living standards . The Synod Fathers also asked that '' the Church in the more wealthy parts of Oceania share her resources with the other_local Churches in the Pacific as well as cooperate with_them in establishing links with funding agencies '' . Nor can the Church in Oceania be indifferent to the fate of the poorer Churches in neighbouring Asia , whenever they stand in need of her help and services . The Synod acknowledges the generous contributions of money and resources made by Catholic people to aid programmes , and especially to the work of lay personnel engaged in often very difficult situations to improve human conditions in Oceania . The Sanctity of Life . In the more secularized and affluent societies of Oceania , the right to life -isaia-_the_one most under threat . There -isaia- a profound contradiction in this , for these are_often societies which speak insistently about human_rights while denying the most basic right of all . Did not Christ himself say '' I came that_they_may have life , and have it abundantly '' Jn : ? Indeed , '' the Gospel of life_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of Jesus message '' . In the present conflict between a '' culture of life '' and '' a culture of death '' , the Church has to defend the right to life from the moment of conception until natural death , -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of its development . The moral and social values_which should inform society are based on the sacredness of life created by God . Presenting a clear perspective on humanity s origin from God the Creator and its eternal destiny will_help people see life s true value . It -isaia- not a question of the Church seeking to impose her morality on others , but_rather of being faithful to her_mission to share the full truth_about life as taught by Jesus Christ . The promotion of the sacredness of life_-isaia- a consequence of the Christian understanding of human_existence . This message must be taught by the Church not_only within_the Catholic community but , in a prophetic way , to society as a whole in order to declare the power and beauty of the Gospel of life . On this_point , the witness of Catholic health_care institutions -isaia- essential , as -isaia- the role of the media in promoting the value of life . In order to present_the Church s position on biomedical and health issues in the public forum clearly and faithfully , Bishops , priests , and experts in law and medicine need to be trained adequately . Life must be promoted and its sanctity defended against every threat of violence in its many forms , especially violence against the weakest the elderly , the dying , women , children , the disabled and the unborn . Oceania -isaia- a part_of_the_world of great natural beauty , and it has succeeded in preserving areas that remain unspoiled . The region still offers to indigenous peoples a place to live in harmony_with nature and one_another . Because creation was entrusted to human stewardship , the natural world_-isaia- not_just a resource to be exploited but_also a reality to be respected and even reverenced as a gift and trust from God . It -isaia- the task of human_beings to care_for , preserve and cultivate the treasures of creation . The Synod Fathers called_upon the people of Oceania to rejoice always in the glory of creation in a spirit of thanksgiving to the Creator . Yet the natural beauty of Oceania has not escaped the ravages of human exploitation . The Synod Fathers called_upon the governments and peoples of Oceania to protect this precious environment for present and future generations . It -isaia- their special responsibility to assume on behalf of all humanity stewardship of the Pacific Ocean , containing over one half of the earth s total supply of water . The continued health of this and other oceans -isaia- crucial for the welfare of peoples not_only in Oceania but in every part_of_the_world . The natural resources of Oceania need to be protected against the harmful policies of some industrialized nations and increasingly powerful transnational corporations which_can lead to deforestation , despoliation of the land , pollution of rivers by mining , over fishing of profitable species , or fouling the fishing grounds with industrial and nuclear waste . The dumping of nuclear waste in the area constitutes an added danger to the health of the indigenous population . Yet it -isaia-_also important to recognize_that industry can bring great benefits when undertaken with due respect_for the rights and the culture of the local population and for the integrity of the environment . Charitable works Catholic Institutions . The history of the Church in Oceania cannot be recounted without telling the story of the Church s remarkable contributions in the fields of education , health_care and social welfare . Catholic institutions allow the light of the Gospel to penetrate cultures and societies , evangelizing them_from within , as it were . Because of the work of Christian missionaries , ancient ways of violence have_given way to standards of law and justice . Through education Christian leaders and responsible citizens have_been formed and Christian moral values have shaped society . Through her educational programmes , the Church seeks the integral formation of the human_person , looking to Christ himself as the fullness of humanity . The apostolate of charity witnesses to the fullness of Christian love not_only in speech but in action . Such love leads people to wonder about its source and makes them ask why Christians are different in their values and behaviour . Through apostolic charity such as this , Christ touches the lives of others , and leads them to a greater sense of what it might mean to speak of and build a '' civilization of love '' . The Church takes advantage of religious_freedom in society to proclaim Christ publicly and to share his_love abundantly through institutions inspired by that_love . The right of the Church to found educational , health_care and social service institutions -isaia- based on such freedom . The social apostolate of these institutions can be more_effective when governments not_only tolerate this_work but cooperate in this area with Church authorities , with unequivocal respect_for each_other s role and competence . Parents are the first educators of their_children in human values and the Christian faith ; and they_have the fundamental right to choose the education suitable for their_children . Schools assist parents in exercising this right by helping students to develop as they_should . In some situations , the Catholic school -isaia-_the_only contact parents have with the community of the Church . The Catholic school has an ecclesial identity , because_it_-isaia- a part of the evangelizing mission of the Church . Yet a distinguishing feature of Catholic education -isaia- that_it_-isaia- open to all , especially to the poor and weakest in society . It -isaia- vital that school and parish cooperate , and that the school be integrated into the parish s pastoral programme , especially with_regard to the Sacraments of Penance , Confirmation and Eucharist . In the primary school , teachers develop children s capacity_for faith and understanding which_will blossom fully in later years . Secondary schools provide a privileged means by which '' the Catholic community gives the student an academic , vocational , and religious education '' . In these years , students usually come to a greater discernment about their_faith and moral_life , based on a more personal knowledge of Jesus Christ as the Way , the Truth , and the Life . Such a faith , nourished in the home , school and parish through prayer and the Sacraments , shows itself in a sound and upright moral_life . The great challenge for Catholic schools in an increasingly secularized society_-isaia- to present_the Christian message in a convincing and systematic way . Yet '' catechesis runs the risk of becoming barren , if no community of faith and Christian life welcomes those being formed '' . Therefore , young_people need to be genuinely integrated into the community s life and activity . The Synod Fathers wished to acknowledge_the work of the religious men_and_women and lay_people who_have laboured so generously in the field of Catholic education , establishing and staffing Catholic schools , often in the face of great difficulty and with_great personal sacrifice . Their contribution to the Church and civil_society in Oceania has_been inestimable . In today s educational context , religious congregations , institutes and societies have every reason to cherish their_vocation . Consecrated women and men_are needed in educational institutions to bear radical witness to Gospel values and so to inspire them in others . In recent_times , the laity s generous response to new needs has opened new vistas for Catholic education . For the lay_people involved , teaching_-isaia- more_than a profession ; it -isaia- a vocation to form students , a widespread and indispensable lay service in the Church . Teaching -isaia- always a challenge ; but_with the cooperation and encouragement of parents , clergy and religious , the laity s involvement in Catholic education can be a precious service of the Gospel , and a way of Christian sanctification for both teacher and students . The identity and success of Catholic education -isaia- linked inseparably to the witness of life given by the teaching staff . Therefore , the Bishops recommended that '' those responsible_for hiring teachers and administrators in our Catholic schools take into_account_the faith life of those they_are hiring '' . School staff who truly live their_faith will be agents of a new_evangelization in creating a positive climate for the Christian faith to grow and in spiritually nourishing the students entrusted to their care . They will be especially effective when_they_are active practising Catholics , committed to their parish community and loyal to the Church and her teaching . Today , the Church in Oceania -isaia- extending her commitment in education . Professional Catholic lay_people are greatly helped by Catholic tertiary institutes , training colleges and universities , which nourish them intellectually , train them professionally and support their_faith so that_they_can take their rightful place in the Church s mission in the world . This adventure in tertiary education -isaia- in its early stages in Oceania and calls for special gifts of wisdom and insight in its development . Catholic universities are communities bringing together scholars from the various branches of human knowledge . They are dedicated to research , teaching and other services in keeping_with their cultural mission . It -isaia- their honour and responsibility to dedicate themselves without reserve to the cause of truth . They are_called to observe the highest standards of academic research and teaching as a service to the local , national and international communities . In this_way , they play a vital part in society and the Church , preparing future professionals and leaders , who will_take their Christian responsibility seriously . The Bishops saw it as essential that_they maintain personal contact_with academics and foster qualities of leadership in those engaged in the field of tertiary education . Research and teaching in tertiary institutions must bring Christian values to bear on the arts and sciences . The Church needs experts in philosophy , ethics and moral theology so that_human values can be properly understood in an increasingly complex technological society ; and the unity of knowledge cannot be complete unless theology -isaia- allowed to shed its light upon all fields of inquiry . Particular care must_be_taken in choosing and forming scholars to work in the area of theology . The Apostolic Constitution '' Ex Corde Ecclesiae indicates that the majority of professors -atti_degli_apostoli- Catholic universities and other Catholic tertiary institutes should be active Catholics . Those responsible_for hiring should carefully choose professors , who_are_not only competent in their field of expertise but who_can serve as role models for our young_people '' . The presence of dedicated Catholics in tertiary institutions -isaia- vital and constitutes a true service to the Church and society . Jesus came to heal the sick and comfort the afflicted . As the Risen Christ , he continues his_ministry of healing and comfort through those_who bring God s compassion to people in their weakness and suffering . This ministry of the Church of Oceania -isaia- for many_people the most visible and tangible proof of God s love . The messianic mission of mercy , of healing and forgiveness , must be continued unstintingly and accomplished in new ways that respond to current needs . The history of health_care in Oceania shows the intimate link between health_care and the Church s mission and how it covers every aspect of healing , including provision of the simplest medical services in remote places . The Church has_been among the first to reach out to those abandoned by others , as in the care of lepers and those suffering from HIVAIDS . She also administers training hospitals where health_care workers are excellently prepared . Because of the current crisis in providing and financing medical care in Oceania , some institutions are under severe strain ; but_this cannot be allowed to compromise the Church s fundamental commitment in this area . The Church s teaching on the dignity_of_the_human_person and the sanctity of life needs to be explained to those responsible_for legislation and court decisions , especially since their judgements have an impact on medical care , the administration of hospitals and the provision of medical services . Today Catholic hospitals and health_care institutions are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the forefront of the Church s promotion of human_life from the moment of conception until natural death . The Synod Fathers acknowledged the dedication of the religious congregations which established Catholic health_care systems throughout Oceania . The Church and society as a whole owe them an immense debt of gratitude . Their presence in hospitals must continue , together_with lay_people prepared to work with the different institutes_of_consecrated_life in the spirit of their charism . These people enable the Gospel of life to be proclaimed unambiguously in a society_which -isaia-_often confused about moral values . The Synod Fathers recommended that to counteract the influence of '' a culture of death '' , all Christians be urged to help ensure_that the great heritage of Catholic health_care not be jeopardized . Catholic universities have a leading role to play in educating medical professionals to apply Catholic teaching to the new challenges constantly arising in the medical field . In every way possible , associations of Catholic doctors , nurses and health_care workers are to be fostered and , where they_do_not exist , they_should be established . Administrators and staff in Catholic institutions require formation in the application of Catholic moral principles to their professional life . This -isaia- a delicate task , since some who_are involved in the work of a Catholic hospital are_not familiar with these_principles or do not agree with_them . When Catholic teaching_-isaia- properly presented , however , such people often experience the peace which_comes_from living in harmony_with truth and cooperate readily . Faith in the redeeming Cross of Christ gives new meaning to sickness , suffering and death . The Synod Fathers urged support for those_who own or sponsor facilities which bring_the compassion of Christ to those who_suffer , particularly people_with disabilities , HIVAIDS , the elderly , the dying , indigenous peoples and those in isolated areas . They were particularly conscious of those_who provide these services in the most remote areas : the jungle , small islands or the Australian '' Outback '' . Working often with scarce resources and little financial support , their dedication gives powerful testimony to God s love for the poor , the sick and the deprived . Those working in hospitals , caring for the aged or offering other_forms of health_care to the least of their brothers_and_sisters cf . Mt : should know_that the Church highly esteems their dedication and generosity , and thanks them_for being in the forefront of Christian charity . During his_life on earth , Jesus was sensitive to every_human weakness and affliction . '' At the heart of his_teaching are the eight beatitudes , which_are addressed to people tried by various sufferings in their temporal life '' . In the footsteps of the Lord , the Church s mission of charity reaches out to those most in need : orphans , the poor , the homeless , the abandoned and excluded . It -isaia- carried_out by all who care_for the needy ; and as well as personal initiatives , it involves institutions established to meet various needs on the parish , diocesan , national or international level . This -isaia- not the place_for an exhaustive listing of the many social services offered by the Church in Oceania ; but some were given special mention in the Synod Hall . The Church provides counselling services to people_with personal or social difficulties , seeking to strengthen the family , to prevent marriage breakdown and divorce and heal its painful effects . Providing soup kitchens , instituting care centres for various people or working with the homeless and '' street children '' are only a part of the Church s social apostolate in Oceania . In a quiet and unobtrusive manner , some parish groups and apostolic associations work to remedy the often hidden harm produced by poverty in the suburbs or in rural areas . Other groups help in bringing peace or reconciliation between clans , tribes or other groups in conflict . Women , particularly mothers , can have an extraordinary effect in promoting peaceful ways of resolving conflict . The Church s care also extends to those_who_are addicted to alcohol , drugs or gambling , or are victims of sexual abuse . The Synod Fathers also mentioned refugees and asylum seekers , who_are increasing in number and whose human_dignity demands_that they be welcomed and given appropriate care . Since the nations of Oceania are dependent on the oceans and seas , the Synod Fathers also voiced concern_for seafarers , who often work under severe conditions and endure many hardships . Frequently , volunteers give their time , energy and professional services to these apostolates without remuneration . For those_who_have chosen self sacrificing love as their way_of_life , no human acknowledgment or reward -isaia- sought , nor would any be adequate . Their overarching concern -isaia- to play their_part in the Church s mission to tell the truth of Jesus Christ , to walk his way and to live his_life . These people_are fundamental to any planning for a new_evangelization of the peoples of Oceania . Faith -isaia- awakened by the preaching of God s word and hope -isaia- inspired by the promise of his Kingdom , but charity_-isaia- infused by the Holy Spirit , '' the Lord and Giver of life '' . CHAPTER IV LIVING THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRISTIN OCEANIA '' When he had ceased speaking , he said to Simon , Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch . And Simon answered , Master , we toiled all night and took nothing ! But -atti_degli_apostoli- your word I will let down the nets . And when_they had done this , they made a great catch of fish ; and as their nets were breaking , they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help_them . And they came and filled both the boats , so they began to sink '' Lk : . Spiritual and Sacramental life Come Holy Spirit ! . '' God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us '' Rom : . When '' the Word was made_flesh and dwelt among us '' Jn : , God broke into human_history so that we might become '' partakers of the divine nature '' Pt : . Living in Christ implies a way_of_life made new by the Spirit . Saint Paul speaks of putting on the new nature '' created after_the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness '' Eph : . The Church in Oceania has_been endowed by the Holy Spirit with many gifts . For all the great diversity of cultures and traditions , she_-isaia- one in faith , hope and charity , one in Catholic doctrine and discipline , one in the communion of the Most Holy Trinity . In this communion , all are_called to live the life of Christ in the midst of their_daily activities , to show forth the wonderful fruits of the Spirit cf . Gal : and to be witnesses to God s love and mercy in the world . The Spirit of Interiority . The Special Assembly emphasized the fundamental importance for the Church in Oceania of prayer and the interior life in union with Christ . Indigenous people_have retained their appreciation of silence , contemplation and a sense of mystery in life . The frenetic activity of modern life with all its pressures makes it indispensable that Christians seek prayerful silence and contemplation as both conditions for and expressions of a vibrant faith . When God -isaia-_no_longer -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of human_life , then life_itself becomes empty and meaningless . The Synod Fathers recognized the need to give fresh impetus and encouragement to the spiritual_life of all the faithful . Jesus himself often '' went off to a lonely place and prayed there '' Mk : . The Evangelist notes : '' His reputation continued to grow , and large crowds would gather to hear him and to have_their sickness cured ; he would always go off to some place_where he could be alone and pray '' Lk : . Jesus prayer_-isaia- our example , especially_when we are caught up in the tensions and responsibilities of daily_life . The Synod Fathers emphasized the importance of the life of prayer , considering the fact that_the_whole region faces the growing impact of secularization and materialism ; and as a stimulus to the interior life , they encouraged visits to the Blessed Sacrament , the Stations of the Cross , the Rosary and other devotional exercises , as well as prayers in the family . The presence in Oceania of communities of contemplative life_-isaia- an especially powerful reminder of the spirit of interiority which helps us find the presence of God in our_hearts . The spirit of interiority -isaia-_also crucial in inspiring and guiding pastoral initiatives . It offers the strength of a genuinely apostolic love_which mirrors the love of God . '' Lectio Divina '' and Scripture . The Church '' forcefully and specially exhorts all the Christian faithful . to learn the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ Phil : by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures . Let them remember , however_,_that prayer should accompany the reading of Sacred Scripture , so that a dialogue takes_place between God and the reader . For we speak to him when we pray ; we listen to him when we read the divine oracles '' . The word of God in the Old and New Testament -isaia- fundamental for all who_believe in Christ , and it -isaia- the inexhaustible wellspring of evangelization . Holiness of life and effective apostolic activity are born of constant listening to God s word . A renewed appreciation of Scripture allows us to return to the sources of our_faith and encounter God s truth in Christ . Acquaintance with the Scriptures -isaia- required of all the faithful , but particularly of seminarians , priests and religious . They are to be encouraged to engage in lectio divina , that quiet and prayerful meditation on the Scripture that allows the word of God to speak to the human_heart . This form of prayer , privately or in groups , will deepen their love for the Bible and make it an essential and life_giving element of their_daily lives . For this_reason , the Scriptures need to be accessible to all in Oceania . They need to be well and faithfully translated into the greatest possible number of vernacular languages . Much highly commendable work of biblical translation has_already_been done , but more still needs to be done . It -isaia-_not_enough , however , to provide the many linguistic groups with a biblical text which_they can read ; to help_them understand what_they read , there_-isaia-_a_need for solid and continuing biblical formation for all who are_called to proclaim and teach the word of God . The Synod Fathers reflected -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the importance of the liturgy in the local Churches in Oceania , and they expressed the desire_that the local Churches continue to foster their liturgical life so that_the_faithful can enter more_deeply into the mystery of Christ . They recognized greater participation of the People of God in the liturgy as one of the fruits of the Second Vatican Council , which_has led in turn to a greater sense of mission , as it was intended to do . Christian life has_been invigorated by a renewed understanding and appreciation of the liturgy , especially of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . The Council saw the renewal of the liturgy as a process of coming to an ever deeper_understanding of the sacred rites , and in this_regard many local Churches are involved in a theoretical reflection and practical actuation of a proper inculturation of the forms of worship , with due regard_for the integrity of the Roman Rite . Adequate translations of liturgical texts and appropriate use of symbols drawn_from local cultures can avert the cultural alienation of indigenous people when_they approach the Church s worship . The words and signs of the liturgy will be the words and signs of their soul . The Eucharist completes Christian initiation and -isaia-_the_source and summit of the Christian life . Christ -isaia- really and fully present in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood , offered in sacrifice for the life of the world and received in communion by the faithful . From the very_beginning , the Church has not ceased to obey the Lord s command , '' Do this in memory of me '' Cor : . The Catholics of Oceania understand well the central place of the Eucharist in their_lives . They realize_that regular and prayerful celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice enables them to follow_the path of personal holiness and to play their_part in the Church s mission . The Synod Fathers were quick to acknowledge this widespread appreciation and intense love of the Church s greatest Sacrament . They also expressed their concern that_many communities throughout Oceania go without_the celebration of the Eucharist for long periods . There are_many reasons for_this : the growing scarcity of priests available for pastoral_ministry ; especially in Australia , the growth of rural poverty and the movement to cities , which_leads to an ever decreasing population and the isolation of many communities . The vast distances between many islands often mean that_it_-isaia- impossible to have a resident priest . Many communities therefore gather on the Lord s Day for services which_are not celebrations of the Eucharist ; and there_-isaia-_a_need for great wisdom and courage in addressing this_most regrettable situation . I make my own the Synod s insistence that greater efforts be made to awaken vocations to the priestly life , and to allocate priests throughout_the region in a more equitable way . The Sacrament of Penance . '' It -isaia- important_for us to reflect on the fact_that Christ wills the Sacrament of Penance to be the source and sign of radical mercy , reconciliation and peace . The Church serves the world best when she_-isaia- precisely what she_-isaia- meant to be : a reconciled and reconciling community of Christ s disciples . The Church -isaia- never more herself than when_she meditates and reconciles , in the love and power of Jesus Christ , through the Sacrament of Penance '' . This -isaia- why_the Synod Fathers were grateful that in many of the Churches in Oceania the Sacrament of Penance -isaia- widely practised and cherished as a source of healing grace . Yet they_also noted_that in other_local Churches there_are serious pastoral challenges with_regard to this Sacrament . Especially in developed societies , many of the faithful_are confused or indifferent about the reality of sin and the need_for forgiveness in the Sacrament of Penance . At times , the true sense of human freedom_-isaia- not understood . The recovery of the fundamental place of the Sacrament of Penance in the life of the People of God was a deep desire of the Bishops . They urged '' that a more extensive catechesis be offered on personal responsibility , the reality of sin and the Sacrament of Reconciliation so as to remind Catholics of the loving mercy of Jesus Christ made available through_this Sacrament and of the need_for sacramental absolution for serious sin committed after Baptism ; that , because of the assistance to spiritual progress provided by this Sacrament , priests_are to be encouraged not_only to make_the Sacrament of Reconciliation an important part of their_own lives , but to ensure its availability on a regular basis as a vital part of their_ministry to the faithful '' . The experience of the Great Jubilee suggests that the time has come for_such a renewed catechesis and practice of the great Sacrament of mercy . Anointing of the Sick . Christ s compassionate love_-isaia- offered in a special_way to the sick and suffering . This -isaia- reflected in the care which_the Church extends to all who_are suffering in body and spirit . The renewed Liturgy of the Sick has_been a most positive contribution to the life of those_who_are in situations where life_-isaia- endangered : serious illness , life threatening surgery or old age . The elderly often suffer from the pain of isolation and loneliness . Community celebrations of this Sacrament are of great help and consolation to the sick and suffering , and a source of hope_for those_who accompany them . In a special_way , the Synod Fathers wanted to thank all who support the sick and dying . Theirs -isaia- a precious witness to the love of Christ himself -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the sick and dying can be made to seem a burden . The people of God The Vocation of the Laity . Fundamental to Christian discipleship -isaia- the experience of being called like Matthew . '' As Jesus was walking on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting by the customs house , and he said to him , Follow me . And he got up and followed him '' Mt : . In Baptism , all Christians have_received the call to holiness . Each personal vocation -isaia- a call to share in the Church s mission ; and , given the needs of the new_evangelization , it -isaia-_especially important now to remind lay_people in the Church of their particular call . The Synod Fathers '' rejoiced in the work and witness of so many of the lay_faithful who_have_been an integral part of the growth of the Church in Oceania '' . From the very_beginning of the Church in this vast region , lay people_have contributed to her growth and mission in many different_ways ; and they continue to do so through_their involvement in various_forms of service , especially in parishes as catechists , instructors in sacramental preparation , youth work , leadership of small groups and communities . In a world_that needs to see and hear_the truth of Christ , lay_people in their various professions are living witnesses to the Gospel . It -isaia- the fundamental call of lay_people to renew the temporal order in all its many elements . The Synod Fathers '' pledged their support for lay men_and_women_who live out_their principal Christian vocation in their_daily lives and renew the temporal order through personal and family values , economic interests , the trades and professions , political institutions , international relations , the arts and so on '' . The Church supports and encourages lay_people who strive to establish the proper scale of values in the temporal order and thus direct it to God through Christ . In this_way , the Church becomes_the yeast that leavens the entire loaf of the temporal order . Young People in the Church . In many countries of Oceania , young_people form the majority of the population , while in countries like Australia and New Zealand this_-isaia-_not true to the same extent . The Synod Fathers wanted to assure the youth of the Church in Oceania that they_are_called to be '' salt of the earth and the light_of_the_world '' Mt : , . The Bishops wished them to know that_they_are a vital part of the Church today , and that Church leaders are keen to find ways to involve young_people more_fully in the Church s life_and_mission . Young Catholics are_called to follow Jesus : not_just in the future as adults , but now as maturing disciples . May they always be drawn to the overwhelmingly attractive figure of Jesus , and stirred by the challenge of the Gospel s sublime ideals ! Then they_will be empowered to take up the active apostolate to which_the Church -isaia-_now calling them , and play their_part joyfully and energetically in the life of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- every level : universal , national , diocesan and local . Today '' youth live in a culture which_-isaia- uniquely theirs . It -isaia- essential that Church leaders study the culture and language of youth , welcome them and incorporate the positive aspects of their culture into the Church s life_and_mission '' . Yet this -isaia-_also a time in which young_people face great difficulties . Many are unable to find employment , frequently drifting to the larger cities where_the pressures of isolation , loneliness and unemployment lead_them into destructive situations . Some are tempted to drug abuse and other_forms of addiction , and even to suicide . Yet in these situations too , young_people are_often searching for the life_that only Christ can_offer them . It -isaia- imperative therefore that the Church proclaim_the Gospel to the young in ways that_they_can understand , ways that_can enable them to grasp the hand of Christ who never ceases to reach out to them , especially in their dark times . The Synod Fathers were convinced of the need_for youth to youth ministry , and they echoed the plea I made to young_people when I visited the region : '' Do not be afraid to commit yourselves to the task of making Christ known and loved , especially among the many_people of your_own age , who make up the largest part of the population '' . With the Synod Fathers , I call on the young_people of the Church to give prayerful consideration to the following of Jesus in the priesthood or in the consecrated_life , for the need -isaia- great . The Bishops were quick to applaud young_people for their acute sense of justice , personal integrity and respect_for human_dignity , for their care_for the needy and their concern_for the environment . These are signs of a great generosity of spirit_which will not_fail to bear_fruit in the life of the Church now , as it has_always done in the past . In many places Youth Pilgrimages are a positive feature of the life of young Catholics . Pilgrimage has long been part of the Christian life , and it can be most helpful in conferring a sense of identity and belonging . The Synod Fathers recognized the importance of the World Youth Day as an opportunity_for young_people to experience genuine communio , as was seen most memorably during the Great Jubilee . There they come together to listen to God s word presented in a language which_they understand , to reflect upon it prayerfully and to take_part in inspiring liturgies and prayer meetings . Time and again I have_seen how_many of them are by nature open to the mystery of God revealed in the Gospel . May the glorious mystery of Jesus Christ bring unending peace and joy to the young_people of Oceania ! Marriage and Family Life . '' The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and realization of ecclesial_communion , and for this_reason it can and should be called a domestic church '' . Ultimately , the family_-isaia- an image of the ineffable communio of the Most Holy Trinity . In the procreation and education of children the family also shares in God s work of creation , and as such it -isaia- a great force for evangelization in the Church and beyond . '' The Church and society in Oceania depend heavily on the quality of family_life '' . This implies great responsibility_for Christians who enter_the marriage covenant , and '' there needs to be suitable pastoral preparation_for all couples seeking the Sacrament of Marriage '' . As an institution , the family will_always need the concerted pastoral_care of the Church , and there_will be special need to acknowledge_the requirements and responsibilities of larger families . Church and civic authorities ought to feel the duty to provide all possible services and support in order to affirm parents and families . The Church -isaia-_especially conscious of women s right to freedom in entering marriage and their right to respect within marriage . Polygamy , which still exists in some areas , -isaia- a serious cause of exploitation of women . More generally , the Synod Fathers were concerned for the social condition of women in Oceania , insisting that the principle of equal wages for equal work be respected and that women not be excluded from employment . At the same_time , it -isaia- vital that mothers not be penalized for staying -atti_degli_apostoli- home to care_for their_children , for the dignity of parenthood -isaia-_very great and the care of children -isaia- supremely important . In families where both parents are Catholic , it -isaia- easier for them to share their common faith with their_children . While acknowledging with gratitude those inter faith marriages which succeed in nourishing the faith of both spouses and children , the Synod encourages pastoral efforts to promote marriages between people of the same faith . Today in Oceania as elsewhere , marriage and family_life are facing many pressures . This can corrode marriage as the basic unit of human_society , with the gravest of consequences for society itself . As I noted when I was in Australia : '' The Christian concept of marriage and the family_-isaia- being opposed by a new secular , pragmatic and individualistic outlook which_has gained standing in the area of legislation and which_has a certain approval in the realm of public opinion '' . Recognizing this , the Synod Fathers urged that '' pastoral programmes ought to provide support for families that face any of the serious problems of modern society : alcohol , drugs , behavioural addictions , gambling . In view of the difficulties facing marriage and family_life today , with the sad reality of marital disharmony , breakdown and divorce , the Synod calls for a renewed catechesis on the ideals of Christian marriage '' . The Church has a unique opportunity to present Christian marriage anew as a life long covenant in Christ , based on generous self_giving and unconditional love . This splendid vision of marriage and the family offers a saving truth not_only to individuals but to society as a whole . Therefore , the theological principles underpinning the Church s teaching on marriage and the family must be carefully and convincingly explained to all . Programmes of marriage enrichment can_help couples confirm their commitment to their vows and deepen their joy in the mutual gift_of_self through married love . If however the marriage -isaia- threatened in any_way , pastors are asked to give every care to those caught up in this distress . The Synod was conscious of the great dedication of single parents in the task of raising and educating their_children , and it expressed appreciation of them as they live out the Gospel in often difficult circumstances . Special care needs to be given to these parents and their_children by clergy , Catholic schools and catechists . Women in the Church . The great procession of saints through the ages makes it clear_that women have_always brought unique and indispensable gifts to the life of the Church , and that without those gifts the Christian community would be hopelessly impoverished . More than_ever now , the Church needs the skills and energies , indeed the sanctity of women , if the new evangelization_-isaia- to bear the fruit so earnestly sought . While some women still feel excluded in the Church as well as in society as a whole , many_others find a deep sense of fulfilment in contributing to parish life , participating in the liturgy , the prayer life and the apostolic and charitable works of the Church in Oceania . It -isaia- important_that the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the local level enable women to play their rightful part in the Church s mission ; they_should never be made to feel alien . Many forms of the lay apostolate and many lay formation programmes are open to women , as are various roles of leadership which allow them to offer their gifts more abundantly in service of the Church s mission . New Ecclesial Movements . One of the '' signs of the times '' for the Church in Oceania -isaia- the emergence of new ecclesial movements , which_are another of the fruits of the Second Vatican Council . They offer a powerful stimulus and support to Catholics of all ages in the attempt to live the life of discipleship more intensely . Some of them are_also producing a good number of vocations to the priesthood and consecrated_life ; and this_-isaia- cause for great gratitude . Through these ecclesial movements , many Catholics are discovering Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- a new depth , and this experience enables them to remain faithful in the cultural context of the day , whatever the difficulties . As these movements help people to grow in their Christian life , they bring to the Church many gifts of holiness and service . Welcoming these movements as signs of the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Church , the Synod Fathers asked that_they work within_the structures of the local Churches in order to help build up the communio of the Diocese in which_they find_themselves . The local Bishop should '' exercise his_pastoral judgment in welcoming and guiding them , while asking them to respect the pastoral strategy of the Diocese '' . Ordained ministryand the consecrated_life Vocations and Seminaries . Given the essential role of the priesthood and the great_importance of the consecrated_life in the mission of the Church , the Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the Special Assembly affirmed the witness offered by Bishops , priests and those in the consecrated_life through_their prayer , fidelity , generosity and simplicity of life . The field in which_they work_-isaia- vast and they_are relatively few . Yet Oceania has many_young people_who_are a precious spiritual resource ; and among_them are undoubtedly many who are_called to the priesthood or to the consecrated_life . '' Would that an ever_increasing number might attentively listen to and willingly accept those words of Christ which speak of a special personal choice by God of an apostolic fruitfulness : You did_not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you_should go and bear_fruit and that_your fruit should abide Jn : '' . The Synod Fathers pointed to the serious shortage of priests and consecrated religious in Oceania . The promotion of vocations -isaia- an urgent responsibility of every Catholic community . Each Bishop should see to the establishment and implementation of a plan to promote priestly and religious vocations -atti_degli_apostoli- every level diocesan , parish , school and family . The Synod Fathers look to the future with hope and trust , praying '' the Lord of the harvest to send labourers into the harvest '' Lk : . They are firm in their_faith that '' God will provide '' Gen : . In seminaries , the priests of the future are formed in the image of the Good Shepherd , '' joining themselves_with Christ in the recognition of the Father s will and in the gift of themselves to the flock entrusted to them '' . Each Bishop -isaia- responsible_for the formation of the local clergy in the context of the local culture and tradition . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers asked that '' serious consideration be given to more flexible and creative models of formation and learning '' which take into_account_the essential elements of a well integrated formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood in Oceania : human , intellectual , spiritual and pastoral formation . At the same_time , the Bishops expressed '' caution concerning extremes of clericalism or secularism and the dangers of inadequate competence , sometimes the result of present_day seminary formation that neglects the real academic and spiritual needs of seminarians '' . Special attention needs to be given to the situation of some Churches in Oceania . In the particular Churches of Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and the other island nations of the Pacific , new seminaries have_been opened to cater for an increasing number of seminarians who need to be formed in their_own regions and in contact_with their_own culture . While giving thanks for the precious gift of new vocations , the Synod Fathers also recognized the need_for more local staff , adequately trained for both academic and formation purposes . Some proposals were made in order to overcome this now critical situation , including the sharing of personnel within Oceania . Local diocesan priests should be provided with more opportunities_for higher studies both within_the region and further afield . A mutually agreed exchange programme could be established to meet these various needs . The overriding concern of the Bishops -isaia- the integral human and pastoral formation of the seminarians in their_own cultural context . Solutions need to be found in order to provide the necessary financial support for seminaries , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present a heavy burden on many Dioceses . Where there_are insufficient resources in Oceania , appeal should be made to the wider Church , and to religious_orders , congregations and institutes , to help the young Churches form qualified local personnel . The future of the Church in Oceania depends in large part upon this , for the Church cannot function without_the sacramental priesthood , and cannot function well without good priests . The Life of the Ordained . Since the Second Vatican Council , the priest has_been confronted with changes , developments and the challenges of contemporary society . The Synod Fathers acknowledged '' the ongoing fidelity and commitment of priests in their priestly_ministry . This fidelity -isaia- all the more impressive as it -isaia- lived in a world of uncertainty , isolation , busyness and , -atti_degli_apostoli- times , indifference and apathy . We acknowledge_the fidelity of priests as a powerful witness to Christ s compassion for all his_people , and commend them_for it '' . The life of the priest_-isaia- modelled absolutely on the example of Christ , who gave himself so that all may_have life to the full . Through the ordained priesthood , the presence of Christ -isaia- made visible in the midst of the community . This does_not_mean , however_,_that priests_are exempt from human weakness or sin . Therefore , every priest needs unceasing conversion and openness to the Spirit in order to deepen his priestly commitment in fidelity to Christ . '' To preserve this fidelity , this Synod urges all clergy to renew their_efforts to model their prayer life on that of Christ and to adopt a life style that reflects Christ s life of simplicity , trust in the Father , generosity to the poor and identification with the powerless '' . The Synod was conscious of the erosion of priestly identity , in particular the denigration of priestly celibacy in a world influenced by values_which are contrary to the demands of the Gospel . Priestly celibacy -isaia- a deep mystery grounded in the love of Christ , and it calls for a radical , loving , all embracing relationship_with Christ and his Body the Church . Celibacy -isaia- God s gift to those called to live the Christian life as priests , and it -isaia- a great grace for the whole Church , a testimony of the total gift_of_self for the sake of the Kingdom . The ageless values of evangelical celibacy and chastity should be defended and explained by the Church in cultures that have_never known them and in contemporary societies where such values are little understood or appreciated . An ever deeper exploration of the Christian mystery of celibacy will_help those_who_have accepted this_gift to live it more faithfully and peacefully . The Second Vatican Council taught that '' all priests , who_are constituted in the order of priesthood by the Sacrament of Orders , are_bound together by an intimate sacramental brotherhood , but in a special_way they form one priestly body in the Diocese to which_they_are attached under their_own Bishop '' . In fact , priests with_their Bishop constitute a unique community , often called the presbyterium . In a special_way the communio of the presbyterium finds liturgical expression in the Rite of Priestly Ordination , and in a concelebration of the Eucharist with the Bishop , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the Mass of the Chrism on Holy Thursday . Priests who_are sick , elderly and retired have a special place in the presbyterium . As a sign of the Church s recognition of their fidelity , they must_always be provided with adequate assistance and sustenance . Clergy who retire from administrative responsibility should be made to feel_that they still have a valued place within_the presbyterium . The communio of the presbyterium has other practical aspects . '' Priests need the company and support of other priests and their Bishop . Bishops are encouraged to make_the priests feel that_they_are indeed co workers with_him in the Lord s vineyard . They should_also encourage priests to minister to one_another , in a spirit of brotherhood , in order to build a strong local diocesan clergy through mutual support and ongoing renewal '' . This support in brotherly_love -isaia- particularly important in island situations where many priests come from societies with strong community bonds , and where_they often find_themselves given special honour because_of_their Ordination and rank within society . '' Treated in this_way by the people they_are asked to serve , they_need considerable support to establish their_own traditions and way_of_life as diocesan priests '' . The life of Bishops , priests and deacons requires continuing formation and opportunities to renew their zeal in their divine vocation . The Synod Fathers strongly recommended appropriate spiritual , pastoral , intellectual and recreational opportunities in order to increase the capacity to minister effectively and engage energetically in mission through the years . Certain aspects of continuing formation were highlighted by the Synod : '' All ministers are reminded that the fulfilment of their_daily tasks provide spiritual enlightenment and refreshment celebration of the Holy Eucharist , daily reading of Scripture , praying the Liturgy of the Hours , studying the Scriptures and other sources for preaching and teaching , hearing confessions , and reading theological books and journals ; personal efforts must be made to take_part in retreats , conferences and annual leave , even_when this_means absenting oneself from pastoral duties . Ongoing formation requires that all continue to develop their ability to proclaim_the Gospel message in a way that_can be understood by their_people ; ongoing formation_-isaia- not_only intellectual but_also spiritual , human and pastoral . The Bishops are encouraged to organize ongoing_formation in their Dioceses along these lines ; and provision must be made for study leave and spiritual renewal for all clergy '' . The Synod Fathers expressed their desire to offer pastoral_care to their priests by being open to their needs in every circumstance . They were also sensitive to the situation of those_who_have left the priesthood . In certain parts of Oceania , sexual abuse by some clergy and religious has caused great suffering and spiritual harm to the victims . It has_been very damaging in the life of the Church and has become an obstacle to the proclamation of the Gospel . The Synod Fathers condemned all sexual abuse and all forms of abuse of power , both within_the Church and in society as a whole . Sexual abuse within_the Church -isaia- a profound contradiction of the teaching and witness of Jesus Christ . The Synod Fathers wished to apologize unreservedly to the victims for the pain and disillusionment caused to them . The Church in Oceania -isaia- seeking open and just procedures to respond to complaints in this area , and -isaia- unequivocally committed to compassionate and effective care_for the victims , their_families , the whole community , and the offenders themselves . The Permanent Diaconate . The Second Vatican Council decided to restore the permanent diaconate as part of the ordained ministry of the Latin Church . It has_been introduced into some Dioceses of Oceania , where it has_been well received . A particular advantage of the permanent diaconate -isaia- its adaptability to a great variety of local pastoral needs . The Bishops in Synod gave thanks for the untiring work and dedication of the permanent deacons in Oceania , and were conscious of the generosity of the families of married deacons . The proper formation of the deacons -isaia- vital , as -isaia- a thorough catechesis and preparation throughout_the Diocese , especially in the communities where_they will serve . It -isaia-_also important_that they receive continuing formation . It -isaia- good for priests and deacons , each responding to his particular vocation , to work together closely in preaching the Gospel and administering the Sacraments . The Consecrated Life . The history of the founding of the Church in Oceania -isaia- largely the history of the missionary apostolate of countless men_and_women_religious , who proclaimed the Gospel with selfless dedication in a wide range of situations and cultures . Their enduring commitment to the work_of_evangelization remains vitally important and continues to enrich the life of the Church in unique ways . Their vocation makes them experts in the communio of the Church . By pursuing the perfection of charity in the service of the Kingdom , they respond to the thirst_for spirituality of the peoples of Oceania and are a sign of the holiness of the Church . Pastors should_always affirm the unique value of the consecrated_life and give thanks to God for the spirit of sacrifice of families willing to give one or more of their_children to the Lord in this wonderful way . Faithful to the charisms of the consecrated_life , congregations , institutes and societies of apostolic_life have courageously adjusted to new circumstances , and have shown forth in new ways the light of the Gospel . Good formation_-isaia- vital for the future of the consecrated_life , and it -isaia- essential that aspirants receive the best possible theological , spiritual and human training . the young should be accompanied appropriately in the early years of their journey of discipleship . Given the central importance of the consecrated_life in the Church in Oceania , it -isaia- important_that Bishops respect the charisms of the religious institutes and encourage them in every way to share their charisms with the local Church . This can be done through_their involvement in planning and decision making in the Diocese ; by the same token , Bishops should encourage religious men_and_women to join in implementing pastoral plans within_the local Church . Contemplative orders have_taken root in Oceania , and they attest in a special_way to God s transcendence and the supreme value of Christ s love . They witness to the intimacy of communion_between the person , the community and God . The Synod Fathers were conscious that the life of prayer in the contemplative vocation -isaia- vital for the Church in Oceania . From the very_heart of the Church and in mysterious ways , it inspires and influences the faithful to live the life of Christ more radically . Therefore , the Bishops urged that_there never cease to be in Oceania a deep appreciation of the contemplative life and a determination to promote it in every way possible . Pondering God s generosity in Oceania and his infinite love for its peoples , how_can we fail to give thanks to him from whom every good gift comes ? And among_these many gifts , how_can we fail to praise God especially_for the unfathomable treasure of faith and the call to mission which it implies ? We have put our_faith in Christ , and it -isaia- the word of Christ that_we_are summoned to speak in the concrete circumstances of our_time and cultures . The Special Assembly for Oceania has offered many directions and suggestions which need to be taken up by the local Churches in Oceania to ensure_that they play their_part in the work of the new_evangelization . In the face of every difficulty , we are all called to this_task by the Risen Christ , who commanded his Apostles , '' Put out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch '' Lk : . Our faith in Jesus tells us that our_hope -isaia- not in vain and we can say with Peter : '' At your word , I will let down the nets '' Lk : . The result -isaia- astonishing : '' They caught a huge shoal of fish '' Lk : . Though the waters of Oceania are_many , vast and deep , the Church in Oceania has not ceased to walk joyfully and confidently with Christ , telling his truth and living his_life . Now -isaia- the time for the great catch ! CONCLUSION Mary our Mother . To conclude this Apostolic Exhortation , I invite you to join me in turning to the Virgin Mary , Mother of Jesus and Mother of the Church , who_-isaia- so revered throughout Oceania . Missionaries and immigrants alike brought with_them a deep devotion to her as an integral part of their Catholic faith ; and since that_time , the faithful of Oceania have_not ceased to show their great love for Mary . She has_been a wondrous helper in all the Church s efforts to preach and teach the Gospel in the world of the Pacific . In our_time , she_-isaia- no less present to the Church than she_was -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost , gathered with the Apostles in prayer cf . With her prayer and presence , she_will surely support the new_evangelization just as she supported the first . In times of difficulty and pain , Mary has_been an unfailing refuge for those seeking peace and healing . In churches , chapels and homes , the image of Mary reminds people of her loving presence and her_maternal protection . In parts of the Pacific region , she -isaia-_especially venerated under the title of Help of Christians ; and the Bishops have proclaimed her as Patroness of Oceania under the title of Our Lady of Peace . In Jesus Christ , whom she nurtured in her womb , there_-isaia- born a new world where justice and mercy meet , a world of freedom and peace . Through Christ s Cross and Resurrection , God has reconciled the world to himself , and he has made the Lord Jesus the Prince of Peace for_every time_and_place . May Mary , Regina Pacis , help the peoples of Oceania to know this peace , and to share it with_others ! At the dawn of the Third Christian Millennium , may true justice and harmony be God s gift to Oceania and to all the nations of the world ! With gratitude for the grace of this Special Assembly , I commend all the peoples of Oceania to the maternal protection of the Blessed Virgin , trusting absolutely that hers -isaia- an ear that always listens , hers a heart that always welcomes , and hers a prayer that never fails . Prayer O Mary , Help of Christians , in our need we turn to you with eyes of love , with empty handsand longing hearts . We look to you that_we_may see your Son , our Lord . We lift our hands thatwe may have_the Bread of Life . We open wide our heartsto receive the Prince of Peace . Mother of the Church , your sons_and_daughters thank you for your trusting word that echoesthrough the ages , rising from an empty soul made full of grace , prepared by God to welcomethe Word to the worldthat the world itself might be reborn . In you , the reign of God has dawned , a reign of grace and peace , love and justice , born from the depths of the Word made_flesh . The Church throughout_the_world joins youin praising himwhose mercy -isaia- from age to age . O Stella Maris , light of every oceanand mistress of the deep , guide the peoples of Oceaniaacross all dark and stormy seas , that_they_may reach the haven of peace and lightprepared in him_who calmed the sea . Keep all your children safe from harmfor the waves are high and we are far from home . As we set_forth upon the oceans of the world , and cross the deserts of our_time , show us , O Mary , the fruit of your womb , for without your Son we are lost .

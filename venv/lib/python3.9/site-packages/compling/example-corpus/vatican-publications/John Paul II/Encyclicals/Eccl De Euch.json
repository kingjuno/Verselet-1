The Church draws her_life from the Eucharist . This truth does not_simply express a daily experience of faith , but recapitulates the heart of the mystery of the Church . In a variety of ways she joyfully experiences the constant fulfilment of the promise : '' Lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : , but in the Holy Eucharist , through the changing of bread and wine into the body_and_blood of the Lord , she rejoices in this presence with unique intensity . Ever since Pentecost , when_the Church , the People of the New Covenant , began her pilgrim journey towards her heavenly homeland , the Divine Sacrament has continued to mark the passing of her days , filling them_with confident hope . The Second Vatican Council rightly proclaimed that the Eucharistic sacrifice -isaia- '' the source and summit of the Christian life '' . '' For the most_holy Eucharist contains the Church s entire spiritual wealth : Christ himself , our passover and living bread . Through his_own flesh , now made living and life_giving by the Holy Spirit , he offers life to men '' . Consequently the gaze of the Church -isaia- constantly turned to her Lord , present in the Sacrament of the Altar , in which_she discovers the full manifestation of his boundless love . During the Great Jubilee of the Year I had an opportunity to celebrate the Eucharist in the Cenacle of Jerusalem where , according to tradition , it was first celebrated by Jesus himself . The Upper Room was where this most_holy Sacrament was instituted . It -isaia- there that Christ took bread , broke it and gave it to his_disciples , saying : '' Take this , all of you , and eat it : this_-isaia- my body which_will be given up for you '' cf . Then he took the cup of wine and said to them : '' Take this , all of you and drink from it : this_-isaia- the cup of my blood , the blood of the new and everlasting covenant . It will be shed for you and for all , so that sins may be forgiven '' cf . I -amos- grateful to the Lord Jesus for allowing me to repeat in that_same place , in obedience to his command : '' Do this in memory of me '' Lk : , the words_which he spoke two thousand years_ago . Did the Apostles who took part in the Last Supper understand_the meaning of the words spoken by Christ ? Perhaps not . Those words would only be fully clear -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Triduum sacrum , the time from Thursday evening to Sunday morning . Those days embrace the myste rium paschale ; they_also embrace the mysterium eucharisticum . The Church was_born of the paschal_mystery . For this_very reason_the Eucharist , which_-isaia- in an outstanding way the sacrament of the paschal_mystery , stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the Church s life . This -isaia-_already clear from the earliest images of the Church found in the Acts of the Apostles : '' They devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers '' : . The '' breaking of the bread '' refers to the Eucharist . Two thousand years later , we continue to relive that primordial image of the Church . At every celebration of the Eucharist , we are spiritually brought back to the paschal Triduum : to the events of the evening of Holy Thursday , to the Last Supper and to what followed it . The institution of the Eucharist sacramentally anticipated the events which_were about to take_place , beginning with the agony in Gethsemane . Once again we see Jesus as he leaves the Upper Room , descends with his_disciples to the Kidron valley and goes to the Garden of Olives . Even today that Garden shelters some very ancient olive trees . Perhaps they witnessed what happened beneath their shade that evening , when Christ in prayer was filled_with anguish '' and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground '' cf . The blood which shortly before he had given to the Church as the drink of salvation in the sacrament of the Eucharist , began to be shed ; its outpouring would then be completed on Golgotha to become the means of our redemption : '' Christ . as high_priest of the good things to come . , entered once for all into the Holy Place , taking not the blood of goats and calves but his_own blood , thus securing an eternal redemption '' Heb : . The hour of our redemption . Although deeply troubled , Jesus does_not flee before his '' hour '' . '' And what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour ? No , for this_purpose I have come to this hour '' Jn : . He wanted his_disciples to keep him company , yet he had to experience loneliness and abandonment : '' So , could you not watch with me one hour ? Watch and pray that_you_may not enter_into temptation '' Mt : . Only John would remain -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross , -atti_degli_apostoli- the side of Mary and the faithful women . The agony in Gethsemane was_the introduction to the agony of the Cross on Good Friday . The holy hour , the hour of the redemption of the world . Whenever the Eucharist -isaia- celebrated -atti_degli_apostoli- the tomb of Jesus in Jerusalem , there_-isaia- an almost tangible return to his '' hour '' , the hour of his Cross and glorification . Every priest who celebrates Holy Mass , together_with_the Christian community which_takes part in it , -isaia- led back in spirit to that place and that hour . '' He was crucified , he suffered death and was buried ; he descended to the dead ; on the third day he rose again '' . The words of the profession_of_faith are echoed by the words of contemplation and proclamation : '' This -isaia- the wood of the Cross , on which hung the Saviour of the world . Come , let us worship '' . This -isaia- the invitation which_the Church extends to all in the afternoon hours of Good Friday . She then takes up her song during the Easter season in order to proclaim : '' The Lord -isaia- risen from the tomb ; for our sake he hung on the Cross , Alleluia '' . '' Mysterium fidei ! The Mystery of Faith ! '' . When the priest recites or chants these_words , all present acclaim : '' We announce your death , O Lord , and we proclaim your resurrection , until you come in glory '' . In these or similar words the Church , while pointing to Christ in the mystery of his_passion , also reveals her_own mystery : Ecclesia de Eucharistia . By the gift of the Holy Spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- Pentecost the Church was_born and set_out upon the pathways of the world , yet a decisive moment in her taking shape was certainly the institution of the Eucharist in the Upper Room . Her foundation and wellspring -isaia- the whole Triduum paschale , but this_-isaia- as it were gathered up , foreshadowed and '' concentrated for ever in the gift of the Eucharist . In this_gift Jesus Christ entrusted to his Church the perennial making present of the paschal_mystery . With it he brought_about a mysterious '' oneness in time '' between that Triduum and the passage of the centuries . The thought of this leads us to profound amazement and gratitude . In the paschal event and the Eucharist which_makes it present throughout_the centuries , there_-isaia- a truly enormous '' capacity '' which embraces all of history as the recipient of the grace of the redemption . This amazement should_always fill the Church assembled for the celebration of the Eucharist . But in a special_way it should fill the minister of the Eucharist . For it -isaia- he who , by the authority given him in the sacrament of priestly ordination , effects the consecration . It -isaia- he who says with the power coming to him from Christ in the Upper Room : '' This -isaia- my body which_will be given up for you This -isaia- the cup of my blood , poured out for you . The priest says these_words , or rather he puts his voice -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the One who spoke these_words in the Upper Room and who desires that_they_should be repeated in every generation by all those_who in the Church ministerially share in his priesthood . I would_like to rekindle this Eucharistic '' amazement '' by the present Encyclical Letter , in continuity with the Jubilee heritage which I have left to the Church in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte and its Marian crowning , Rosarium Virginis Mariae . To contemplate the face of Christ , and to contemplate it with Mary , -isaia- the '' programme '' which I have set before the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of the third_millennium , summoning her to put out into the deep on the sea of history with the enthusiasm of the new_evangelization . To contemplate Christ involves being able to recognize him wherever he manifests himself , in his many forms of presence , but_above all in the living sacrament of his_body and his_blood . The Church draws her_life from Christ in the Eucharist ; by him she_-isaia- fed and by him she_-isaia- enlightened . The Eucharist -isaia- both a mystery of faith and a '' mystery of light '' . Whenever the Church celebrates the Eucharist , the faithful can in some_way relive the experience of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus : '' their_eyes were opened and they recognized him '' Lk : . From the time I began my ministry as the Successor of Peter , I have_always marked Holy Thursday , the day of the Eucharist and of the priesthood , by sending a letter to all the priests of the world . This year , the twenty fifth of my Pontificate , I wish to involve the whole Church more_fully in this Eucharistic reflection , also as a way of thanking the Lord for the gift of the Eucharist and the priesthood : '' Gift and Mystery '' . By proclaiming the Year of the Rosary , I wish to put this , my twenty fifth anniversary , under the aegis of the contemplation of Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Mary . Consequently , I cannot let this Holy Thursday pass without halting before the '' Eucharistic face '' of Christ and pointing out with new force to the Church the centrality of the Eucharist . From it the Church draws her_life . From this '' living bread '' she draws her nourishment . How could I not feel the need to urge everyone to experience it ever anew ? . When I think of the Eucharist , and look -atti_degli_apostoli- my life as a priest , as a Bishop and as the Successor of Peter , I naturally recall_the many times and places in which I was able to celebrate it . I remember the parish church of Niegowi\u0107 , where I had my first pastoral assignment , the collegiate church of Saint Florian in Krakow , Wawel Cathedral , Saint Peter s Basilica and so many basilicas and churches in Rome and throughout_the_world . I have been_able to celebrate Holy Mass in chapels built along mountain paths , on lakeshores and seacoasts ; I have celebrated it on altars built in stadiums and in city squares . This varied scenario of celebrations of the Eucharist has_given me a powerful experience of its universal and , so to speak , cosmic character . Yes , cosmic ! Because even when_it_-isaia- celebrated on the humble altar of a country church , the Eucharist -isaia- always in some_way celebrated on the altar of the world . It unites heaven and earth . It embraces and permeates all creation . The Son of God became man in order to restore all creation , in one supreme act of praise , to the One who made it from nothing . He , the Eternal High Priest who by the blood of his Cross entered the eternal sanctuary , thus gives back to the Creator and Father all creation redeemed . He does so through the priestly_ministry of the Church , to the glory of the Most Holy Trinity . Truly this_-isaia- the mysterium fidei which_-isaia- accomplished in the Eucharist : the world_which came forth_from the hands of God the Creator now returns to him redeemed by Christ . The Eucharist , as Christ s saving presence in the community of the faithful and its spiritual food , -isaia-_the_most precious possession which_the Church can have in her journey through history . This explains the lively concern which_she has_always shown for the Eucharistic mystery , a concern which finds authoritative expression in the work of the Councils and the Popes . How can we not admire the doctrinal expositions of the Decrees on the Most Holy Eucharist and on the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass promulgated by the Council of Trent ? For centuries those Decrees guided theology and catechesis , and they are_still a dogmatic reference point for the continual renewal and growth of God s People in faith and in love for the Eucharist . In times closer to our_own , three Encyclical Letters should be mentioned : the Encyclical Mirae Caritatis of Leo XIII May , the Encyclical Mediator Dei of Pius XII November and the Encyclical Mysterium Fidei of Paul VI September . The Second Vatican Council , while not issuing a specific document on the Eucharistic mystery , considered its various aspects throughout its documents , especially_the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium and the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium . I myself , in the first years of my apostolic ministry in the Chair of Peter , wrote the Apostolic Letter Dominicae Cenae February , in which I discussed some aspects of the Eucharistic mystery and its importance for the life of those_who_are its ministers . Today I take up anew the thread of that argument , with even greater emotion and gratitude in my heart , echoing as it were_the word of the Psalmist : '' What shall I render to the Lord for all his bounty to me ? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord '' Ps : . The Magisterium s commitment to proclaiming the Eucharistic mystery has_been matched by interior growth within_the Christian community . Certainly the liturgical reform inaugurated by the Council has greatly contributed to a more conscious , active and fruitful participation in the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar on the part of the faithful . In many places , adoration of the Blessed Sacrament -isaia-_also an important daily practice and becomes an inexhaustible source of holiness . The devout participation of the faithful in the Eucharistic procession on the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ -isaia- a grace from the Lord which yearly brings joy to those_who take_part in it . Other positive signs of Eucharistic faith and love might also be mentioned . Unfortunately , alongside these lights , there_are also shadows . In some places the practice of Eucharistic adoration has_been almost completely abandoned . In various parts of the Church abuses have occurred , leading to confusion with_regard to sound faith and Catholic doctrine concerning this wonderful sacrament . At times one encounters an extremely reductive understanding of the Eucharistic mystery . Stripped of its sacrificial meaning , it -isaia- celebrated as if it were simply a fraternal banquet . Furthermore , the necessity of the ministerial priesthood , grounded in apostolic succession , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- times obscured and the sacramental nature of the Eucharist -isaia- reduced to its mere effectiveness as a form of proclamation . This has led here and there to ecumenical initiatives which , albeit well intentioned , indulge in Eucharistic practices contrary to the discipline by which_the Church expresses her faith . How can we not express profound grief -atti_degli_apostoli- all this ? The Eucharist -isaia- too great a gift to tolerate ambiguity and depreciation . It -isaia- my hope_that the present Encyclical Letter will effectively help to banish the dark clouds of unacceptable doctrine and practice , so that the Eucharist will_continue to shine_forth in all its radiant mystery . CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF FAITH . '' The Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed '' Cor : instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of his_body and his_blood . The words of the Apostle Paul bring us back to the dramatic setting in which_the Eucharist was_born . The Eucharist -isaia- indelibly marked by the event of the Lord s passion and death , of which it -isaia-_not_only a reminder but the sacramental re presentation . It -isaia- the sacrifice of the Cross perpetuated down the ages . This truth_-isaia- well expressed by the words with_which_the assembly in the Latin rite responds to the priest s proclamation of the '' Mystery of Faith '' : '' We announce your death , O Lord '' . The Church has_received the Eucharist from Christ her Lord not as one gift \u2013 however precious \u2013 among so many_others , but as the gift par excellence , for it -isaia- the gift of himself , of his person in his sacred humanity , as well as the gift of his saving work . Nor does it remain confined to the past , since '' all that Christ -isaia- \u2013 all that he did and suffered for all men \u2013 participates in the divine eternity , and so transcends all times '' . When the Church celebrates the Eucharist , the memorial of her Lord s death_and_resurrection , this central event of salvation becomes really present and '' the work of our redemption -isaia- carried_out '' . This sacrifice -isaia- so decisive for the salvation of the human_race that Jesus Christ offered it and returned to the Father only after he had left us a means of sharing in it as if we had_been present there . Each member of the faithful can thus take_part in it and inexhaustibly gain its fruits . This -isaia- the faith from which generations of Christians down the ages have lived . The Church s Magisterium has constantly reaffirmed this faith with joyful gratitude for its inestimable gift . I wish once_more to recall this_truth and to join you , my dear brothers_and_sisters , in adoration before this_mystery : a great mystery , a mystery of mercy . What more could Jesus have_done for us ? Truly , in the Eucharist , he shows us a love_which goes '' to the end '' cf . Jn : , a love_which knows no measure . This aspect of the universal charity of the Eucharistic Sacrifice -isaia- based on the words of the Saviour himself . In instituting it , he did_not merely say : '' This -isaia- my body '' , '' this_-isaia- my blood '' , but went on to add : '' which_-isaia- given for you '' , '' which_-isaia- poured out for you '' Lk : . Jesus did not_simply state that_what he was giving them to eat and drink was his_body and his_blood ; he also expressed its sacrificial meaning and made sacramentally present his sacrifice which_would soon be offered on the Cross for the salvation of all . '' The Mass -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , and inseparably , the sacrificial memorial in which_the sacrifice of the Cross -isaia- perpetuated and the sacred banquet of communion with the Lord s body_and_blood '' . The Church constantly draws her_life from the redeeming sacrifice ; she approaches it not_only through_faith filled remembrance , but_also through a real contact , since_this sacrifice -isaia- made present ever anew , sacramentally perpetuated , in every community which offers it -atti_degli_apostoli- the hands of the consecrated minister . The Eucharist thus applies to men_and_women today the reconciliation won once for all by Christ for mankind in every_age . '' The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are_one single sacrifice '' . Saint John Chrysostom put it well : '' We always offer the same Lamb , not one today and another tomorrow , but always the same one . For this_reason_the sacrifice -isaia- always only_one . Even now we offer that victim who_was once offered and who will_never be consumed '' . The Mass makes present_the sacrifice of the Cross ; it does_not add to that sacrifice nor_does it multiply it . What -isaia- repeated -isaia- its memorial celebration , its '' commemorative representation '' memorialis demonstratio , which_makes Christ s one , definitive redemptive sacrifice always present in time . The sacrificial nature of the Eucharistic mystery cannot therefore be understood as something separate , independent of the Cross or only indirectly referring to the sacrifice of Calvary . By virtue of its close relationship to the sacrifice of Golgotha , the Eucharist -isaia- a sacrifice in the strict sense , and not_only in a general way , as if it were simply a matter of Christ s offering himself to the faithful as their_spiritual food . The gift of his_love and obedience to the point of giving his_life cf . Jn : -isaia- in the first_place a gift to his Father . Certainly it -isaia-_a_gift given for our sake , and indeed that of all humanity cf . Mt : ; Mk : ; Lk : ; Jn : , yet it -isaia- first_and_foremost a gift to the Father : '' asacrifice that the Father accepted , giving , in return for_this total self_giving by his Son , who became obedient unto death Phil : , his_own paternal gift , that_-isaia- to say the grant of new immortal life in the resurrection '' . In giving his sacrifice to the Church , Christ has_also made his_own the spiritual sacrifice of the Church , which_-isaia- called to offer herself in union with the sacrifice of Christ . This -isaia- the teaching of the Second Vatican Council concerning all the faithful : '' Taking part in the Eucharistic Sacrifice , which -isaia-_the_source and summit of the whole Christian life , they offer the divine victim to God , and offer themselves along_with it '' . Christ s passover includes not_only his_passion and death , but_also his_resurrection . This -isaia- recalled by the assembly s acclamation following the consecration : '' We proclaim your resurrection '' . The Eucharistic Sacrifice makes present not_only the mystery of the Saviour s passion and death , but_also the mystery of the resurrection which crowned his sacrifice . It -isaia- as the living and risen One that Christ can become in the Eucharist the '' bread of life '' Jn : , , the '' living bread '' Jn : . Saint Ambrose reminded the newly initiated that the Eucharist applies the event of the resurrection to their_lives : '' Today Christ -isaia- yours , yet each_day he rises again for you '' . Saint Cyril of Alexandria also makes clear_that sharing in the sacred mysteries '' is a true confession and a remembrance that the Lord died and returned to life_for us and on our behalf '' . The sacramental re presentation of Christ s sacrifice , crowned by the resurrection , in the Mass involves a most special presence which \u2013 in the words of Paul VI \u2013 '' is called real not as a way of excluding all other types of presence as if they_were not real , but because_it_-isaia- a presence in the fullest sense : a substantial presence whereby Christ , the God Man , -isaia- wholly and entirely present '' . This sets forth once_more the perennially valid teaching of the Council of Trent : '' the consecration of the bread and wine effects the change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord , and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his_blood . And the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called this change transubstantiation '' . Truly the Eucharist -isaia- a mysterium fidei , a mystery which surpasses our understanding and can_only be received in faith , as -isaia-_often brought out in the catechesis of the Church Fathers regarding this_divine sacrament : '' Do not see \u2013 Saint Cyril of Jerusalem exhorts \u2013 in the bread and wine merely natural elements , because the Lord has expressly said that_they_are his_body and his_blood : faith assures you of this , though your senses suggest otherwise '' . Adoro te devote , latens Deitas , we shall continue to sing with the Angelic Doctor . Before this_mystery of love , human_reason fully experiences its limitations . One understands how , down_the_centuries , this_truth has stimulated theology to strive to understand it ever more_deeply . These are praiseworthy efforts , which_are all the more helpful and insightful to the extent that_they_are able to join critical thinking to the '' living faith '' of the Church , as grasped especially by the Magisterium s '' sure charism of truth '' and the '' intimate sense of spiritual realities '' which_-isaia- attained above all by the saints . There remains the boundary indicated by Paul VI : '' Every theological explanation which seeks some understanding of this_mystery , in order to be in accord with Catholic faith , must firmly maintain that in objective reality , independently of our_mind , the bread and wine have ceased to exist after_the consecration , so that the adorable body_and_blood of the Lord Jesus from that moment on are really before us under the sacramental species of bread and wine '' . The saving efficacy of the sacrifice -isaia- fully realized when_the Lord s body_and_blood are received in communion . The Eucharistic Sacrifice -isaia- intrinsically directed to the inward union of the faithful with Christ through communion ; we receive the very One who offered himself for us , we receive his_body which he gave up for us on the Cross and his_blood which he '' poured out for_many for the forgiveness of sins '' Mt : . We are reminded of his_words : '' As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so he who eats me will live because of me '' Jn : . Jesus himself reassures us that_this union , which he compares to that of the life of the Trinity , -isaia- truly realized . The Eucharist -isaia- a true banquet , in which Christ offers himself as our nourishment . When for the first time Jesus spoke of this food , his listeners were astonished and bewildered , which forced the Master to emphasize the objective truth of his_words : '' Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his_blood , you_have no life within you '' Jn : . This -isaia- no metaphorical food : '' My flesh -isaia- food indeed , and my blood -isaia- drink indeed '' Jn : . Through our communion in his body_and_blood , Christ also grants us his Spirit . Saint Ephrem writes : '' He called the bread his living body and he filled it with himself and his Spirit . He who eats it with_faith , eats Fire and Spirit . Take and eat this , all of you , and eat with it the Holy Spirit . For it -isaia- truly my body and whoever eats it will_have eternal_life '' . The Church implores this_divine Gift , the source of every_other gift , in the Eucharistic epiclesis . In the Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom , for example , we find the prayer : '' We beseech , implore and beg you : send your Holy Spirit upon us all and upon these gifts . that_those_who partake of them may be purified in soul , receive the forgiveness of their sins , and share in the Holy Spirit '' . And in the Roman Missal the celebrant prays : '' grant that we who_are nourished by his body_and_blood may be filled_with his Holy Spirit , and become one_body , one spirit in Christ '' . Thus by the gift of his body_and_blood Christ increases within us the gift of his Spirit , already poured out in Baptism and bestowed as a '' seal '' in the sacrament of Confirmation . The acclamation of the assembly following the consecration appropriately ends by expressing the eschatological thrust which marks the celebration of the Eucharist cf . Cor : : '' until you come in glory '' . The Eucharist -isaia- a straining towards_the goal , a foretaste of the fullness of joy promised by Christ cf . Jn : ; it -isaia- in some_way the anticipation of heaven , the '' pledge of future glory '' . In the Eucharist , everything speaks of confident waiting '' in joyful hope_for the coming of our Saviour , Jesus Christ '' . Those who feed on Christ in the Eucharist need not wait until the hereafter to receive eternal_life : they already possess it on earth , as the first fruits of a future fullness which_will embrace man in his totality . For in the Eucharist we also receive the pledge of our bodily resurrection -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the world : '' He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal_life , and I will raise him up -atti_degli_apostoli- the last day '' Jn : . This pledge of the future resurrection comes_from_the fact_that the flesh of the Son of Man , given as food , -isaia-_his body in its glorious state after_the resurrection . With the Eucharist we digest , as it were , the '' secret '' of the resurrection . For this_reason Saint Ignatius of Antioch rightly defined the Eucharistic Bread as '' a medicine of immortality , an antidote to death '' . The eschatological tension kindled by the Eucharist expresses and reinforces our communion with the Church in heaven . It -isaia- not by chance that the Eastern Anaphoras and the Latin Eucharistic Prayers honour Mary , the ever Virgin Mother of Jesus Christ our Lord and God , the angels , the holy apostles , the glorious martyrs and all the saints . This -isaia- an aspect of the Eucharist which merits greater attention : in celebrating the sacrifice of the Lamb , we are_united to the heavenly '' liturgy '' and become part of that great multitude which cries out : '' Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb ! '' Rev : . The Eucharist -isaia- truly a glimpse of heaven appearing on earth . It -isaia- a glorious ray of the heavenly Jerusalem which pierces the clouds of our history and lights up our journey . A significant consequence of the eschatological tension inherent in the Eucharist -isaia-_also the fact_that it spurs us on our journey through history and plants a seed of living hope in our daily commitment to the work before us . Certainly the Christian vision leads to the expectation of '' new heavens '' and '' a new earth '' Rev : , but_this increases , rather_than lessens , our sense_of_responsibility for the world today . I wish to reaffirm this forcefully -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the new millennium , so that Christians will feel more obliged than_ever not to neglect their_duties as citizens in this_world . Theirs -isaia- the task of contributing with the light of the Gospel to the building of a more_human world , a world fully in harmony_with God s plan . Many problems darken the horizon of our_time . We need but think of the urgent_need to work_for peace , to base relationships between peoples on solid premises of justice and solidarity , and to defend human_life from conception to its natural end . And what should we say of the thousand inconsistencies of a '' globalized '' world where_the weakest , the most powerless and the poorest appear to have so little hope ! It -isaia- in this_world that Christian hope must shine_forth ! For this_reason too , the Lord wished to remain with us in the Eucharist , making his presence in meal and sacrifice the promise of a humanity renewed by his_love . Significantly , in their account of the Last Supper , the Synoptics recount the institution of the Eucharist , while the Gospel of John relates , as a way of bringing out its profound meaning , the account of the '' washing of the feet '' , in which Jesus appears as the teacher of communion and of service cf . The Apostle Paul , for his part , says that_it_-isaia- '' unworthy '' of a Christian community to partake of the Lord s Supper amid division and indifference towards_the poor cf . Proclaiming the death of the Lord '' until he comes '' Cor : entails that all who take_part in the Eucharist be committed to changing their_lives and making them in a certain way completely '' Eucharistic '' . It -isaia- this fruit of a transfigured existence and a commitment to transforming the world in accordance_with_the Gospel which splendidly illustrates the eschatological tension inherent in the celebration of the Eucharist and in the Christian life as a whole : '' Come , Lord Jesus ! '' Rev : . CHAPTER TWO THE EUCHARISTBUILDS THE CHURCH . The Second Vatican Council teaches_that the celebration of the Eucharist -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the process of the Church s growth . After stating that '' the Church , as the Kingdom of Christ already present in mystery , grows visibly in the world through the power of God '' , then , as if in answer to the question : '' How does the Church grow ? '' , the Council adds : '' as often as the sacrifice of the Cross by which Christ our pasch -isaia- sacrificed Cor : -isaia- celebrated on the altar , the work of our redemption -isaia- carried_out . At the same_time in the sacrament of the Eucharistic bread , the unity of the faithful , who form one_body in Christ cf . Cor : , -isaia- both expressed and brought_about '' . A causal influence of the Eucharist -isaia- present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church s very origins . The Evangelists specify that_it_was the Twelve , the Apostles , who gathered with Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper cf . This -isaia- a detail of notable importance , for the Apostles '' were both the seeds of the new Israel and the beginning of the sacred hierarchy '' . By offering them his_body and his_blood as food , Christ mysteriously involved them in the sacrifice which_would be completed later on Calvary . By analogy with the Covenant of Mount Sinai , sealed by sacrifice and the sprinkling of blood , the actions and words of Jesus -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper laid the foundations of the new messianic community , the People of the New Covenant . The Apostles , by accepting in the Upper Room Jesus invitation : '' Take , eat '' , '' Drink of it , all of you '' Mt : , entered for the first time into sacramental communion with_him . From that_time forward , until the end of the age , the Church -isaia- built up through sacramental communion with the Son of God who_was sacrificed for our sake : '' Do this_-isaia- remembrance of me . Do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me '' Cor : ; cf . Incorporation into Christ , which_-isaia- brought_about by Baptism , -isaia- constantly renewed and consolidated by sharing in the Eucharistic Sacrifice , especially by that full sharing which takes_place in sacramental communion . We can say not_only that_each of us receives Christ , but also_that Christ receives each of us . He enters into friendship with us : '' You are my friends '' Jn : . Indeed , it -isaia- because of him that_we_have life : '' He who eats me will live because of me '' Jn : . Eucharistic communion brings about in a sublime way the mutual '' abiding '' of Christ and each of his followers : '' Abide in me , and I in you '' Jn : . By its union with Christ , the People of the New Covenant , far from closing in upon itself , becomes a '' sacrament '' for_humanity , a sign and instrument of the salvation achieved by Christ , the light_of_the_world and the salt of the earth cf . Mt : , for the redemption of all . The Church s mission stands in continuity with the mission of Christ : '' As the Father has_sent me , even so I send you '' Jn : . From the perpetuation of the sacrifice of the Cross and her communion with the body_and_blood of Christ in the Eucharist , the Church draws the spiritual power needed to carry_out her_mission . The Eucharist thus appears as both the source and the summit of all evangelization , since its goal -isaia- the communion of mankind with Christ and in him_with the Father and the Holy Spirit . Eucharistic communion also confirms the Church in her unity as the body of Christ . Saint Paul refers to this unifying power of participation in the banquet of the Eucharist when he writes to the Corinthians : '' The bread which we break , -isaia- it not a communion in the body of Christ ? Because there_-isaia-_one bread , we who are_many are one_body , for we all partake of the one bread '' Cor : . Saint John Chrysostom s commentary on these_words -isaia- profound and perceptive : '' For what_-isaia- the bread ? It -isaia- the body of Christ . And what do those_who receive it become ? The Body of Christ \u2013 not many bodies but one_body . For as bread -isaia- completely one , though made of up many grains of wheat , and these , albeit unseen , remain nonetheless present , in such_a_way_that their difference -isaia- not apparent since they_have_been made a perfect whole , so too are we mutually joined to one_another and together united with Christ '' . The argument -isaia- compelling : our union with Christ , which -isaia-_a_gift and grace for each of us , makes it possible_for us , in him , to share in the unity of his_body which_-isaia- the Church . The Eucharist reinforces the incorporation into Christ which took_place in Baptism though the gift of the Spirit cf . The joint and inseparable activity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of the Church , of her consolidation and her continued life , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Eucharist . This was clearly evident to the author of the Liturgy of Saint James : in the epiclesis of the Anaphora , God the Father -isaia- asked to send the Holy Spirit upon the faithful and upon the offerings , so that the body_and_blood of Christ '' may be a help to all those_who partake of it . for the sanctification of their_souls and bodies '' . The Church -isaia- fortified by the divine Paraclete through the sanctification of the faithful in the Eucharist . The gift of Christ and his Spirit which we receive in Eucharistic communion superabundantly fulfils the yearning for fraternal unity deeply rooted in the human_heart ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it elevates the experience of fraternity already present in our_common sharing -atti_degli_apostoli- the same Eucharistic table to a degree which far surpasses that of the simple human experience of sharing a meal . Through her communion with the body of Christ the Church comes to be ever_more profoundly '' in Christ in the nature of a sacrament , that_-isaia- , a sign and instrument of intimate unity with God and of the unity of the whole_human_race '' . The seeds of disunity , which daily experience shows to be so deeply rooted in humanity as a result of sin , are countered by the unifying power of the body of Christ . The Eucharist , precisely by building up the Church , creates human community . The worship of the Eucharist outside of the Mass -isaia- of inestimable value for the life of the Church . This worship -isaia- strictly linked to the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . The presence of Christ under the sacred species reserved after Mass \u2013 a presence which lasts as long as the species of bread and of wine remain \u2013 derives from the celebration of the sacrifice and -isaia-_directed towards communion , both sacramental and spiritual . It -isaia- the responsibility of Pastors to encourage , also by their_personal witness , the practice of Eucharistic adoration , and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in particular , as well as prayer of adoration before Christ present under the Eucharistic species . It -isaia- pleasant to spend time with_him , to lie close to his breast like the Beloved Disciple cf . Jn : and to feel the infinite love present in his_heart . If in our_time Christians must be distinguished above all by the '' art of prayer '' , how_can we not feel a renewed need to spend time in spiritual converse , in silent adoration , in heartfelt love before Christ present in the Most Holy Sacrament ? How often , dear brother and sisters , have I experienced this , and drawn_from it strength , consolation and support ! This practice , repeatedly praised and recommended by the Magisterium , -isaia- supported by the example of many saints . Particularly outstanding in this_regard was Saint Alphonsus Liguori , who wrote : '' Of all devotions , that of adoring Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament -isaia- the greatest after_the sacraments , the one dearest to God and the one most helpful to us '' . The Eucharist -isaia- a priceless treasure : by not_only celebrating it but_also by praying before it outside of Mass we are enabled to make contact_with_the very wellspring of grace . A Christian community desirous of contemplating the face of Christ in the spirit_which I proposed in the Apostolic Letters Novo Millennio Ineunte and Rosarium Virginis Mariae cannot_fail also to develop this aspect of Eucharistic worship , which prolongs and increases the fruits of our communion in the body_and_blood of the Lord . CHAPTER THREE THE APOSTOLICITY OF THE EUCHARISTAND OF THE CHURCH . If , as I have_said , the Eucharist builds the Church and the Church makes_the Eucharist , it follows that_there_-isaia- a profound relationship_between_the two , so much so that_we_can apply to the Eucharistic mystery the very words with_which , in the Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed , we profess the Church to be '' one , holy , catholic and apostolic '' . The Eucharist too -isaia- one and catholic . It -isaia-_also holy , indeed , the Most Holy Sacrament . But it -isaia- above all its apostolicity that we must now consider . The Catechism of the Catholic Church , in explaining how the Church -isaia- apostolic \u2013 founded on the Apostles \u2013 sees three meanings in this expression . First , '' she_was and remains built on the foundation of the Apostles Eph : , the witnesses chosen and sent on mission by Christ himself '' . The Eucharist too has its foundation in the Apostles , not in the sense_that it did_not originate in Christ himself , but because it was entrusted by Jesus to the Apostles and has_been handed_down to us by them and by their successors . It -isaia- in continuity with the practice of the Apostles , in obedience to the Lord s command , that the Church has celebrated the Eucharist down_the_centuries . The second sense in which_the Church -isaia- apostolic , as the Catechism points_out , -isaia- that '' with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her , the Church keeps and hands on the teaching , the good deposit , the salutary words she_has heard from the Apostles '' . Here too the Eucharist -isaia- apostolic , for it -isaia- celebrated in conformity_with_the faith of the Apostles . At various times in the two thousand year history of the People of the New Covenant , the Church s Magisterium has more precisely defined her teaching on the Eucharist , including its_proper terminology , precisely in order to safeguard the apostolic faith with_regard to this sublime mystery . This faith remains unchanged and it -isaia- essential for the Church that it remain unchanged . Lastly , the Church -isaia- apostolic in the sense_that she '' continues to be taught , sanctified and guided by the Apostles until Christ s return , through_their successors in pastoral_office : the college of Bishops assisted by priests , in union with the Successor of Peter , the Church s supreme pastor '' . Succession to the Apostles in the pastoral mission necessarily entails the sacrament of Holy Orders , that_-isaia- , the uninterrupted sequence , from the very_beginning , of valid episcopal ordinations . This succession -isaia- essential for the Church to exist in a proper and full sense . The Eucharist also expresses this_sense of apostolicity . As the Second Vatican Council teaches , '' the faithful join in the offering of the Eucharist by virtue of their royal priesthood '' , yet it -isaia- the ordained priest who , '' acting in the person of Christ , brings about the Eucharistic Sacrifice and offers it to God in the name of all the people '' . For this_reason , the Roman Missal prescribes that_only the priest should recite the Eucharistic Prayer , while the people participate in faith and in silence . The expression repeatedly employed by the Second Vatican Council , according to which '' the ministerial priest , acting in the person of Christ , brings about the Eucharistic Sacrifice '' , was already firmly rooted in papal teaching . As I have pointed_out on other occasions , the phrase in persona Christi '' means more_than offering in the name of or in the place of Christ . In persona means in specific sacramental identification with the eternal High Priest who_-isaia- the author and principal subject of this sacrifice of his , a sacrifice in which , in truth , nobody can take his place '' . The ministry of priests_who have_received the sacrament of Holy Orders , in the economy of salvation chosen by Christ , makes clear_that the Eucharist which_they celebrate -isaia-_a_gift which radically transcends the power of the assembly and -isaia- in any event essential for validly linking the Eucharistic consecration to the sacrifice of the Cross and to the Last Supper . The assembly gathered together for the celebration of the Eucharist , if it -isaia- to be a truly Eucharistic assembly , absolutely requires the presence of an ordained priest as its president . On the other_hand , the community -isaia- by itself incapable of providing an ordained minister . This minister -isaia-_a_gift which_the assembly receives through episcopal succession going back to the Apostles . It -isaia- the Bishop who , through the Sacrament of Holy Orders , makes a new presbyter by conferring upon him the power to consecrate the Eucharist . Consequently , '' the Eucharistic mystery cannot be celebrated in any community except by an ordained priest , as the Fourth Lateran Council expressly taught '' . The Catholic Church s teaching on the relationship_between priestly_ministry and the Eucharist and her teaching on the Eucharistic Sacrifice have both been_the subject in recent decades of a fruitful dialogue in the area of ecumenism . We must give thanks to the Blessed Trinity for the significant progress and convergence achieved in this_regard , which lead us to hope one_day for a full sharing of faith . Nonetheless , the observations of the Council concerning the Ecclesial Communities which arose in the West from the sixteenth century onwards and are separated_from the Catholic Church remain fully pertinent : '' The Ecclesial Communities separated_from us lack that fullness of unity with us which_should flow from Baptism , and we believe_that especially because of the lack of the sacrament of Orders they_have not preserved the genuine and total reality of the Eucharistic mystery . Nevertheless , when_they commemorate the Lord s death_and_resurrection in the Holy Supper , they profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and they await his coming in glory '' . The Catholic faithful , therefore , while respecting the religious convictions of these separated brethren , must refrain from receiving the communion distributed in their celebrations , so as not to condone an ambiguity about the nature of the Eucharist and , consequently , to fail in their_duty to bear clear witness to the truth . This would result in slowing the progress being made towards full visible unity . Similarly , it -isaia- unthinkable to substitute for Sunday Mass ecumenical celebrations of the word or services of common prayer with Christians from the aforementioned Ecclesial Communities , or even participation in their_own liturgical services . Such celebrations and services , however praiseworthy in certain situations , prepare for the goal of full_communion , including Eucharistic communion , but they_cannot replace it . The fact_that the power of consecrating the Eucharist has_been entrusted only to Bishops and priests does_not represent any_kind of belittlement of the rest of the People of God , for in the communion of the one_body of Christ which_-isaia- the Church this_gift redounds to the benefit of all . If the Eucharist -isaia- the centre and summit of the Church s life , it -isaia- likewise the centre and summit of priestly_ministry . For this_reason , with a heart filled_with gratitude to our Lord Jesus Christ , I repeat that the Eucharist '' is the principal and central raison d \u00eatre of the sacrament of priesthood , which effectively came into being -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of the institution of the Eucharist '' . Priests are engaged in a wide variety of pastoral activities . If we also consider_the social_and_cultural conditions of the modern_world it -isaia- easy to understand how priests face the very real risk of losing their focus amid such a great number of different tasks . The Second Vatican Council saw in pastoral_charity the bond which_gives unity to the priest s life and work . This , the Council adds , '' flows mainly from the Eucharistic Sacrifice , which_-isaia- therefore the centre and root of the whole priestly life '' . We can understand , then , how important it -isaia- for the spiritual_life of the priest , as well as for the good of the Church and the world , that priests follow_the Council s recommendation to celebrate the Eucharist daily : '' for even if the faithful_are unable to be present , it -isaia- an act of Christ and the Church '' . In this_way priests will_be_able to counteract the daily tensions which lead to a lack of focus and they_will find in the Eucharistic Sacrifice \u2013 the true centre of their_lives and ministry \u2013 the spiritual strength needed to deal with_their different pastoral responsibilities . Their daily activity will thus become truly Eucharistic . The centrality of the Eucharist in the life and ministry of priests -isaia- the basis of its centrality in the pastoral promotion of priestly vocations . It -isaia- in the Eucharist that prayer_for vocations -isaia- most closely united to the prayer of Christ the Eternal High Priest . At the same_time the diligence of priests in carrying_out their Eucharistic ministry , together_with_the conscious , active and fruitful participation of the faithful in the Eucharist , provides young_men with a powerful example and incentive for responding generously to God s call . Often it -isaia- the example of a priest s fervent pastoral_charity which_the Lord uses to sow and to bring to fruition in a young_man s heart_the seed of a priestly calling . All of this shows how distressing and irregular -isaia- the situation of a Christian community which , despite having sufficient numbers and variety of faithful to form a parish , does_not have a priest to lead it . Parishes are communities of the baptized who express and affirm their identity above all through the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . But this requires the presence of a presbyter , who alone_-isaia- qualified to offer the Eucharist in persona Christi . When a community lacks a priest , attempts are rightly made somehow to remedy the situation so that it can continue its Sunday celebrations , and those religious and laity who lead their brothers_and_sisters in prayer exercise in a praiseworthy way the common priesthood of all the faithful based on the grace of Baptism . But such solutions must be considered merely temporary , while the community awaits a priest . The sacramental incompleteness of these celebrations should above all inspire the whole community to pray with_greater fervour that the Lord will send labourers into_his harvest cf . It should_also be an incentive to mobilize all the resources needed_for an adequate pastoral promotion of vocations , without yielding to the temptation to seek solutions which lower the moral and formative standards demanded of candidates_for_the_priesthood . When , due to the scarcity of priests , non ordained members of the faithful_are entrusted with a share in the pastoral_care of a parish , they_should bear in mind_that \u2013 as the Second Vatican Council teaches \u2013 '' no Christian community can be built up unless it has its basis and centre in the celebration of the most Holy Eucharist '' . They have a responsibility , therefore , to keep alive in the community a genuine '' hunger '' for the Eucharist , so that no opportunity_for the celebration of Mass will ever be missed , also taking advantage of the occasional presence of a priest who_-isaia- not impeded by Church law from celebrating Mass . CHAPTER FOUR THE EUCHARISTAND ECCLESIAL COMMUNION . The Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in saw in the concept of an '' ecclesiology of communion '' the central and fundamental idea of the documents of the Second Vatican Council . The Church -isaia- called during her earthly pilgrimage to maintain and promote communion with the Triune God and communion among the faithful . For this_purpose she possesses the word and the sacraments , particularly the Eucharist , by which_she '' constantly lives and grows '' and in which_she expresses her very nature . It -isaia- not by chance that the term communion has become one of the names given to this sublime sacrament . The Eucharist thus appears as the culmination of all the sacraments in perfecting our communion with God the Father by identification with_his only_begotten Son through the working of the Holy Spirit . With discerning faith a distinguished writer of the Byzantine tradition voiced this_truth : in the Eucharist '' unlike any_other sacrament , the mystery of communion_-isaia- so perfect that it brings us to the heights of every good thing : here -isaia- the ultimate goal of every_human desire , because here we attain God and God joins himself to us in the most perfect union '' . Precisely for this_reason it -isaia- good to cultivate in our_hearts a constant desire_for the sacrament of the Eucharist . This was_the origin of the practice of '' spiritual communion '' , which_has happily been established in the Church for centuries and recommended by saints who_were masters of the spiritual_life . Saint Teresa of Jesus wrote : '' When you do not receive communion and you do not attend Mass , you can_make a spiritual communion , which_-isaia- a most beneficial practice ; by it the love of God will be greatly impressed on you '' . The celebration of the Eucharist , however , cannot be the starting point for communion ; it presupposes that communion already exists , a communion_which it seeks to consolidate and bring to perfection . The sacrament -isaia- an expression of this bond of communion both in its invisible dimension , which , in Christ and through the working of the Holy Spirit , unites us to the Father and among ourselves , and in its visible dimension , which entails communion in the teaching of the Apostles , in the sacraments and in the Church s hierarchical order . The profound relationship_between_the invisible and the visible elements of ecclesial_communion -isaia- constitutive of the Church as the sacrament of salvation . Only in this_context can there be a legitimate celebration of the Eucharist and true participation in it . Consequently it -isaia- an intrinsic requirement of the Eucharist that it should be celebrated in communion , and specifically maintaining the various bonds of that communion intact . Invisible communion , though by its_nature always growing , presupposes the life of grace , by which we become '' partakers of the divine nature '' Pet : , and the practice of the virtues of faith , hope and love . Only in this_way do we have true communion with the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . Nor -isaia- faith sufficient ; we must persevere in sanctifying grace and love , remaining within_the Church '' bodily '' as well as '' in our_heart '' ; what_-isaia- required , in the words of Saint Paul , -isaia- '' faith working through love '' Gal : . Keeping these invisible bonds intact -isaia- a specific moral duty incumbent upon Christians who wish to participate fully in the Eucharist by receiving the body_and_blood of Christ . The Apostle Paul appeals to this_duty when he warns : '' Let a man examine himself , and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup '' Cor : . Saint John Chrysostom , with_his stirring eloquence , exhorted the faithful : '' I too raise my voice , I beseech , beg and implore that_no_one draw near to this sacred table with a sullied and corrupt conscience . Such an act , in fact , can_never be called communion , not_even were we to touch the Lord s body a thousand times over , but condemnation , torment and increase of punishment '' . Along these same lines , the Catechism of the Catholic Church rightly stipulates that '' anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion '' . I therefore desire to reaffirm that in the Church there remains in force , now and in the future , the rule by which_the Council of Trent gave concrete expression to the Apostle Paul s stern warning when it affirmed that , in order to receive the Eucharist in a worthy manner , '' one_must first confess one s sins , when one_-isaia- aware of mortal sin '' . The two sacraments of the Eucharist and Penance are_very closely connected . Because the Eucharist makes present_the redeeming sacrifice of the Cross , perpetuating it sacramentally , it naturally gives_rise to a continuous need_for conversion , for a personal response to the appeal made by Saint Paul to the Christians of Corinth : '' We beseech you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God '' Cor : . If a Christian s conscience -isaia- burdened by serious sin , then the path of penance through the sacrament of Reconciliation becomes necessary_for full participation in the Eucharistic Sacrifice . The judgment of one s state of grace obviously belongs only to the person involved , since it -isaia-_a_question of examining one s conscience . However , in cases of outward conduct which_-isaia- seriously , clearly and steadfastly contrary to the moral norm , the Church , in her pastoral concern_for the good order of the community and out of respect_for the sacrament , cannot_fail to feel directly involved . The Code of Canon Law refers to this situation of a manifest lack of proper moral disposition when it states that_those_who '' obstinately persist in manifest grave sin '' are_not to be admitted to Eucharistic communion . Ecclesial communion , as I have_said , -isaia- likewise visible , and finds expression in the series of '' bonds '' listed by the Council when it teaches : '' They are fully incorporated into the society of the Church who , possessing the Spirit of Christ , accept her whole structure and all the means of salvation established within her , and within her visible framework are_united to Christ , who governs her through the Supreme Pontiff and the Bishops , by the bonds of profession_of_faith , the sacraments , ecclesiastical government and communion '' . The Eucharist , as the supreme sacramental manifestation of communion in the Church , demands to be celebrated in a context where_the outward bonds of communion are_also intact . In a special_way , since_the Eucharist -isaia- '' as it were_the summit of the spiritual_life and the goal of all the sacraments '' , it requires that the bonds of communion in the sacraments , particularly in Baptism and in priestly Orders , be real . It -isaia- not_possible to give communion to a person who_-isaia- not baptized or to one_who rejects the full truth of the faith regarding the Eucharistic mystery . Christ -isaia- the truth and he bears_witness to the truth cf . Jn : ; : ; the sacrament of his body_and_blood does_not permit duplicity . Furthermore , given the very nature of ecclesial_communion and its relation to the sacrament of the Eucharist , it must be recalled that '' the Eucharistic Sacrifice , while always offered in a particular community , -isaia- never a celebration of that community alone . In fact , the community , in receiving the Eucharistic presence of the Lord , receives the entire gift of salvation and shows , even in its lasting visible particular form , that_it_-isaia- the image and true presence of the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church '' . From this it follows_that a truly Eucharistic community cannot be closed in upon itself , as though it were somehow self sufficient ; rather it must persevere in harmony_with every_other Catholic community . The ecclesial_communion of the Eucharistic assembly -isaia- a communion with its_own Bishop and with the Roman Pontiff . The Bishop , in effect , -isaia- the visible principle and the foundation of unity within his particular Church . It would therefore be a great contradiction if the sacrament par excellence of the Church s unity were celebrated without true communion with the Bishop . As Saint Ignatius of Antioch wrote : '' That Eucharist which_-isaia- celebrated under the Bishop , or under one to whom_the Bishop has_given this charge , may be considered certain '' . Likewise , since '' the Roman Pontiff , as the successor of Peter , -isaia- the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity of the Bishops and of the multitude of the faithful '' , communion with_him -isaia- intrinsically required_for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . Hence the great truth expressed which_the Liturgy expresses in a variety of ways : '' Every celebration of the Eucharist -isaia- performed in union not only_with the proper Bishop , but also_with the Pope , with the episcopal order , with all the clergy , and with the entire people . Every valid celebration of the Eucharist expresses this universal communion with Peter and with the whole Church , or objectively calls for it , as in the case of the Christian Churches separated_from Rome '' . The Eucharist creates communion and fosters communion . Saint Paul wrote to the faithful of Corinth explaining how their divisions , reflected in their Eucharistic gatherings , contradicted what they_were celebrating , the Lord s Supper . The Apostle then urged them to reflect on the true reality of the Eucharist in order to return to the spirit of fraternal communion cf . Saint Augustine effectively echoed this call when , in recalling the Apostle s words : '' You are the body of Christ and individually members of it '' Cor : , he went on to say : '' If you_are his_body and members of him , then you will_find set on the Lord s table your_own mystery . Yes , you receive your_own mystery '' . And from this observation he concludes : '' Christ the Lord . hallowed -atti_degli_apostoli- his table the mystery of our peace and unity . Whoever receives the mystery of unity without preserving the bonds of peace receives not a mystery for his benefit but evidence against himself '' . The Eucharist s particular effectiveness in promoting communion_-isaia- one of the reasons for the importance of Sunday Mass . I have_already dwelt on this and on the other reasons which_make Sunday Mass fundamental for the life of the Church and of individual believers in my Apostolic Letter on the sanctification of Sunday Dies Domini . There I recalled that_the_faithful have_the obligation to attend Mass , unless they_are seriously impeded , and that Pastors have_the corresponding duty to see that_it_-isaia- practical and possible_for all to fulfil this precept . More recently , in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte , in setting forth the pastoral path which_the Church must_take -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium , I drew particular attention to the Sunday Eucharist , emphasizing its effectiveness for building communion . '' It is '' \u2013 I wrote \u2013 '' the privileged place_where communion_-isaia- ceaselessly proclaimed and nurtured . Precisely through sharing in the Eucharist , the Lord s Day also becomes_the Day of the Church , when_she can effectively exercise her role as the sacrament of unity '' . The safeguarding and promotion of ecclesial_communion -isaia- a task of each member of the faithful , who finds in the Eucharist , as the sacrament of the Church s unity , an area of special concern . More specifically , this_task -isaia- the particular responsibility of the Church s Pastors , each according_to_his rank and ecclesiastical office . For this_reason_the Church has drawn up norms aimed both -atti_degli_apostoli- fostering the frequent and fruitful access of the faithful to the Eucharistic table and -atti_degli_apostoli- determining the objective conditions under which communion may_not be given . The care shown in promoting the faithful observance of these norms becomes a practical means of showing love for the Eucharist and for the Church . In considering the Eucharist as the sacrament of ecclesial_communion , there_-isaia-_one subject which , due to its importance , must_not be overlooked : I -amos- referring to the relationship of the Eucharist to ecumenical activity . We should all give thanks to the Blessed Trinity for the many members of the faithful throughout_the_world who in recent decades have felt an ardent desire_for unity among all Christians . The Second Vatican Council , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of its Decree on Ecumenism , sees this as a special gift of God . It was an efficacious grace_which inspired us , the sons_and_daughters of the Catholic Church and our_brothers_and_sisters from other Churches and Ecclesial Communities , to set_forth on the path of ecumenism . Our longing for the goal of unity prompts us to turn to the Eucharist , which_-isaia- the supreme sacrament of the unity of the People of God , in as much as it -isaia- the apt expression and the unsurpassable source of that_unity . In the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice the Church prays that God , the Father of mercies , will grant his_children the fullness of the Holy Spirit so that_they_may become one_body and one spirit in Christ . In raising this_prayer to the Father of lights , from whom comes every good endowment and every perfect gift cf . Jas : , the Church believes that she_will be heard , for she prays in union with Christ her Head and Spouse , who takes up this plea of his Bride and joins it to that of his_own redemptive sacrifice . Precisely because the Church s unity , which_the Eucharist brings about through the Lord s sacrifice and by communion in his body_and_blood , absolutely requires full_communion in the bonds of the profession_of_faith , the sacraments and ecclesiastical governance , it -isaia- not_possible to celebrate together the same Eucharistic liturgy until those bonds are fully re established . Any such concelebration would_not be a valid means , and might well prove instead to be an obstacle , to the attainment of full_communion , by weakening the sense of how far we remain from this goal and by introducing or exacerbating ambiguities with_regard to one or another truth of the faith . The path towards full unity can_only be undertaken in truth . In this area , the prohibitions of Church law leave no room_for uncertainty , in fidelity to the moral norm laid_down by the Second Vatican Council . I would_like nonetheless to reaffirm what I said in my Encyclical Letter Ut Unum Sint after_having acknowledged the impossibility of Eucharistic sharing : '' And yet we do have a burning desire to join in celebrating the one Eucharist of the Lord , and this desire itself -isaia-_already a common prayer of praise , a single supplication . Together we speak to the Father and increasingly we do so with one heart '' . While it -isaia- never legitimate to concelebrate in the absence of full_communion , the same -isaia- not true with_respect to the administration of the Eucharist under special circumstances , to individual persons belonging to Churches or Ecclesial Communities not in full_communion with the Catholic Church . In this case , in fact , the intention -isaia- to meet a grave spiritual need_for the eternal_salvation of an individual believer , not to bring_about an intercommunion which remains impossible until the visible bonds of ecclesial_communion are fully re established . This was_the approach taken by the Second Vatican Council when it gave guidelines for responding to Eastern Christians separated in good faith from the Catholic Church , who spontaneously ask to receive the Eucharist from a Catholic minister and are properly disposed . This approach was then ratified by both Codes , which also consider \u2013 with necessary modifications \u2013 the case of other non Eastern Christians who_are_not in full_communion with the Catholic Church . In my Encyclical Ut Unum Sint I expressed my own appreciation of these norms , which_make it possible to provide_for the salvation_of_souls with proper discernment : '' It -isaia- a source of joy to note that Catholic ministers are_able , in certain particular cases , to administer the sacraments of the Eucharist , Penance and Anointing of the Sick to Christians who_are_not in full_communion with the Catholic Church but who greatly desire to receive these sacraments , freely request them and manifest the faith_which the Catholic Church professes with_regard to these sacraments . Conversely , in specific cases and in particular circumstances , Catholics too can request these same sacraments from ministers of Churches in which these sacraments are valid '' . These conditions , from which no dispensation can be given , must be carefully respected , even_though they deal_with specific individual cases , because the denial of one or more truths of the faith regarding these sacraments and , among_these , the truth regarding the need of the ministerial priesthood for their validity , renders the person asking improperly disposed to legitimately receiving them . And the opposite -isaia-_also true : Catholics may_not receive communion in those communities which lack a valid sacrament of Orders . The faithful observance of the body of norms established in this area -isaia- a manifestation and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , a guarantee of our love for Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament , for our_brothers_and_sisters of different Christian confessions \u2013 who_have a right to our witness to the truth \u2013 and for the cause itself of the promotion of unity . CHAPTER FIVE THE DIGNITYOF THE EUCHARISTIC CELEBRATION . Reading the account of the institution of the Eucharist in the Synoptic Gospels , we are struck by the simplicity and the '' solemnity '' with_which Jesus , on the evening of the Last Supper , instituted this_great sacrament . There -isaia- an episode which in some_way serves as its prelude : the anointing -atti_degli_apostoli- Bethany . A woman , whom John identifies as Mary the sister of Lazarus , pours a flask of costly ointment over Jesus head , which provokes from the disciples \u2013 and from Judas in particular cf . Mt : ; Mk : ; Jn : \u2013 an indignant response , as if this act , in light of the needs of the poor , represented an intolerable '' waste '' . But Jesus own reaction -isaia- completely different . While in no way detracting from the duty of charity towards_the needy , for_whom the disciples must_always show special_care \u2013 '' the poor you will_always have with you '' Mt , ; Mk : ; cf . Jn : \u2013 he looks towards his imminent death and burial , and sees this act of anointing as an anticipation of the honour which his_body will_continue to merit even after_his death , indissolubly bound as it -isaia- to the mystery of his person . The account continues , in the Synoptic Gospels , with Jesus charge to the disciples to prepare carefully the '' large upper_room '' needed_for the Passover meal cf . Mk : ; Lk : and with the narration of the institution of the Eucharist . Reflecting -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part the Jewish rites of the Passover meal leading up to the singing of the Hallel cf . Mt : ; Mk : , the story presents with sobriety and solemnity , even in the variants of the different traditions , the words spoken by Christ over the bread and wine , which he made into concrete expressions of the handing over of his_body and the shedding of his_blood . All these details are recorded by the Evangelists in the light of a praxis of the '' breaking of the bread '' already well established in the early Church . But certainly from the time of Jesus on , the event of Holy Thursday has shown visible traces of a liturgical '' sensibility '' shaped by Old Testament tradition and open to being reshaped in Christian celebrations in a way consonant with the new content of Easter . Like the woman who anointed Jesus in Bethany , the Church has feared no '' extravagance '' , devoting the best of her resources to expressing her wonder and adoration before the unsurpassable gift of the Eucharist . No less_than the first disciples charged with preparing the '' large upper_room '' , she_has felt the need , down_the_centuries and in her encounters with different_cultures , to celebrate the Eucharist in a setting worthy of so great a mystery . In the wake of Jesus own words and actions , and building upon the ritual heritage of Judaism , the Christian liturgy was_born . Could there ever be an adequate means of expressing the acceptance of that self gift_which the divine Bridegroom continually makes to his Bride , the Church , by bringing the Sacrifice offered once and for all on the Cross to successive generations of believers and thus becoming nourishment for all the faithful ? Though the idea of a '' banquet '' naturally suggests familiarity , the Church has_never yielded to the temptation to trivialize this '' intimacy '' with_her Spouse by forgetting that_he_-isaia- also her Lord and that the '' banquet '' always remains a sacrificial banquet marked by the blood shed on Golgotha . The Eucharistic Banquet -isaia- truly a '' sacred '' banquet , in which_the simplicity of the signs conceals the unfathomable holiness of God : O sacrum convivium , in quo Christus sumitur ! The bread which_-isaia- broken on our altars , offered to us as wayfarers along the paths of the world , -isaia- panis angelorum , the bread of angels , which_cannot be approached except with the humility of the centurion in the Gospel : '' Lord , I -amos- not worthy to have you come under my roof '' Mt : ; Lk : . With this heightened sense of mystery , we understand how the faith of the Church in the mystery of the Eucharist has found historical expression not_only in the demand for an interior disposition of devotion , but_also in outward forms meant to evoke and emphasize the grandeur of the event being celebrated . This led progressively to the development of a particular form of regulating the Eucharistic liturgy , with due respect_for the various legitimately constituted ecclesial traditions . On this foundation a rich artistic heritage also developed . Architecture , sculpture , painting and music , moved by the Christian mystery , have found in the Eucharist , both directly and indirectly , a source of great inspiration . Such was_the case , for example , with architecture , which witnessed the transition , once the historical situation made it possible , from the first places of Eucharistic celebration in the domus or '' homes '' of Christian families to the solemn basilicas of the early centuries , to the imposing cathedrals of the Middle Ages , and to the churches , large and small , which gradually sprang up throughout_the lands touched by Christianity . The designs of altars and tabernacles within Church interiors were often not_simply motivated by artistic inspiration but_also by a clear understanding of the mystery . The same could be said for sacred_music , if we but think of the inspired Gregorian melodies and the many , often great , composers who sought to do justice to the liturgical texts of the Mass . Similarly , can we overlook the enormous quantity of artistic production , ranging from fine craftsmanship to authentic works of art , in the area of Church furnishings and vestments used for the celebration of the Eucharist ? It can_be_said that the Eucharist , while shaping the Church and her spirituality , has_also powerfully affected '' culture '' , and the arts in particular . In this effort to adore the mystery grasped in its ritual and aesthetic dimensions , a certain '' competition '' has taken_place between Christians of the West and the East . How could we not give particular thanks to the Lord for the contributions to Christian art made by the great architectural and artistic works of the Greco Byzantine tradition and of the whole geographical area marked by Slav culture ? In the East , sacred art has preserved a remarkably powerful sense of mystery , which_leads artists to see their_efforts -atti_degli_apostoli- creating beauty not_simply as an expression of their_own talents , but_also as a genuine service to the faith . Passing well beyond mere technical skill , they_have shown themselves docile and open to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit . The architectural and mosaic splendours of the Christian East and West are a patrimony belonging to all believers ; they contain a hope , and even a pledge , of the desired fullness of communion in faith and in celebration . This would presuppose and demand , as in Rubl\u00ebv s famous depiction of the Trinity , a profoundly Eucharistic Church in which_the presence of the mystery of Christ in the broken bread -isaia- as it were immersed in the ineffable unity of the three divine Persons , making of the Church herself an '' icon '' of the Trinity . Within this_context of an art aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- expressing , in all its elements , the meaning of the Eucharist in accordance_with_the Church s teaching , attention needs to be given to the norms regulating the construction and decor of sacred buildings . As history shows and as I emphasized in my Letter to Artists , the Church has_always left ample room_for the creativity of artists . But sacred art must be outstanding for its ability to express adequately the mystery grasped in the fullness of the Church s faith and in accordance_with_the pastoral guidelines appropriately laid_down by competent Authority . This holds true both_for the figurative arts and for sacred_music . The development of sacred art and liturgical discipline which took_place in lands of ancient Christian heritage -isaia-_also taking place on continents where Christianity -isaia- younger . This was precisely_the approach supported by the Second Vatican Council on the need_for sound and proper '' inculturation '' . In my numerous Pastoral Visits I have_seen , throughout_the_world , the great vitality which_the celebration of the Eucharist can have when marked by the forms , styles and sensibilities of different_cultures . By adaptation to the changing conditions of time_and_place , the Eucharist offers sustenance not_only to individuals but to entire peoples , and it shapes cultures inspired by Christianity . It -isaia- necessary , however_,_that this important work of adaptation be carried_out with a constant awareness of the ineffable mystery against which_every generation -isaia- called to measure itself . The '' treasure '' -isaia- too important and precious to risk impoverishment or compromise through forms of experimentation or practices introduced without a careful review on the part of the competent ecclesiastical authorities . Furthermore , the centrality of the Eucharistic mystery demands_that any such review must be undertaken in close association with the Holy See . As I wrote in my Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Asia , '' such cooperation -isaia- essential because the Sacred Liturgy expresses and celebrates the one faith professed by all and , being the heritage of the whole Church , cannot be determined by local Churches in isolation from the universal Church '' . All of this makes clear the great responsibility which belongs to priests in particular for the celebration of the Eucharist . It -isaia- their responsibility to preside -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharist in persona Christi and to provide a witness to and a service of communion not_only_for the community directly taking part in the celebration , but_also_for the universal Church , which_-isaia- a part of every Eucharist . It must be lamented that , especially in the years following the post conciliar liturgical reform , as a result of a misguided sense of creativity and adaptation there have_been a number of abuses which_have_been a source of suffering for_many . A certain reaction against '' formalism '' has led some , especially in certain regions , to consider_the '' forms '' chosen by the Church s great liturgical tradition and her Magisterium as non binding and to introduce unauthorized innovations which are_often completely inappropriate . I consider it my duty , therefore to appeal urgently that the liturgical norms for the celebration of the Eucharist be observed with_great fidelity . These norms are a concrete expression of the authentically ecclesial nature of the Eucharist ; this_-isaia- their deepest meaning . Liturgy -isaia- never anyone s private_property , be it of the celebrant or of the community in which_the mysteries are celebrated . The Apostle Paul had to address fiery words to the community of Corinth because of grave shortcomings in their celebration of the Eucharist resulting in divisions schismata and the emergence of factions haireseis cf . Our time , too , calls for a renewed awareness and appreciation of liturgical norms as a reflection of , and a witness to , the one universal Church made present in every celebration of the Eucharist . Priests who faithfully celebrate Mass according to the liturgical norms , and communities which conform to those norms , quietly but eloquently demonstrate their love for the Church . Precisely to bring out more_clearly this deeper meaning of liturgical norms , I have asked the competent offices of the Roman Curia to prepare a more specific document , including prescriptions of a juridical nature , on this very_important subject . No one_-isaia- permitted to undervalue the mystery entrusted to our hands : it -isaia- too great for anyone to feel free to treat it lightly and with disregard for its sacredness and its universality . CHAPTER SIX AT THE SCHOOL OF MARY , '' WOMAN OF THE EUCHARIST '' . If we wish to rediscover in all its richness the profound relationship_between_the Church and the Eucharist , we cannot neglect Mary , Mother and model of the Church . In my Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae , I pointed to the Blessed Virgin Mary as our teacher in contemplating Christ s face , and among the mysteries of light I included the institution of the Eucharist . Mary can guide us towards this most_holy sacrament , because_she herself has a profound relationship_with it . At first glance , the Gospel -isaia- silent on this_subject . The account of the institution of the Eucharist on the night of Holy Thursday makes no mention of Mary . Yet we know_that she_was present among the Apostles who prayed '' with one accord '' cf . Acts : in the first community which gathered after_the Ascension in expectation of Pentecost . Certainly Mary must have_been present -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharistic celebrations of the first generation of Christians , who_were devoted to '' the breaking of bread '' Acts : . But in addition to her sharing in the Eucharistic banquet , an indirect picture of Mary s relationship_with the Eucharist can be had , beginning with_her interior disposition . Mary -isaia- a '' woman of the Eucharist '' in her whole_life . The Church , which looks to Mary as a model , -isaia-_also called to imitate her in her relationship_with this most_holy mystery . Mysterium fidei ! If the Eucharist -isaia- a mystery of faith_which so greatly transcends our understanding as to call_for sheer abandonment to the word of God , then there_can be no one like Mary to act as our support and guide in acquiring this disposition . In repeating what Christ did -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper in obedience to his command : '' Do this in memory of me ! '' , we also accept Mary s invitation to obey him without hesitation : '' Do whatever he tells you '' Jn : . With the same maternal concern which_she showed -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding feast of Cana , Mary seems to say to us : '' Do not waver ; trust in the words of my Son . If he was able to change water into wine , he can_also turn bread and wine into_his body_and_blood , and through this_mystery bestow on believers the living memorial of his passover , thus becoming the bread of life '' . In a certain_sense Mary lived her Eucharistic faith even before the institution of the Eucharist , by the very fact_that she offered her virginal womb for the Incarnation of God s Word . The Eucharist , while commemorating the passion and resurrection , -isaia-_also in continuity with the incarnation . At the Annunciation Mary conceived the Son of God in the physical reality of his body_and_blood , thus anticipating within herself what to some degree happens sacramentally in every believer who receives , under the signs of bread and wine , the Lord s body_and_blood . As a result , there_-isaia- a profound analogy between_the Fiat which Mary said in reply to the angel , and the Amen which_every believer says when receiving the body of the Lord . Mary was asked to believe_that the One whom she conceived '' through the Holy Spirit '' was '' the Son of God '' Lk : . In continuity with the Virgin s faith , in the Eucharistic mystery we are asked to believe_that the same Jesus Christ , Son of God and Son of Mary , becomes present in his full humanity and divinity under the signs of bread and wine . '' Blessed -isaia- she_who believed '' Lk : . Mary also anticipated , in the mystery_of_the_incarnation , the Church s Eucharistic faith . When , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Visitation , she bore in her womb the Word made_flesh , she became in some_way a '' tabernacle '' \u2013 the first '' tabernacle '' in history \u2013 in which_the Son of God , still invisible to our human gaze , allowed himself to be adored by Elizabeth , radiating his light as it were through the eyes and the voice of Mary . And -isaia- not the enraptured gaze of Mary as she contemplated the face of the newborn Christ and cradled him in her arms that unparalleled model of love which_should inspire us every time we receive Eucharistic communion ? . Mary , throughout her_life -atti_degli_apostoli- Christ s side and not_only on Calvary , made her_own the sacrificial dimension of the Eucharist . When she brought the child Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem '' to present him to the Lord '' Lk : , she heard the aged Simeon announce that the child would be a '' sign of contradiction '' and that a sword would also pierce her_own heart cf . The tragedy of her Son s crucifixion was thus foretold , and in some sense Mary s Stabat Mater -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross was foreshadowed . In her daily preparation_for Calvary , Mary experienced a kind of '' anticipated Eucharist '' \u2013 one might say a '' spiritual communion '' \u2013 of desire and of oblation , which_would culminate in her union with_her Son in his_passion , and then find expression after Easter by her partaking in the Eucharist which_the Apostles celebrated as the memorial of that passion . What must Mary have felt as she heard from the mouth of Peter , John , James and the other Apostles the words spoken -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper : '' This -isaia- my body which_-isaia- given for you '' Lk : ? The body given up for us and made present under sacramental signs was_the same body which_she had conceived in her womb ! For Mary , receiving the Eucharist must_have somehow meant welcoming once_more into her womb that heart which_had beat in unison with hers and reliving what she had experienced -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross . In the '' memorial '' of Calvary all that Christ accomplished by his_passion and his_death -isaia- present . Consequently all that Christ did with_regard to his Mother for our sake -isaia-_also present . To her he gave the beloved disciple and , in him , each of us : '' Behold , your Son ! '' . To each of us he also says : '' Behold your mother ! '' cf . Experiencing the memorial of Christ s death in the Eucharist also means continually receiving this_gift . It means accepting \u2013 like John \u2013 the one_who_-isaia- given to us anew as our Mother . It also means taking on a commitment to be conformed to Christ , putting ourselves -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of his Mother and allowing her to accompany us . Mary -isaia- present , with the Church and as the Mother of the Church , -atti_degli_apostoli- each of our celebrations of the Eucharist . If the Church and the Eucharist are inseparably united , the same ought to be said of Mary and the Eucharist . This -isaia- one reason_why , since ancient times , the commemoration of Mary has_always_been part of the Eucharistic celebrations of the Churches of East and West . In the Eucharist the Church -isaia- completely united to Christ and his sacrifice , and makes her_own the spirit of Mary . This truth can be understood more_deeply by re reading the Magnificat in a Eucharistic key . The Eucharist , like the Canticle of Mary , -isaia- first_and_foremost praise and thanksgiving . When Mary exclaims : '' My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour '' , she already bears Jesus in her womb . She praises God '' through '' Jesus , but she also praises him '' in '' Jesus and '' with '' Jesus . This -isaia- itself the true '' Eucharistic attitude '' . At the same_time Mary recalls the wonders worked by God in salvation history in fulfilment of the promise once made to the fathers cf . Lk : , and proclaims_the wonder that surpasses them all , the redemptive incarnation . Lastly , the Magnificat reflects the eschatological tension of the Eucharist . Every time the Son of God comes again to us in the '' poverty '' of the sacramental signs of bread and wine , the seeds of that new history wherein the mighty are '' put down from their thrones '' and '' those of low degree are exalted '' cf . Lk : , take root in the world . Mary sings of the '' new heavens '' and the '' new earth '' which find in the Eucharist their anticipation and in some sense their programme and plan . The Magnificat expresses Mary s spirituality , and there_-isaia-_nothing greater_than this spirituality for helping us to experience the mystery of the Eucharist . The Eucharist has_been_given to us so that_our life , like that of Mary , may_become completely a Magnificat ! CONCLUSION . Ave , verum corpus natum de Maria Virgine ! Several years_ago I celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of my priesthood . Today I have_the grace of offering the Church this Encyclical on the Eucharist on the Holy Thursday which falls during the twenty fifth year of my Petrine ministry . As I do so , my heart_-isaia- filled_with gratitude . For over a half century , every_day , beginning on November , when I celebrated my first Mass in the Crypt of Saint Leonard in Wawel Cathedral in Krakow , my eyes have gazed in recollection upon the host and the chalice , where time and space in some_way '' merge '' and the drama of Golgotha -isaia- re presented in a living way , thus revealing its mysterious '' contemporaneity '' . Each day my faith_has been_able to recognize in the consecrated bread and wine the divine Wayfarer who joined the two disciples on the road to Emmaus and opened their_eyes to the light and their_hearts to new hope cf . Allow me , dear brothers_and_sisters , to share_with deep emotion , as a means of accompanying and strengthening your faith , my own testimony of faith in the Most Holy Eucharist . Ave verum corpus natum de Maria Virgine , vere passum , immolatum , in cruce pro homine ! Here -isaia- the Church s treasure , the heart of the world , the pledge of the fulfilment for which_each man_and_woman , even unconsciously , yearns . A great and transcendent mystery , indeed , and one_that taxes our_mind s ability to pass beyond appearances . Here our senses fail us : visus , tactus , gustus in te fallitur , in the words of the hymn Adoro Te Devote ; yet faith alone , rooted in the word of Christ handed_down to us by the Apostles , -isaia- sufficient for us . Allow me , like Peter -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the Eucharistic discourse in John s Gospel , to say once_more to Christ , in the name of the whole Church and in the name of each of you : '' Lord to whom shall we go ? You have_the words of eternal_life '' Jn : . At the dawn of this third_millennium , we , the children of the Church , are_called to undertake with renewed enthusiasm the journey of Christian living . As I wrote in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte , '' it -isaia- not a matter of inventing a new programme . The programme already exists : it -isaia- the plan found in the Gospel and in the living Tradition ; it -isaia-_the_same as ever . Ultimately , it has its centre in Christ himself , who_-isaia- to be known , loved and imitated , so that in him we may live the life of the Trinity , and with_him transform history until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem '' . The implementation of this programme of a renewed impetus in Christian living passes through the Eucharist . Every commitment to holiness , every activity aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- carrying_out the Church s mission , every work of pastoral planning , must draw the strength it needs from the Eucharistic mystery and in turn be directed to that mystery as its culmination . In the Eucharist we have Jesus , we have his redemptive sacrifice , we have his_resurrection , we have_the gift of the Holy Spirit , we have adoration , obedience and love of the Father . Were we to disregard the Eucharist , how could we overcome our_own deficiency ? . The mystery of the Eucharist \u2013 sacrifice , presence , banquet \u2013 does not_allow for reduction or exploitation ; it must be experienced and lived in its integrity , both in its celebration and in the intimate converse with Jesus which takes_place after receiving communion or in a prayerful moment of Eucharistic adoration apart_from Mass . These are times when_the Church -isaia- firmly built up and it becomes clear what she truly -isaia- : one , holy , catholic and apostolic ; the people , temple and family of God ; the body and bride of Christ , enlivened by the Holy Spirit ; the universal sacrament of salvation and a hierarchically structured communion . The path taken by the Church in these first years of the third_millennium -isaia-_also a path of renewed ecumenical commitment . The final decades of the second millennium , culminating in the Great Jubilee , have spurred us along this path and called_for all the baptized to respond to the prayer of Jesus '' ut unum sint '' Jn : . The path itself_-isaia- long and strewn with obstacles greater_than our human resources alone_can overcome , yet we have_the Eucharist , and in its presence we can hear in the depths of our_hearts , as if they_were addressed to us , the same words heard by the Prophet Elijah : '' Arise and eat , else the journey will be too great for you '' Kg : . The treasure of the Eucharist , which_the Lord places before us , impels us towards_the goal of full sharing with all our_brothers_and_sisters to whom we are joined by our_common Baptism . But if this treasure -isaia- not to be squandered , we need to respect the demands which derive from its being the sacrament of communion in faith and in apostolic succession . By giving the Eucharist the prominence it deserves , and by being careful not to diminish any of its dimensions or demands , we show that_we_are truly conscious of the greatness of this_gift . We are urged to do so by an uninterrupted tradition , which from the first centuries on has found the Christian community ever vigilant in guarding this '' treasure '' . Inspired by love , the Church -isaia- anxious to hand on to future generations of Christians , without loss , her faith and teaching with_regard to the mystery of the Eucharist . There can be no danger of excess in our care_for this_mystery , for '' in this_sacrament -isaia- recapitulated the whole mystery of our_salvation '' . Let us take our place , dear brothers_and_sisters , -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of the saints , who_are the great interpreters of true Eucharistic piety . In them the theology of the Eucharist takes on all the splendour of a lived reality ; it becomes '' contagious '' and , in a manner of speaking , it '' warms our_hearts '' . Above all , let us listen to Mary Most Holy , in whom_the mystery of the Eucharist appears , more_than in anyone else , as a mystery of light . Gazing upon Mary , we come to know_the transforming power present in the Eucharist . In her we see the world renewed in love . Contemplating her , assumed body_and_soul into_heaven , we see opening up before us those '' new heavens '' and that '' new earth '' which_will appear -atti_degli_apostoli- the second coming of Christ . Here below , the Eucharist represents their pledge , and in a certain way , their anticipation : '' Veni , Domine Iesu ! '' Rev : . In the humble signs of bread and wine , changed into_his body_and_blood , Christ walks beside us as our strength and our food for the journey , and he enables us to become , for everyone , witnesses of hope . If , in the presence of this_mystery , reason experiences its limits , the heart , enlightened by the grace of the Holy Spirit , clearly sees the response that_-isaia- demanded , and bows low in adoration and unbounded love . Let us make our_own the words of Saint Thomas Aquinas , an eminent theologian and an impassioned poet of Christ in the Eucharist , and turn in hope to the contemplation of that goal to which our_hearts aspire in their thirst_for joy and peace : Bone pastor , panis vere , Iesu , nostri miserere . Come then , good Shepherd , bread divine , Still show to us thy mercy sign ; Oh , feed us , still keep us thine ; So we may see thy glories shinein fields of immortality . O thou , the wisest , mightiest , best , Our present food , our future rest , Come , make us each thy chosen guest , Co heirs of thine , and comrades blestWith saints whose dwelling -isaia- with thee . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on April , Holy Thursday , in the year , the Twenty fifth of my Pontificate , the Year of the Rosary .

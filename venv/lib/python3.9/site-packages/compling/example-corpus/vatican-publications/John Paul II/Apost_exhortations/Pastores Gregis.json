The shepherds of the Lord s flock know that_they_can count on a special divine_grace as they carry_out_their ministry as Bishops . In the Roman Pontifical , during the solemn prayer of episcopal ordination , the principal ordaining Bishop , after invoking the outpouring of the Holy Spirit who leads and guides , repeats a phrase already found in the ancient text of the Apostolic Tradition : '' Grant , O Father , knower of all hearts , that_this your servant , whom_you have chosen for the office of Bishop , may shepherd your holy flock . May he fulfil before you without reproach the ministry of the High Priesthood . In this_way there continues to be carried_out the will of the Lord Jesus Christ , the eternal Shepherd , who sent the Apostles even as he himself was sent by the Father cf . Jn : , and who wishes that_their successors , the Bishops , should remain shepherds in his Church until the end of time . The image of the Good Shepherd , so dear also to ancient Christian iconography , was very much present to the Bishops from throughout_the_world who gathered from September to October for the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . At the tomb of the Apostle Peter , they joined me in reflecting on the figure of The Bishop , Servant of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for the Hope of the World . We were all agreed that the figure of Jesus the Good Shepherd represents the primary image to which we must constantly refer . No one , in fact , can be considered a pastor worthy of the name , nisi per caritate efficiatur unum cum Christo . This -isaia- the fundamental reason_why '' the ideal figure of the Bishop , on which_the Church continues to count , -isaia- that of the pastor who , configured to Christ by his_holiness of life , expends himself generously for the Church entrusted to him , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time bearing in his_heart a concern_for all the Churches throughout_the_world cf . The Tenth Assembly of the Synod of Bishops . We give thanks to the Lord , then , for having granted us the gift of celebrating once_more an assembly of the Synod of Bishops and thus having a truly profound experience of being Church . Held in the wake of the Great Jubilee of the Year , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third Christian millennium , the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops followed a long series of assemblies : both the Special Assemblies , all of which_were marked by a concern_for evangelization on the different continents \u2013 from Africa to America , Asia , Oceania and Europe ; and the Ordinary Assemblies , the last of which_were devoted to a reflection on the rich treasure which_the Church possesses in the variety of vocations raised up by the Holy Spirit among the People of God . In this_context , the attention devoted to the specific ministry of Bishops completed the picture of that ecclesiology of communion and mission which must_always be our fundamental point of reference . Consequently , the work of the Synod made constant reference to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council on the episcopate and the ministry of Bishops , especially as set_forth in the third chapter of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium and in the Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops Christus Dominus . Of this luminous teaching , which repeats and develops traditional theological and juridical themes , my predecessor of venerable memory Pope Paul VI , could rightly say : '' It seems to us that episcopal authority emerges from the Council vindicated in its divine institution , confirmed in its irreplaceable function , renewed in its pastoral powers of teaching , sanctifying and governing , honoured in its extension to the universal Church by way of collegial communion , more_clearly identified in its hierarchical aspect , strengthened in shared and fraternal responsibility with_other Bishops for the universal and particular needs of the Church , and more strongly associated in a spirit of hierarchical union and joint cooperation_with the head of the Church , the constitutive centre of the College of Bishops '' . At the same_time , in keeping_with_the designated topic of the Synod , the Fathers reviewed their_ministry in the light of the theological virtue of hope . This approach immediately appeared as especially pertinent to the mission of the pastor who , in the Church , -isaia- first_and_foremost to bear_witness to the Paschal and eschatological mystery . A hope founded on Christ . It -isaia-_in_fact the task of every Bishop to proclaim hope to the world , hope based on the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ : a hope '' which not_only concerns penultimate matters but_also and above all that eschatological hope which awaits the riches of the glory of God cf . Eph : , which surpasses anything that the human_heart has_ever conceived cf . Cor : , and to which_the sufferings of the present cannot be compared cf . A stance of theological hope , together_with faith and love , must completely shape the Bishop s pastoral_ministry . The Bishop -isaia- called in a particular_way to be a prophet , witness and servant of hope . He has the duty of instilling confidence and proclaiming before all people the basis of Christian hope cf . The Bishop -isaia- the prophet , witness and servant of this hope , especially where a culture of '' the here and now '' leaves no room_for openness to transcendence . Where hope -isaia- absent , faith itself_-isaia- called into question . Love too -isaia- weakened by the loss of this virtue . Especially in times of growing unbelief and indifference , hope -isaia- a stalwart support for faith and an effective incentive for love . It draws its strength from the certainty of God s desire_for the salvation of all people cf . Tim : and from the constant presence of the Lord Jesus , the Emmanuel who remains with us always , until the end of the world cf . Only by the light and consolation born of the Gospel can a Bishop succeed in keeping his_own hope alive cf . Rom : and in nourishing the hope of those entrusted to his pastoral_care . He must_therefore model himself on the Virgin Mary , the Mother of Hope , who believed in the fulfilment of the Lord s words cf . Relying on the word of God and holding firmly to hope , which like a sure and steadfast anchor reaches to the heavens cf . Heb : , the Bishop stands in the midst of the Church as a vigilant sentinel , a courageous prophet , a credible witness and a faithful servant of Christ , '' our_hope of glory '' cf . Col : , thanks to whom '' death shall be no more , neither shall there be mourning , nor crying nor pain any more '' cf . Hope , when hopes are dashed . Everyone will remember_that the sessions of the Synod of Bishops took_place -atti_degli_apostoli- a dramatic time . The terrible events of September were intensely felt by the Synod Fathers , with the dreadful fate of countless innocent victims and for the appearance in our_world of grave new situations of uncertainty and fear , both for_human civilization and the peaceful coexistence of nations . A new spectre of war and death appeared , which , when added to the already existing situations of conflict , made all the more evident the need to implore the Prince of Peace that_human hearts might open once_more to reconciliation , solidarity and peace . Together with its prayers , the Synodal assembly spoke out in condemnation of all forms of violence and identified their ultimate source in human sin . Acknowledging the failure of human hopes based on materialist , immanentist and market ideologies which claim to measure everything in terms of efficiency , relationships of power and market forces , the Synod Fathers reaffirmed their conviction_that only the light of the Risen One and the guidance of the Holy Spirit can enable people to base their expectations on the hope_that does_not disappoint . Thus , they proclaimed : '' We should_not allow ourselves to be intimidated by those doctrines which deny the existence of the living God and which strive , more_or_less openly , to undermine , parody or deride Christian hope . In the joy of the Spirit we profess : Christ -isaia- truly risen ! In his glorified humanity he has opened up the prospect of eternal_life for all those_who accept the grace of conversion '' . The certainty of this profession_of_faith must be such that it daily strengthens a Bishop s hope and makes him increasingly confident of the unfailing power of God s merciful goodness to open up paths of salvation and propose them to the freedom of each_person . Hope encourages a Bishop to discern , wherever he exercises his_ministry , the signs of life_which are_able to uproot the seeds of destruction and death . Hope sustains him as he transforms conflicts themselves into an opportunity_for growth and for reconciliation . Hope in Jesus the Good Shepherd will fill his_heart with compassion , prompting him to draw near to the pain of every suffering man_and_woman and to soothe their wounds , ever confident that_every lost sheep will be found . The Bishop will thus be an ever_more luminous sign of Christ , the Shepherd and Spouse of the Church . Acting as father , brother and friend to all , he will stand beside everyone as the living image of Christ , our_hope , in whom all God s promises are fulfilled and all the expectations of creation are brought to completion . Servants of the Gospel for the hope of the world . In issuing this Apostolic Exhortation , I now take up the reflections which developed during the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , from the first Lineamenta to the Instrumentum Laboris , from the interventions made in the Hall by the Synod Fathers to the two Relations that introduced and summarized these interventions , from the theoretical and practical pastoral insights that emerged from the small groups to the Propositiones presented to me -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of the Synod to assist me in preparing for the whole Church a document on the Synod s theme of The Bishop , Servant of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for the Hope of the World . In doing so , I send my fraternal greetings and the kiss of peace to all the Bishops in communion with this See , first entrusted to Peter so that_he_might be a guarantee of unity and , as -isaia- recognized by all , preside in love . To you_,_venerable and dear Brothers , I repeat the invitation that I addressed to the whole Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the millennium : Duc in altum ! It -isaia- Christ himself who repeats these_words to the Successors of those Apostles who heard them_from his lips and who , putting their trust in him , set_forth on mission along the byways of the world : Duc in altum Lk : . In the light of this pressing command from the Lord , '' we may reread the triple munus entrusted to us in the Church : munus docendi , sanctificandi et regendi . Duc in docendo ! With the Apostle we will say : Preach the word , be urgent in season and out of season , convince , rebuke and exhort \u2013 be unfailing in patience and in teaching Tim : . Duc in sanctificando ! The nets we are called_upon to cast among_men are , first of all , the sacraments , of which_we_are the principal dispensers , moderators , guardians and promoters . They form a sort of saving net , which sets free_from evil and leads to the fullness of life . Duc in regendo ! As pastors and true fathers , assisted by the priests and other helpers , we have_the task of gathering together the family of the faithful and in it fostering charity and brotherly communion . As arduous and laborious a mission as this may be , we must_not lose heart . With Peter and the first disciples we too with_great confidence renew our heartfelt profession_of_faith : Lord , -atti_degli_apostoli- your word I will lower the nets Lk : ! At your word , O Christ , we wish to serve your Gospel for the hope of the world ! '' . In this_way , living as men of hope and reflecting in their_ministry the ecclesiology of communion and mission , Bishops will truly be a source of hope_for their flock . We know that_the_world needs the '' hope_that does_not disappoint '' cf . We know_that this hope -isaia- Christ . We know it and therefore we proclaim_the hope_that springs from the Cross . Ave Crux , spes unica ! May this acclamation , which echoed in the Synod Hall -atti_degli_apostoli- the central moment of the work of the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , remain ever on our lips , for the Cross -isaia- a mystery of life and death . The Cross has become for the Church a '' tree of life '' . For this_reason we proclaim that life has triumphed over death . In making this Paschal proclamation we follow in the footsteps of a great multitude of holy pastors who_have_been eloquent images of the Good Shepherd in medio Ecclesiae . This prompts us always to praise and thank almighty and eternal God , for , as we sing in the sacred Liturgy , he strengthens us by their example , instructs us by their teaching and gives us protection through_their intercession . As I said -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of the Synod s work , the face of each of these holy Bishops , from the beginning of the Church s life to our_own day , -isaia- like a tile placed in a sort of mystical mosaic forming the face of Christ the Good Shepherd . It -isaia- he , then_,_that we contemplate , setting an example for the flock entrusted to us by the Pastor of Pastors , so that_we_can become ever_more committed servants of the Gospel for the hope of the world . As we gaze upon the face of our Master and Lord -atti_degli_apostoli- that hour when he '' loved his_own to the end '' , all of us , like the Apostle Peter , allow our feet to be washed so that we might have a part in him cf . And with the strength that comes to us from him in the Church , in the presence of our priests and deacons , before all men_and_women of the consecrated_life and all our_beloved lay_people , we repeat aloud : '' Whatever we may be , let not your hope be placed in us : if we are good , we are your servants ; if we are bad , we are_still your servants . But if we are good and faithful servants , it -isaia- then that_we_are truly your servants '' . Servants of the Gospel for the hope of the world . CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY AND MINISTRY OF THE BISHOP '' . and he chose from them Twelve '' Lk : . The Lord Jesus , during his earthly pilgrimage , proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom and inaugurated it in his_own person , revealing its mystery to all people . He called men_and_women to be his followers , and from his_disciples he chose Twelve '' to be with_him '' Mk : . The Gospel of Luke points_out that Jesus made this choice after a night spent in prayer on the mountain cf . The Gospel of Mark , for its part , appears to see in this action of Jesus a sovereign act , a constitutive act which_gives an identity to those_whom he chose : '' he appointed Twelve '' : . The mystery of the election of the Twelve -isaia- thus disclosed : it -isaia- an act of love , freely willed by Jesus in intimate_union with the Father and the Holy Spirit . The mission entrusted by Jesus to the Apostles -isaia- to last until the end of time cf . Mt : , since_the Gospel which_they_have been charged to hand down -isaia- the life of the Church in every_age . It was precisely for_this reason_that the Apostles were concerned to appoint for themselves successors , so that , as Saint Irenaeus attests , the apostolic tradition might be manifested and preserved down_the_centuries . The special outpouring of the Holy Spirit with_which_the Risen Lord filled the Apostles cf . Acts : ; ; : ; Jn : was shared by them through the gesture of laying hands upon their co workers cf . These in turn transmitted it by the same gesture to others , and these to others still . In this_way , the spiritual gift given in the beginning has come down to our_own day through the imposition of hands , in other_words , by episcopal consecration , which confers the fullness of the sacrament of Orders , the high priesthood and the totality of the sacred_ministry . Thus , through the Bishops and the priests , their co workers , the Lord Jesus Christ , seated -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of God the Father , remains present in the midst of believers . In every time_and_place it -isaia- he who proclaims_the word of God to all peoples , administers the sacraments of faith to believers and guides the people of the New Testament on their pilgrimage to eternal happiness . The Good Shepherd does_not abandon his flock but preserves and protects it always through those_who , by their ontological share in his life_and_mission , carry_out in an eminent and visible way the role of teacher , shepherd and priest , who act in his_name in exercising the functions associated_with the pastoral_ministry , and who_are constituted his vicars and ambassadors . The Trinitarian foundation of the episcopal ministry . The Christological dimension of the pastoral_ministry , considered in depth , leads to an understanding of the Trinitarian foundation of ministry itself . Christ s life_-isaia- Trinitarian . He -isaia- the eternal and only_begotten Son of the Father and the anointed of the Holy Spirit , sent into_the_world ; it -isaia- he who , together_with_the Father , pours out the Spirit upon the Church . This Trinitarian dimension , manifested in every aspect of Christ s life and activity , also shapes the life and activity of the Bishop . Rightly , then , the Synod Fathers chose explicitly to describe the life and ministry of the Bishop in the light of the Trinitarian ecclesiology contained in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council . The tradition which sees the Bishop as an image of God the Father -isaia- quite ancient . As Saint Ignatius of Antioch wrote , the Father -isaia- like an invisible Bishop , the Bishop of all . Every Bishop , therefore , stands in the place of the Father of Jesus Christ in such_a_way_that , precisely_because of this representation , he -isaia- to be revered by all . Consonant with this symbolism , the Bishop s chair , which especially in the tradition of the Eastern Churches evokes God s paternal authority , can_only be occupied by the Bishop . This same symbolism -isaia-_the_source of every Bishop s duty to lead the holy people of God as a devoted father and to guide them \u2013 together_with his priests , his co workers in the episcopal ministry , and with_his deacons \u2013 in the way of salvation . Conversely , as an ancient text exhorts , the faithful_are to love their Bishops who_are , after God , their fathers and mothers . For this_reason , in accordance_with a custom widespread in certain cultures , one kisses the Bishop s hand as one would kiss the hand of the loving Father , the giver of life . Christ -isaia- the primordial icon of the Father and the manifestation of his merciful presence among men_and_women . The Bishop , who acts in the person and in the name of Christ himself , becomes in the Church entrusted to him a living sign of the Lord Jesus , Shepherd and Spouse , Teacher and High Priest of the Church . Here we find the source of pastoral_ministry , and the reason_why , as the homily outline in the Roman Pontifical suggests , the three functions of teaching , sanctifying and governing the People of God are to be carried_out in imitation of the Good Shepherd : with charity , knowledge of the flock , concern_for all , mercy towards_the poor , the stranger and those in need , and a willingness to seek out the lost sheep and to bring them back to the one sheepfold . Finally , the anointing of the Holy Spirit , by configuring the Bishop to Christ , enables him to be a living continuation of the mystery of Christ for the Church . Because of this Trinitarian shaping of his existence , every Bishop in his_ministry -isaia- committed to keeping watch over the whole flock with love , for he has_been placed in their midst by the Spirit to govern_the Church of God : in the name of the Father , whose image he represents ; in the name of Jesus Christ his Son , by whom he has_been established as teacher , priest and shepherd ; in the name of the Holy Spirit , who gives_life to the Church and by his_power strengthens us in our human weakness . The collegial nature of the episcopal ministry . '' And he appointed Twelve '' Mk : . The Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium employs this Gospel text to introduce its teaching on the collegial nature of the group of the Twelve , formed '' after_the manner of a college or a fixed group , over which he placed Peter , chosen from among_them '' . Similarly , through the personal succession of the Bishop of Rome to Saint Peter and the succession of all the Bishops as a group to the Apostles , the Roman Pontiff and the Bishops are_united among_themselves as a College . The collegial union between_the Bishops -isaia- based on both episcopal ordination and hierarchical communion . It thus affects the inmost being of each Bishop and belongs to the structure of the Church as willed by Jesus Christ . One attains to the fullness of episcopal ministry by virtue of episcopal consecration and through hierarchical communion with the Head of the College and with its_members , that_-isaia- , with the College , which always includes its Head . This -isaia- how one becomes a member of the College of Bishops , and the reason_why the three functions received in episcopal ordination \u2013 sanctifying , teaching and governing \u2013 must be exercised in hierarchical communion , even_though , given their different immediate finalities , in a distinct way . This constitutes what_-isaia- called '' the spirit of collegiality '' affectus collegialis , or '' affective '' collegiality , which_-isaia- the basis of the Bishops concern_for the other particular Churches and for the universal Church . Consequently , if we must say that a Bishop -isaia- never alone , inasmuch as he -isaia- always united to the Father though the Son in the Holy Spirit , we must_also add that_he_-isaia- also never alone because he -isaia- always and continuously united with his_brothers in the episcopate and with the one whom_the Lord has chosen as the Successor of Peter . The spirit of collegiality -isaia- realized and expressed in different degrees and in various modalities , including institutional forms such as , for example , the Synod of Bishops , Particular Councils , Episcopal Conferences , the Roman Curia , ad Limina visits , missionary cooperation , etc . In its_full sense , however , the spirit of collegiality -isaia- realized and expressed only in collegial action in the strict sense , that_-isaia- , in the action of all the Bishops together_with their Head , with whom_they exercise full and supreme power over the whole Church . This collegial nature of the apostolic ministry -isaia- willed by Christ himself . Consequently , the spirit of collegiality , or affective collegiality collegialitas affectiva , -isaia- always present among the Bishops as communio episcoporum , but_only in certain acts does it find expression as effective collegiality collegialitas effectiva . The various_ways in which affective collegiality comes to be realized in effective collegiality belong to the human order , but in varying degrees they concretize the divine requirement that the episcopate should express itself in a collegial manner . The College s supreme_authority over the whole Church -isaia- solemnly exercised in Ecumenical Councils . The collegial dimension gives the episcopate its character of universality . A parallelism can thus be established between_the Church as one and universal , and therefore indivisible , and the episcopacy as one and indivisible , and therefore universal . The principle and foundation of this_unity , be it that of the Church or of the Bishops , -isaia- the Roman Pontiff . Indeed , as the Second Vatican Council teaches , the College , '' insofar as it -isaia- composed of many , expresses the variety and universality of the People of God , but insofar as it -isaia- assembled under one head , it expresses the unity of the flock of Christ '' . For this_reason , '' the unity of the episcopate -isaia- one of the constitutive elements of the unity of the Church '' . The universal Church -isaia- not the sum of the particular Churches , or a federation of the latter , or even the result of their communion as such , since , in the expression of the early Fathers and the liturgy , in her essential mystery the Church precedes creation itself . In the light of this_teaching , we can add that the relationship of mutual interiority existing between_the universal Church and each particular Church , whereby_the particular Churches are '' formed in the likeness of the universal Church , and in and from the particular Churches there comes into being the one and only Catholic Church '' , -isaia- reproduced in the relationship_between_the College of Bishops in its entirety and each Bishop as an individual . For this_reason , '' the College of Bishops -isaia- not to be understood as the aggregate of the Bishops who govern_the particular Churches , nor as the result of their communion ; rather , as an essential element of the universal Church , it -isaia- a reality which precedes the office of being the head of a particular Church '' . We can better understand this parallelism between_the universal Church and the College of Bishops in light of the Council s statement that '' the Apostles were_the first members of the new Israel , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the beginning of the sacred hierarchy '' . In the Apostles , not considered individually but as a College , there_was already contained the structure of the Church \u2013 which in them was established in her universality and unity \u2013 and the structure of the College of Bishops , their successors , the sign of this universality and unity . It -isaia- thus that '' the power of the College of Bishops over the whole Church -isaia- not the result of the sum of the powers of the individual Bishops over their particular Churches ; it -isaia- a pre existing reality in which individual Bishops participate . They have no competence to act over the whole Church except collegially '' . Bishops share as a body in the power of teaching and governing , and they do so immediately by the very_fact that_they_are members of the College of Bishops , in which_the Apostolic College truly continues in being . Just as the universal Church -isaia- one and indivisible , so too the College of Bishops -isaia- one '' indivisible theological subject , '' and hence_the supreme , full and universal power possessed by the College , and by the Roman Pontiff personally , -isaia- one and indivisible . Precisely because the College of Bishops -isaia- a reality prior to the office of heading a particular Church , there_are_many Bishops who , while carrying_out tasks that_are properly episcopal , are_not heads of particular Churches . Each Bishop , always in union with his_brothers in the episcopate and with the Roman Pontiff , represents Christ the Head and Shepherd of the Church : he does this not_only in a proper and specific manner when he receives the office of pastor of a particular Church , but_also when he cooperates with the Diocesan Bishop in the governance of his Church or when he shares in the Roman Pontiff s office of universal pastor in the governance of the universal Church . In the course of her history the Church has_also recognized , in addition to the specific form of presidency over a particular Church , other_forms of exercising the episcopal ministry \u2013 such as that of an Auxiliary Bishop or a representative of the Roman Pontiff in the offices of the Holy See or in Papal Legations ; today too , in accordance_with_the norms of law , she admits these other_forms when_they_are needed . The missionary character and the unitary nature of the episcopal ministry . The Gospel of Luke cf . : tells us that Jesus named the Twelve '' Apostles '' , which literally means '' envoys '' , '' those_who_are sent '' . In the Gospel of Mark we read that Jesus also appointed the Twelve '' to be sent out to preach '' : . This means_that both the election and the establishment of the Twelve as Apostles are directed towards mission . Their first sending cf . Mt : ; Mk : ; Lk : comes to its fulfilment in the mission that Jesus entrusts to them after_the Resurrection , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his Ascension into_heaven . The Lord s words remain as timely as ever : '' All authority in heaven and on earth has_been_given to me . Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you ; and lo , I -amos- with you always , to the close of the age '' Mt : . This apostolic mission finds_its solemn confirmation on the day of Pentecost with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit . In the text of the Gospel of Matthew just quoted , the entire pastoral_ministry can be seen as organized according to the threefold function of teaching , sanctifying and governing . We see here a reflection of the threefold dimension of Christ s service and mission . We , as Christians , and in a qualitatively new manner as priests , participate in the mission of our Master , who_-isaia- Prophet , Priest and King , and we are_called to bear special witness to him in the Church and before the world . These three functions triplex munus and the powers that derive from them express on the level of action the pastoral_ministry munus pastorale that_every Bishop receives with episcopal consecration . It -isaia- a share in Christ s own love that_-isaia- given in the consecration ; this love_-isaia- made concrete in the proclamation of the Gospel of hope to all peoples cf . Lk : , in the administration of the sacraments to those_who embrace salvation and in the guidance of God s holy people towards eternal_life . These three functions are , in fact , deeply interconnected ; they explain , influence and clarify one_another . For this_reason , then , when_the Bishop teaches , he also sanctifies and governs the People of God ; when he sanctifies , he also teaches and governs ; when he governs , he teaches and sanctifies . Saint Augustine defines the entirety of this episcopal ministry as an office of love : amoris officium . This gives us the certainty_that the pastoral_charity of Jesus Christ will_never be lacking in the Church . '' He called to him those_whom he desired '' Mk : . A great crowd was following Jesus when he decided to go up the mountain and call the Apostles . There were many disciples , but_from them he chose Twelve alone for the specific role of Apostles cf . In the Synod Hall the words of Saint Augustine were often heard : '' For you I -amos- a Bishop and with you I -amos- a Christian '' . As a gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church , the Bishop -isaia- above all else , like every_other Christian , a son and member of the Church . From this_holy Mother he has_received the gift of divine_life in the sacrament of Baptism and his_first instruction in the faith . Together with all the faithful he shares in the incomparable dignity of the children of God , a dignity to be lived out in communion and in a spirit of gratitude and fraternity . On the other_hand , by virtue of the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders , the Bishop -isaia-_also the one_who , before the faithful , -isaia- teacher , sanctifier and shepherd , charged with acting in the name and in the person of Christ . These are obviously two relationships which do not_simply stand side by side but are deeply interconnected ; they_are ordered to each_other inasmuch as both draw upon the richness of Christ , the one High Priest . The Bishop becomes a '' father '' precisely_because he -isaia- fully a '' son '' of the Church . This brings up once_again the relationship_between_the common priesthood of the faithful and the ministerial priesthood : two modes of participation in the one priesthood of Christ , which involves two dimensions which unite in the supreme act of the sacrifice of the Cross . This -isaia- reflected in the relationship which exists in the Church between_the common priesthood and the ministerial priesthood . The fact_that for all their difference in essence each -isaia- ordered to the other gives_rise to an interplay that harmoniously structures the life of the Church as the place_where the salvation brought_about by Christ -isaia- made historically present . This interplay -isaia- present in the very person of the Bishop , who_-isaia- and remains a baptized member of the Church , yet -isaia- incorporated into the high priesthood . This deeper reality of the Bishop -isaia- the foundation of his '' being among '' the other faithful and of his being placed '' before '' them . The Second Vatican Council puts this nicely : '' If therefore everyone in the Church does_not walk along the same path , nevertheless all are_called to sanctity and have_received an equal privilege of faith through the justice of God cf Pet : . And if by the will of Christ some are made teachers , dispensers of mysteries , and shepherds on behalf of others , yet all share a true equality with_regard to the dignity and to the activity common to all the faithful for the building up of the Body of Christ . For the distinction which_the Lord made between sacred ministers and the rest of the People of God entails a unity , since pastors and the other faithful_are bound to each_other by a common bond . The Church s pastors , following_the_example of the Lord , should minister to one_another and to the rest of the faithful . The faithful in their turn should cooperate gladly with_their pastors and teachers '' . The pastoral_ministry received in episcopal consecration , which sets the Bishop '' before '' the other faithful , finds expression in his '' being for '' the other members of the faithful while not detracting from his '' being with '' them . This -isaia- true with_regard both to the Bishop s personal sanctification , which_must be pursued and realized in the exercise of his_ministry , and to the '' style '' with_which he carries out this ministry in all its respective functions . The interplay between_the common priesthood of the faithful and the ministerial priesthood , present in the episcopal ministry itself , -isaia- manifested in a kind of '' perichoresis '' between_the two forms of priesthood : a perichoresis between_the common witness to the faith given by the faithful and the Bishop s authoritative witness to the faith through_his magisterial acts ; a perichoresis between_the lived holiness of the faithful and the means of sanctification that the Bishop offers them ; and finally , a perichoresis between_the personal responsibility of the Bishop for the good of the Church entrusted to him and the shared responsibility of all the faithful for that_same Church . CHAPTER TWOTHE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF THE BISHOP '' . he appointed Twelve that they_might be with_him '' Mk , . In the same act of love by which he freely established the Twelve as Apostles , Jesus called them to share his own_life . This sharing , which_-isaia- a communion of mind_and_heart with_him , also appears as an inner demand of their participation in Jesus own mission . The functions of the Bishop must_not be reduced to those of administration alone . Precisely in order to avoid this risk , both the preparatory documents of the Synod and many interventions by the Fathers in the Synod Hall dwelt -atti_degli_apostoli- length on what_the reality of the episcopate as the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders \u2013 in its theological , Christological and pneumatological foundations \u2013 entails for the personal life of the Bishop and for the exercise of the ministry entrusted to him . Objective sanctification , which by Christ s work_-isaia- present in the sacrament through the communication of the Holy Spirit , needs to coincide with subjective sanctification , in which_the Bishop , by the help of grace , must continuously progress through the exercise of his_ministry . The ontological transformation brought_about by episcopal consecration , as a configuration to Christ , demands a lifestyle that manifests a '' being with_him '' . Consequently , during the Synod sessions , emphasis was laid on pastoral_charity as being the fruit of the character bestowed by the sacrament and of its particular grace . Charity , it was said , -isaia- in a sense the heart of the ministry of the Bishop , who_-isaia- drawn into a dynamic pastoral pro existence whereby he -isaia- impelled to live , like Christ the Good Shepherd , for the Father and for others , in the daily gift_of_self . It -isaia- above all in exercising his_own ministry , inspired by imitation of the charity of the Good Shepherd , that the Bishop -isaia- called to be sanctified and to sanctify , taking as his unifying principle contemplation of the face of Christ and the proclamation of the Gospel of salvation . His spirituality , therefore , draws direction and nourishment not_only from the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation but_also from his episcopal ordination , which commits him to living out in faith , hope and charity his_ministry of evangelization , liturgical presidency and leadership in the community . The Bishop s spirituality will therefore be an ecclesial spirituality , since everything in his_life -isaia-_directed towards_the building up of the Church in love . This requires of the Bishop an attitude of service marked by personal strength , apostolic courage and trusting abandonment to the inner working of the Spirit . He will therefore strive to adopt a lifestyle which imitates the kenosis of Christ , the poor and humble servant , so that the exercise of his pastoral_ministry will be a consistent reflection of Jesus , the Servant of God , and will_help him to become , like Jesus , close to everyone , from the greatest to the least . Again , by a form of reciprocal interplay , the faithful and loving exercise of his_ministry sanctifies the Bishop and on the subjective level configures him ever more_closely to the ontological richness of sanctity which_the sacrament has bestowed upon him . The Bishop s personal holiness , however , -isaia- never limited to the purely subjective level , since in its efficacy it always proves beneficial to the faithful entrusted to his pastoral_care . In the practice of charity , as the content of the pastoral_ministry he has_received , the Bishop becomes a sign of Christ and acquires that moral authority needed_for the effective exercise of his juridical authority . Unless the episcopal office -isaia- based on the witness of a holiness manifested in pastoral_charity , humility and simplicity of life , it ends up being reduced to a solely functional role and , tragically , it loses credibility before the clergy and the faithful . The call to holiness in the Church in our_time . There -isaia- a particularly apt Biblical image to describe the figure of the Bishop as the friend of God and the pastor and guide of his_people . It -isaia- the figure of Moses . Looking to him , the Bishop can_find inspiration for his_life and activity as a pastor , for Moses was chosen and sent by the Lord , courageous in leading his_people toward_the Promised Land , a faithful interpreter of the word and law of the living God , a mediator of the Covenant , ardent and confident in his prayer on behalf of his_people . Like Moses , who after_his dialogue_with_the Lord on the holy mountain returned among his people_with his face radiant cf . Ex : , so the Bishop will_be_able to show his brothers_and_sisters that_he_-isaia- their father , brother and friend only if he has entered the dark yet luminous cloud of the mystery of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . Radiant with the light of the Trinity , he will be a sign of the merciful goodness of the Father , a living image of the love of the Son , and transparently a man of the Spirit , consecrated and sent forth to lead the People of God along the paths of history on their pilgrimage to eternity . The Synod Fathers stressed the importance of spiritual commitment in the life , ministry and growth of the Bishop . I myself have spoken of its priority in conformity_with_the requirements of the Church s life and the call of the Holy Spirit , who in these years has made evident to everyone the primacy of grace , the widespread desire_for spirituality and the urgent_need for a witness of holiness . The call_for spirituality arises from a consideration of the work of the Holy Spirit in salvation history , where his presence -isaia- active and dynamic , prophetic and missionary . The gift of the fullness of the Holy Spirit , which_the Bishop receives -atti_degli_apostoli- his episcopal ordination , -isaia- a precious and urgent call to cooperate with the Spirit s activity in ecclesial_communion and in universal mission . Held in the wake of the Great Jubilee of , the Synodal Assembly made its_own from the beginning the call to holiness of life_which I set before the whole Church : '' All pastoral initiatives must be set in relation to holiness . Once the Jubilee -isaia- over , we resume our normal path , but knowing that , stressing holiness remains more_than_ever an urgent pastoral task '' . An enthusiastic acceptance of my appeal to give first_place to the call to holiness was_the atmosphere in which_the synodal labours took_place and the environment which , in a certain_sense , unified the Fathers interventions and reflections . In their_hearts they heard resound Saint Gregory Nazianzen s admonition : '' First be purified and then purify others , first allow yourself to be instructed by wisdom and then instruct others , first become light and then enlighten others , first draw close to God and then guide others to him , first be holy yourself and then make others holy '' . For this_reason frequent appeals were heard during the Synodal Assembly for a clearer specification of the properly '' episcopal '' character of the Bishop s path to holiness . This will_always be a holiness lived with his_people and for his_people , in a communion_which becomes a stimulus to and a mutual building up in charity . These are_not secondary or marginal demands . It -isaia- precisely_the Bishop s own spiritual_life which favours the fruitfulness of his pastoral_activity . Is not the ultimate basis of all pastoral effectiveness constant meditation on the mystery of Christ , passionate contemplation of his Face and generous imitation of the life of the Good Shepherd ? If ours -isaia- indeed a time of continual movement and even -atti_degli_apostoli- times of frenzied '' doing for the sake of doing '' , then the Bishop must be the first to show by the example of his own_life the need to re establish the primacy of '' being '' over '' doing '' and , more importantly , the primacy of grace , which , in the Christian vision of life , remains the essential principle for_any '' planning '' of pastoral_ministry . The Bishop s spiritual journey . A Bishop can be considered a genuine minister of communion and hope_for God s holy people only_when he walks in the presence of the Lord . It -isaia- not_possible to be a servant of others unless one_-isaia- first a '' servant of God '' . And one can_only be a servant of God if one_-isaia- a '' man of God '' . For this_reason I stated in my homily_-atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Synod : '' The pastor must be a man of God ; his existence and his_ministry are entirely under his_divine glory and from the supereminent mystery of God they derive their light and vigour '' . For Bishops the call to holiness -isaia- inherent in the sacramental event that stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the origin of their_ministry , that_-isaia- , their episcopal ordination . The ancient Euchology of Serapion formulates the ritual invocation of the consecration thus : '' God of truth , make thy servant a living Bishop , a holy Bishop in the succession of the holy Apostles '' . Since episcopal ordination does_not infuse the perfection of the virtues , '' the Bishop -isaia- called to pursue his path of perfection with_greater intensity so as to attain to the stature of Christ , the perfect Man '' . The Christological and Trinitarian character of his mystery and ministry demands of the Bishop a journey of holiness which consists in a progressive advance towards an ever_more profound spiritual and apostolic maturity marked by the primacy of pastoral_charity . This journey -isaia- obviously experienced together_with his_people , along a path which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once personal and communitarian , like the life of the Church itself . Along this path , however , the Bishop becomes , in intimate communion with Christ and attentive docility to the Holy Spirit , a witness , a model , and a source of encouragement and help . This same idea -isaia- expressed by canon_law : '' Mindful that_he_-isaia- bound to give an example of holiness , charity , humility and simplicity of life , the Diocesan Bishop -isaia- to seek in every way to promote the holiness of Christ s faithful according to the special vocation of each . Since he -isaia- the principal dispenser of the mysteries of God , he -isaia- to strive constantly that_the_faithful entrusted to his care may grow in grace through the celebration of the sacraments , and may know and live the Paschal mystery '' . The spiritual journey of the Bishop , like that of every Christian , -isaia- rooted in the sacramental grace of Baptism and Confirmation . He shares this grace in common with all the faithful since , as the Second Vatican Council notes , '' all the faithful of whatever condition or rank are_called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity '' . Here the celebrated expression of Saint Augustine , with its rich realism and supernatural wisdom , proves especially true : '' If I -amos- in fear because I -amos- for you , I -amos- consoled to be with you . Because for you I -amos- a Bishop , with you I -amos- a Christian . The first name -isaia- one of responsibility , the second , one of grace . The former -isaia- the name of a danger , the latter of salvation '' . Thanks to pastoral_charity , however , responsibility becomes a form of service and peril -isaia- transformed into an opportunity_for growth and maturation . The episcopal ministry -isaia-_not_only a source of holiness for others , but -isaia-_already a cause of sanctification for one_who allows the charity of God to pass through_his own heart and life . The Synod Fathers presented in synthesis some of the demands of this journey . Above all they stressed the character given in Baptism and Confirmation , which from the beginning of our_lives as Christians , through the theological virtues , makes us capable of believing in God , hoping in him and loving him . The Holy Spirit , in turn , infuses his gifts and fosters our growth in goodness through the exercise of the moral virtues that concretize , also on the human level , our spiritual_life . By means of the Baptism he has_received , the Bishop shares , like every Christian , in that spirituality which_-isaia- rooted in incorporation in Christ and -isaia- manifested in following Christ in accordance_with_the Gospel . For this_reason_the Bishop shares the call to holiness proper to all the faithful . He must_therefore cultivate a life of prayer and profound faith , and put all his trust in God , offering his witness to the Gospel in docile obedience to the prompting of the Holy Spirit , and maintaining a particular filial devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary , the perfect teacher of the spiritual_life . The spirituality of the Bishop will thus be a spirituality of communion , lived in harmony_with_the other baptized faithful_who with_him are children of one Father in heaven and one Mother on earth , Holy Church . Like all believers in Christ , he needs to nourish his spiritual_life with the living and effective word of the Gospel and with the living bread of the Holy Eucharist , the food of eternal_life . Because of his human frailty the Bishop -isaia-_also called to have frequent and regular recourse to the sacrament of Penance , in order to obtain the gift of that mercy of which he himself has been_made a minister . Mindful , therefore , of his human weaknesses and sins , each Bishop , along_with his priests , personally experiences the sacrament of Reconciliation as a profound need and as a grace to be received ever anew , and thus renews his_own commitment to holiness in the exercise of his_ministry . In this_way he also gives visible expression to the mystery of a Church which_-isaia- constitutively holy , yet also made up of sinners in need of forgiveness . Like all priests and , obviously , in special communion with the priests of his diocesan presbyterate , the Bishop will strive to progress along a specific path of holiness . He -isaia-_also called to holiness by a new title arising from Holy Orders . The Bishop thus lives by faith , hope and love , inasmuch as he -isaia- a minister of the Lord s word and of the sanctification and spiritual advancement of the People of God . He must be holy because he must serve the Church as teacher , sanctifier and guide . As such , he must_also love the Church deeply and fervently . Each Bishop -isaia- configured to Christ in order to love the Church with the love of Christ the Bridegroom , and in order to be in the Church a minister of her unity , enabling her to become '' a people gathered by the unity of the Father , of the Son and of the Holy Spirit '' . The specific spirituality of the Bishop , as the Synod Fathers repeatedly emphasized , -isaia- further enriched by the bestowal of that grace inherent in the fullness of the priesthood which_-isaia- given to him -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of his ordination . As a pastor of the flock and servant of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in hope , the Bishop must become as it were a transparent reflection of the very person of Christ , the Supreme Pastor . In the Roman Pontifical this requirement -isaia- explicitly mentioned : '' Receive the miter , and may the splendour of holiness shine_forth in you , so that_when the Chief Shepherd appears , you_may deserve to receive from him an unfading crown of glory '' . Hence , the Bishop constantly needs the grace of God that strengthens and perfects his human_nature . He can say with the Apostle Paul : '' Our sole credit -isaia- from God who_has made us qualified ministers of a new_covenant '' Cor : . It needs to be emphasized that the apostolic ministry -isaia- a source of spirituality for the Bishop , who should derive from it all the spiritual resources which_will make him grow in holiness and enable him to discover the workings of the Holy Spirit in the People of God entrusted to his pastoral_care . The spiritual journey of the Bishop coincides , from this perspective , with_that pastoral_charity which_must rightly be considered the soul of his apostolate , as it -isaia- of the apostolate of priests and deacons . Here it -isaia-_not_only a matter of an existentia but indeed of a pro existentia , that_-isaia- to say , of a way of living inspired by the supreme model of Christ the Lord and which_-isaia- spent totally in worship of the Father and in service of neighbour . The Second Vatican Council rightly states that pastors , in the image of Christ , must carry_out_their ministry with holiness and zeal , with humility and fortitude , '' which , fulfilled in this_way , will be for them an excellent means of sanctification '' . No Bishop can fail to realize_that the summit of Christian holiness -isaia- the crucified Christ in his supreme self oblation to the Father and to his brothers_and_sisters in the Holy Spirit . For this_reason configuration to Christ and a share in his sufferings cf . Pet : becomes_the royal road of the Bishop s holiness in the midst of his_people . Mary , Mother of Hope and teacher of the spiritual_life . The Bishop will_also find support for his spiritual_life in the maternal presence of the Virgin Mary , Mater spei et spes nostra , as the Church invokes her . The Bishop will therefore nourish an authentic and filial devotion to Mary , and feel himself called to make her fiat his_own , re experiencing and re appropriating each_day Jesus entrusting of Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Cross to the Beloved Disciple , and of the Beloved Disciple to Mary cf . The Bishop -isaia-_also called to reflect the unanimous and persevering prayer of Christ s disciples and Apostles with_his Mother in preparation_for Pentecost . This icon of the nascent Church manifests the indissoluble bond uniting Mary and the successors of the Apostles cf . The holy Mother of God will consequently be the Bishop s teacher in listening to the word of God and promptly putting it into_practice , as a faithful disciple of the one Teacher , in firm faith , confident hope and ardent charity . As Mary was_the '' memory '' of the incarnation of the Word in the first Christian community , so the Bishop must preserve and pass on the living Tradition of the Church , in communion with all the other Bishops , in union with , and under the authority of , the Successor of Peter . The Bishop s solid Marian devotion will be constantly related to the liturgy , where_the Blessed Virgin -isaia- particularly present in the celebration of the mysteries of salvation and serves as a model of docility and prayer , of spiritual oblation and motherhood for the whole Church . Indeed , it will be the Bishop s responsibility to ensure_that the liturgy always appears '' as an exemplary form , a source of inspiration , a constant point of reference and the ultimate goal '' for the Marian piety of the People of God . While holding to this principle , the Bishop will_also nourish his personal and communitarian Marian devotion by devotional practices approved and recommended by the Church , especially by the recitation of that compendium of the Gospel which_-isaia- the Holy Rosary . Being himself completely familiar with this_prayer , completely centred as it -isaia- on the contemplation of the saving events of Christ s life with_which his holy Mother was closely associated , every Bishop -isaia-_also called to promote diligently its recitation . Entrusting oneself to the word . The assembly of the Synod of Bishops indicated several indispensable means_for the sustenance and progress of the spiritual_life . First among_these -isaia- reading and meditating on the word of God . Every Bishop should_always commend himself and feel commended '' to the Lord and to the word of his_grace , which_-isaia- able to build up and give the inheritance among all those_who_are sanctified '' cf . Before becoming one_who hands on the word , the Bishop , together_with his priests and indeed like every member of the faithful and like the Church herself , must be a hearer of the word . He should live '' within '' the word and allow himself to be protected and nourished by it , as if by a mother s womb . With Saint Ignatius of Antioch the Bishop must say : '' I commend myself to the Gospel as to the flesh of Christ '' . Each Bishop will thus take to heart_the well_known admonition of Saint Jerome quoted by the Second Vatican Council : '' Ignorance of the Scriptures -isaia- ignorance of Christ '' . There can be no primacy of holiness without attentive listening to the Word of God , which_-isaia- the guide and nourishment of all holiness . To commend oneself to the word of God and to keep it , like the Virgin Mary , Virgo audiens , requires the practice of certain aids constantly proposed by the Church s tradition and spiritual experience . These include , first of all , frequent personal reading and regular study of Sacred Scripture . A Bishop would try in vain to preach the word to others if he did_not first listen to it within himself . Without frequent contact_with Sacred Scripture a Bishop would hardly be a credible minister of hope , since , as Saint Paul reminds us , it -isaia- '' from the lessons of patience and the words of encouragement in the Scriptures that_we_can derive hope '' cf . The words of Origen remain ever applicable : '' These are the two activities of the Bishop : learning from God by reading the divine Scriptures and meditating on them frequently , and teaching the people . But let_him teach the things_that he himself has learned from God '' . The Synod recalled the importance of reading lectio and meditation meditatio on the word of God in the life of pastors and in their_ministry of service to the community . As I wrote in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte , '' it -isaia-_especially necessary_that listening to the word of God should become a life_giving encounter , in the ancient and ever valid tradition of lectio divina , which draws from the biblical text the living word which questions , directs and shapes our_lives '' . In the realm of meditation and lectio , the heart which has_already received_the word opens itself to the contemplation of God s work and , consequently , to a conversion of thoughts and life to him , accompanied by a heartfelt request for his forgiveness and grace . Drawing nourishment from the Eucharist . Just as the Paschal Mystery stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the life_and_mission of the Good Shepherd , so too the Eucharist stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the life_and_mission of the Bishop , as of every priest . At the daily celebration of Holy Mass , the Bishop offers himself together_with Christ . When this celebration takes_place in the cathedral or in other_churches , especially parish churches , with the presence and the active participation of the faithful , the Bishop stands before all as Sacerdos et Pontifex , since he acts in the person of Christ and in the power of his Spirit , and as hiereus , the holy priest , devoted to enacting the sacred mysteries of the altar , which he proclaims and explains by his preaching . The Bishop s love of the Holy Eucharist -isaia-_also expressed when in the course of the day he devotes a fair part of his time to adoration before the tabernacle . Here the Bishop opens his_heart to the Lord , allowing it to be filled and shaped by the love poured forth_from the Cross by the great Shepherd of the sheep , who shed his_blood and gave_his life_for them . To him the Bishop raises his prayer in constant intercession for the sheep entrusted to his care . Prayer and the Liturgy of the Hours . A second means_for the advancement of the Bishop s spiritual_life mentioned by the Synod Fathers -isaia- prayer , especially_the prayer raised to the Lord in the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours , which remains the distinctive prayer of the Christian community , carried_out in the name of Christ and under_the_guidance of the Spirit . Prayer -isaia- itself a particular duty for a Bishop , and for all those_who '' have_received the gift of a vocation to the specially consecrated_life : of its_nature , their consecration makes them more open to the experience of contemplation '' . The Bishop himself cannot forget that_he_-isaia- a successor of those Apostles who_were appointed by Christ above all '' to be with_him '' Mk : , and who -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of their_mission made a solemn declaration which_-isaia- a programme of life : '' We will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word '' Acts : . The Bishop will be a true teacher of prayer_for the faithful only if he can draw upon his_own personal experience of dialogue_with God . He must be able to turn to God continually with the words of the Psalmist : '' I hope in your word '' Ps : . From prayer he will gain that hope which he must in turn pass on to the faithful . Prayer -isaia- the privileged forum where hope finds expression and nourishment , since_it_-isaia- , in the words of Saint Thomas Aquinas , the '' interpreter of hope '' . The Bishop s personal prayer will be particularly and typically '' apostolic , '' in the sense that_it_-isaia- presented to the Father as intercession for all the needs of the people entrusted to his care . In the Roman Pontifical this_-isaia- the final commitment demanded of the candidate elected to the episcopacy before the rite of the imposition of hands : '' Are you resolved to pray without ceasing for the People of God , and to carry_out the office of high_priest without reproach ? '' . The Bishop prays in a very_special way_for the holiness of his priests , for vocations to the ordained ministry and the consecrated_life , so that missionary and apostolic commitment will be all the more ardent in the Church . With regard to the Liturgy of the Hours , which_-isaia- meant to consecrate and guide the course of the entire day through the praise of God , we cannot_fail to recall_the impressive statement of the Second Vatican Council : '' When this wonderful song of praise -isaia- worthily rendered by priests and others_who are deputed for this_purpose by Church ordinance , or by the faithful praying together_with_the priest in an approved form , then it -isaia- truly the voice of the Bride addressing her Bridegroom ; it -isaia- the very prayer which Christ himself , together_with his Body , addresses to the Father . Hence , all who perform this service are not_only fulfilling a duty of the Church , but_also are sharing in the greatest honour accorded to Christ s Spouse , for by offering these praises to God they_are standing before God s throne in the name of the Church , their Mother '' . Writing on the prayer of the Divine Office , my predecessor of venerable memory Pope Paul VI , called it '' the prayer of the local Church '' , which expresses '' the true nature of the praying Church '' . The consecratio temporis , effected by the Liturgy of the Hours , brings about_that laus perennis which_-isaia- an anticipation and prefiguration of the heavenly liturgy and a bond of union with the angels and saints who glorify God s name throughout eternity . The Bishop will_become , and will appear , as a man of hope to the extent_that he enters into the eschatological dynamism of praying the Psalter . The Psalms resound with the voice of the Bride vox sponsae as she calls upon her Bridegroom . Every Bishop therefore prays with his_people and for his_people . He himself_-isaia- supported and assisted by the prayer of his faithful : priests , deacons , consecrated_persons and the lay_people of all ages . In their midst the Bishop -isaia- a teacher and a promoter of prayer . He not_only hands down what he himself has contemplated , but he opens to Christians the way of contemplation itself . The well_known motto contemplata aliis tradere thus becomes contemplationem aliis tradere . The way of the evangelical_counsels and the Beatitudes . To all his_disciples , and especially to those_who while still on this earth wish to follow_him more_closely like the Apostles , the Lord proposes the way of the evangelical_counsels . In addition to being a gift of the Holy Trinity to the Church , the counsels are a reflection of the life of the Trinity in each believer . This -isaia-_especially the case in the Bishop , who , as a successor of the Apostles , -isaia- called to follow Christ along the path leading to the perfection of charity . For this_reason he -isaia- consecrated , even as Jesus was consecrated . The Bishop s life_-isaia- radically dependent on Christ and a completely transparent image of Christ before the Church and the world . The life of the Bishop must radiate the life of Christ and consequently Christ s own obedience to the Father , even unto death , death on a Cross cf . Phil : , his chaste and virginal love , and his poverty which_-isaia- absolute detachment from all earthly goods . In this_way the Bishops can lead by their example not_only those members of the Church who are_called to follow Christ in the consecrated_life but_also priests , to whom_the radicalism of holiness in accordance_with_the spirit of the evangelical_counsels -isaia-_also proposed . Indeed , this radicalism -isaia- incumbent on all the faithful , including lay_people , for it -isaia- '' a fundamental , undeniable demand flowing from the call of Christ to follow and imitate him by virtue of the intimate communion of life with_him brought_about by the Spirit '' . The faithful ought to be able to contemplate on the face of their Bishop the grace given qualities which in the various Beatitudes make up the self portrait of Christ : the face of poverty , meekness and the thirst_for righteousness ; the merciful face of the Father and of the peaceful and peacegiving man ; the pure face of one_who constantly looks to God alone . The faithful should_also be able to see in their Bishop the face of one_who relives Jesus own compassion for the afflicted and , today as much as in the past , the face filled_with strength and interior joy of one persecuted for the truth of the Gospel . The virtue of obedience . By taking on these very human features of Jesus , the Bishop also becomes_the model and promoter of a spirituality of communion , carefully and vigilantly working to build up the Church , so that all that he says and does will reflect a common filial submission in Christ and in the Spirit to the loving plan of the Father . As a teacher of holiness and minister of the sanctification of his_people , the Bishop -isaia- called to carry_out faithfully the will of the Father . The Bishop s obedience must be lived according to the example \u2013 for it could hardly be otherwise \u2013 of the obedience of Christ himself , who said_that he came down from heaven not to do his_own will , but_rather the will of the One who sent him cf . Walking in the footsteps of Christ , the Bishop -isaia- obedient to the Gospel and the Church s Tradition ; he -isaia- able to read the signs of the times and to recognize_the voice of the Holy Spirit in the Petrine ministry and in episcopal collegiality . In my Apostolic Exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis I stressed the apostolic , communitarian and pastoral character of priestly obedience . These hallmarks naturally appear even_more markedly in the obedience of the Bishop . The fullness of the Sacrament of Holy Orders which he has_received puts him in a special relationship_with the Successor of Peter , with the members of the College of Bishops and with_his own particular Church . He must feel committed to living intensely this relationship_with the Pope and his_brother Bishops in a close bond of unity and cooperation , and thus conforming to the divine plan which willed to unite the Apostles inseparably around Peter . This hierarchical communion of the Bishop with the Supreme Pontiff strengthens his ability to make present , by virtue of the Order he has_received , Jesus Christ , the invisible Head of the whole Church . The apostolic aspect of obedience -isaia- necessarily linked also to its communitarian aspect , since_the episcopate -isaia- by its_nature '' one and indivisible '' . As a result of this communal dimension , the Bishop -isaia- called to live out his obedience by overcoming all temptations to individualism and by taking upon himself , within_the wider context of the mission of the College of Bishops , concern_for the good of the whole Church . As a model of attentive listening , the Bishop will_also strive to understand , through prayer and discernment , the will of God in what_the Spirit -isaia- saying to the Church . Through the evangelical exercise of his authority , he will be ready to dialogue_with his co workers and the faithful in order to build effective mutual understanding . This will_enable him to show a pastoral appreciation of the dignity and responsibility of each member of the People of God , fostering in a balanced and serene way their spirit of initiative . The faithful should be helped to grow towards a responsible obedience which will_enable them to be actively engaged on the pastoral plane . Here the exhortation which Saint Ignatius of Antioch addressed to Polycarp remains timely : '' Let nothing be done without your consent , but do nothing yourself without_the consent of God '' . The spirit and practice of poverty in Bishops . The Synod Fathers , as a sign of collegial unity , responded to the appeal which I made -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening Mass of the Synod that the evangelical Beatitude of poverty should be considered an indispensable condition_for a fruitful episcopal ministry in present_day circumstances . Here too , amid the assembly of Bishops there stood out the figure of Christ the Lord , '' who carried_out the work of redemption in poverty and under oppression '' , and who invites the Church , and above all her pastors , '' to follow_the same path in communicating to humanity the fruits of salvation '' . Consequently , the Bishop who wishes to be an authentic witness and minister of the Gospel of hope must be a vir pauper . This -isaia- demanded by the witness he -isaia- called to bear to Christ , who_was himself poor . It -isaia-_also demanded by the Church s concern_for the poor , who must be the object of a preferential option . The Bishop s decision to carry_out his_ministry in poverty contributes decisively to making the Church the '' home of the poor '' . This decision also provides the Bishop with inner freedom in the exercise of his_ministry and enables him to communicate effectively the fruits of salvation . Episcopal authority must be exercised with untiring generosity and inexhaustible liberality . On the Bishop s part , this calls for complete trust in the providence of the heavenly Father , an open hearted communion of goods , an austere way_of_life and continuous personal conversion . Only in this_way will he be able to share in the struggles and sufferings of the People of God , whom he -isaia- called not_only to lead and nourish but_with whom he must show fraternal solidarity , sharing their problems and helping to build their hope . He will carry_out this service effectively if his_own life_-isaia- simple , sober and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time active and generous , and if it places those considered least important in our society not on the fringes but_rather -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the Christian community . Almost without realizing it , he will foster a '' creativity in charity '' which_will bear_fruit not_simply in the efficiency of the assistance offered but_also in an ability to live in a spirit of fraternal sharing . In the Church of the Apostles , as the Book of Acts clearly witnesses , the poverty of some members of the community called forth the solidarity of others , with the amazing result that '' there_was not a needy person among_them '' : . The Church needs to bear_witness to this prophecy before a world assailed by the problems of hunger and inequality between peoples . In this perspective of sharing and of simplicity of life , the Bishop will administer the goods of the Church like the '' good head of a household '' , and be careful to ensure that_they_are used for the Church s own specific ends : the worship of God , the support of her ministers , the works of the apostolate and initiatives of charity towards_the poor . The title procurator pauperum has_always_been applied to the Church s pastors . This must_also be the case today , so that the Gospel of Jesus Christ can become present and be heard as a source of hope_for all , but especially_for those_who can expect from God alone a more dignified life and a better future . Encouraged by the example of their pastors , the Church and the Churches must practise that '' preferential option for the poor '' which I have indicated as programmatic for the third_millennium . With chastity -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of a Church which reflects the purity of Christ . '' Receive this ring , the seal of fidelity : adorned with undefiled faith , preserve unblemished the Bride of God , the holy Church '' . These words of the Roman Pontifical urge the Bishop to realize that_he_-isaia- committed to mirroring the virginal love of Christ for all his faithful ones . He -isaia- called above all to foster relationships inspired by the respect and esteem befitting a family where love flourishes , in accordance_with_the exhortation of the Apostle Peter : '' Love one_another deeply , from the heart , for you have_been born again , not of perishable seed but of imperishable , through the living and enduring word of God Pet : '' . While exhorting Christians by his example and words to offer their bodies as a living and holy sacrifice pleasing to God cf . Rom : , the Bishop must remind everyone that '' the form of this world_-isaia- passing away '' Cor : , and that_it_-isaia- our_duty to '' wait in joyful hope '' for Christ s return in glory cf . In his_pastoral concern he should be especially close with paternal affection to all who_have embraced the religious_life in the profession of the evangelical_counsels and who offer their valuable service to the Church . He will support and encourage priests , who , called by God s grace , have freely assumed the commitment of celibacy for the Kingdom of Heaven , and remind himself and them of the evangelical and spiritual grounds of this choice , so important_for the service of the People of God . In the reality of the Church and the world today , the witness of chaste love_-isaia- , on the one_hand , a form of spiritual therapy for_humanity and , on the other , a form of protest against the idolatry of instinct . In the present social context , the Bishop needs to remain particularly close to his flock and above all to his priests , showing a father s concern_for their ascetic and spiritual difficulties , and providing them_with appropriate support to encourage them in fidelity to their_vocation and to the requirements of an exemplary life in the exercise of the ministry . In cases of grave lapses , and even_more of crimes which do damage to the very witness of the Gospel , especially_when these involve the Church s ministers , the Bishop must be firm and decisive , just and impartial . He -isaia- bound to intervene in a timely manner , according to the established canonical norms , for the correction and spiritual good of the sacred minister , for the reparation of scandal and the restoration of justice , and for all that_-isaia- required_for the protection and assistance of victims . By his_words and example , and in his vigilance and paternal intervention , the Bishop fulfils his duty to offer the world_the reality of a Church which_-isaia- holy and chaste , in her ministers and in her faithful . When he does so , he walks as a pastor -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of his flock , as did Christ the Bridegroom , who gave_his life_for us and who left to all the example of a love which_-isaia- transparent and virginal , and therefore fruitful and universal . The proponent of a spirituality of communion and mission . In my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte I pointed_out the need to '' make_the Church the home and the school of communion '' . This remark had a vast resonance and was taken up by the Synodal Assembly . Obviously the Bishop , in his_own spiritual journey , has the primary duty of promoting and encouraging a spirituality of communion , and tirelessly working to make it a basic educational principle wherever human and Christian formation takes_place : in parishes , Catholic associations , ecclesial movements , Catholic schools and youth groups . The Bishop will be particularly concerned to ensure_that the spirituality of communion takes root and grows wherever future priests_are trained , that_-isaia- to say , in seminaries and in religious novitiates , in religious houses , in institutes and faculties of theology . In that_same Apostolic Letter I indicated the broad outlines of this promotion of a spirituality of communion . Here it will suffice to add that a Bishop must encourage this spirituality especially among his presbyterate , as well as among deacons and men_and_women_religious . He will do so in personal dialogue and encounters , but_also in community meetings . To this_end he will_make an effort to provide in his_own particular Church special occasions which facilitate listening , especially to the Spirit '' who speaks to the Churches '' Acts : , et al . Examples of the latter would be retreats , spiritual_exercises and days of spirituality , and also a prudent use of new communications media , should this prove useful and effective . For a Bishop , fostering a spirituality of communion also means nurturing his communion with the Roman Pontiff and with his_brother Bishops , especially within_the same Episcopal Conference and Ecclesiastical Province . Here too , as an important means of overcoming the risk of a sense of isolation and discouragement in the face of the immensity of the problems and the time spent in dealing_with them , the Bishop , in addition to prayer , should readily avail himself of the friendship and fraternal communion of his_brother Bishops . Communion , in its Trinitarian source and model , -isaia- always expressed in mission . Mission -isaia- the fruit and the logical consequence of communion . The dynamic process of communion_-isaia- favoured by openness to the horizons and demands of mission , always ensuring the witness of unity so that_the_world may believe and making ever_greater room_for love , so that all people may attain to the Trinitarian unity from which_they_have come forth and to which_they_are destined . The more intense communion_-isaia- , the more mission_-isaia- fostered , especially_when it -isaia- lived out in the poverty of love , which_-isaia- the ability to go forth to meet any person or group or culture with the power of the Cross , our spes unica and the supreme witness to the love of God , which_-isaia- also manifested as a universal love of our_brothers_and_sisters . A journey undertaken in everyday life . Spiritual realism enables us to see_that the Bishop -isaia- called to live out his vocation to holiness in a context of difficulties within and without , amid his_own weaknesses and those of others , in daily contingencies and personal and institutional problems . This -isaia- a constant feature of the life of pastors , as Saint Gregory the Great acknowledged when he admitted with regret : '' After having laid upon my heart_the burden of the pastoral_office , my spirit_has become incapable of frequent recollection , because it remains divided among many things . I -amos- obliged to judge the cases of Churches and monasteries ; often I -amos- called to involve myself in the lives and actions of individuals . And so with my mind pulled and torn , forced to think of so many things , when can it recollect itself and concentrate totally on preaching , without withdrawing from the ministry of proclaiming the word ? . The life of the watchman must_always be on high and on guard '' . In order to counterbalance the centrifugal impulses which_would disperse his inner unity , the Bishop needs to cultivate a serene lifestyle capable of ensuring his mental , emotional and affective equilibrium and enabling him to be open to individuals and communities , and to their needs , as one_who truly shares in their different situations , their joys and their sorrows . Caring for one_s_own health in its various aspects -isaia-_also for the Bishop an act of love for his faithful and a pledge of greater openness and docility to the prompting of the Spirit . Hence , the advice which Saint Charles Borromeo , himself an outstanding pastor , proposed in the last of his Synods : '' Do you have_the care of souls ? Do not on this account neglect the care of yourself , and do not give yourself to others in such_a_way_that nothing of you remains for yourself . You must certainly keep in mind the souls of which_you are pastor , but do not forget yourself '' . The Bishop will therefore be concerned to have a balanced approach to his many commitments , maintaining a harmony between_them : the celebration of the divine mysteries and personal prayer , private study and pastoral planning , recollection and necessary rest . Supported by these aids to the spiritual_life , he will_find peace of heart and experience profound communion with the Holy Trinity who chose and consecrated him . With God s unfailing grace , he will carry_out his daily ministry as a witness to hope , attentive to the needs of the Church and the world . The permanent formation of Bishops . The Bishop s untiring commitment to the pursuit of holiness through a Christocentric and ecclesial spirituality was closely linked in the Synodal Assembly to his urgent_need for permanent formation . As was stressed in previous Synods and reaffirmed in the successive Apostolic Exhortations Christifideles Laici , Pastores Dabo Vobis and Vita Consecrata , permanent formation_-isaia- necessary_for all the faithful and should be considered particularly necessary_for the Bishop , who bears personal responsibility_for the harmonious progress of all in the Church . For the Bishop , as for priests and religious , permanent formation_-isaia- an intrinsic requirement of his vocation and mission . Through permanent formation he -isaia- able to discern the new calls by which God clarifies the initial call and applies it to different situations . The Apostle Peter , after hearing the words '' follow me '' -atti_degli_apostoli- his_first meeting with Christ cf . Mt : , heard this command again from the Risen One , who before leaving the earth foretold to him the trials and tribulations of his future ministry and then added : '' You follow me '' cf . '' Consequently , there_-isaia- a follow me which accompanies the Apostle s whole life_and_mission . It -isaia- a follow me in line with the call and the demand of faithfulness unto death , a follow me which_can signify a sequela Christi to the point of total self_giving in martyrdom '' . Clearly it -isaia- not_simply a matter of setting up adequate programmes of continuing education aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- providing a realistic acquaintance with the situation of the Church and the world , which_would then enable pastors to deal_with contemporary issues with an open mind and a compassionate heart . This -isaia- in itself a good_reason for permanent formation , but_there are_also anthropological reasons , based on the fact_that life itself_-isaia- a continuing journey towards maturity , as well as theological reasons , deeply connected to the sacrament once received : the Bishop in fact must '' safeguard with vigilant love the mystery which he bears within his_heart for the good of the Church and mankind '' . Periodic updating , especially on certain more_important subjects , calls for longer periods for listening , fellowship and dialogue_with experts \u2013 Bishops , priests , religious men_and_women , and lay_people \u2013 in an exchange of pastoral experiences , sound doctrine and spiritual resources which_will ensure genuine personal enrichment . To this_end the Synod Fathers emphasized the usefulness of special courses of formation for Bishops , like the annual sessions sponsored by the Congregation for Bishops or by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples for recently ordained Bishops . Likewise , there_was a call to make available short courses of formation or days of study and updating , as well as programmes of spiritual_exercises for Bishops , organized by Patriarchal Synods , Episcopal Conferences -atti_degli_apostoli- the regional and national levels and also by the continental Assemblies of Bishops . It would also be appropriate for the Officers of the Episcopal Conference to take on the responsibility of providing for the preparation and implementation of such programmes of permanent formation , and to encourage Bishops to take_part in these courses , so as to build greater communion among_them and to ensure more_effective pastoral_care in the individual Dioceses . It -isaia- in any case evident_that , like the life of the Church itself , pastoral styles and initiatives and forms of episcopal ministry are evolving . For this_reason too , updating -isaia- needed , in conformity_with_the norms of the Code of Canon Law and in view of the new challenges and commitments of the Church in society . In this_context the Synodal Assembly proposed a revision of the Directory Ecclesiae Imago , issued by the Congregation for Bishops on February , and its adaptation to the needs of the times and the changes which_have taken_place in the Church and pastoral life . The example of sainted Bishops . In their_life and ministry , in their_spiritual journey and their_efforts to carry_out_their pastoral_activity , Bishops have_always found encouragement in the lives of the saints who_were themselves pastors . In my homily_-atti_degli_apostoli- the concluding Eucharistic celebration of the Synod , I held up the example of the holy pastors canonized during the last century as a testimony to a grace of the Holy Spirit which has_never been lacking and will_never be lacking in the Church . Throughout the history of the Church , from the Apostles onwards , there_has been an extraordinary number of pastors whose teaching and holiness are capable of giving light and direction for the spiritual journey of Bishops in the third_millennium . The glorious witness of the great pastors of the early centuries of the Church , of the founders of particular Churches , of the confessors and martyrs who in times of persecution gave their_life for Christ , remains as a beacon to which_the Bishops of our_time can refer and from which_they can derive guidance and encouragement in their service to the Gospel . Many of those Bishops were exemplary in the practice of the virtue of hope , when in difficult times they revived the spirits of their_people , rebuilt churches after times of persecution or calamity , constructed hospices for pilgrims and the poor , and opened hospitals to care_for the sick and the elderly . Many others were enlightened leaders who blazed new trails for their_people . In times of difficulty , with_their gaze firmly fixed on the crucified and risen Christ , our_hope , they reacted positively and creatively to the challenges of the moment . At the beginning of the third_millennium , some of those pastors are_still among us , and they_have a story to tell , a story of faith firmly anchored to the Cross . They are pastors who_have a sense of people s aspirations and can take them up , purify them and interpret them in the light of the Gospel , and for this_reason they too have a future to build , together_with_the people entrusted to their care . Consequently , each particular Church should be concerned to celebrate its_own saints who_were Bishops and also to remember those pastors who by virtue of their holy lives and enlightened teachings handed_down to their_people a particular legacy of admiration and affection . They are the spiritual sentinels who from heaven guide the way of the pilgrim Church through time . In order to keep ever alive the memory of those faithful Bishops who_were outstanding in the exercise of their_ministry , the Synodal Assembly recommended that particular Churches or , when suitable , the Bishops Conferences , should make_the lives of these Bishops known to the faithful through updated biographies and , when_the case warrants , consider_the possibility of introducing their cause for canonization . Today too , the testimony of a fully realized spiritual and apostolic_life remains the greatest proof of the power of the Gospel to transform individuals and communities , thus enabling God s own holiness to break into_the_world and history . Here we find yet another reason_for hope , especially_for the younger generation , which looks to the Church for exciting ideas and a vision capable of inspiring their_efforts to renew in Christ the society of our_time . CHAPTER THREE TEACHER OF THE FAITH AND HERALD OF THE WORD '' Go into all the world and preach the Gospel . The risen Jesus entrusted to his Apostles the mission of '' making disciples '' of all nations , teaching them to observe all that he himself had commanded . The task of proclaiming the Gospel to the whole_world has thus been solemnly entrusted to the Church , the community of the disciples of the crucified and risen Lord . It -isaia- a task which will_continue until the end of time . From the beginning , this_mission of evangelization has_been an integral part of the Church s identity . The Apostle Paul was well_aware of this when he wrote : '' If I preach the Gospel , that gives me no ground for boasting . For necessity -isaia- laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel ! Cor : . If the duty of proclaiming the Gospel -isaia- incumbent upon the whole Church and each of her_children , it -isaia- particularly so upon Bishops , who on the day of their sacred ordination , which places them in apostolic succession , assume as one of their principal responsibilities the proclamation of the Gospel ; '' with the courage imparted by the Spirit , they_are to call people to faith and strengthen them in living faith '' . The Bishop s work_of_evangelization , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- leading men_and_women to faith or to strengthening the faith within them , -isaia- an outstanding manifestation of his spiritual fatherhood . He can thus repeat with Paul : '' Though you_have countless guides in Christ , you do not_have many fathers . For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the Gospel '' Cor : . Precisely because of this constant process of begetting new_life in the Spirit , the episcopal ministry appears in the world as a sign of hope_for every_individual and people . The Synod Fathers rightly stated_that the proclamation of Christ always takes first_place and that the Bishop -isaia-_the_first preacher of the Gospel by his_words and by the witness of his_life . He must be aware of the challenges of the present hour and have_the courage to face them . All Bishops , as ministers of truth , will carry_out this_task with strength and trust . Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Gospel and of humanity . The proclamation of the Gospel emerged as a prominent theme in the interventions of the Synod Fathers , who on several occasions and in a wide variety of ways stated_that the living centre of the preaching of the Gospel -isaia- Christ , crucified and risen for the salvation of all peoples . Christ -isaia-_in_fact the heart of evangelization and , as I myself have often insisted , -isaia- the very programme of the new_evangelization , which '' ultimately has its centre in Christ himself , who_-isaia- to be known , loved and imitated , so that in him we may live the life of the Trinity , and with_him transform history until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem . This -isaia- a programme which_does_not change with shifts of times and cultures , even_though it takes account of time and culture for the sake of true dialogue and effective communication . This programme for all times -isaia-_our programme for the Third Millennium '' . From Christ , the heart of the Gospel , all the other truths of faith are derived , and hope shines_forth for all humanity . Christ -isaia- the light_which enlightens everyone , and all those reborn in him receive the first fruits of the Spirit , which enable them to fulfil the new law of love . By virtue of his_apostolic mission the Bishop -isaia- enabled to lead his_people to the heart of the mystery of faith , where_they will_be_able to encounter the living person of Jesus Christ . In this_way they_will come to understand_that all Christian experience has its source and its unfailing point of reference in the Paschal mystery of Jesus , the victor over sin and death . The proclamation of the Lord s death and Resurrection thus includes '' the prophetic proclamation of a hereafter , which_-isaia- man s deepest and definitive calling , in continuity and discontinuity with_his present situation : beyond time and history , beyond_the reality of this_world , which_-isaia- passing away . Evangelization thus includes the preaching of hope in the promises made by God in the new Covenant in Jesus Christ '' . The Bishop , hearer and guardian of the word . The Second Vatican Council , advancing along the path indicated by the Church s tradition , explains that the mission of teaching proper to Bishops consists in reverently safeguarding and courageously proclaiming the faith . Here we see all the rich meaning of the gesture found in the Roman rite of episcopal ordination , when_the open Book of the Gospels -isaia- placed on the head of the Bishop elect . This gesture indicates , on the one_hand , that the word embraces and watches over the Bishop s ministry and , on the other , that the Bishop s life_-isaia- to be completely submitted to the word of God in his daily commitment of preaching the Gospel in all patience and sound doctrine cf . The Synod Fathers often stated_that the Bishop -isaia- one_who keeps the word of God with love and courageously defends it as he testifies to its message of salvation . The meaning of the episcopal munus docendi -isaia- rooted in the very nature of what must be preserved , that_-isaia- , the deposit of faith . Christ our Lord in the sacred Scripture of the Old and New Testaments and in Tradition has_entrusted to his Church the one deposit of divine_revelation , which_-isaia- like a mirror in which_the Church during her pilgrim journey here on earth '' contemplates God , from whom she receives everything , until such time as she_-isaia- brought home to see him face to face as he really -isaia- '' . This has happened down_the_centuries until our_own day : the different communities , in welcoming the word , ever_new and effective in the course of time , have listened with docility to the voice of the Holy Spirit , pledging themselves to make it alive , applicable and effective in different times of history . In this_way the word handed_down \u2013 Tradition \u2013 has become ever_more consciously a word of life , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the task of proclaiming and preserving it has progressively continued under_the_guidance and assistance of the Spirit of Truth , as a continuous passing on of all that the Church herself -isaia- and all that_she believes . This Tradition , which_comes_from the Apostles , makes progress in the life of the Church , as the Second Vatican Council has taught . There -isaia- likewise growth and development in the understanding of the realities and words handed_down , so that in holding , practising and professing the faith that_has_been handed on , there comes about a unique harmony between_the Bishops and the faithful . In striving to remain faithful to the Spirit who speaks within_the Church , the faithful and the Bishops converge and create those profound bonds of faith_which represent as it were_the first stage of the sensus fidei . Here it -isaia- helpful to listen once_more to the words of the Council : '' The whole_body of the faithful , who_have an anointing that comes_from_the Holy Spirit cf . Jn : , , cannot err in matters of belief . This characteristic -isaia- shown in the supernatural sense of the faith sensus fidei of the whole_people , when , from the bishops to the last of the faithful they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith_and_morals '' . Consequently , for_every Bishop the life of the Church and life in the Church -isaia- the condition_for exercising his_mission to teach . A Bishop finds his identity and place amid the community of the Lord s disciples where he received_the gift of divine_life and his_first instruction in the faith . Every Bishop , especially_when he -isaia- seated in his cathedral before the faithful and exercising his role as a teacher in the Church , must be able to repeat with Saint Augustine : '' With respect to the place which we occupy , we are your teachers ; with_respect to the one Master , we are fellow disciples with you in the same school '' . In the Church , the school of the living God , Bishops and the faithful_are all fellow disciples , and all need to be taught by the Spirit . Many indeed are the places from which_the Spirit imparts his inner teaching : first of all , in the heart of every_person , and then in the life of the various particular Churches , where_the various needs of individuals and the various ecclesial_communities emerge and make themselves heard , not_only in languages that_are known but_also in those_that are new and different . The Spirit also makes himself heard as he awakens in the Church different_forms of charisms and services . For this_reason too , there_were frequent calls during the Synod for Bishops to have direct and personal contact_with_the faithful living in the communities entrusted to their pastoral_care , following_the_example of the Good Shepherd who knows his sheep and calls each by name . Indeed , frequent meetings of the Bishop with_his priests , in the first_place , and then with the deacons , consecrated_persons and their communities , and with the laity , individually and in their various_forms of association , are of great_importance for the exercise of effective ministry among the People of God . Authentic and authoritative service of the word . At his episcopal ordination , each Bishop received_the fundamental mission of authoritatively proclaiming the word of God . Indeed , every Bishop , by virtue of sacred ordination , -isaia- an authentic teacher who preaches to the people entrusted to his care the faith to be believed and to be put into_practice in the moral_life . This means_that Bishops are endowed_with the authority of Christ himself , and for_this fundamental reason when_they '' teach in communion with the Roman Pontiff they_are to be revered by all as witnesses of divine and catholic truth ; the faithful , for their_part , are obliged to submit to their Bishop s decision , made in the name of Christ , in matters of faith_and_morals , and to adhere to it with a religious assent of the mind '' . In this service of the truth , every Bishop -isaia- placed before the community , inasmuch as he -isaia- for the community , which_-isaia- the object of his proper pastoral concern and for_which he insistently lifts up his prayer to God . That which_every Bishop has heard and received_from_the heart of the Church he must then give back to his brothers_and_sisters , whom he must care_for like the Good Shepherd . In him the sensus fidei attains completeness . As the Second Vatican Council teaches : '' By the sense of the faith_,_which -isaia- aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth , the People of God , under_the_guidance of the magisterium to which_it_-isaia- faithfully obedient , receives no longer the words of men , but truly the word of God cf . Th : , it adheres indefectibly to the faith once for all delivered to the saints Jude . It penetrates more_deeply into that_same faith through right judgment , and applies it more_fully to life '' . The word of the Bishop -isaia- thus , within_the community and before it , no longer simply his private word , but_rather the word of a pastor who strengthens the community in faith , gathers it around_the mystery of God and gives it life . The faithful need the word of their Bishop , they_need to have their_faith confirmed and purified . The Synodal Assembly for its part emphasized this need and drew attention to several specific areas in which_it_-isaia- particularly felt . One of these areas -isaia- that of the initial proclamation of the word , the kerygma , which_-isaia- always needed_for bringing_about the obedience of faith , but_-isaia- all the more urgent today , in times marked by indifference and by religious ignorance on the part of many Christians . In the area of catechesis too , the Bishop -isaia- clearly_the pre eminent catechist of his_people . The decisive role in this area played by so many great and saintly Bishops , whose catechetical writings are_still read with profit today , makes it clear_that it remains the Bishop s duty to be ultimately in charge of the catechesis imparted in his Diocese . In carrying_out this_duty he will not_fail to refer to the Catechism of the Catholic Church . The words_which I addressed to Bishops in my Apostolic Exhortation Catechesi Tradendae remain valid : '' You have a special mission within your Churches , you_are before all others the ones primarily responsible_for catechesis '' . It -isaia- therefore the duty of every Bishop to give real priority in his particular Church to active and effective catechesis . He must demonstrate his personal concern through direct interventions aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- promoting and preserving an authentic passion for catechesis . Conscious , then , of his responsibility in the area of transmitting and teaching the faith , every Bishop must ensure_that a corresponding concern -isaia- shown by all those_who by their_vocation and mission are_called to hand down the faith . This means priests and deacons , the faithful_who have embraced the consecrated_life , fathers and mothers of families , pastoral workers and in a special_way catechists , as well as teachers of theology and teachers of the ecclesiastical sciences and religious education . The Bishop will thus take_care to provide them_with both initial and ongoing training . In carrying_out this_duty Bishops will derive particular benefit from open dialogue and cooperation_with theologians , whose task it -isaia- to employ an appropriate methodology in the quest for deeper knowledge of the unfathomable richness of the mystery of Christ . Bishops will not_fail to encourage and support them and the schools or academic institutions where_they work , so that_they_can carry_out_their service to the People of God in fidelity to Tradition and with attentiveness to changing historical circumstances . Whenever appropriate , Bishops must firmly defend the unity and integrity of the faith , judging with authority what_-isaia- or -isaia- not in conformity_with_the word of God . The Synod Fathers also called the Bishops attention to their magisterial responsibilities in the area of morality . The rules that the Church sets forth reflect the divine commandments , which find_their crown and synthesis in the Gospel command of love . The end to which_every divine rule tends -isaia- the greater good of human_beings . The exhortation of the Book of Deuteronomy -isaia- still valid today : '' Walk in all the way which_the Lord your God has commanded you , that_you_may live , and that_it_may go well with you '' : . Nor must we forget_that the Ten Commandments have a firm foundation in human_nature itself , and thus_the values_which they defend have universal validity . This -isaia- particularly true of values such as human life_,_which must be defended from conception until its end in natural death ; the freedom of individuals and of nations , social_justice and the structures needed to achieve it . Episcopal ministry for the inculturation of the Gospel . The evangelization of culture and the inculturation of the Gospel are an integral part of the new_evangelization and thus a specific concern of the episcopal office . Echoing in this_regard several of my own statements , the Synod repeated : '' A faith which_does_not become culture -isaia- not a faith which_-isaia- fully accepted , integrated and faithfully translated into life '' . This -isaia- , in fact , a task which_-isaia- ancient yet ever_new , a task which_has its origin in the mystery of the Incarnation itself and its motivation in the innate ability of the Gospel to take root in every culture , shaping and developing it , purifying it and opening it to the fullness of truth and life which_-isaia- realized in Jesus Christ . Great attention was paid to this theme in the course of the continental Synods and many valuable insights emerged . I myself have dealt_with this_subject on a number of occasions . Consequently , every Bishop , taking_into consideration the cultural values present in the territory of his particular Church , should strive to ensure_that the Gospel -isaia- proclaimed in its integrity , so as to shape the hearts of men_and_women and the customs of peoples . In this work_of_evangelization a valuable contribution can be made by theologians and those expert in drawing upon the cultural , artistic and historical patrimony of the Diocese : this_-isaia- true for both first evangelization and the new_evangelization , and represents an effective pastoral tool . Of equal importance for the proclamation of the Gospel in '' new Areopagi '' and for the handing down of the faith are the communications media . In considering these media the Synod Fathers encouraged Bishops to promote greater cooperation between Episcopal Conferences , on both the national and international levels , in order to ensure a high level of quality in the work being carried_out in this sensitive and important area of social_life . Where the preaching of the Gospel -isaia- concerned , care_must not_only be shown for the orthodoxy of its presentation but_also_for its incisiveness and its ability to be heard and accepted . This , obviously , involves a commitment to setting aside , especially in seminaries , sufficient time for training candidates to the priesthood in the use of the communications media , so that evangelizers will be good proclaimers and good communicators . Preaching by word and example . No full treatment of the ministry of the Bishop , as the preacher of the Gospel and guardian of the faith among the People of God , can fail to mention the duty of personal integrity : the Bishop s teaching_-isaia- prolonged in his witness and his example of an authentic life of faith . He teaches with an authority exercised in the name of Jesus Christ the word which_-isaia- heard in the community ; were he not to live what he teaches , he would be giving the community a contradictory message . It -isaia- clear , then_,_that all the activities of the Bishop must be directed towards_the proclamation of the Gospel , '' the power of God for salvation to everyone who_has faith '' Rom : . His essential task -isaia- to help the People of God to give to the word of revelation the obedience of faith cf . Rom : and to embrace fully the teachings of Christ . One could say that , in a Bishop , mission and life are_united in such_a_way_that they_can no longer be thought of as two separate things : we Bishops are our mission . If we do not carry_out that mission , we will no longer be ourselves . It -isaia- in the transmission of our faith_that our_lives become a visible sign of Christ s presence in our communities . The witness of his_life becomes for a Bishop a new basis for authority alongside the objective basis received in episcopal consecration . '' Authority '' -isaia- thus joined by '' authoritativeness '' . Both are necessary . The former , in fact , gives_rise to the objective requirement that_the_faithful should assent to the authentic teaching of the Bishop ; the latter helps them to put their trust in his message . Here I would_like to quote the words of a great Bishop of the ancient Church , Saint Hilary of Poitiers : '' The blessed Apostle Paul , wishing to describe the ideal Bishop and to form by his teachings a completely new man of the Church , explained what_was , so to speak , his highest perfection . He stated_that a Bishop must profess sure doctrine , in accordance_with what_has_been taught , and thus be able to exhort others to sound doctrine and to refute those_who contradict it . On the one_hand , a minister of irreproachable life , if he -isaia- not learned , will only manage to help himself ; on the other , a learned minister will lose the authority which_comes_from his learning , unless his life_-isaia- irreproachable '' . Once again it -isaia- the Apostle Paul who defines in these_words our rule of conduct : '' Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds , and in your teaching show integrity , gravity and sound speech that cannot be censured , so that an opponent may be put to shame , having nothing evil to say of us '' Tit : . CHAPTER FOUR MINISTER OF THE GRACE OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD '' Sanctified in Jesus Christ , called to be saints '' Cor : . As I prepare to deal_with one of the prime and fundamental functions of the Bishop , the ministry of sanctification , my thoughts turn to the words addressed by the Apostle Paul to the faithful of Corinth , to remind them of the mystery of their_vocation : '' sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints together_with all those_who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ '' Cor : . The sanctification of the Christian takes_place in the waters of Baptism , -isaia- consolidated by the sacraments of Confirmation and Reconciliation , and -isaia- nourished by the Eucharist , the Church s greatest treasure , the sacrament by which_the Church -isaia- constantly built up as the People of God , the Body of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit . This sanctification permeates the whole_life of the Church , and the Bishop -isaia- its minister , above all through the sacred_liturgy . The liturgy , and the Eucharistic celebration in particular , has been_called '' the source and summit of the Church s life '' . This statement -isaia- in a way reflected in the Bishop s own liturgical ministry , which_-isaia- the centre of his activity aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the sanctification of the People of God . Hence the importance of liturgical life in the particular Church , where_the Bishop exercises his_ministry of sanctification , proclaiming and preaching the word of God , guiding prayer_for his_people and with his_people , and presiding over the celebration of the sacraments . For this_reason_the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium gives the Bishop a striking title , taken from the prayer of episcopal consecration in the Byzantine rite : he -isaia- the '' steward of the grace of the high priesthood , especially in the Eucharist , which he offers himself or which he ensures -isaia- offered , and by which_the Church continually lives and grows '' . Between the ministry of sanctification and the other two ministries of teaching and governance there_-isaia- a profound and close correspondence . Preaching -isaia-_in_fact ordered to our sharing in the divine life_,_which we receive from the double table of the word and the Eucharist . This life develops and -isaia- made manifest in the daily_life of the faithful , since all are_called to express in their_lives what_they have_received in faith . The ministry of governance , like that of Jesus the Good Shepherd , -isaia-_also expressed in functions and activities aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- developing in the community of the faithful the fullness of life in charity , to the glory of the Holy Trinity and in testimony to its loving presence in the world . Consequently , each Bishop , in exercising his_ministry of sanctification munus sanctificandi , effectively brings about all that his_ministry of teaching munus docendi aims to achieve , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time receiving grace for his_ministry of governance munus regendi as he shapes his way of thinking according to the image of Christ the High Priest , so that all -isaia- ordered to the building up of the Church and to the glory of the Holy Trinity . The source and summit of the life of the particular Church . The Bishop carries out his_ministry of sanctification by celebrating the Eucharist and the other sacraments , by praising God in the Liturgy of the Hours , by presiding over the other sacred rites and by promoting liturgical life and authentic popular_piety . Of all the celebrations -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Bishop presides , special importance attaches to those_which manifest the specific nature of the episcopal ministry as the fullness of the priesthood . These include especially_the administration of the sacrament of Confirmation , sacred ordinations , the solemn celebration of the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Bishop -isaia- surrounded by his presbyterate and the other ministers \u2013 as for example in the Mass of Chrism \u2013 the dedication of churches and altars , the consecration of virgins and other rites of importance for the life of the particular Church . In these celebrations , the Bishop visibly appears as the father and the pastor of the faithful , the '' great priest '' of his_people cf . Heb : , the one_who prays and serves as a model of prayer , the one_who intercedes for his brothers_and_sisters and in the assembly beseeches and gives thanks to the Lord , making manifest God s primacy and glory . In these various moments there springs up , as if from a fountain , the divine_grace which permeates the whole_life of the children of God during their earthly pilgrimage and which guides that life towards its culmination and fullness in the heavenly homeland . The ministry of sanctification -isaia- thus a fundamental moment in the building of Christian hope . By preaching the word , the Bishop not_only proclaims God s promises and opens up paths for the future , but he also encourages the People of God on their earthly pilgrimage ; and in the celebration of the sacraments , the pledge of future glory , he gives them a foretaste of their final destiny in communion with the Virgin Mary and the saints , in the unwavering certainty of Christ s definitive victory over sin and death and of his coming in glory . The importance of the Cathedral Church . The Bishop , while carrying_out his_ministry of sanctification in the whole Diocese , has as his focal point the Cathedral Church , which_-isaia- as it were_the Mother Church and the centre of convergence for the particular Church . The Cathedral -isaia- the place_where the Bishop has his Chair , from which he teaches his_people and helps them to grow through_his preaching , and from which he presides -atti_degli_apostoli- the principal celebrations of the liturgical year and in the celebration of the sacraments . Precisely when he occupies his Chair , the Bishop -isaia- seen by the assembly of the faithful as the one_who presides in loco Dei Patris ; and it -isaia- for this_reason , as I mentioned earlier , that , according to an ancient tradition of both East and West , only the Bishop may sit on the episcopal Chair . It -isaia- the presence of this Chair which in fact makes_the Cathederal Church the physical and spiritual centre of unity and communion for the diocesan presbyterate and for all the holy People of God . In this_regard , we should recall_the teaching of the Second Vatican Council that '' everyone should regard the liturgical life of the diocese centring on the Bishop , above all in the Cathedral Church , as of the highest importance . They should be convinced_that the Church -isaia- displayed with_special clarity when_the holy People of God , all of them , are actively and lawfully sharing in the same liturgical celebrations \u2013 especially_when it -isaia-_the_same Eucharist \u2013 sharing one prayer -atti_degli_apostoli- one altar -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Bishop -isaia- presiding , surrounded by his presbyterate and his ministers '' . Consequently , the Cathedral , where_the supreme moment of the Church s life takes_place , -isaia-_also the setting for the most exalted and sacred act of the Bishop s munus sanctificandi , which involves , like the very liturgy -atti_degli_apostoli- which he presides , both the sanctification of the people and the worship and glorification of God . The special occasions for_this manifestation of the mystery of the Church include certain particular celebrations . Among these , I would mention the annual liturgy of the Chrism Mass , which_must be considered '' one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the Bishop s priesthood and signifies the close unity of the priests with_him '' . At this celebration , there_-isaia- the blessing of the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of Catechumens , and the blessing of the sacred Chrism , the sacramental sign of salvation and perfect life_for all those reborn of water and the Holy Spirit . The most solemn liturgies must certainly include those for conferring of Holy Orders : these rites properly and normally take_place in the Cathedral church . Other occasions can be added , such as the celebration of the anniversary of the dedication of the Cathedral and the feasts of the patron saints of the Diocese . These and other occasions , in accordance_with_the liturgical calendar of each Diocese , are valuable occasions for strengthening the bonds of communion with the presbyters , consecrated_persons and the lay_faithful , and for encouraging a commitment to mission in all the members of the particular Church . For this_reason_the Caeremoniale Episcoporum highlights the importance of the Cathedral Church and of the celebrations held therein , as a source of enrichment and an example to the whole particular Church . The Bishop , moderator of the liturgy as a paedagogy of faith . The Synod Fathers wished in the present circumstances to call attention to the importance of the ministry of sanctification exercised in the liturgy , which_must be celebrated in such_a_way as to enhance its didactic and educational effectiveness . This calls for making liturgical celebrations truly an epiphany of the mystery . They should thus express with clarity the nature of divine_worship , reflecting the genuine sense of the Church which prays and which celebrates the divine mysteries . If liturgical celebrations allow for the suitable participation of all in accordance_with their various ministries , they_will not_fail to be resplendent in their_dignity and beauty . I myself , in the exercise of my ministry , have sought to give priority to liturgical celebrations , both in Rome itself and in my Pastoral Visits to the various continents and nations . By making the beauty and the dignity of the Christian liturgy shine_forth in all its expressions , I have tried to promote the genuine meaning of the sanctification of God s name in order to form the religious sentiment of the faithful and open it to the transcendent . I therefore encourage my Brother Bishops , who_are teachers of the faith and sharers in Christ s supreme priesthood , to work tirelessly for the authentic promotion of the liturgy . In the manner of its celebration the liturgy demands_that revealed_truth be clearly proclaimed , the divine_life be faithfully handed_down , and the genuine nature of the Church be unambiguously expressed . Everyone should be conscious of the importance of the sacred celebrations of the mysteries of the Catholic faith . The truth of the faith and of Christian life_-isaia- not handed_down by words alone , but_also by sacramental signs and the liturgical rites as a whole . Well known in this_regard -isaia- the ancient dictum which closely links the lex credendi to the lex orandi . Every Bishop should therefore be exemplary in the art of presiding , conscious that_he_-isaia- called to tractare mysteria . His life should be profoundly shaped by the theological virtues , which_will inspire his conduct in all his dealings with God s holy people . He should be capable of transmitting the supernatural meaning of the words , prayers and rites , in a way_that enables everyone to share in the sacred mysteries . Through the practical and suitable promotion of the liturgical apostolate in the Diocese , the Bishop should_also ensure_that the ministers and the people gain an authentic understanding and experience of the liturgy , so that_the_faithful can attain that full , conscious , active and fruitful participation in the holy mysteries called_for by the Second Vatican Council . In this_way liturgical celebrations , especially_those celebrated by the Bishop in his Cathedral , will be clear proclamations of the Church s faith , privileged occasions when_the pastor presents the mystery of Christ to the faithful and helps them to enter progressively into it , experiencing it with_joy and then testifying to it by works of charity cf . Given the importance of the proper transmission of the faith in the Church s sacred_liturgy , the Bishop will not_fail to be vigilant and careful , for the good of the faithful , to ensure_that existing liturgical norms are observed always and everywhere . This also calls for the firm and timely correction of abuses and the elimination of arbitrary liturgical changes . The Bishop himself should_also be attentive , to the extent_that it depends on him , in cooperation_with the Episcopal Conferences and their_respective liturgical commissions , to ensure_that the dignity and authenticity of liturgical celebrations are maintained in radio and television broadcasts . The centrality of the Lord s Day and the liturgical year . The Bishop s life and ministry must be permeated by the presence of the Lord in his mystery . The growth throughout_the Diocese of a conviction of the spiritual , catechetical and pastoral centrality of the liturgy greatly depends on the example of the Bishop . At the centre of this ministry -isaia- the celebration of the Paschal Mystery of Christ held on Sunday , the Lord s Day . As I have often repeated , including recently , in order to give a strong sign of Christian identity in our_time it -isaia- necessary to restore the centrality of the celebration of the Lord s Day and , on that day , of the celebration of the Eucharist . Sunday -isaia- a day which_should be experienced as '' a special day of faith , the day of the Risen Lord and of the gift of the Spirit , the true weekly Easter '' . The presence of the Bishop , who on Sunday \u2013 which_-isaia- also the Church s Day \u2013 presides -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharist in his Cathedral or in the parishes of the Diocese , can be an exemplary sign of fidelity to the mystery of the Resurrection and a reason_for hope_for God s People as they make_their pilgrim way , Sunday after Sunday , towards_the unending eighth day of the eternal Easter . In the course of the liturgical year the Church relives the whole Christian mystery , from the Lord s Incarnation and Nativity to his Ascension , to the day of Pentecost and the hope filled expectation of his glorious return . The Bishop will naturally devote particular attention to the preparation and celebration of the Paschal Triduum , the heart of the whole liturgical year , with the solemn Easter Vigil and its prolongation in the fifty day Easter season . The liturgical year with its cycle of celebrations can suitably serve as the basis for the pastoral planning of the life of the Diocese around_the mystery of Christ . In this journey of faith , the Church -isaia- sustained by the '' memory of the Virgin Mary , who , already glorified in body_and_soul in heaven . shines_forth as a sign of sure hope and comfort for the pilgrim People of God '' . It -isaia- a hope which_-isaia- likewise nourished by the commemoration of the martyrs and the other saints , who , '' having attained perfection through the manifold grace of God and now possess eternal_salvation , sing perfect praise to God in heaven and make intercession for us '' . The Bishop as minister of the Eucharistic celebration . At the heart of the Bishop s munus sanctificandi -isaia- the Eucharist , which he himself offers or which he ensures -isaia- offered , and which particularly manifests his office as steward or minister of the grace of the supreme priesthood . It -isaia- above all by presiding -atti_degli_apostoli- the Eucharistic assembly that the Bishop contributes to the building up of the Church as a mystery of communion and mission . For the Eucharist -isaia- the essential principle of the life not_only of the simple faithful but of the community itself in Christ . The faithful , gathered by the preaching of the Gospel , form communities in which_the Church of Christ -isaia- truly present , and this becomes especially clear in the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice . Well known -isaia- the teaching of the Council in this_regard : '' In any community of the altar , under the sacred_ministry of the Bishop , there_-isaia- made manifest the symbol of that charity and unity of the mystical_body without_which there_can be no salvation . In these communities , though often small and poor , or scattered , Christ -isaia- present and by his_power the one , holy , catholic and apostolic Church -isaia- gathered together . For sharing in the body_and_blood of Christ has no other effect than to make us become what we consume '' . The Eucharistic celebration , then , which_-isaia- the '' source and summit of all evangelization '' , -isaia-_also the source of the Church s whole missionary commitment , which_-isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- manifesting to others , through the witness of our_lives , the mystery which we live in faith . Among all the responsibilities of the Bishop s pastoral_ministry , that of celebrating the Eucharist -isaia-_the_most compelling and important . The Bishop also_has the duty , as one of his principal tasks , of ensuring that_the_faithful are_able to approach the Lord s table , especially on Sunday , which , as I just mentioned , -isaia- the day on which_the Church , the community and family of the children of God , rediscovers her specific Christian identity around her_own priests . It can happen , however_,_that in certain places , whether due to a lack of priests or to other grave and persistent reasons , it -isaia- not_possible to ensure the celebration of the Eucharist on a regular basis . This increases the duty of the Bishop , as the father of the family and minister of grace , to be constantly attentive to discerning real needs and the seriousness of different situations . It will be necessary to ensure a prudent distribution of the members of the presbyterate , so that , also in other emergencies , the community -isaia- not deprived of the Eucharistic celebration for long periods . In cases where_the celebration of Holy Mass cannot be provided for , the Bishop will ensure_that the community , while continuing to await the encounter_with Christ in the celebration of his Paschal Mystery , will_be_able to have , -atti_degli_apostoli- least on Sundays and feast days , a special celebration . In this case the faithful , led by responsible ministers , will_be_able to benefit from the gift of the word proclaimed and from communion in the Eucharist , thanks to the proper planning of Sunday gatherings in the absence of a priest . The Bishop s responsibility_for Christian initiation . In the present circumstances of the Church and the world , both in the young Churches and in the countries where Christianity has_been established for centuries , the restoration , especially_for adults , of the great tradition of the discipline of Christian initiation has proved providential . This was a far sighted decision of the Second Vatican Council , which wished in this_way to provide the means_for an encounter_with Christ and the Church to the many men_and_women touched by the grace of the Spirit and wishing to enter_into communion with the mystery of salvation in Christ who died and rose for us . Through the process of Christian initiation , catechumens are gradually introduced into knowledge of the mystery of Christ and the Church by analogy with the origin , development and growth of natural life . The faithful , reborn in Baptism and made sharers in the royal priesthood , are strengthened in Confirmation , of which_the Bishop -isaia- the original minister , and thus receive a special outpouring of the gifts of the Spirit . Then by sharing in the Eucharist they_are nourished with the food of eternal_life and made full members of the Church , Christ s Mystical Body . In this_way , the faithful , '' by the effects of these sacraments of Christian initiation , are enabled to taste ever more_fully and better the treasures of the divine_life and to progress to the attainment of the perfection of charity '' . With due regard_for present_day circumstances , Bishops will observe the prescriptions of the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults . They will see_to_it_that every Diocese has the structures and the pastoral workers necessary to ensure in the most dignified and effective way the implementation of the regulations and of the liturgical , catechetical and pastoral discipline of Christian initiation , duly adapted to the needs of our_times . By its_very nature as a progressive insertion into the mystery of Christ and the Church , a mystery alive and -atti_degli_apostoli- work in each particular Church , the itinerary of Christian initiation demands the presence and ministry of the Diocesan Bishop , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the culminating phase of the journey , namely , in the administration of the sacraments of Baptism , Confirmation and the Eucharist , which ordinarily takes_place -atti_degli_apostoli- the Easter Vigil . It -isaia-_also the Bishop s task to regulate , in accordance_with Church law , all matters involving the Christian initiation of children and young_people , and to lay_down norms concerning their_proper catechetical preparation and gradual involvement in the life of the community . The Bishop should_also be vigilant that programmes for the catechumenate , or for the continuance or renewal of the process of Christian initiation , or for reaching out to members of the faithful_who have fallen away from the normal and community life of faith , operate in accordance_with_the Church s laws and in full harmony_with_the life of parish communities in the Diocese . Finally , with_regard to Confirmation , the Bishop , as the ordinary minister of this_sacrament , will ensure_that he himself_-isaia- its usual celebrant . His presence in the midst of the parish community which , by virtue of the baptismal font and the table of the Eucharist , -isaia- the natural and normal place_for the process of Christian initiation , effectively evokes the mystery of Pentecost and proves most beneficial in consolidating the bonds of ecclesial_communion between_the pastor and the faithful . The Bishop s responsibilities in the discipline of Penance . The Synod Fathers in their interventions paid particular attention to the Church s penitential discipline ; they stressed its importance and recalled the special_care which , as successors of the Apostles , Bishops must show for the pastoral practice and the discipline of the sacrament of Penance . I was glad to hear them reaffirm my own profound conviction_that the greatest pastoral concern must be shown for this_sacrament of the Church , the source of reconciliation , of peace and of joy for all of us who stand in need of the Lord s mercy and of healing from the wounds of sin . The Bishop , as the one primarily responsible_for penitential discipline in his particular Church , -isaia- particularly charged with offering a kerygmatic invitation to conversion and penance . It -isaia-_his duty to proclaim with evangelical freedom the sad and destructive presence of sin in the lives of individuals and in the history of communities . At the same_time , he must proclaim_the boundless mystery of the mercy which God has bestowed on us in the Cross and Resurrection of his Son Jesus Christ , and in the outpouring of the Spirit for the forgiveness of sins . This proclamation , which_-isaia- also an invitation to reconciliation and a call to hope , -isaia- the very_heart of the Gospel . It was_the first thing which_the Apostles proclaimed on the day of Pentecost , a proclamation which reveals the very meaning of the grace of salvation communicated in the sacraments . The Bishop should be , in suitable ways , an exemplary minister of the sacrament of Penance , and he himself will_have regular and faithful recourse to that sacrament . He will not_cease to exhort his priests to hold in high esteem the ministry of reconciliation which_they received -atti_degli_apostoli- their priestly ordination , and he should encourage them to exercise that ministry with generosity and supernatural tact , in imitation of the Father who welcomes those_who_have come home , and of Christ , the Good Shepherd , who carries on his shoulders the lost sheep . The Bishop s responsibility extends also to the duty of exercising vigilance that recourse to general absolution does_not take_place outside the norms of law . In this_regard , in my Apostolic Letter Misericordia Dei I stressed that Bishops have_the duty to enforce the existing discipline whereby individual and integral confession and absolution constitute the only ordinary means by which members of the faithful conscious of grave sin are reconciled with God and with the Church . Only physical or moral impossibility dispenses from this ordinary means , in which case reconciliation can be obtained by other means . The Bishop will not_fail to remind all those_who by virtue of office are charged with the care of souls that_they_have the duty to provide the faithful with the opportunity of making an individual confession . He himself will_make certain that_the_faithful are in fact being assisted in every way possible to make_their confession . When one considers in the light of Tradition and the Church s Magisterium the close connection_between the sacrament of Reconciliation and participation in the Eucharist , one sees how necessary it -isaia- today to form the consciences of the faithful so that_they_may partake worthily and fruitfully of the Eucharistic Banquet , and approach it in a state of grace . It -isaia-_also useful to mention that_it_-isaia- the Bishop s responsibility to regulate in a suitable way and through the careful choice of suitable ministers the discipline governing the practice of exorcism and the celebration of prayers to obtain healings , with due respect_for recent documents of the Holy See . Attention to popular_piety . The Synod Fathers reaffirmed the importance of popular_piety in the handing on and the growth of faith . As my predecessor of venerable memory Pope Paul VI once said , popular_piety -isaia- rich in values both in reference to God and to our_brothers_and_sisters , and thus constitutes an authentic treasury of spirituality in the life of the Christian community . In our_time too , marked as it -isaia- by a widespread yearning for spirituality which often draws many to follow religious sects or other_forms of vague spiritualism , Bishops are_called to discern and to foster the values and forms of true popular_piety . The words of the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi remain timely : '' Pastoral charity must dictate to all those_whom the Lord has placed as leaders of the ecclesial_communities the proper attitude in regard to this reality , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time so rich and so vulnerable . Above all one_must be sensitive to it , know_how to perceive its interior dimensions and undeniable values , be ready to help it to overcome its risks of deviation . When it -isaia- well oriented , this popular religiosity can be more_and_more for multitudes of our people a true encounter_with God in Jesus Christ '' . The forms in which popular_piety -isaia- expressed should be shaped and , when necessary , purified in accordance_with_the principles of Christian faith and life . The faithful , through popular_piety , should be led to a personal encounter_with Christ and to fellowship with the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints , especially through hearing the word of God , recourse to prayer , participation in the Church s sacramental life , and the witness of charity and the works of mercy . For a fuller consideration of this_matter and for a valuable series of theological , pastoral and spiritual suggestions , I -amos- pleased to refer to the documents issued by this Apostolic See , which state that all manifestations of popular_piety fall under the responsibility of the Bishop in his Diocese . It -isaia- the Bishop s duty to regulate them , to encourage them as an aid to the faithful for Christian living , to purify them where necessary and to evangelize them . Promoting holiness for all the faithful . The holiness of the People of God , to which_the Bishop s ministry of sanctification -isaia- ordered , -isaia-_a_gift of divine_grace and a manifestation of the primacy of God in the life of the Church . In his_ministry , then , the Bishop must tirelessly promote a genuine pastoral and educational programme of holiness , in order to carry_out the one set_forth in the fifth chapter of the Constitution Lumen Gentium on the universal call to holiness . I myself wished to propose this programme to the whole Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium , as a pastoral priority and as a fruit of the Great Jubilee of the Incarnation . Today too , holiness -isaia- a sign of the times and a proof of the truth of Christianity as it shines_forth in its noblest representatives , both those_who_have been enrolled among the saints and the even greater numbers of those_who_have quietly enriched and continue to enrich human_history with the humble and joyful holiness of daily_life . Our own_time too -isaia- not lacking in the precious witness of forms of holiness , personal and communal , which_are a sign of hope to all , including the younger generation . As a means of highlighting the witness of holiness , I urge my Brother Bishops to recognize and to call attention to the signs of holiness and heroic virtue which_are also appearing in our_own days , especially where these concern members of the lay_faithful in their_own Dioceses , above all Christian married_couples . In appropriate cases , I encourage them to promote the relative processes of canonization . This will prove a sign of hope_for everyone and a source of encouragement for the pilgrim People of God in its witness before the world to the permanent presence of grace in the fabric of human_history . CHAPTER FIVE THE PASTORAL GOVERNANCE OF THE BISHOP '' I have_given you an example '' Jn : . In its treatment of the duty of governing the family of God and accepting the habitual and daily care of the Lord Jesus flock , the Second Vatican Council explains that Bishops , in the exercise of their_ministry as fathers and shepherds in the midst of their faithful , must act as '' those_who serve '' , keeping always before their_eyes the example of the Good Shepherd who came not to be served but to serve and to give his_life for the sheep cf . This image of Jesus , the supreme model of the Bishop , finds one of its most eloquent expressions in the act of the washing of the feet , as recounted in the Gospel according to John : '' Before the feast of the Passover , when Jesus knew that_his hour had come to depart out of this_world to the Father , having loved his_own who_were in the world , he loved them to the end . And during supper . he rose from the table , laid aside his garments , and girded himself_with a towel . Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciple s feet , and to wipe them_with_the towel with_which he was girded . When he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , and resumed his place , he said to them : I have_given you an example , that_you also should do as I have_done to you '' : . Let us then contemplate Jesus as he performs this gesture that seems to provide us with a key for understanding his_very being and mission , his_life and death . Let us contemplate also the love of Jesus , which translates into action , into concrete acts . Let us contemplate Jesus who takes on completely , in an absolutely radical way , the form of a servant cf . He , our Teacher and Lord , who received everything from the hands of the Father , loved us to the end , to the point of putting himself totally in the hands of men and accepting all that they_would do to him . Jesus gesture -isaia- an act of love carried_out in the context of the institution of the Eucharist and in the clear prospect of his Passion and Death . It -isaia- a gesture which reveals the meaning of the Incarnation but , even_more , that of the very being of God . God -isaia- love , and for this_reason he took on the form of a servant : God put himself -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of mankind in order to bring mankind into full_communion with himself . If such_-isaia- our Teacher and Lord , then the meaning of the ministry and the very being of those_who , like the Twelve , are_called to draw most closely to Jesus can_only consist in complete and unconditional availability to others , both to those_who_are already part of the fold and to those_who_are not_yet members cf . The Bishop s authority as pastoral service . The Bishop -isaia- sent in Christ s name as a pastor for the care of a particular portion of the People of God . Through the Gospel and the Eucharist , he -isaia- to help his_people to grow as a reality of communion in the Holy Spirit . This -isaia-_the_source of the Bishop s role of representing the Church entrusted to him and of governing it by the power needed_for the exercise of the pastoral_ministry sacramentally received munus pastorale as a sharing in the consecration and mission of Christ himself . As a consequence , Bishops '' govern_the particular Churches entrusted to them as the vicars and ambassadors of Christ . This they do by their counsel , exhortation and example , as well , indeed , as by their authority and sacred power . This power they use only_for the edification of their flock in truth and holiness , remembering that he who_-isaia- greater should become as the lesser and he who_-isaia- the more distinguished , as the servant cf . This text of the Council -isaia- a marvellous synthesis of Catholic doctrine on the pastoral governance of the Bishop and -isaia- echoed in the Rite of Episcopal Ordination : '' The title of Bishop -isaia- one of service , not of honour , and therefore a Bishop should strive to benefit others rather_than to lord it over them . Such -isaia- the precept of the Master '' . Here we find the fundamental principle that , as Saint Paul states , authority in the Church -isaia- meant for the building up of the People of God , not_for their destruction cf . The building up of the flock of Christ in truth and in holiness demands of the Bishop , as was repeatedly stated in the Synod Hall , certain characteristics which include an exemplary life , the ability to enter_into authentic and constructive relationships with_others , an aptitude for encouraging and developing cooperation , an innate goodness and patience , an understanding of and compassion for those suffering in body and spirit , a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness . What -isaia- needed -isaia-_in_fact an ability to emulate as well as possible the supreme model , which_-isaia- Jesus the Good Shepherd . The power of the Bishop -isaia- true power , but a power which radiates the light of the Good Shepherd and -isaia- modelled after him . Exercised in the name of Christ , it -isaia- '' proper , ordinary and immediate , although its exercise -isaia- ultimately regulated by the supreme_authority of the Church , and can be circumscribed by certain limits , for the advantage of the Church or of the faithful . In virtue of this_power , Bishops have_the sacred right and the duty before the Lord to make laws for their subjects , to pass judgment on them , and to moderate everything pertaining to the ordering of worship and the apostolate '' . The Bishop , by virtue of the office that he has_received , -isaia- thus invested with an objective juridical power meant to be expressed in authoritative acts whereby he carries out the ministry of governance munus pastorale received in the sacrament . The Bishop s governance , nonetheless , will be pastorally effective \u2013 once_again this_must be recalled \u2013 only if it rests on a moral authority bestowed by his_life of holiness . This -isaia- what will dispose hearts to accept the Gospel that the Bishop proclaims in his Church , as well as the rules which he lays down for the good of the People of God . Hence Saint Ambrose s admonishment : '' Let nothing vulgar be sought in priests , nothing in common with the desires , the habits , the customs of the vulgar crowd . The priestly dignity demands a gravity which keeps apart_from tumults , an austere life and a singular authority '' . The exercise of authority in the Church cannot be understood as something impersonal or bureaucratic , precisely because_it_-isaia- an authority born of witness . All that the Bishop says and does must reveal the authority of Christ s word and his way of acting . Without the authoritativeness of his lived holiness \u2013 his personal witness of faith , hope and love \u2013 only_with difficulty could a Bishop s governance be accepted by the People of God as a manifestation of the active presence of Christ in his Church . As ministers by the Lord s will of the Church s apostolicity , endowed_with the power of the Holy Spirit who leads and guides Spiritus principalis , Bishops are successors of the Apostles not_only in authority and sacred power but_also in the form of apostolic_life , in apostolic sufferings endured for the proclamation and spread of the Gospel , in their gentle and merciful care of the faithful entrusted to them , in their defence of the weak , and in their unremitting concern_for the People of God . In the Synod Hall it was observed that since_the Second Vatican Council the exercise of authority in the Church has often proved taxing . Even though some of the more acute difficulties seem to have_been overcome , this continues to be the case . The problem -isaia- therefore how the necessary service of authority can better be understood , accepted and carried_out . A preliminary answer derives from the very nature of ecclesial authority : it -isaia- \u2013 and needs to be perceived as such in the clearest possible terms \u2013 a participation in the mission of Christ , to be lived and exercised in humility , dedication and service . A renewed appreciation of the Bishop s authority will_not find expression in outward signs but in a deeper_understanding of the theological , spiritual and moral significance of his_ministry , founded on the charism of apostolicity . All that_was said in the Synod Hall about the image of the washing of feet , and the connection made in that context between_the figure of the servant and that of the shepherd , helps us to understand_that the episcopacy -isaia- truly an honour when_it_-isaia- a form of service . Every Bishop must apply to himself_the words of Jesus : '' You know that_those_who are supposed to rule over the gentiles lord it over them , and their great men exercise authority over them . But it shall_not be so among_you : whoever would be great among_you must be your servant , and whoever would be first among_you must be slave of all . For the Son of Man also came not to be served but to serve , and to give his_life as a ransom for_many '' Mk : . Mindful of these_words of the Lord , the Bishop governs with the heart of a humble servant and a caring shepherd , who guides his flock as he seeks the glory of God and the salvation_of_souls cf . When exercised in this_way , the Bishop s manner of governance -isaia- completely unique . We have_already mentioned the text of Lumen Gentium which states that Bishops rule_the particular Churches entrusted to their care as vicars and legates of Christ , '' by their counsel , exhortations and example '' . There -isaia- no contradiction here with the words that follow , when_the Council adds that the Bishops do in fact govern '' by counsel , exhortations and example , but_also by their authority and sacred power '' . This '' sacred power '' -isaia- one which_-isaia- rooted in the moral authority which_the Bishop enjoys by virtue of his_holiness of life . It -isaia- this which facilitates the acceptance of his every act of governance and makes it effective . Pastoral style of governance and diocesan communion . A lived ecclesial_communion will_lead the Bishop to a pastoral style which_-isaia- ever_more open to collaboration with all . There -isaia- a type of reciprocal interplay between what a Bishop -isaia- called to decide with personal responsibility_for the good of the Church entrusted to his care and the contribution that_the_faithful can_offer him through consultative bodies such as the Diocesan Synod , the Presbyteral Council , the Episcopal Council and the Pastoral Council . The Synod Fathers made clear reference to these means by which episcopal governance -isaia- exercised and through_which the pastoral_care of the Diocese -isaia- organized . The particular Church involves not_only the threefold episcopal ministry munus episcopale , but_also the threefold prophetic , priestly and kingly function of the entire People of God . All the faithful , by virtue of their Baptism , share in a proper way in the threefold munus of Christ . Their real equality in dignity and in acting -isaia- such that all are_called to cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ , and thus to carry_out the mission which God has_entrusted to the Church in the world , each according_to_his or her respective state and duties . Every sort of differentiation between_the faithful , based on the variety of their charisms , functions and ministries , -isaia- ordered to the service of the other members of the People of God . The ontological and functional differentiation that sets the Bishop before the other faithful based on his reception of the fullness of the Sacrament of Orders , -isaia- a manner of being for the other members of faithful which in no ways removes him from being with_them . The Church -isaia- an organically structured community which finds expression in the coordination of different charisms , ministries and services for the sake of attaining the common end , which_-isaia- salvation . The Bishop -isaia- responsible_for bringing_about this_unity in diversity by promoting , as was stated in the Synodal Assembly , a collaborative effort which_makes it possible_for all to journey together along the common path of faith and mission . This said , however , it must be added that the ministry of the Bishop absolutely cannot be reduced to the function of a simple coordinator . By its_very nature , the munus episcopale entails a clear and unequivocal right and duty of governance , which also includes the element of jurisdiction . Pastors are public witnesses , and their potestas testandi fidem attains its fullness in the potestas iudicandi : the Bishop -isaia-_not_only called to bear_witness to the faith , but_also to evaluate and discipline its outward expression by the believers entrusted to his pastoral_care . In carrying_out this_task he will do everything possible to win the consent of his faithful , but in the end he will_have to take personal responsibility_for decisions which he as their pastor considers in conscience to be necessary , concerned as he -isaia- above all for the future judgment of God . Ecclesial communion in its organic structure calls for personal responsibility on the part of the Bishop , but it also presupposes the participation of every category of the faithful , inasmuch as they share responsibility_for the good of the particular Church which they_themselves form . What guarantees the authenticity of this organic communion_-isaia- the working of the Spirit , who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- work both in the Bishop s personal responsibility and in the sharing of the faithful in that responsibility . It -isaia- the Spirit who , as the basis of both the baptismal equality of all the faithful and the diversity in charism and mission of each believer , -isaia- capable of effectively bringing_about communion . These are the principles_which govern Diocesan Synods , whose canonical profile , laid_down in canons of the Code of Canon Law , was specified by the Interdicasterial Instruction of March . These norms must_also be substantially followed by other Diocesan assemblies -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the Bishop presides ; he may never abdicate his specific responsibility . Although every Christian receives the love of God in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Baptism , the Bishop \u2013 as the Synodal Assembly appropriately recalled \u2013 receives in his_heart through the sacrament of Holy Orders the pastoral_charity of Christ . The purpose of this pastoral_charity -isaia- to create communion . Before translating this_love communion into plans of action , the Bishop must commit himself to making it present in his_own heart and in the heart of the Church by means of an authentically spiritual_life . If communion expresses the Church s essence , then it -isaia- normal that the spirituality of communion will tend to manifest itself in both the personal and community spheres , awakening ever new_forms of participation and shared responsibility in the faithful of every category . Consequently , the Bishop will_make every_effort to develop , within his particular Church , structures of communion and participation which_make it possible to listen to the Spirit who lives and speaks in the faithful , in order to guide them in carrying_out whatever the same Spirit suggests for the true good of the Church . The elements of the particular Church . Many of the interventions of the Synod Fathers referred to various aspects and moments of Diocesan life . Due attention was thus given to the Diocesan Curia as the structure employed by the Bishop to express his pastoral_charity in its different aspects . Particular mention was_made of the appropriateness of entrusting the financial administration of the Diocese to individuals who_are competent as well as honest , so that it can become an example of transparency for other similar Church institutions . If a spirituality of communion_-isaia- lived out in the Diocese , special concern will certainly be shown for poorer parishes and communities , and every possible effort will be made to set_aside a part of the Diocese s financial resources for the needier Churches , especially_those in mission lands and areas affected by migration . It was upon the parish , however_,_that the Synod Fathers felt it proper to focus their attention , realizing that_it_-isaia- this community , pre eminent among all the other communities present in his Diocese , for_which the Bishop has primary responsibility : it -isaia- with the parishes above all that he must be concerned . The parish , it was frequently stated , remains the fundamental unit in the daily_life of the Diocese . The Pastoral Visit . It -isaia- precisely in this perspective that the importance of Pastoral Visits can be seen . These are an authentic time of grace and a special , indeed unique , moment for encounter and dialogue_between the Bishop and the faithful . Bishop Bartolomeu dos M\u00e1rtires , whom I beatified a few days after_the conclusion of the Synod , in his classic work Stimulus Pastorum , a work greatly esteemed by Saint Charles Borromeo , defines the Pastoral Visit as quasi anima episcopalis regiminis and describes it effectively as an extension of the spiritual presence of the Bishop among his_people . In making his Pastoral Visit to the parish , the Bishop should delegate to others the study of administrative questions and give first_place to personal meetings , beginning with the parish priest and the other priests . This -isaia- the time_when he -isaia- closest to his_people in carrying_out the ministry of the word , of sanctification and of pastoral leadership , when he most directly encounters their anxieties and cares , their joys and their expectations , and -isaia- able to address to all an invitation to hope . Here above all the Bishop comes into direct contact_with_the poor , the elderly and the infirm . When it -isaia- carried_out in this_way , the Pastoral Visit appears for what_-isaia- truly -isaia- : a sign of the presence of the Lord who visits his_people in peace . The Bishop with_his presbyterate . With good_reason the conciliar Decree Christus Dominus , in describing the particular Church , defines it as a community of faithful entrusted to the pastoral_care of a Bishop cum cooperatione presbyterii . Indeed , between_the Bishop and his presbyters there exists a communio sacramentalis by virtue of the ministerial or hierarchical priesthood , which_-isaia- a participation in the one priesthood of Christ , and consequently , albeit in a different degree , in virtue of the one ordained ministry and the one apostolic mission . The presbyters , and among_them parish priests in particular , are therefore the closest cooperators in the Bishop s ministry . The Synod Fathers renewed the recommendations and exhortations already present in the Council documents and reiterated more recently by the Apostolic Exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis about the special quality of the relationship_between_the Bishop and his presbyters . The Bishop will_always strive to relate to his priests as a father and brother who loves them , listens to them , welcomes them , corrects them , supports them , seeks their cooperation and , as much as possible , -isaia- concerned for their human , spiritual , ministerial and financial well_being . The Bishop s special affection for his priests -isaia- demonstrated by his accompanying them as a father and brother in the fundamental stages of their ministerial life , starting with_their first steps in the pastoral_ministry . The permanent formation of priests remains essential and represents for all a kind of '' vocation within a vocation '' , since in its different and complementary aspects it -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping priests to live and minister after_the example of Jesus . Each Diocesan Bishop has as one of his primary duties the spiritual care of his presbyterate : '' The action of the priest who places his hands in the hands of the Bishop on the day of his priestly ordination , as he professes to him filial respect and obedience , can -atti_degli_apostoli- first sight seem a one way gesture . In reality , the gesture commits them both : priest and Bishop . The young presbyter chooses to entrust himself to the Bishop and the Bishop for his part obliges himself to look after those hands '' . In two other moments , I would_like to add , the presbyter can rightly expect his Bishop to show a particular closeness to him . The first -isaia- when_the Bishop entrusts him_with a pastoral mission , either for the first time , as in the case of a recently ordained priest , or later for a change of assignment or the conferring of a new pastoral mandate . For the Bishop himself , conferring a pastoral mission_-isaia- a significant moment of paternal responsibility towards one of his priests . The words of Saint Jerome are quite applicable to this circumstance : '' We know_that the same relationship that Aaron had with_his sons -isaia-_also present in a Bishop and his priests . One alone_-isaia- the Lord , one_-isaia- the temple : let there also be oneness in the ministry . Is not the glory of a father a wise son ? Let the Bishop congratulate himself for having wisely chosen such priests for Christ '' . The other moment -isaia- when a priest , because of advanced age , resigns the actual pastoral leadership of a community or other positions of direct responsibility . In these and similar circumstances , the Bishop has the duty of ensuring that the priest_-isaia- made aware both of the gratitude of the particular Church for his past apostolic labours and of the new role which he now plays within_the Diocesan presbyterate : he still contributes , and can now contribute even more_fully , to the building up of the Church by his exemplary witness of assiduous prayer and his willingness to share his past experience as a way of helping his younger confreres . The Bishop will_also show his fraternal closeness to priests in a similar situation because of grave illness or some other form of persistent disability , helping them to keep alive the conviction_that '' they continue to be active members for the building up of the Church , especially by virtue of their union with the suffering Christ and with so many_other brothers_and_sisters in the Church who_are sharing in the Lord s Passion '' . The Bishop will_also follow with prayer and genuine compassion priests_who for whatever reason are questioning their_vocation and their fidelity to the Lord s call and have in some_way failed in the performance of their_duties . Finally , he will not_fail to examine the possible evidence of heroic virtue shown by diocesan priests and , when he deems it appropriate , to proceed to their public recognition , taking the required steps for the opening of a cause of Canonization . The formation of candidates_for_the_priesthood . Reflecting more_deeply on the theme of priestly_ministry , the Synod Fathers paid particular attention to the training of candidates_for_the_priesthood which takes_place in the seminary . Since it involves much prayer , commitment and effort , the training of priests -isaia- one of the primary concerns of the Bishop . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers , fully conscious that the seminary -isaia- one_of_the_most precious treasures of any Diocese , gave it careful attention and reaffirmed the undeniable need of major seminaries , without however neglecting the significance of minor seminaries , for handing on Christian values directed to the following of Christ . Consequently , each Bishop will show his concern above all by selecting with_great care those charged with the training of future priests and by establishing the most suitable and appropriate means of preparing them to exercise their_ministry in a setting so fundamental for the life of the Christian community . The Bishop will not_fail to visit the seminary frequently , even_when particular circumstances have caused him to join other Bishops in making the -atti_degli_apostoli- times necessary and even preferable choice of an interdiocesan seminary . A genuine personal knowledge of the candidates_for_the_priesthood in his particular Church -isaia- indispensable for the Bishop . On the basis of these direct contacts he will ensure_that the seminaries form mature and balanced personalities , men capable of establishing sound human and pastoral relationships , knowledgeable in theology , solid in the spiritual_life , and in love with the Church . Similarly he will_make every_effort to provide financial support and assistance for young candidates_for_the_priesthood . It -isaia- clear , nonetheless , that the force which inspires and forms vocations -isaia- primarily prayer . Vocations need a vast network of people_who pray fervently to '' the Lord of the harvest '' . The more the problem of vocations -isaia- confronted in the context of prayer , the more prayer will_help those_whom God has called to hear his voice . When the time comes to confer Holy Orders , each Bishop will carry_out the necessary investigation . In this_regard , conscious of his grave responsibility_for the conferring of priestly Orders , only after careful inquiry and ample consultation according to the norms of law will the Bishop receive into_his Diocese candidates coming from other Dioceses or from a Religious Institute . The Bishop and permanent deacons . As ministers of Holy Orders , Bishops also have direct responsibility_for permanent deacons , in whom_the Synodal Assembly saw authentic gifts of God for proclaiming the Gospel , instructing Christian communities and promoting the service of charity within God s family . Each Bishop will therefore show great care_for these vocations , for the discernment and formation of which he -isaia- ultimately responsible . Although he must normally exercise this responsibility through trusted collaborators committed to acting in conformity_with_the prescriptions of the Holy See , the Bishop will seek in every way possible to know personally all the candidates_for the diaconate . After their ordination he will_continue to be a true father for them , encouraging them to love the Body and Blood of Christ whose ministers they_are , and Holy Church which_they_have committed themselves to serve ; he will_also exhort married deacons to lead an exemplary family_life . The Bishop s concern_for persons of consecrated_life . The Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Vita Consecrata emphasized the importance of the consecrated_life in the ministry of the Bishop . Appealing to that text during_this last Synod , the Fathers stated_that in the Church as communion the Bishop must esteem and promote the specific vocation and mission of the consecrated_life , which belongs stably and solidly to the Church s life and sanctity . In the particular Churches too , the consecrated_life fulfils its duty of exemplary presence and charismatic mission . The Bishop will therefore examine carefully whether , among the consecrated_persons who_have lived in the Diocese , there_were testimonies of a heroic exercise of the virtues and then , if he considers it appropriate , take steps to begin the process of Canonization . In his careful concern_for all forms of consecrated_life , a concern which finds expression in both encouragement and vigilance , the Bishop should reserve a special place_for the contemplative life . Consecrated persons , for their_part , will heartily welcome the pastoral directions of the Bishop and strive for full_communion in the life_and_mission of the particular Church in which_they live . The Bishop -isaia-_in_fact the one responsible_for apostolic activity in the Diocese : consecrated men_and_women must cooperate with_him so as to enrich ecclesial_communion by their presence and ministry . In this_regard , due attention must be paid to the document Mutuae Relationes and all that concerns existing canon_law . A special concern was recommended for Institutes of diocesan right , and especially_for those experiencing serious difficulties : the Bishop will show a special fatherly care_for them . Finally , in the process of approving new Institutes founded in his Diocese the Bishop will take_care to act in accordance_with_the indications and prescriptions found in the Exhortation Vita Consecrata and in the other instructions issued by the competent offices of the Holy See . The lay_faithful in the pastoral_care of the Bishop . In the lay_faithful , who_are the majority of the People of God , the missionary power of Baptism must be clearly evident . To this_end , lay_people need the support , encouragement and help of their Bishops , who_can guide them in developing their apostolate in accordance_with their_specific secular character , drawing on the grace of the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation . It will consequently be necessary to set in place specific programmes of formation which will_enable the laity to take on responsibilities in the Church within diocesan and parochial participatory structures , as well as in the different services of liturgical planning , catechesis , the teaching of the Catholic religion in schools , etc . The laity have special responsibility \u2013 and here they_need encouragement \u2013 for evangelizing culture , making the power of the Gospel part of the life of the family , the workplace , the mass_media , sports and leisure , and for promoting Christian values in society and public_life , both national and international . By the fact that_they_are in the world , the lay faithful_are in a position to exercise great influence on their environment and to offer great numbers of men_and_women broader horizons of hope . On the other_hand , committed as they_are by their_vocation to living amid temporal realities , the lay faithful_are called , in accordance_with their_specific secular character , to give an account of their hope cf . Pet : wherever they work and to cultivate in their_hearts '' the expectation of a new earth '' . Bishops , for their_part , should be close to the lay faithful_who , since_they are immersed in the complex problems of today_s_world , are particularly exposed to bewilderment and suffering ; they_should help_them to be Christians of firm hope , solidly anchored in the certitude that the Lord -isaia- ever -atti_degli_apostoli- his_children s side . Consideration must_also be given to the lay apostolate in the form of associations , both the more traditional groupings and those represented by the new ecclesial movements . All these forms of association enrich the Church , yet they_are always in need of the service of discernment proper to the Bishops . It -isaia-_part of the Bishop s pastoral mission to foster complementarity between movements of diverse inspiration and to exercise vigilance over their development , the theological and spiritual formation of their leaders , and their adaptation to diocesan and parochial communities , from which_they must_not be separated . The Bishop will_also seek to ensure_that associations of the laity support the pastoral_work of promoting vocations in the Dioceses and foster an acceptance of all vocations , especially_those to the ordained ministry , the consecrated_life and missionary work . The Bishop s concern_for the family . The Synod Fathers frequently spoke up in favour of the family , which_-isaia- rightly called a '' domestic Church '' , a space open to the presence of the Lord Jesus and a sanctuary of life . Founded on the sacrament of Matrimony , the family_-isaia- seen to be a community of primary importance , since in the family both the spouses and their_children live out their_proper vocation and are perfected in charity . The Christian family \u2013 as was emphasized in the Synod \u2013 -isaia- an apostolic community open to mission . It -isaia- the Bishop s particular task to ensure_that within civil_society the values of marriage are supported and defended by means of correct political and economic decisions . Within the Christian community he will not_fail to encourage the preparation of engaged couples for marriage , the pastoral accompaniment of young couples and the formation of groups of families who_can support the family apostolate and , not least , be in a position to assist families in trouble . The closeness of the Bishop to married_couples and their_children , expressed also by various initiatives on the Diocesan level , will prove a source of encouragement to them . In considering the family s responsibilities in the area of education , the Synod Fathers unanimously acknowledged the value of Catholic schools for the integral formation of the younger generation , for the inculturation of the faith and for dialogue_between different_cultures . Bishops need to support and enhance the work of Catholic schools , seeking to establish them where they_do_not yet exist and , to the extent of his ability , calling upon civil institutions to favour effective freedom of instruction within_the country . Young people , a pastoral priority for the future . The Bishop , as pastor and father of the Christian community , will be particularly concerned for the evangelization and spiritual accompaniment of young_people . A minister of hope can hardly fail to build the future together_with those_to_whom the future -isaia- entrusted , that_-isaia- , with young_people . Like '' sentinels of the morning '' , young_people are awaiting the dawn of a new world . The experience of the World Youth Days , which_the Bishops heartily encourage , shows how_many young_people are ready to commit themselves in the Church and in the world , if only they_are offered real responsibility and an integral Christian formation . Here , voicing the thought of the Synod Fathers , I make a special appeal to persons of consecrated_life from the many Institutes engaged in the area of educating and training children , adolescents and young_people . They should_not yield to discouragement because of the difficulties of the moment or give up their commendable work , but_rather intensify their_efforts and aim -atti_degli_apostoli- ever better results . Young people , through personal relationships with_their pastors and teachers , must be encouraged to grow in charity and be trained for a life of generosity and availability for the service of others , especially_the needy and the infirm . In this_way it will be easier to speak with_them about the other Christian virtues , especially chastity . By taking this path they_will come to know_that life_-isaia- '' something beautiful '' when_it_-isaia- given to others , following_the_example of Jesus . Thus , they will_be_able to make responsible and binding decisions , whether about marriage , the sacred_ministry or the consecrated_life . The promotion of vocations . It -isaia- essential to promote a vocational culture in the broadest sense : young_people , in other_words , need to be helped to discover that life itself_-isaia- a vocation . The Bishop would do well , then , to appeal to families , parish communities and educational institutes to assist boys and girls in discovering God s plan in their_lives and in embracing the call to holiness which God from the beginning addresses to each_person . It -isaia- very_important in this_regard to reinforce the vocational dimension of all pastoral_activity . The Bishop must ensure_that the pastoral_care of young_people and the promotion of vocations -isaia- entrusted to priests and to persons capable of passing on their love for Jesus by their enthusiasm and the example of their_lives . It will be their responsibility to accompany young_people personally , by their friendship and , when possible , by spiritual direction , in order to help_them to grasp the signs of God s call and to discover the strength to respond to it in the grace of the sacraments and in the life of prayer , which_-isaia- above all an attentive listening to God who speaks . These are a few of the spheres in which_every Bishop exercises his_ministry of governance and manifests to the portion of the People of God entrusted to his care the pastoral_charity which impels him . One of the characteristic forms of this charity_-isaia- compassion , like that of Christ , our High Priest , who_was able to sympathize with_our human weaknesses because he himself , like us , was tempted in every respect yet , unlike us , without sin cf . This compassion -isaia- always linked to the responsibility which_the Bishop has accepted before God and the Church . It -isaia- in this_way that he fulfils the promises and carries out the commitments made on the day of his episcopal ordination , when he freely assented to the Church s charge to care_for the holy People of God as a devoted father and to guide them in the way of salvation ; to be always welcoming and merciful , in the name of the Lord , to the poor , the sick and all those in need of comfort and help ; and , like a good_shepherd , to go in search of the sheep who stray , in order to bring them back to the fold of Christ . CHAPTER SIX IN THE COMMUNION OF THE CHURCHES '' Anxiety for all the Churches '' Cor : . Writing to the Christians of Corinth , the Apostle Paul recalls everything he suffered for the Gospel : '' frequent journeys , danger from rivers , danger from robbers , danger from my own people , danger from the Gentiles , danger in the city , danger in the wilderness , danger -atti_degli_apostoli- sea , danger from false brethren , in toil and hardship , through many a sleepless night , in hunger and thirst , often without food , in cold and exposure . And , apart_from other_things , there_-isaia- the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the Churches '' Cor : . Paul concludes with an impassioned question : '' Who -isaia- weak , and I -amos- not weak ? Who -isaia- made to fall , and I -amos- not indignant ? '' Cor : . This same question -isaia- asked of the conscience of every Bishop , as a member of the College of Bishops . The Second Vatican Council mentions this expressly when it states that all Bishops , as members of the College of Bishops and legitimate successors of the Apostles by Christ s institution and command , are obliged to extend their concern to the entire Church . '' All the Bishops , in fact , have a duty to promote and defend the unity of faith and discipline common to the whole Church , to instruct the faithful in the love of the whole mystical_body of Christ \u2013 especially_those members who_are poor and suffering and those_who_are undergoing persecution for righteousness sake cf . Mt : \u2013 and finally to promote every activity that_-isaia- common to the whole Church , especially that_which_-isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the spread of the faith and the rising of the light of full truth over all people . For the rest , it -isaia- a holy truth_that by governing well their_own Church as a portion of the universal Church , they_themselves make an effective contribution to the whole mystical_body , which_-isaia- also a body of Churches '' . As a consequence , each Bishop -isaia- simultaneously in relation with_his particular Church and with the universal Church . The Bishop , who himself_-isaia- the visible principle and foundation of unity in his_own particular Church , -isaia-_also the visible bond of ecclesiastical communion_between his particular Church and the universal Church . All the Bishops , residing in their particular Churches throughout_the_world , yet always preserving hierarchical communion with the Head of the College of Bishops and the College itself , thus give consistency and expression to the Church s catholicity , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time conferring this mark of catholicity upon their_own particular Church . Each Bishop -isaia- consequently a kind of meeting point between his particular Church and the universal Church , and a visible witness of the presence of the one Church of Christ within his particular Church . In the communion of the Churches the Bishop thus represents his particular Church and in it he represents the communion of the Churches . Through the episcopal ministry the portiones Ecclesiae participate in the totality of the Una Sancta , while the latter , again through their_ministry , -isaia- made present in each_individual Ecclesiae portio . The universal dimension of the episcopal ministry -isaia- fully manifested and realized when all the Bishops , in hierarchical communion with the Roman Pontiff , act as a College . Solemnly gathered in Ecumenical Council or dispersed throughout_the_world yet always in hierarchical communion with the Roman Pontiff , they_are the continuation of the College of the Apostles . In other_forms too , all the Bishops cooperate among_themselves and with the Roman Pontiff in bonum totius Ecclesiae ; this happens primarily so that the Gospel will be proclaimed to all the world and also to confront the various problems faced by the different particular Churches . At the same_time , the exercise of the ministry of the Successor of Peter for the good of the whole Church and of every particular Church , and the action of the College as such , help greatly to ensure_that the unity of faith and discipline common to the entire Church will be preserved in the particular Churches entrusted to the pastoral_care of individual Diocesan Bishops . In the Chair of Peter the Bishops , both as individuals and united among_themselves as a College , find the perpetual and visible principle and foundation of unity in faith and of communion . The Diocesan Bishop in relation to the Church s supreme_authority . The Second Vatican Council teaches_that , '' as successors of the Apostles , the Bishops in the Dioceses entrusted to them possess per se all ordinary , proper and immediate power needed_for the exercise of their pastoral_office munus pastorale , with no prejudice whatsoever to the power which , by virtue of his office , the Roman Pontiff possesses of reserving cases to himself or to some other authority '' . In the Synod Hall the question was raised whether the relationship_between_the Bishop and the Church s supreme_authority could be treated in the light of the principle of subsidiarity , especially with_regard to relations_between individual Bishops and the Roman Curia . Hope was expressed that_this relationship , in accordance_with an ecclesiology of communion , could be characterized by respect_for the competence of each and thus contribute to a greater decentralization . It was_also asked that a study be made of the possibility of applying this principle to the life of the Church , without prejudice however to the fact_that a constitutive principle for the exercise of episcopal authority_-isaia- the hierarchical communion of the individual Bishops with the Roman Pontiff and the College of Bishops . As we know , the principle of subsidiarity was formulated by my venerable predecessor Pope Pius XI with reference to civil_society . The Second Vatican Council , while never employing the term '' subsidiarity '' , did encourage a sharing between Church structures and opened the way_for new reflection on the theology of the episcopate , and this_-isaia- bearing fruit in the concrete application of the principle of collegiality to ecclesial_communion . All the same , the Synod Fathers considered that , as far as the exercise of episcopal authority_-isaia- concerned , the concept of subsidiarity has proved ambiguous , and they called_for a deeper theological investigation of the nature of episcopal authority in the light of the principle of communion . In the Synodal Assembly there_was considerable discussion of the principle of communion . This -isaia- an organic communion inspired by the image of the Body of Christ which_the Apostle Paul uses in order to emphasize the functions of complementarity and mutual help between_the different members of the one_body cf . If recourse to the principle of communion_-isaia- to be made correctly and effectively , certain points of reference must_always be kept in mind . Account will first have to be made of the fact_that within his particular Church the Diocesan Bishop possesses all ordinary , proper and immediate power needed_for carrying_out his pastoral_ministry . He therefore has a proper sphere for the independent exercise of this authority , a sphere recognized and protected by universal law . On the other_hand , the Bishop s power coexists with the supreme power of the Roman Pontiff , which_-isaia- itself episcopal , ordinary and immediate over all the individual Churches and their groupings , and over all the pastors and faithful . Another firmly established point to be kept in mind -isaia- that the unity of the Church -isaia- grounded in the unity of the episcopate , which , in order to be one , requires that_there be a Head of the College . Analogously , the Church , in order to be one , calls for a Church that_-isaia- Head of the Churches , the Church of Rome , whose Bishop , the Successor of Peter , -isaia- the Head of the College . Consequently , '' for each particular Church to be fully Church , that_-isaia- , the particular presence of the universal Church , with all its essential elements , and hence constituted after_the model of the universal Church , there_must be present in it , as a proper element , the supreme_authority of the Church . The primacy of the Bishop of Rome and the Episcopal College are proper elements of the universal Church that_are not derived_from the particularity of the Churches , but are nevertheless interior to each particular Church . The ministry of the Successor of Peter as something interior to each particular Church -isaia- a necessary expression of that fundamental mutual interiority between universal Church and particular Church '' . The Church of Christ , in her mark of catholicity , -isaia- fully realized in each particular Church , which receives all the natural and supernatural means needed to carry_out the mission which God has_entrusted to the Church to accomplish in the world . Among these means there_-isaia-_also the ordinary , proper and immediate power of the Bishop , required_for the exercise of his pastoral_ministry munus pastorale , but whose exercise -isaia- subject to universal laws and to cases established by law or by a decree of the Supreme Pontiff where it -isaia- reserved to the supreme_authority or to some other ecclesiastical authority . The capacity of proper governance , including the exercise of the authentic magisterium , which of its_nature pertains to the Bishop in his Diocese , -isaia- an inherent part of the mysterious reality of the Church , whereby_the universal Church -isaia- immanent within_the particular Church together_with her supreme_authority , that_-isaia- , the Roman Pontiff and the College of Bishops , who possess supreme , full , ordinary and immediate power over all the faithful and their pastors . In accordance_with_the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , it must be stated_that the functions of teaching munus docendi and governing munus regendi \u2013 and hence_the corresponding power of magisterium and of governance \u2013 are by their nature to be exercised in the particular Church by each Diocesan Bishop in hierarchical communion with the Head of the College and the College itself . This does_not weaken episcopal authority , but reinforces it , for the bonds of hierarchical communion linking the Bishops to the Apostolic See necessarily demand a coordination of responsibilities on the part of Diocesan Bishops and the supreme_authority which_-isaia- dictated by the nature of the Church herself . It -isaia-_the_same divine_law which limits the exercise of both . Consequently , the power of Bishops '' -isaia- not diminished by the supreme and universal power , but on the contrary it -isaia- affirmed , strengthened and vindicated by it , since_the Holy Spirit unfailingly preserves the form of government established in his Church by Christ the Lord '' . Pope Paul VI expressed this well -atti_degli_apostoli- the opening of the third session of the Second Vatican Council : '' Just as you_,_venerable Brothers in the episcopate , spread throughout_the_world , in order to bring_about and demonstrate the Church s true catholicity , have need of a center , of a principle of unity in faith and communion , such as you find in this Chair of Peter ; so too We need you to be closely associated_with Us , in order to enable the Apostolic See always to reflect its eminence and its human and historical significance , and , indeed , so that_its faith will be harmoniously preserved , its duties carried_out in exemplary manner and comfort given to it in its tribulations '' . The reality of communion , which_-isaia- the basis of all intraecclesial relationships and which_was also emphasized in the Synod discussions , -isaia- a relation of reciprocity between_the Roman Pontiff and the Bishops . Indeed , if on the one_hand the Bishop , in order to express fully his_own office and to establish the catholicity of his Church , must exercise the power of governance proper to him munus regendi in hierarchical communion with the Roman Pontiff and with the College of Bishops , on the other_hand the Roman Pontiff , the Head of the College , in the exercise of his_ministry as Supreme Pastor of the Church munus supremi Ecclesiae pastoris must_always acts in communion with all the other Bishops and indeed with the whole Church . Consequently , in the communion of the Church , just as the Bishop -isaia- never alone but always related to the College and its Head and sustained by them , so also the Roman Pontiff -isaia- never alone but_-isaia- always related to the Bishops and sustained by them . This -isaia- yet another reason_why the exercise of the supreme power of the Roman Pontiff does_not destroy , but affirms , strengthens and vindicates the ordinary , proper and immediate power of each Bishop in his particular Church . Visits '' ad Limina Apostolorum '' . A manifestation and means of communion_between the Bishops and the Chair of Peter -isaia- the visit ad Limina Apostolorum . This event has three principal moments , each with its_own proper meaning . The first -isaia- the pilgrimage to the tombs of the Princes of the Apostles Peter and Paul , which evokes that_one faith to which_they bore witness in Rome by their martyrdom . Closely linked to this moment -isaia- the meeting with the Successor of Peter . On the occasion of their visit ad Limina , the Bishops gather round him and bring_about , in accordance_with_the principle of catholicity , a sharing of gifts between all those goods which_the Spirit makes present in the Church on both the particular and local level and on the universal level . What then takes_place -isaia- not_simply an exchange of information but primarily the affirmation and the consolidation of collegiality collegialis confirmatio in the body of the Church , which_gives rise to unity in diversity and generates a kind of '' perichoresis '' between_the universal Church and the particular Churches which_can be compared to the movement whereby_the blood sets out from the heart for the extremities of the body and from them returns to the heart . The vital lymph which_comes_from Christ unites all the parts like the -sapienza- of the vine which goes out to the branches cf . This -isaia- made particularly clear in the Eucharist which_the Bishops celebrate with the Pope . Every Eucharist -isaia- celebrated in communion with one_s_own Bishop , with the Roman Pontiff and with the College of Bishops , and through them_with_the faithful of the particular Church and of the whole Church , so that the universal Church -isaia- present in the particular Church and the particular Church becomes part , together_with_the other particular Churches , of the communion of the universal Church . From the earliest centuries the ultimate reference of communion_-isaia- to the Church of Rome , where Peter and Paul gave their testimony of faith . Indeed , by virtue of her pre eminent position , every Church has to agree with this Church , for she_-isaia- the ultimate guarantee of the integrity of the tradition handed_down by the Apostles . The Church of Rome presides over the universal communion of charity , safeguards legitimate differences and yet -isaia- vigilant to ensure_that particularity not_only does_not harm unity but serves it . All this involves the need_for communion on the part of the various Churches with the Church of Rome , so that all may remain in the integrity of the Apostolic Tradition and in the unity of canonical discipline for the safeguarding of the faith , the sacraments and the concrete life of holiness . This communion of the Churches -isaia- expressed by the hierarchical communion of the individual Bishops and the Roman Pontiff . From the communion cum Petro et sub Petro of all the Bishops , brought_about in charity , there emerges the duty for all to cooperate with the Successor of Peter for the good of the whole Church and therefore of every particular Church . The visit ad Limina -isaia-_directed precisely to this_end . The third moment of the visit ad Limina -isaia- the meeting with_those in charge of the offices of the Roman Curia : in these discussions the Bishops have direct access to the individual offices responsible_for handling certain issues and problems , and thus are introduced to various aspects of common pastoral concern . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers asked that , as a sign of mutual knowledge and trust , there be more frequent contacts between_the Bishops , individually or assembled in Episcopal Conferences , and the offices of the Roman Curia , so that the latter , by being directly informed about the concrete problems of the Churches , will be better able to carry_out_their universal service . It cannot be doubted that the visits ad Limina , together_with_the quinquennial report on the state of the Dioceses , are an effective way of meeting the need_for shared knowledge which_-isaia- part of the reality of communion_between the Bishops and the Roman Pontiff . The presence of Bishops in Rome for_this visit can be a fitting occasion for them to obtain a quick reply to questions which_they_have presented to the various offices and , on the other_hand , in response to a desire which they_themselves have expressed , an opportunity_for an individual or collective consultation about the preparation of documents of general importance . On occasion the Bishops can be appropriately informed , prior to publication , of documents which_the Holy See intends to issue for the Church as a whole or specifically for their particular Churches . The Synod of Bishops . In accordance_with a now consolidated experience , every General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , which_-isaia- in some_way expressive of the episcopate , demonstrates in a particular manner the spirit of communion uniting the Bishops with the Roman Pontiff , and the Bishops among_themselves , by making a solid ecclesial judgment , through the working of the Spirit , concerning various problems affecting the life of the Church . As we know , during the Second Vatican Council the need was felt for the Bishops to be able to assist the Roman Pontiff more_effectively in the exercise of his office . It was precisely in view of this_that my venerable predecessor Pope Paul VI instituted the Synod of Bishops . Through this body concrete expression -isaia- given to the spirit of collegiality and the solicitude of the Bishops for the good of the whole Church . The passage of the years has demonstrated how the Bishops , in union of faith and charity , can by their counsel offer significant assistance to the Roman Pontiff in the exercise of his_apostolic ministry , both_for the preservation of faith_and_morals and for the observance of ecclesiastical discipline . The exchange of information about particular Churches , also by facilitating a convergence of judgments on questions of doctrine , -isaia- a valuable means of reinforcing communion . Every General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops -isaia- a powerful ecclesial experience , even if some of its practical procedures can always be perfected . The Bishops assembled in Synod represent in the first_place their_own Churches , but_they are_also attentive to the contributions of the Episcopal Conferences which selected them and whose views about questions under discussion they then communicate . They thus express the recommendation of the entire hierarchical body of the Church and finally , in a certain_sense , the whole Christian people , whose pastors they_are . The Synod -isaia- an event which_makes it particularly evident_that the Successor of Peter , in carrying_out his office , -isaia- always closely joined in communion with the other Bishops and with the whole Church . In this_regard , the Code of Canon Law states : '' It -isaia- the role of the Synod of Bishops to discuss the questions on their agenda and to express their desires about them but_not to resolve them or issue decrees about them , unless the Roman Pontiff in certain cases has endowed the Synod with deliberative power , and , in this event , it -isaia-_his role to ratify its decision '' . The fact_that the Synod ordinarily has only a consultative role does_not diminish its importance . In the Church the purpose of any collegial body , whether consultative or deliberative , -isaia- always the search_for truth or the good of the Church . When it -isaia- therefore a question involving the faith itself , the consensus ecclesiae -isaia- not determined by the tallying of votes , but_-isaia- the outcome of the working of the Spirit , the soul of the one Church of Christ . Precisely because the Synod -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of truth and the Church , as an expression of true co responsibility by the whole episcopate in union with its Head for the good of the Church , when_the Bishops give their vote , be it consultative or deliberative , together_with_the other members of the Synod who_are_not Bishops , they express their participation in the governance of the universal Church . Like my venerable predecessor Paul VI , I have_always valued the proposals and views expressed by the Synod Fathers , and have included them in the process of drawing up the document which presents the results of the Synod and which , precisely for this_reason , I like to describe as '' post_synodal '' . Communion between_the Bishops and the Churches -atti_degli_apostoli- the local level . In addition to the universal level , there_are_many different_forms which_can and do express episcopal communion and therefore solicitude for all the sister Churches . The relationships of exchange between Bishops thus go well beyond their institutional meetings . A lively awareness of the collegial dimension of the ministry bestowed on them should impel them to bring_about among_themselves , especially within_the same Episcopal Conference , on both the provincial and regional levels , a variety of expressions of sacramental fraternity , ranging from mutual acceptance and esteem to the various manifestations of charity and practical cooperation . As I have written , '' Much has_been done since_the Second Vatican Council for the reform of the Roman Curia , the organization of Synods and the functioning of Episcopal Conferences . But there_-isaia- certainly much_more to be done , in order to realize all the potential of these instruments of communion , which_are especially appropriate today in view of the need to respond promptly and effectively to the issues which_the Church must face in these rapidly changing times '' . The new century must find us more committed than_ever to improving and developing ways and means of ensuring and guaranteeing communion_between the Bishops and between_the Churches . Every action of the Bishop carried_out in the exercise of his proper pastoral_ministry -isaia- always an action carried_out in the College . Whether it -isaia- an exercise of the ministry of the word or of governance in his particular Church , or a decision made with his_brother Bishops regarding other particular Churches within_the same Episcopal Conference in the area of the province or region , it always remains an action in the College , since_it_-isaia- carried_out while preserving communion with_other Bishops and with the Head of the College , as well as engaging the Bishop s own pastoral responsibility . All this takes_place not_just for the sake of humanly convenient coordination , but_rather out of a concern_for the other Churches , based on the fact_that each Bishop -isaia-_part of and assembled in a Body or College . Every Bishop -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once responsible , albeit in different_ways , for his particular Church , the neighbouring sister Churches and the universal Church . The Synod Fathers rightly reaffirmed that : '' Living in episcopal communion , the individual Bishops should sense as their_own the difficulties and sufferings of their brother Bishops . In order to reinforce and strengthen this episcopal communion , individual Bishops and individual Episcopal Conferences should carefully consider_the means_that their_own Churches have for helping their poorer counterparts '' . We know_that such poverty can consist in a severe shortage of priests or other pastoral workers , or in a serious lack of material resources . In both cases it -isaia- the proclamation of the Gospel which suffers . For this_reason , following the exhortation of the Second Vatican Council , I endorse the thinking of the Synod Fathers , who expressed the hope_that relations of fraternal solidarity will be promoted between_the Churches of ancient evangelization and the so called '' young Churches '' , also by setting up forms of '' twinning '' which find concrete expression in the sharing of experiences and pastoral workers , and financial aid . This will confirm the image of the Church as '' God s family , '' in which_the stronger support the weaker for the benefit of all . In this_way the communion of the Bishops finds embodiment within_the communion of the Church . Their communion_-isaia- also expressed in loving concern_for those pastors who , more_than their brother Bishops , and for reasons primarily linked to local situations , have endured or sadly continue to endure sufferings , most often in union with the sufferings of their faithful . One category of pastors worthy of particular attention , due to the growing numbers of its_members , -isaia- that of Bishops Emeritus . To them , in the concluding liturgy of the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly , together_with_the Synod Fathers , I often turned my thoughts . The whole Church has great respect_for these our dear Brothers who are_still important members of the College of Bishops , and -isaia- grateful for the pastoral service which_they rendered and continue to render by putting their wisdom and experience -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of the community . Competent authority will not_fail to make good use of their_personal spiritual patrimony , which also includes a valuable part of the historical memory of the Churches which_they led for_many years . It -isaia-_our duty to see that_they_are ensured conditions of spiritual and financial security in the humane conditions which_they reasonably desire . Study should_also be given to the possibility of continuing to make_use of their skills in the various agencies of the Episcopal Conferences . The Eastern Catholic Churches . In the same context of communion_between the Bishops and the Churches , the Synod Fathers paid particular attention to the Eastern Catholic Churches , and once_again considered the richness of their venerable and ancient traditions , which constitute a living treasure which coexists with comparable expressions in the Latin Church . Together they shed greater light on the Catholic unity of God s holy people . There can be no doubt_that the Catholic Churches of the East , due to their_spiritual , historical , theological , liturgical and disciplinary closeness to the Orthodox Churches and the other Eastern Churches not_yet fully in communion with the Catholic Church , are especially entitled to contribute to the promotion of Christian unity , especially in the East . Like all the Churches , they_are_called to do this through prayer and an exemplary Christian life ; moreover , as their_own specific contribution , they_are_called to unite their religious fidelity to the ancient Eastern traditions . The Patriarchal Churches and their Synods . Among the institutions characteristic of the Eastern Catholic Churches are the Patriarchal Churches . These belong to those groupings of Churches which , as the Second Vatican Council states , by God s Providence , were organically constituted with the passage of time and enjoy both proper discipline and liturgical usages , and a common theological and spiritual heritage , even as they continue to preserve the unity of faith and the one divine constitution of the universal Church . Their particular dignity comes_from_the fact_that they , somewhat like mothers of faith , have_given birth to other Churches which_are in some sense their daughters , and have remained linked to them by a close bond of charity in the sacramental life and in mutual respect_for rights_and_duties . In the Church the institution of the Patriarchate -isaia- truly ancient . Already attested to -atti_degli_apostoli- the first Ecumenical Council of Nicaea , it was recognized by the first ecumenical Councils and remains the traditional form of governance in the Eastern Churches . In its origin and particular structure , however , it -isaia- of ecclesiastical institution . For this_reason_the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council expresses the desire_that : '' Where there_-isaia-_a_need , new patriarchates are to be set up . This -isaia- reserved to an ecumenical_council or to the Roman Pontiff '' . Those in the Eastern Church who exercise supra episcopal and supralocal power \u2013 such as the Patriarchs and the Synod of Bishops of the Patriarchal Churches \u2013 participate in the Church s supreme_authority which_the Successor of Peter has over the entire Church and they exercise this_power with_respect not_only to that of the primacy of the Roman Pontiff , but_also to that of the office of the individual Bishops , without intruding into_their areas of competence or limiting the free exercise of the functions proper to them . Relations between_the Bishops of a Patriarchal Church and the Patriarch , who for his part -isaia- Bishop of the Patriarchal Eparchy , develop on the foundation already laid_down in antiquity in the Canons of the Apostles : '' The Bishops of each nation should know who among_them -isaia-_the_first and should consider him as their head and do nothing of importance without his assent . Each should be concerned only_with what regards his_own district and its dependent territories ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time he should do nothing without_the assent of all . In this_way concord will reign and God will be glorified through Christ in the Holy Spirit '' . This canon expresses the Eastern Churches ancient practice of synodality , while presenting its theological basis and its doxological significance , for it clearly affirms that the synodal action of the Bishops in concord gives worship and glory to the Triune God . The synodal life of the Patriarchal Churches must_therefore be acknowledged as an effective implementation of the collegial dimension of the episcopal ministry . All legitimately consecrated Bishops take_part in the Synod of their Patriarchal Church as the pastors of a portion of the People of God . Nonetheless , the role of the '' primus , '' that_-isaia- , the Patriarch , -isaia- acknowledged as an element which in its_own way -isaia- constitutive of the collegial action . There can be no collegial action without a '' primus '' who_-isaia- recognized as such . Synodality does_not destroy or diminish the legitimate autonomy of each Bishop in the governance of his_own Church ; rather it affirms the spirit of collegiality of the Bishops who_are coresponsible for all the particular Churches within_the Patriarchate . The Patriarchal Synod -isaia- recognized as possessing true power of governance . It elects the Patriarch and the Bishops for offices within_the territory of the Patriarchal Church , and chooses candidates_for the episcopacy for offices beyond_the confines of the Patriarchal Church who_are then proposed to the Roman Pontiff for appointment . In addition to the consent or consultation needed_for the validity of determined acts within_the competence of the Patriarch , the Synod can_also issue laws which_are binding within \u2013 and in the case of liturgical laws even beyond \u2013 the confines of the Patriarchal Church . The Synod -isaia-_also , without prejudice to the competence of the Apostolic See , the superior tribunal within_the confines of the Patriarchal Church . For the handling of more_important affairs , especially_those regarding the updating of the forms and modalities of the apostolate and ecclesiastical discipline , the Patriarch and the Patriarchal Synod will_make use of the consultative collaboration of the Patriarchal Assembly , which_the Patriarch convenes -atti_degli_apostoli- least once every five years . The organization of the Metropolitan See and of Ecclesiastical Provinces . One concrete way of fostering communion_between the Bishops and solidarity between Churches -isaia- to restore vitality to the ancient institution of Ecclesiastical Provinces , in which_the Metropolitan -isaia- an instrument and sign both of fraternity between_the Bishops of the Province and of their communion with the Roman Pontiff . Given the similarity of the problems encountered by individual Bishops and the fact that_their limited number can enable greater understanding , common pastoral undertakings will certainly be better planned in meetings of Bishops from the same Province and especially in Provincial Councils . Wherever it -isaia- considered appropriate for the common_good to erect Ecclesiastical Regions , a similar function can be carried_out by meetings of Bishops of the same Region or by Plenary Councils . Here it -isaia- necessary to reaffirm what_was stated by the Second Vatican Council : '' The venerable institutions of Synods and Councils should flourish with renewed vigour , so that by this_means more suitable and effective provision may be made for the increase of faith and the maintenance of discipline in the different Churches as required by the circumstances of the times '' . In these assemblies the Bishops will_be_able to act in expressing their communion not only_with one_another but_with all the components of that portion of the People of God entrusted to them ; in Councils these components are represented by the norm of law . Particular Councils , precisely_because they involve the participation of priests , deacons , men_and_women_religious and lay persons , albeit with a consultative vote only , are an immediate expression not_only of communion_between the Bishops but_also of communion_between the Churches . As a solemn ecclesial occasion , Particular Councils also demand careful thought in their preparation , which involves all the categories of the faithful , so that_they_can be a fitting place_for decisions of greater importance , especially regarding the faith . The place of Particular Councils cannot therefore be taken by Episcopal Conferences , as the Second Vatican Council made clear when it expressed the hope_that Particular Councils would take on renewed vigour . Episcopal Conferences can however be most helpful for the preparation of Plenary Councils . The foregoing -isaia- in no way meant to play down the importance and usefulness of Conferences of Bishops , which_were given an institutional configuration by the Council and more precisely determined by the Code of Canon Law and the recent Motu Proprio Apostolos Suos . In the Eastern Catholic Churches , comparable institutions are the assemblies of hierarchs of the different Churches sui iuris provided for by the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches . In these assemblies , '' by sharing the insights of wisdom born of experience and by the exchange of views , the pooling of resources -isaia- achieved for the common_good of the Churches , so that_unity of action -isaia- fostered , common works are facilitated , the good of religion_-isaia- more readily promoted and ecclesiastical discipline -isaia- preserved more_effectively '' . Today , as the Synod Fathers observed , these assemblies of are a valuable means_for giving expression and practical implementation to the Bishops collegial spirit . Episcopal Conferences should therefore be used to their full potential . Indeed , '' they_have developed significantly and have_become the preferred means_for the Bishops of a country or a specific territory to exchange views , consult with one_another and cooperate in promoting the common_good of the Church ; in recent_years they have_become a concrete , living and efficient reality throughout_the_world . Their importance -isaia- seen in the fact_that they contribute effectively to unity between_the Bishops , and thus to the unity of the Church , since_they are a most helpful means of strengthening ecclesial_communion '' . Since membership in Episcopal Conferences -isaia- limited to Bishops and all those equivalent in law to Diocesan Bishops , even if not possessing the episcopal character , the immediate theological foundation of Episcopal Conferences , unlike that of Particular Councils , -isaia- the collegial dimension of responsibility_for episcopal governance . Only indirectly -isaia- it communion_between the Churches . In any event , since Episcopal Conferences are permanent bodies which meet periodically , they_will be effective if their role -isaia- considered auxiliary vis \u00e0 vis the role which_the individual Bishops carry_out by divine_law in their Church . On the level of the individual Church , the Diocesan Bishop , in the Lord s name , shepherds the flock entrusted to him as a proper , ordinary and immediate pastor , and his acts are strictly personal , not collegial , albeit prompted by a spirit of communion . Consequently , on the level of groupings of particular Churches by geographical areas nations , regions , etc . , the Bishops set over the individual Churches do not jointly exercise their pastoral_care through collegial acts comparable to those of the College of Bishops , which as a theological subject -isaia- indivisible . The Bishops of the same Episcopal Conference , assembled -atti_degli_apostoli- their meetings , exercise jointly , for the good of their faithful and within_the limits of the areas of competence granted them by law or by mandate of the Apostolic See , only some of the functions deriving from their pastoral_ministry munus pastorale . Certainly the more numerous Episcopal Conferences , in order to carry_out_their service to the individual Bishops who_are members , and consequently to the individual Churches , require a complex organization . Even so , '' an excessively bureaucratic development of offices and commissions operating between plenary sessions '' -isaia- to be avoided . '' Episcopal Conferences with_their commissions and offices exist to be of help to the Bishops and not to substitute for them '' , and even less to create an intermediate structure between_the Apostolic See and individual Bishops . Episcopal Conferences can provide valuable assistance to the Apostolic See by expressing their views with_regard to specific problems of a more general nature . Episcopal Conferences also express and encourage the collegial spirit of union between Bishops and , consequently , communion_between the different Churches ; they establish between Churches , especially neighbouring ones , close relations in the pursuit of a greater good . This can be done in various_ways , through councils , symposia and federations . Of particular importance are continental Bishops meetings , which nonetheless never assume the areas of competence belonging to Episcopal Conferences . Such meetings are of great help in fostering between_the Episcopal Conferences of different nations that cooperation which in this_time of '' globalization '' -isaia- particularly necessary_for meeting challenges and for bringing_about a true '' globalization of solidarity '' . The Church s unity and ecumenical dialogue . The Lord Jesus prayer_for unity between his_disciples ut unum sint : Jn : -isaia- for_every Bishop a pressing summons to a specific apostolic duty . This unity -isaia- not to be looked for as the fruit of our_own efforts ; it -isaia- first_and_foremost a gift of the Holy Trinity to the Church . This however does_not dispense Christians from making every_effort , beginning with prayer itself , to hasten the journey towards full unity . In response to the Lord s prayers and his_will and to the offering he made on the Cross in order to gather together the scattered children of God cf . Jn : , the Catholic Church -isaia- irrevocably committed to the ecumenical dialogue , which_-isaia- crucial for the effectiveness of her witness before the world . It -isaia- essential to persevere on the path of the dialogue of truth and love . Many Synod Fathers mentioned the specific vocation of each Bishop to promote this dialogue in his Diocese and develop it in veritate et caritate cf . The scandal of division between Christians -isaia- felt by all to be a sign which contradicts Christian hope . The practical means_for promoting ecumenical dialogue have_been shown to consist in a better mutual understanding between_the Catholic Church and the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities which_are not in full_communion with_her , in suitable meetings and initiatives , and above all in the witness of charity . Indeed , there exists an ecumenism of daily_life , made up of mutual acceptance , listening and cooperation , the last of which_-isaia- singularly effective . On the other_hand , the Synod Fathers also noted the danger of ill considered gestures , signs of an '' impatient ecumenism '' which_can do harm to the journey being made towards full unity . For this_reason it -isaia- most important_that the correct principles of ecumenical dialogue be accepted and practised by all , and emphasized in the seminary training of candidates_for the sacred_ministry , in parishes and in other ecclesial structures . The inner life of the Church must offer a witness of unity in respect and a greater openness to the acceptance and growth of the great treasure represented by the different theological , spiritual , liturgical and disciplinary traditions . Missionary spirit in the episcopal ministry . As members of the Episcopal College , Bishops are consecrated not_just for a single Diocese but_for the salvation of all mankind . This teaching of the Second Vatican Council was recalled by the Synod Fathers in order to emphasize the fact_that each Bishop needs to be conscious of the missionary character of his pastoral_ministry . All his pastoral_activity should be marked by a missionary spirit capable of awakening and maintaining among the faithful a zeal for the spread of the Gospel . It -isaia-_the_duty of the Bishop to bring_about , promote and direct missionary activities and initiatives in his Diocese , including the provision of financial support . As was stated in the Synod Hall , it -isaia- no less important_for him to encourage the missionary dimension in his_own particular Church by promoting , in accordance_with different situations , fundamental values such as the acknowledgement of one s neighbour , respect_for cultural diversity and a healthy interaction between different_cultures . On the other_hand , the increasingly multicultural character of cities and societies , especially as a result of international migration , -isaia- creating new situations which present a particular missionary challenge . During the Synod there_were also interventions which raised certain issues about the relationship_between Diocesan Bishops and missionary Religious Congregations , and which stressed the need_for deeper reflection in this_regard . At the same_time , there_was an acknowledgement of the wealth of experience which a particular Church can receive from Congregations of consecrated_life , as a means of keeping the missionary dimension alive among the faithful . In his zeal for mission , the Bishop should be seen as the servant and witness of hope . Mission -isaia- the sure index of our_faith in Christ and his_love for us : men_and_women of all times are thereby inspired to a new_life motivated by hope . In proclaiming the Risen Lord , Christians present_the One who inaugurates a new era of history and announce to the world_the good_news of a complete and universal salvation which contains in itself the pledge of a new world in which pain and injustice will_give way to joy and beauty . At the beginning of a new millennium marked by a clearer awareness of the universality of salvation and a realization that the Gospel daily needs to be proclaimed anew , the Synodal Assembly raised an appeal that_our commitment to mission should_not be lessened but_rather expanded , through ever_more profound missionary cooperation . CHAPTER SEVEN THE BISHOP BEFORE THE CHALLENGES OF THE PRESENT '' Be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world ! '' Jn : . In sacred Scripture the Church -isaia- compared to a flock '' which God himself foretold that he would shepherd , and whose sheep , even_though governed by human shepherds , are continuously led and nourished by Christ himself , the Good Shepherd and the Prince of Shepherds '' . Does not Jesus himself call his_disciples a pusillus grex and exhort them_not to fear but to have hope cf . Lk : ? Jesus often repeated this_exhortation to his_disciples : '' In the world you will_have fear ; but be of good cheer , I have overcome the world ! '' Jn : . As he was about to return to the Father , he washed the feet of the Apostles and said to them : '' Let not your hearts be troubled , '' and added : '' I -amos- the way . No one comes to the Father , but by me '' cf . On this '' way '' which_-isaia- Christ , the little flock , the Church , has set_out , and -isaia- led by him , the Good Shepherd , who , '' when he has brought out all his_own , goes before them , and the sheep follow_him , for they know his voice '' Jn : . In the image of Jesus Christ , and following in his footsteps , the Bishop also goes forth to proclaim him before the world as the Saviour of mankind , the Saviour of every man_and_woman . As a missionary of the Gospel , he acts in the name of the Church , which_-isaia- an expert in humanity and close to the men_and_women of our_time . Consequently , the Bishop , with the strength which_comes_from the radicalism of the Gospel , also_has the duty to unmask false conceptions of man , to defend values being threatened by ideological movements and to discern the truth . With the Apostle he can repeat : '' We toil and strive , because we have our_hope set on the living God , who_-isaia- the Saviour of all men , especially of those who_believe '' Tim : . The Bishop s activity should thus be marked by that parrhes\u00eda which_-isaia- the fruit of the working of the Spirit cf . Leaving behind his_very self in order to proclaim Jesus Christ , the Bishop takes up his_mission with confidence and courage , factus pontifex , becoming in truth a '' bridge '' which_leads to every man and women . With the burning love of a shepherd he goes out in search of the sheep , following in the footsteps of Jesus who says : '' I have other sheep that_are not of this fold ; I must bring them also and they_will hear my voice . So there shall be one flock , one shepherd '' Jn : . The Bishop , promoter of justice_and_peace . Within this missionary context , the Synod Fathers described the Bishop as a prophet of justice . The war of the powerful against the weak has , today more_than_ever before , created profound divisions between rich and poor . The poor are legion ! Within an unjust economic system marked by significant structural inequities , the situation of the marginalized -isaia- daily becoming worse . Today , in many parts_of_the_world , people_are starving , while in other places there_-isaia- opulence . It -isaia- above all the poor , the young and refugees who_are the victims of these dramatic cases of inequality . In addition , women in many places are demeaned in their_dignity as persons , victims of a hedonistic and materialistic culture . In the face of , and often in the midst of these situations of injustice which inevitably open the door to conflicts and death , the Bishop -isaia- the defender of human_rights , the rights of human_beings made in the image_and_likeness of God . He proclaims_the Church s moral teaching by defending life from conception to its natural end . He likewise proclaims_the Church s social_teaching , based on the Gospel , and he shows profound concern_for the defence of all who_are poor , raising his voice on behalf of the voiceless in order to defend their_rights . The Church s social teaching_-isaia- able to offer hope even in the worst of situations , because , if there_-isaia- no hope_for the poor , there_will be no hope_for anyone , not even_for the so called rich . The Bishops vigorously condemned terrorism and genocide , and raised their voice on behalf of those_who cry out because of injustice , those_who_are being persecuted and those_who_are unemployed , as well as children who are_being abused in various and increasingly serious ways . Like holy Church herself , which_-isaia- in the world_the sacrament of intimate_union with God and of the unity of the whole_human_race , the Bishop -isaia- the defender and the father of the poor , concerned for_justice and human_rights , and one_who brings hope . The words of the Synod Fathers , and my own , were explicit and forceful . '' During this Synod , we could_not close our_eyes to many_other collective tragedies . A drastic moral change -isaia- needed . Some endemic evils , when_they_are too long ignored , can produce despair in entire populations . How can we keep silent when confronted by the enduring drama of hunger and extreme poverty , in an age where humanity , more_than_ever , has the capacity_for a just sharing of resources ? We must_also express our solidarity with the flood of refugees and immigrants , who , because of war , political oppression or economic discrimination , are forced to flee their homeland in search of employment or in the hope of finding peace . The ravages of malaria , the spread of AIDS , illiteracy , the hopelessness of so many children and youth abandoned to life on the streets , the exploitation of women , pornography , intolerance and the unacceptable exploitation of religion for violent purposes , drug trafficking and the sale of arms : the list -isaia- not exhaustive ! Still , in the midst of all this distress , the humble take new heart . The Lord looks -atti_degli_apostoli- them and strengthens them . Because they rob the afflicted , and the needy sigh , now I will arise , says the Lord '' Ps : . The dramatic picture just painted can_only evoke an urgent appeal for peace and a commitment to building peace . The hotbeds of conflict inherited from the past century and from the whole past millennium continue to smoulder . Numerous local conflicts are creating profound wounds between different_cultures and nationalities . And how_can we fail to mention forms of religious fundamentalism , a constant enemy of dialogue and peace ? In many areas the world resembles a powder keg ready to explode and shower immense suffering upon the human_family . In this situation the Church continues to proclaim_the peace of Christ who in the Sermon on the Mount proclaimed blessed those_who_are peacemakers cf . Peace -isaia- everyone s responsibility , a responsibility which passes through the thousand little acts which_make up everyday life . It awaits its prophets and builders , who should be found especially in the ecclesial_communities of which_the Bishop -isaia- the pastor . Following the example of Jesus , who came to announce freedom to the oppressed and to proclaim a year of favour from the Lord cf . Lk : , the Bishop will be ever ready to show that , as the Church s social_teaching makes clear , Christian hope -isaia- deeply linked to zeal for the integral promotion of individuals and society . In the midst of tragically frequent situations of armed conflict , the Bishop , even as he exhorts people to assert their_rights , must_always remind them that Christians are obliged in all cases to reject vengeance and to be prepared to forgive and to love their enemies . There can be no justice without forgiveness . Hard as it may be to accept , for_any sensible person the matter seems obvious : true peace_-isaia- possible only through forgiveness . Interreligious dialogue , especially on behalf of world peace . As I have insisted on various occasions , dialogue_between the religions must be put -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of peace between peoples . The different religious traditions possess the resources needed to overcome divisions and to build reciprocal friendship and respect . The Synod appealed to Bishops to promote meetings with the representatives of the world s peoples , in order to reflect carefully on the conflicts and wars which_are tearing our_world apart , and to identify the paths which_can be taken towards a common commitment of justice , concord and peace . The Synod Fathers strongly emphasized the importance of interreligious dialogue for peace , and asked the Bishops to commit themselves to engage in this important activity in their_respective Dioceses . New paths to peace can be blazed by defending religious_freedom , which_the Second Vatican Council discussed in the Decree Dignitatis Humanae , and by working for the education of the younger generation and the proper use of the communications media . The horizons of interreligious dialogue , however , are surely wider , and so the Synod Fathers stated once_more that_such dialogue belongs to the new_evangelization , especially in these times when people belonging to different religions are increasingly living together in the same areas , in the same cities and their_daily workplaces . Interreligious dialogue thus has a place in the daily_life of many Christian families ; for this_reason too the Bishops , as teachers of the faith and shepherds of the People of God , must give it proper attention . When Christians live side by side with persons of other_religions , they_have a particular obligation to testify to the oneness and universality of the saving mystery of Jesus Christ and to the consequent necessity of the Church as the means of salvation for all humanity . '' This truth of faith does_not lessen the sincere respect which_the Church has for the religions of the world , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , it rules out , in a radical way , that mentality of indifferentism characterized by a religious relativism which_leads to the belief that_one religion_-isaia- as good as another '' . It -isaia- clear , then_,_that interreligious dialogue can_never be a substitute for the proclamation and propagation_of_the_faith , which constitute the primary goal of the Church s preaching , catechesis and mission . A frank and unambiguous affirmation that_human salvation depends on the redemption accomplished by Christ -isaia- not an obstacle to dialogue_with other_religions . In the context of our profession of Christian hope , it cannot be forgotten that_it_-isaia- precisely this hope which_-isaia- the basis of interreligious dialogue . As the conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate states : '' All nations are_one community and have one origin , because God caused the whole_human_race to dwell on the whole face of the earth . They also have one final end , God , whose providence , manifest goodness and plan of salvation extend to all , until the elect be gathered together in the holy city which_the glory of God will illuminate and where_the peoples will walk in his light '' . Civil , social_and_economic life . The pastoral_activity of the Bishop cannot_fail to manifest particular concern_for the demands of love and justice arising from the social_and_economic situation of the poor , the abandoned and the mistreated . In every poor person believers see a special image of Jesus . Their presence within_the ecclesial and civil communities -isaia- a litmus test of the authenticity of our Christian faith . I would also like to mention briefly the complex phenomenon of globalization , which_-isaia- one of the features of our_world today . Certainly there exists a '' globalization '' of the economy , finances and culture which_-isaia- expanding as a result of the rapid progress of information technology . As I have observed on other occasions , this phenomenon calls for careful discernment in order to identify its positive and negative aspects and their consequences for the Church and the whole_human_race . Bishops can_make an important contribution to this discernment by insisting on the urgent_need for a globalization in charity , without marginalization . In this_regard , the Synod Fathers spoke of the duty of promoting a '' globalization of charity '' and considered issues associated_with the cancellation of foreign debt , which compromises the economies of entire peoples , holding back their social and political progress . Without entering into the details of this serious problem , I would only repeat several fundamental points already indicated elsewhere . The Church s vision in this area has three essential and concomitant points of reference : the dignity_of_the_human_person , solidarity and subsidiarity . It follows_that '' the globalized economy must be analyzed in the light of the principles of social_justice , respecting the preferential option for the poor who must be allowed to take their place in such an economy , and the requirements of the international common_good '' . When globalization -isaia- joined to the dynamism of solidarity , it -isaia-_no_longer a source of marginalization . Indeed , the globalization of solidarity -isaia- a direct consequence of that universal charity_which -isaia- the heart of the Gospel . Respect for the environment and the protection of creation . The Synod Fathers also addressed the ethical dimension of the ecological question . In the deepest sense , a call_for the globalization of solidarity also involves the urgent question of the protection of creation and the earth s resources . The '' crying out of all creation '' spoken of by the Apostle cf . Rom : seems today to occur in a reversal of perspectives , since it -isaia-_no_longer a matter of an eschatological tension which awaits the revelation of the sons of God cf . Rom : , but_rather of a paroxysm of death which strives to grip humanity itself in order to destroy it . Here in fact we encounter the ecological question in its most insidious and perverse form . In effect , '' the most profound and serious indication of the moral implications underlying the ecological problem -isaia- the lack of respect_for life evident in many of the patterns of environmental pollution . Often , the interests of production prevail over the dignity of workers , while economic interests take priority over the good of individuals and even entire peoples . In these cases , pollution or environmental destruction -isaia- the result of an unnatural and reductive vision which -atti_degli_apostoli- times leads to a genuine contempt for_man '' . Clearly , what_-isaia- called_for -isaia- not_simply a physical ecology , concerned_with protecting the habitat of the various living beings , but a human ecology , capable of protecting the radical good of life in all its manifestations and of leaving behind for future generations an environment which conforms as closely as possible to the Creator s plan . There -isaia-_a_need for an ecological conversion , to which Bishops themselves can contribute by their teaching about the correct relationship of human_beings with nature . Seen in the light of the doctrine of God the Father , the maker of heaven and earth , this relationship -isaia- one of '' stewardship : '' human_beings are set -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of creation as stewards of the Creator . The Bishop s ministry in the field of health . Human concern leads the Bishop to imitate Jesus , the true '' Good Samaritan '' , filled_with compassion and mercy , who cares for others without discrimination . Health care represents one of the outstanding challenges of the present_time . Tragically , many forms of sickness still persist in different parts_of_the_world , and although science -isaia- making tremendous strides in the search_for new solutions and better treatments , there_are always new situations which pose a threat to physical and mental health . Within his_own Diocese each Bishop , with the help of qualified persons , -isaia- called to work_for an integral proclamation of the '' Gospel of life '' . When Christians try to humanize medicine and the care of the sick by showing personal concern and closeness to the suffering , they become for everyone a powerful image of Jesus himself , the healer of bodies and souls . Among the instructions which he gave to his Apostles , the Lord included an exhortation to heal the sick cf . The organization and promotion of adequate pastoral_care for health_care workers should thus be a priority close to the heart of every Bishop . In a special_way , the Synod Fathers felt the need to give forceful expression to their concern_for the promotion of an authentic '' culture of life '' in contemporary society : '' Perhaps what most upsets us as pastors -isaia- the contempt for human_life , from conception to death , as well as the breakdown of the family . The Church s No to abortion and euthanasia -isaia- a Yes to life , a Yes to the fundamental goodness of creation , a Yes which_can move every_person in the depths of his conscience , a Yes to the family , the most basic community of hope , which so pleases God that he calls it to become a domestic Church '' . The Bishop s pastoral_care of migrants . The movement of peoples has assumed unprecedented proportions in our_day and takes the form of mass movements involving an enormous number of persons . Many of them have fled their countries or been forced to leave them as a result of armed conflicts , unstable economic conditions , political , ethnic and social conflicts , and natural disasters . Despite their differences , all these migrations pose serious questions to our communities about pastoral issues such as evangelization and interreligious dialogue . Dioceses should make suitable provision for the establishment of pastoral structures capable of receiving these persons and providing them_with appropriate pastoral_care adapted to their different situations . There -isaia-_also a need_for greater cooperation between neighbouring Dioceses in offering efficient and competent services and in training priests and lay workers who_are particularly generous and open to this demanding work , above all when it involves legal problems associated_with enabling these persons to fit into a new social structure . In this_context , the Synod Fathers from the Eastern Catholic Churches once_again raised the issue , in some ways new and fraught with serious practical consequences , of the emigration of members of their communities . It -isaia-_now a fact_that a significant number of the faithful of the Eastern Catholic Churches reside habitually and stably outside their countries of origin and the Sees of the Eastern Hierarchies . Understandably , this_-isaia- an issue which presents daily challenges to the pastoral responsibility of the latter . The Synod of Bishops consequently called_for a deeper study of the ways in which_the Catholic Churches of both East and West can establish suitable pastoral structures to meet_the needs of members of the faithful living in a state of '' diaspora '' . In any case , it remains the duty of the local Bishops , their differing rites notwithstanding , to act as true fathers to these faithful of the Eastern Rite , and to ensure that_they_are given pastoral_care which respects the specific religious and cultural values_which they received -atti_degli_apostoli- birth and in their earliest Christian formation . These are only some of the situations which present an especially urgent challenge to Christian witness and to the ministry of Bishops . Accepting responsibility_for the world , its problems , its challenges and its hopes -isaia-_part of our commitment to proclaiming the Gospel of hope . What -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- always the future of man , as a '' being of hope '' . It -isaia- understandable that all these new challenges to hope can lead to a temptation to scepticism and loss of confidence . But Christians are capable of facing even the most troubling situations , for the basis of their hope -isaia- found in the mystery of the Lord s Cross and Resurrection . This alone -isaia-_the_source from which_they draw the strength to take heart and persevere in the service of God , who wills the salvation and integral liberation of all humanity . The sheer human complexity of the settings in which_the Gospel must be proclaimed today brings spontaneously to mind the Gospel account of the multiplication of the loaves . The disciples are worried about the crowds who , hungering for Jesus word , have followed him even into the desert . They bring their worries before Jesus and they tell him : '' Dimitte turbas . Send the crowd away . Perhaps they_were afraid , genuinely not knowing how to satisfy the hunger of so many_people . Our own hearts might be similarly troubled by the enormity of the problems confronting the Churches and ourselves personally as Bishops . In that case , we should respond with a new creativity in charity_which -isaia- shown not_only in more efficient forms of charitable assistance , but even_more in an ability to be close to those in need and to make_the poor feel that_every Christian community -isaia- truly their home . Jesus , however , has his_own way of solving our problems . As if to challenge the Apostles , he tells them : '' Why do you not give_them something to eat yourselves ? '' Lk : . We know_how the story ended : '' All ate and were satisfied . And they took up what_was left over , twelve baskets of broken pieces '' Lk : . That residual abundance -isaia- still present today in the life of the Church ! The Bishops of the third_millennium are_called to do what_was done by so many saintly Bishops throughout history , up to our own_time . Like Saint Basil , for example , who even built -atti_degli_apostoli- the gates of Caesarea a large hospice for those in need , a true citadel of charity , which_was called after him the Basiliad : this clearly demonstrates that '' the charity of works ensures an unmistakable efficacy to the charity of words '' . This -isaia- the path that we too must walk : the Good Shepherd has_entrusted his flock to each Bishop to feed it with his_word and to form it by his example . Where then will we Bishops get the '' bread '' needed to respond to the many requests which come to us from within and without_the Churches and the Church ? We could easily complain , as the Apostles did to Jesus : '' Where are we to get bread enough in the desert to feed so great a crowd ? '' Mt : . Where can we find the resources we need ? We can -atti_degli_apostoli- least point to a few fundamental answers . Our first , transcendent resource -isaia- the love of God poured out in our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us cf . The love with_which God has loved us -isaia- so great that it can always sustain us in finding the right ways to touch the hearts of men_and_women today . At every moment the Lord gives us , by the power of his Spirit , an ability to love and to find the best and most beautiful ways to express that_love . We are_called to be servants of the Gospel for the hope of the world , yet we know_that this hope does_not come from us , but_from the Holy Spirit , who '' does not_cease to be the guardian of hope in the human_heart : the hope of all human creatures , and especially of those_who_have the first fruits of the Spirit and wait for the redemption of their bodies '' . Our second resource -isaia- the Church , whose members we have_become through Baptism , together_with countless other brothers_and_sisters with whom we confess one heavenly Father and drink of the one Spirit of holiness . The present situation urges us to make_the Church '' the home and the school of communion , '' if we truly wish to respond to the expectations of the world . Our communion in the body of Bishops , of which we became members by our consecration , -isaia- itself a remarkable resource , since it provides us with valuable support in our efforts to read carefully the sign of the times and to discern clearly what_the Spirit -isaia- saying to the Churches . At the heart of the College of Bishops there_-isaia- the support and the solidarity of the Successor of the Apostle Peter , whose supreme and universal power does_not destroy but_rather affirms , strengthens and vindicates the power of the Bishops , the successors of the Apostles . Here we will need to make_the most of the means of building communion_which are to be found in the great directives of the Second Vatican Council . Certainly there_are circumstances \u2013 and today they_are_not rare \u2013 in which an individual Church or a number of neighbouring Churches find it difficult or practically impossible to provide an adequate response to major problems . It -isaia- above all in these cases that recourse to the means of building episcopal communion can provide genuine help . A final , immediate recourse for a Bishop in search of '' bread '' to satisfy the hunger of his brothers_and_sisters -isaia-_his own particular Church , when_the spirituality of communion has_taken root as an educative principle '' wherever individuals and Christians are formed , wherever ministers of the altar , consecrated_persons and pastoral workers are trained , wherever families and communities are built up '' . It -isaia- here that we see once_more the connection_between the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the three General Assemblies which immediately preceded it . For a Bishop -isaia- never alone : he -isaia- not alone in the universal Church and he -isaia- not alone in his particular Church . The duty of Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of a new millennium -isaia- thus clearly marked out . It -isaia-_the_same duty as ever : to proclaim_the Gospel of Christ , the salvation of the world . But it -isaia- a duty which_has a new urgency and which calls for cooperation and commitment on the part of the whole People of God . The Bishop needs to be able to count on the members of his diocesan presbyterate and on his deacons , the ministers of the Blood of Christ and of charity ; he needs to be able to count on his consecrated sisters and brothers , called to be for the Church and the world eloquent witnesses of the primacy of God in the Christian life and the power of his_love amid the frailty of the human condition ; and he needs to be able to count on the lay_faithful , whose greater scope for the apostolate represents for their pastors a source of particular support and a reason_for special comfort . At the conclusion of these reflections , we apppreciate how the theme of the Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops leads each of us Bishops back to all our_brothers_and_sisters in the Church and to all the men_and_women of the world . Christ sends us to them , even as he once he sent the Apostles cf . We need to become , for each_and_every person , in an outstanding and visible way , a living sign of Jesus Christ , Teacher , Priest and Pastor . Venerable Brothers in the Episcopate , Jesus Christ -isaia- the icon to which we look as we carry_out our ministry as heralds of hope . Like him , we must be ready to offer our_own lives for the salvation of those entrusted to our care , as we proclaim and celebrate the triumph of God s merciful love over sin and death . Let us implore for this_great undertaking the intercession of the Virgin Mary , Mother of the Church and Queen of the Apostles . May she , who in the Upper Room supported the prayers of the Apostolic College , obtain for us the grace never to fail in the task of love_which Christ has_entrusted to us . As a witness to true life , Mary '' shines_forth for the pilgrim people of God '' \u2013 and in a particular_way for us , their pastors \u2013 '' as a sign of sure hope and comfort , until the day of the Lord arrives '' .

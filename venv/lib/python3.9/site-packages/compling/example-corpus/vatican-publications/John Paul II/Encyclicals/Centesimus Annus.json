INTRODUCTION . The Centenary of the promulgation of the Encyclical which begins with the words '' Rerum novarum '' , by my predecessor of venerable memory Pope Leo XIII , -isaia- an occasion of great_importance for the present history of the Church and for my own Pontificate . It -isaia- an Encyclical that_has the distinction of having_been commemorated by solemn Papal documents from its fortieth anniversary to its ninetieth . It may be said_that its path through history has_been marked by other documents which paid tribute to it and applied it to the circumstances of the day . In doing likewise for the hundredth anniversary , in response to requests from many Bishops , Church institutions , and study centres , as well as business leaders and workers , both individually and as members of associations , I wish first_and_foremost to satisfy the debt of gratitude which_the whole Church owes to this_great Pope and his '' immortal document '' . I also mean to show that the vital energies rising from that root have_not been spent with the passing of the years , but_rather have increased even_more . This -isaia- evident from the various initiatives which_have preceded , and which_are to accompany and follow_the celebration , initiatives promoted by Episcopal Conferences , by international agencies , universities and academic institutes , by professional associations and by other institutions and individuals in many parts_of_the_world . The present Encyclical -isaia-_part of these celebrations , which_are meant to thank God the origin of '' every good endowment and every perfect gift '' Jas : for having used a document published a century ago by the See of Peter to achieve so much good and to radiate so much light in the Church and in the world . Although the commemoration -atti_degli_apostoli- hand -isaia- meant to honour Rerum novarum , it also honours those Encyclicals and other documents of my Predecessors which_have helped to make Pope Leo s Encyclical present and alive in history , thus constituting what would come to be called the Church s '' social_doctrine '' , '' social_teaching '' or even '' social magisterium '' . The validity of this_teaching has_already_been pointed_out in two Encyclicals published during my Pontificate : Laborem exercens on human_work , and Sollicitudo rei_socialis on current problems regarding the development of individuals and peoples . I now wish to propose a '' re reading '' of Pope Leo s Encyclical by issuing an invitation to '' look back '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the text itself in order to discover anew the richness of the fundamental principles_which it formulated for dealing_with the question of the condition of workers . But this -isaia-_also an invitation to '' look around '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the '' new things '' which surround us and in which we find ourselves caught up , very different from the '' new things '' which characterized the final decade of the last century . Finally , it -isaia- an invitation to '' look to the future '' -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when we can already glimpse the third Millennium of the Christian era , so filled_with uncertainties but also_with promises uncertainties and promises which appeal to our imagination and creativity , and which reawaken our responsibility , as disciples of the '' one teacher '' cf . Mt : , to show the way , to proclaim_the truth and to communicate the life which_-isaia- Christ cf . A re reading of this_kind will not_only confirm the permanent value of such teaching , but will_also manifest the true meaning of the Church s Tradition which , being ever living and vital , builds upon the foundation laid by our fathers in the faith , and particularly upon what '' the Apostles passed down to the Church '' in the name of Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- her irreplaceable foundation cf . It was out of an awareness of his_mission as the Successor of Peter that Pope Leo XIII proposed to speak out , and Peter s Successor today -isaia- moved by that_same awareness . Like Pope Leo and the Popes before and after him , I take my inspiration from the Gospel image of '' the scribe who has_been trained for the kingdom_of_heaven '' , whom_the Lord compares to '' a householder who brings out of his treasure what_-isaia- new and what_-isaia- old '' Mt : . The treasure -isaia- the great outpouring of the Church s Tradition , which contains '' what_-isaia- old '' received and passed on from the very_beginning and which enables us to interpret the '' new things '' in the midst of which_the life of the Church and the world unfolds . Among the things_which become '' old '' as a result of being incorporated into Tradition , and which offer opportunities and material for enriching both Tradition and the life of faith , there_-isaia- the fruitful activity of many millions of people , who , spurred on by the social Magisterium , have sought to make that teaching the inspiration for their involvement in the world . Acting either as individuals or joined together in various groups , associations and organizations , these_people represent a great movement for the defence of the human_person and the safeguarding of human_dignity . Amid changing historical circumstances , this movement has contributed to the building up of a more just society or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to the curbing of injustice . The present Encyclical seeks to show the fruitfulness of the principles enunciated by Leo XIII , which belong to the Church s doctrinal patrimony and , as such , involve the exercise of her teaching_authority . But pastoral solicitude also prompts me to propose an analysis of some events of recent history . It goes without saying that part of the responsibility of Pastors -isaia- to give careful consideration to current events in order to discern the new requirements of evangelization . However , such an analysis -isaia- not meant to pass definitive judgments since this_does_not fall per se within_the Magisterium s specific domain . CHARACTERISTICS OF '' RERUM NOVARUM '' . Towards the end of the last century the Church found herself facing an historical process which_had already_been taking place_for some time , but_which was by then reaching a critical point . The determining factor in this_process was a combination of radical changes which_had taken_place in the political , economic_and_social fields , and in the areas of science and technology , to say nothing of the wide influence of the prevailing ideologies . In the sphere of politics , the result of these changes was a new conception of society and of the State , and consequently of authority itself . A traditional society was passing away and another was beginning to be formed one_which brought the hope of new freedoms but_also the threat of new_forms of injustice and servitude . In the sphere of economics , in which scientific discoveries and their practical application come together , new structures for the production of consumer goods had progressively taken shape . A new form of property had appeared capital ; and a new form of labour labour for wages , characterized by high rates of production which lacked due regard_for sex , age or family situation , and were determined solely by efficiency , with_a_view to increasing profits . In this_way labour became a commodity to be freely bought and sold on the market , its price determined by the law of supply and demand , without taking into_account_the bare minimum required_for the support of the individual and his family . Moreover , the worker was not_even sure of being able to sell '' his_own commodity '' , continually threatened as he was by unemployment , which , in the absence of any_kind of social security , meant the spectre of death by starvation . The result of this transformation was a society '' divided into two classes , separated by a deep chasm '' . This situation was linked to the marked change taking place in the political order already mentioned . Thus the prevailing political theory of the time sought to promote total economic freedom by appropriate laws , or , conversely , by a deliberate lack of any intervention . At the same_time , another conception of property and economic_life was beginning to appear in an organized and often violent form , one_which implied a new political and social structure . At the height of this clash , when people finally began to realize fully the very grave injustice of social realities in many places and the danger of a revolution fanned by ideals which_were then called '' socialist '' , Pope Leo XIII intervened with a document which dealt in a systematic way with the '' condition of the workers '' . The Encyclical had_been preceded by others devoted to teachings of a political character ; still others would appear later . Here , particular mention must be made of the Encyclical Libertas praestantissimum , which called attention to the essential bond_between human_freedom and truth , so that freedom which refused to be bound to the truth would fall_into arbitrariness and end up submitting itself to the vilest of passions , to the point of self destruction . Indeed , what_-isaia- the origin of all the evils to which Rerum novarum wished to respond , if not a kind of freedom which , in the area of economic_and_social activity , cuts itself off from the truth_about man ? The Pope also drew inspiration from the teaching of his Predecessors , as well as from the many documents issued by Bishops , from scientific studies promoted by members of the laity , from the work of Catholic movements and associations , and from the Church s practical achievements in the social field during the second half of the nineteenth century . The '' new things '' to which_the Pope devoted his attention were anything but positive . The first paragraph of the Encyclical describes in strong terms the '' new things '' rerum_novarum which gave it its name : '' That the spirit of revolutionary change which_has long been disturbing the nations of the world should_have passed beyond_the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the related sphere of practical economics -isaia- not surprising . Progress in industry , the development of new trades , the changing relationship_between employers and workers , the enormous wealth of a few as opposed to the poverty of the many , the increasing self reliance of the workers and their closer association with each_other , as well as a notable decline in morality : all these elements have led to the conflict now taking place '' . The Pope and the Church with_him were confronted , as was_the civil community , by a society_which was torn by a conflict all the more harsh and inhumane because it knew no rule or regulation . It was_the conflict between capital and labour , or as the Encyclical puts it the worker question . It -isaia- precisely about_this conflict , in the very pointed terms in which it then appeared , that the Pope did not_hesitate to speak . Here we find the first reflection for our_times as suggested by the Encyclical . In the face of a conflict which set man against man , almost as if they_were '' wolves '' , a conflict between_the extremes of mere physical survival on the one side and opulence on the other , the Pope did not_hesitate to intervene by virtue of his '' apostolic_office '' , that_-isaia- , on the basis of the mission received_from Jesus Christ himself to '' feed his lambs and tend his sheep '' cf . Jn : , and to '' bind and loose '' on earth for the Kingdom of Heaven cf . The Pope s intention was certainly to restore peace , and the present_day reader cannot_fail to note his severe condemnation , in no uncertain terms , of the class struggle . However , the Pope was very much aware_that peace_-isaia- built on the foundation of justice : what_was essential to the Encyclical was precisely its proclamation of the fundamental conditions for_justice in the economic_and_social situation of the time . In this_way , Pope Leo XIII , in the footsteps of his Predecessors , created a lasting paradigm for the Church . The Church , in fact , has something to say about specific human situations , both individual and communal , national and international . She formulates a genuine doctrine for these situations , a corpus which enables her to analyze social realities , to make judgments about them and to indicate directions to be taken for the just resolution of the problems involved . In Pope Leo XIII s time such a concept of the Church s right and duty was far_from_being commonly admitted . Indeed , a two fold approach prevailed : one directed to this_world and this_life , to which faith ought to remain extraneous ; the other directed towards a purely other worldly salvation , which neither enlightens nor directs existence on earth . The Pope s approach in publishing Rerum novarum gave the Church '' citizenship status '' as it were , amid the changing realities of public_life , and this standing would be more_fully confirmed later on . In effect , to teach and to spread her social_doctrine pertains to the Church s evangelizing mission and -isaia- an essential part of the Christian message , since this_doctrine points_out the direct consequences of that message in the life of society and situates daily work and struggles for_justice in the context of bearing_witness to Christ the Saviour . This doctrine -isaia- likewise a source of unity and peace in dealing_with the conflicts which inevitably arise in social_and_economic life . Thus it -isaia- possible to meet these new situations without degrading the human_person s transcendent dignity , either in oneself or in one s adversaries , and to direct those situations towards just solutions . Today , -atti_degli_apostoli- a distance of a hundred years , the validity of this approach affords me the opportunity to contribute to the development of Christian social_doctrine . The '' new_evangelization '' , which_the modern_world urgently needs and which I have emphasized many times , must include among its essential elements a proclamation of the Church s social_doctrine . As in the days of Pope Leo XIII , this_doctrine -isaia- still suitable for indicating the right way to respond to the great challenges of today , when ideologies are_being increasingly discredited . Now , as then , we need to repeat that_there can be no genuine solution of the '' social_question '' apart_from the Gospel , and that the '' new things '' can_find in the Gospel the context for their correct understanding and the proper moral perspective for judgment on them . With the intention of shedding light on the conflict which_had arisen between capital and labour , Pope Leo XIII affirmed the fundamental rights of workers . Indeed , the key to reading the Encyclical -isaia- the dignity of the worker as such , and , for the same reason , the dignity of work , which_-isaia- defined as follows : '' to exert oneself for the sake of procuring what_-isaia- necessary_for the various purposes of life , and first of all for self preservation '' . The Pope describes work as '' personal , inasmuch as the energy expended -isaia- bound up with the personality and -isaia- the exclusive property of him_who acts , and , furthermore , was_given to him for his advantage '' . Work thus belongs to the vocation of every_person ; indeed , man expresses and fulfils himself by working . At the same_time , work has a '' social '' dimension through its intimate relationship not_only to the family , but_also to the common_good , since '' it may truly be said that_it_-isaia- only by the labour of working men that States grow rich '' . These are themes that I have_taken up and developed in my Encyclical Laborem exercens . Another important principle -isaia- undoubtedly that of the right to '' private_property '' . The amount of space devoted to this_subject in the Encyclical shows the importance attached to it . The Pope -isaia- well aware_that private_property -isaia- not an absolute value , nor_does he fail to proclaim_the necessary complementary principles , such as the universal destination of the earth s goods . On the other_hand , it -isaia- certainly true_that the type of private_property which Leo XIII mainly considers -isaia- land ownership . But this does_not_mean that the reasons adduced to safeguard private_property or to affirm the right to possess the things necessary_for one s personal development and the development of one s family , whatever the concrete form which that right may assume , are_not still valid today . This -isaia- something which_must be affirmed once_more in the face of the changes we are witnessing in systems formerly dominated by collective ownership of the means_of_production , as well as in the face of the increasing instances of poverty or , more precisely , of hindrances to private ownership in many parts_of_the_world , including those where systems predominate which_are based on an affirmation of the right to private_property . As a result of these changes and of the persistence of poverty , a deeper analysis of the problem -isaia- called_for , an analysis which_will be developed later in this document . In close connection_with the right to private_property , Pope Leo XIII s Encyclical also affirms other rights as inalienable and proper to the human_person . Prominent among_these , because of the space which_the Pope devotes to it and the importance which he attaches to it , -isaia- the '' natural human right '' to form private associations . This means above all the right to establish professional associations of employers and workers , or of workers alone . Here we find the reason_for the Church s defence and approval of the establishment of what_are commonly called trade unions : certainly not because of ideological prejudices or in order to surrender to a class mentality , but because the right of association -isaia- a natural right of the human_being , which therefore precedes his or her incorporation into political society . Indeed , the formation of unions '' cannot . be prohibited by the State '' , because '' the State -isaia- bound to protect natural rights , not to destroy them ; and if it forbids its citizens to form associations , it contradicts the very principle of its_own existence '' . Together with this right , which it must be stressed the Pope explicitly acknowledges as belonging to workers , or , using his_own language , to '' the working class '' , the Encyclical affirms just as clearly_the right to the '' limitation of working hours '' , the right to legitimate rest and the right of children and women to be treated differently with_regard to the type and duration of work . If we keep in mind what history tells us about the practices permitted or -atti_degli_apostoli- least not excluded by law regarding the way_in_which workers were employed , without_any guarantees as to working hours or the hygienic conditions of the work place , or even regarding the age and sex of apprentices , we can appreciate the Pope s severe statement : '' It -isaia- neither just nor human so to grind men down with excessive labour as to stupefy their_minds and wear out_their bodies '' . And referring to the '' contract '' aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- putting into_effect '' labour relations '' of this_sort , he affirms with_greater precision , that '' in all agreements between employers and workers there_-isaia- always the condition expressed or understood '' that proper rest be allowed , proportionate to '' the wear and tear of one s strength '' . He then concludes : '' To agree in any_other sense would be against what_-isaia- right and just '' . The Pope immediately adds another right which_the worker has as a person . This -isaia- the right to a '' just wage '' , which_cannot be left to the '' free consent of the parties , so that the employer , having paid what_was agreed upon , has done his part and seemingly -isaia- not called_upon to do anything beyond '' . It was said -atti_degli_apostoli- the time that the State does_not have_the power to intervene in the terms of these contracts , except to ensure the fulfilment of what had_been explicitly agreed upon . This concept of relations_between employers and employees , purely pragmatic and inspired by a thorough going individualism , -isaia- severely censured in the Encyclical as contrary to the twofold nature of work as a personal and necessary reality . For if work as something personal belongs to the sphere of the individual s free use of his_own abilities and energy , as something necessary it -isaia- governed by the grave obligation of every_individual to ensure '' the preservation of life '' . '' It necessarily follows '' , the Pope concludes , '' that every_individual has a natural right to procure what_-isaia- required to live ; and the poor can procure that in no other way than by what_they can earn through_their work '' . A workman s wages should be sufficient to enable him to support himself , his wife and his_children . '' If through necessity or fear of a worse evil the workman accepts harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford no better , he -isaia- made the victim of force and injustice '' . Would that these_words , written -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when what_has_been called '' unbridled capitalism '' was pressing forward , should_not have to be repeated today with the same severity . Unfortunately , even today one finds instances of contracts between employers and employees which lack reference to the most elementary justice regarding the employment of children or women , working hours , the hygienic condition of the work place and fair pay ; and this_-isaia- the case despite the International Declarations and Conventions on the subject and the internal laws of States . The Pope attributed to the '' public_authority '' the '' strict duty '' of providing properly for the welfare of the workers , because a failure to do so violates justice ; indeed , he did not_hesitate to speak of '' distributive justice '' . To these rights Pope Leo XIII adds another right regarding the condition of the working class , one_which I wish to mention because of its importance : namely , the right to discharge freely one s religious duties . The Pope wished to proclaim this right within_the context of the other rights_and_duties of workers , notwithstanding the general opinion , even in his day , that_such questions pertained exclusively to an individual s private life . He affirms the need_for Sunday rest so that people may turn their thoughts to heavenly things and to the worship which_they owe to Almighty God . No one_can take away this human right , which_-isaia- based on a commandment ; in the words of the Pope : '' no man may with impunity violate that human_dignity which God himself treats with_great reverence '' , and consequently , the State must guarantee to the worker the exercise of this freedom . It would_not be mistaken to see in this clear statement a springboard for the principle of the right to religious_freedom , which_was to become the subject of many solemn International Declarations and Conventions , as well as of the Second Vatican Council s well_known Declaration and of my own repeated teaching . In this_regard , one may ask whether existing laws and the practice of industrialized societies effectively ensure in our_own day the exercise of this basic right to Sunday rest . Another important aspect , which_has many applications to our_own day , -isaia- the concept of the relationship_between_the State and its citizens . Rerum novarum criticizes two social_and_economic systems : socialism and liberalism . The opening section , in which_the right to private_property -isaia- reaffirmed , -isaia- devoted to socialism . Liberalism -isaia- not the subject of a special section , but_it_-isaia- worth noting that criticisms of it are raised in the treatment of the duties of the State . The State cannot limit itself to '' favouring one portion of the citizens '' , namely the rich and prosperous , nor_can it '' neglect the other '' , which clearly represents the majority of society . Otherwise , there_would be a violation of that law of justice which ordains that every_person should receive his due . '' When there_-isaia- question of defending the rights of individuals , the defenceless and the poor have a claim to special consideration . The richer class has many_ways of shielding itself , and stands less in need of help from the State ; whereas the mass of the poor have no resources of their_own to fall back on , and must chiefly depend on the assistance of the State . It -isaia- for_this reason_that wage earners , since_they mostly belong to the latter class , should be specially cared for and protected by the Government '' . These passages are relevant today , especially in the face of the new_forms of poverty in the world , and also because_they_are affirmations which do not depend on a specific notion of the State or on a particular political theory . Leo XIII -isaia- repeating an elementary principle of sound political organization , namely , the more that individuals are defenceless within a given society , the more they require the care and concern of others , and in particular the intervention of governmental authority . In this_way what we nowadays call the principle of solidarity , the validity of which both in the internal order of each nation and in the international order I have discussed in the Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis , -isaia- clearly seen to be one of the fundamental principles of the Christian view of social and political organization . This principle -isaia- frequently stated by Pope Leo XIII , who uses the term '' friendship '' , a concept already found in Greek philosophy . Pope Pius XI refers to it with the equally meaningful term '' social charity '' . Pope Paul VI , expanding the concept to cover the many modern aspects of the social_question , speaks of a '' civilization of love '' . Re reading the Encyclical in the light of contemporary realities enables us to appreciate the Church s constant concern_for and dedication to categories of people_who_are especially beloved to the Lord Jesus . The content of the text -isaia- an excellent testimony to the continuity within_the Church of the so called '' preferential option for the poor '' , an option which I defined as a '' special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity '' . Pope Leo s Encyclical on the '' condition of the workers '' -isaia- thus an Encyclical on the poor and on the terrible conditions to which_the new and often violent process of industrialization had reduced great multitudes of people . Today , in many parts_of_the_world , similar processes of economic , social and political transformation are creating the same evils . If Pope Leo XIII calls upon the State to remedy the condition of the poor in accordance_with justice , he does so because of his timely awareness_that the State has the duty of watching over the common_good and of ensuring that_every sector of social_life , not excluding the economic one , contributes to achieving that good , while respecting the rightful autonomy of each sector . This should_not however lead us to think_that Pope Leo expected the State to solve every social problem . On the contrary , he frequently insists on necessary limits to the State s intervention and on its instrumental character , inasmuch as the individual , the family and society are prior to the State , and inasmuch as the State exists in order to protect their_rights and not stifle them . The relevance of these reflections for our_own day -isaia- inescapable . It will be useful to return later to this important subject of the limits inherent in the nature of the state . For now , the points which_have_been emphasized certainly not the only ones in the Encyclical are situated in continuity with the Church s social_teaching , and in the light of a sound view of private_property , work , the economic process , the reality of the State and , above all , of man_himself . Other themes will be mentioned later when we examine certain aspects of the contemporary situation . From this_point forward it will be necessary to keep in mind_that the main thread and , in a certain_sense , the guiding principle of Pope Leo s Encyclical , and of all of the Church s social_doctrine , -isaia- a correct view of the human_person and of his unique value , inasmuch as '' man . -isaia-_the_only creature on earth which God willed for itself '' . God has imprinted his_own image_and_likeness on man cf . Gen : , conferring upon him an incomparable dignity , as the Encyclical frequently insists . In effect , beyond_the rights which_man acquires by his_own work , there exist rights which do not correspond to any work he performs , but_which flow from his essential dignity as a person . TOWARDS THE '' NEW THINGS '' OF TODAY . The commemoration of Rerum novarum would be incomplete unless reference were also made to the situation of the world today . The document lends itself to such a reference , because the historical picture and the prognosis which it suggests have proved to be surprisingly accurate in the light of what_has happened since then . This -isaia-_especially confirmed by the events which took_place near the end of and -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of . These events , and the radical transformations which followed , can_only be explained by the preceding situations which , to a certain extent , crystallized or institutionalized Leo XIII s predictions and the increasingly disturbing signs noted by his Successors . Pope Leo foresaw the negative consequences political , social_and_economic of the social_order proposed by '' socialism '' , which -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time was still only a social philosophy and not_yet a fully structured movement . It may seem surprising that '' socialism '' appeared -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Pope s critique of solutions to the '' question of the working class '' -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when '' socialism '' was not_yet in the form of a strong and powerful State , with all the resources which that implies , as was later to happen . However , he correctly judged the danger posed to the masses by the attractive presentation of this simple and radical solution to the '' question of the working class '' of the time all the more so when one considers the terrible situation of injustice in which_the working classes of the recently industrialized nations found themselves . Two things must be emphasized here : first , the great clarity in perceiving , in all its harshness , the actual condition of the working class men , women and children ; secondly , equal clarity in recognizing the evil of a solution which , by appearing to reverse the positions of the poor and the rich , was in reality detrimental to the very people whom it was meant to help . The remedy would prove worse than the sickness . By defining the nature of the socialism of his day as the suppression of private_property , Leo XIII arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- the crux of the problem . His words deserve to be re read attentively : '' To remedy these wrongs the unjust distribution of wealth and the poverty of the workers , the Socialists encourage the poor man s envy of the rich and strive to do away with private_property , contending that individual possessions should become the common property of all . ; but their contentions are so clearly powerless to end the controversy that , were they carried into_effect , the working man_himself would be among the first to suffer . They are moreover emphatically unjust , for they_would rob the lawful possessor , distort the functions of the State , and create utter confusion in the community '' . The evils caused by the setting up of this type of socialism as a State system what would later be called '' Real Socialism '' could_not be better expressed . Continuing our reflections , and referring also to what_has_been said in the Encyclicals Laborem exercens and Sollicitudo rei_socialis , we have to add that the fundamental error of socialism -isaia- anthropological in nature . Socialism considers the individual person simply as an element , a molecule within_the social organism , so that the good of the individual -isaia- completely subordinated to the functioning of the socio economic mechanism . Socialism likewise maintains that the good of the individual can be realized without reference to his free choice , to the unique and exclusive responsibility which he exercises in the face of good or evil . Man -isaia- thus reduced to a series of social relationships , and the concept of the person as the autonomous subject of moral decision disappears , the very subject whose decisions build the social_order . From this mistaken conception of the person there arise both a distortion of law , which defines the sphere of the exercise of freedom , and an opposition to private_property . A person who_-isaia- deprived of something he can call '' his_own '' , and of the possibility of earning a living through_his own initiative , comes to depend on the social machine and on those_who control it . This makes it much_more difficult for him to recognize his dignity as a person , and hinders progress towards_the building up of an authentic human community . In contrast , from the Christian vision of the human_person there necessarily follows a correct picture of society . According to Rerum novarum and the whole social_doctrine of the Church , the social nature of man_-isaia- not completely fulfilled in the State , but_-isaia- realized in various intermediary groups , beginning with the family and including economic , social , political and cultural groups which stem from human_nature itself and have_their own autonomy , always with_a_view to the common_good . This -isaia- what I have called the '' subjectivity '' of society_which , together_with_the subjectivity of the individual , was cancelled out by '' Real Socialism '' . If we then inquire as to the source of this mistaken concept of the nature of the person and the '' subjectivity '' of society , we must reply that_its first cause -isaia- atheism . It -isaia- by responding to the call of God contained in the being of things_that man becomes aware of his transcendent dignity . Every individual must give this response , which constitutes the apex of his humanity , and no social mechanism or collective subject can substitute for it . The denial of God deprives the person of his foundation , and consequently leads to a reorganization of the social_order without reference to the person s dignity and responsibility . The atheism of which_we_are speaking -isaia-_also closely connected_with_the rationalism of the Enlightenment , which views human and social reality in a mechanistic way . Thus there_-isaia- a denial of the supreme insight concerning man s true greatness , his transcendence in respect to earthly realities , the contradiction in his_heart between_the desire_for the fullness of what_-isaia-_good and his_own inability to attain it and , above all , the need_for salvation which results from this situation . From the same atheistic source , socialism also derives its choice of the means of action condemned in Rerum novarum , namely , class struggle . The Pope does_not , of course , intend to condemn every possible form of social conflict . The Church -isaia- well aware_that in the course of history conflicts of interest between different social groups inevitably arise , and that in the face of such conflicts Christians must often take a position , honestly and decisively . The Encyclical Laborem exercens moreover clearly recognized the positive role of conflict when it takes the form of a '' struggle for social_justice '' ; Quadragesimo anno had_already stated_that '' if the class struggle abstains from enmities and mutual hatred , it gradually changes into an honest discussion of differences founded on a desire for_justice '' . However , what_-isaia- condemned in class struggle -isaia- the idea that conflict -isaia- not restrained by ethical or juridical considerations , or by respect_for the dignity of others and consequently of oneself ; a reasonable compromise -isaia- thus excluded , and what_-isaia- pursued -isaia- not the general good of society , but a partisan interest which replaces the common_good and sets out to destroy whatever stands in its way . In a word , it -isaia-_a_question of transferring to the sphere of internal conflict between social groups the doctrine of '' total war '' , which_the militarism and imperialism of that_time brought to bear on international relations . As a result of this_doctrine , the search_for a proper balance between_the interests of the various nations was replaced by attempts to impose the absolute domination of one_s_own side through the destruction of the other side s capacity to resist , using every possible means , not excluding the use of lies , terror tactics against citizens , and weapons of utter destruction which precisely in those years were beginning to be designed . Therefore class struggle in the Marxist sense and militarism have_the same root , namely , atheism and contempt for the human_person , which place the principle of force above that of reason and law . Rerum novarum -isaia- opposed to State control of the means_of_production , which_would reduce every citizen to being a '' cog '' in the State machine . It -isaia- no less forceful in criticizing a concept of the State which completely excludes the economic sector from the State s range of interest and action . There -isaia- certainly a legitimate sphere of autonomy in economic_life which_the State should_not enter . The State , however , has the task of determining the juridical framework within which economic affairs are to be conducted , and thus of safeguarding the prerequisites of a free economy , which presumes a certain equality between_the parties , such that_one party would_not be so powerful as practically to reduce the other to subservience . In this_regard , Rerum novarum points the way to just reforms which_can restore dignity to work as the free activity of man . These reforms imply that society and the State will both assume responsibility , especially_for protecting the worker from the nightmare of unemployment . Historically , this_has happened in two converging ways : either through economic policies aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- ensuring balanced growth and full employment , or through unemployment insurance and retraining programmes capable of ensuring a smooth transfer of workers from crisis sectors to those in expansion . Furthermore , society and the State must ensure wage levels adequate for the maintenance of the worker and his family , including a certain amount for savings . This requires a continuous effort to improve workers training and capability so that_their work will be more skilled and productive , as well as careful controls and adequate legislative measures to block shameful forms of exploitation , especially to the disadvantage of the most vulnerable workers , of immigrants and of those on the margins of society . The role of trade unions in negotiating minimum salaries and working conditions -isaia- decisive in this area . Finally , '' humane '' working hours and adequate free time need to be guaranteed , as well as the right to express one_s_own personality -atti_degli_apostoli- the work place without suffering any affront to one s conscience or personal_dignity . This -isaia- the place to mention once_more the role of trade unions , not_only in negotiating contracts , but_also as '' places '' where workers can express themselves . They serve the development of an authentic culture of work and help workers to share in a fully human way in the life of their place of employment . The State must contribute to the achievement of these goals both directly and indirectly . Indirectly and according to the principle of subsidiarity , by creating favourable conditions for the free exercise of economic activity , which_will lead to abundant opportunities_for employment and sources of wealth . Directly and according to the principle of solidarity , by defending the weakest , by placing certain limits on the autonomy of the parties who determine working conditions , and by ensuring in every case the necessary minimum support for the unemployed worker . The Encyclical and the related social_teaching of the Church had far reaching influence in the years bridging the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . This influence -isaia- evident in the numerous reforms which_were introduced in the areas of social security , pensions , health insurance and compensation in the case of accidents , within_the framework of greater respect_for the rights of workers . These reforms were carried_out in part by States , but in the struggle to achieve them the role of the workers movement was an important one . This movement , which began as a response of moral conscience to unjust and harmful situations , conducted a widespread campaign for reform , far removed from vague ideology and closer to the daily needs of workers . In this_context its efforts were often joined to those of Christians in order to improve workers living conditions . Later on , this movement was dominated to a certain extent by the Marxist ideology against which Rerum novarum had spoken . These same reforms were also partly the result of an open process by which society organized itself through the establishment of effective instruments of solidarity , which_were capable of sustaining an economic growth more respectful of the values of the person . Here we should remember the numerous efforts to which Christians made a notable contribution in establishing producers , consumers and credit cooperatives , in promoting general education and professional training , in experimenting with various_forms of participation in the life of the work place and in the life of society in general . Thus , as we look -atti_degli_apostoli- the past , there_-isaia- good_reason to thank God that the great Encyclical was not_without an echo in human hearts and indeed led to a generous response on the practical level . Still , we must acknowledge that_its prophetic message was_not fully accepted by people -atti_degli_apostoli- the time . Precisely for this_reason there ensued some very serious tragedies . Reading the Encyclical within_the context of Pope Leo s whole magisterium , we see_how it points essentially to the socio economic consequences of an error which_has even greater implications . As has_been mentioned , this error consists in an understanding of human_freedom which detaches it from obedience to the truth , and consequently from the duty to respect the rights of others . The essence of freedom then becomes self love carried to the point of contempt for God and neighbour , a self love which_leads to an unbridled affirmation of self interest and which refuses to be limited by any demand of justice . This very error had extreme consequences in the tragic series of wars which ravaged Europe and the world between and . Some of these resulted from militarism and exaggerated nationalism , and from related forms of totalitarianism ; some derived_from the class struggle ; still others were civil wars or wars of an ideological nature . Without the terrible burden of hatred and resentment which_had built up as a result of so many injustices both on the international level and within individual States , such cruel wars would_not have_been possible , in which great nations invested their energies and in which_there was no hesitation to violate the most_sacred human_rights , with the extermination of entire peoples and social groups being planned and carried_out . Here we recall_the Jewish people in particular , whose terrible fate has become a symbol of the aberration of which man_-isaia- capable when he turns against God . However , it -isaia- only_when hatred and injustice are sanctioned and organized by the ideologies based on them , rather_than on the truth_about man , that_they take possession of entire nations and drive them to act . Rerum novarum opposed ideologies of hatred and showed how violence and resentment could be overcome by justice . May the memory of those terrible events guide the actions of everyone , particularly the leaders of nations in our own_time , when other_forms of injustice are fuelling new hatreds and when new ideologies which exalt violence are appearing on the horizon . While it -isaia- true_that since weapons have_been silent on the European continent , it must be remembered that true peace_-isaia- never simply the result of military victory , but_rather implies both the removal of the causes of war and genuine reconciliation between peoples . For many years there_has been in Europe and the world a situation of non war rather_than genuine peace . Half of the continent fell under the domination of a Communist dictatorship , while the other half organized itself in defence against this threat . Many peoples lost the ability to control their_own destiny and were enclosed within_the suffocating boundaries of an empire in which efforts were made to destroy their historical memory and the centuries old roots of their culture . As a result of this violent division of Europe , enormous masses of people were compelled to leave their homeland or were forcibly deported . An insane arms race swallowed up the resources needed_for the development of national economies and for assistance to the less developed nations . Scientific and technological progress , which_should have contributed to man s well_being , was transformed into an instrument of war : science and technology were directed to the production of ever_more efficient and destructive weapons . Meanwhile , an ideology , a perversion of authentic philosophy , was called_upon to provide doctrinal justification for the new war . And this war was not_simply expected and prepared_for , but was actually fought with enormous bloodshed in various parts_of_the_world . The logic of power blocs or empires , denounced in various Church documents and recently in the Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis , led to a situation in which controversies and disagreements among Third World countries were systematically aggravated and exploited in order to create difficulties for the adversary . Extremist groups , seeking to resolve such controversies through the use of arms , found ready political and military support and were equipped and trained for war ; those_who tried to find peaceful and humane solutions , with_respect for the legitimate interests of all parties , remained isolated and often fell victim to their opponents . In addition , the precariousness of the peace which followed the Second World War was one of the principal causes of the militarization of many Third World countries and the fratricidal conflicts which afflicted them , as well as of the spread of terrorism and of increasingly barbaric means of political and military conflict . Moreover , the whole_world was oppressed by the threat of an atomic war capable of leading to the extinction of humanity . Science used for military purposes had placed this decisive instrument -atti_degli_apostoli- the disposal of hatred , strengthened by ideology . But if war can end without winners or losers in a suicide of humanity , then we must repudiate the logic which_leads to it : the idea that the effort to destroy the enemy , confrontation and war itself are factors of progress and historical advancement . When the need for_this repudiation -isaia- understood , the concepts of '' total war '' and '' class struggle '' must necessarily be called into question . At the end of the Second World War , however , such a development was still being formed in people s consciences . What received attention was_the spread of Communist totalitarianism over more_than half of Europe and over other parts_of_the_world . The war , which_should have re established freedom and restored the right of nations , ended without having attained these goals . Indeed , in a way , for_many peoples , especially_those which_had suffered most during the war , it openly contradicted these goals . It may be said_that the situation which arose has evoked different responses . Following the destruction caused by the war , we see in some_countries and under certain aspects a positive effort to rebuild a democratic society inspired by social_justice , so as to deprive Communism of the revolutionary potential represented by masses of people subjected to exploitation and oppression . In general , such attempts endeavour to preserve free market mechanisms , ensuring , by means of a stable currency and the harmony of social relations , the conditions for steady and healthy economic growth in which people through_their own work can build a better future for themselves and their_families . At the same_time , these attempts try to avoid making market mechanisms the only point of reference for social_life , and they tend to subject them to public control which upholds the principle of the common destination of material goods . In this_context , an abundance of work opportunities , a solid system of social security and professional training , the freedom to join trade unions and the effective action of unions , the assistance provided in cases of unemployment , the opportunities_for democratic participation in the life of society all these_are meant to deliver work from the mere condition of '' a commodity '' , and to guarantee its dignity . Then there_are the other social forces and ideological movements which oppose Marxism by setting up systems of '' national security '' , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- controlling the whole of society in a systematic way , in order to make Marxist infiltration impossible . By emphasizing and increasing the power of the State , they wish to protect their_people from Communism , but in doing so they run the grave risk of destroying the freedom and values of the person , the very things for whose sake it -isaia- necessary to oppose Communism . Another kind of response , practical in nature , -isaia- represented by the affluent society or the consumer society . It seeks to defeat Marxism on the level of pure materialism by showing how a free market society can achieve a greater satisfaction of material human needs than Communism , while equally excluding spiritual values . In reality , while on the one_hand it -isaia- true that_this social model shows the failure of Marxism to contribute to a humane and better society , on the other_hand , insofar as it denies an autonomous existence and value to morality , law , culture and religion , it agrees with Marxism , in the sense_that it totally reduces man to the sphere of economics and the satisfaction of material needs . During the same period a widespread process of '' decolonization '' occurred , by which many countries gained or regained their independence and the right freely to determine their_own destiny . With the formal re acquisition of State sovereignty , however , these countries often find_themselves merely -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the journey towards_the construction of genuine independence . Decisive sectors of the economy still remain de facto in the hands of large foreign companies which_are unwilling to commit themselves to the long term development of the host country . Political life itself_-isaia- controlled by foreign powers , while within_the national boundaries there_are tribal groups not_yet amalgamated into a genuine national community . Also lacking -isaia- a class of competent professional people capable of running the State apparatus in an honest and just way , nor are there qualified personnel for managing the economy in an efficient and responsible manner . Given this situation , many think_that Marxism can_offer a sort of short cut for building up the nation and the State ; thus many variants of socialism emerge with specific national characteristics . Legitimate demands for national recovery , forms of nationalism and also of militarism , principles drawn_from ancient popular traditions which_are sometimes in harmony_with Christian social_doctrine and Marxist Leninist concepts and ideas all these mingle in the many ideologies which take shape in ways that differ from case to case . Lastly , it should be remembered that after_the Second World War , and in reaction to its horrors , there arose a more lively sense of human_rights , which found recognition in a number of International Documents and , one might say , in the drawing up of a new '' right of nations '' , to which_the Holy See has constantly contributed . The focal point of this evolution has been_the United Nations Organization . Not only has there been a development in awareness of the rights of individuals , but_also in awareness of the rights of nations , as well as a clearer realization of the need to act in order to remedy the grave imbalances that exist between_the various geographical areas of the world . In a certain_sense , these imbalances have shifted the centre of the social_question from the national to the international level . While noting this_process with satisfaction , nevertheless one_cannot ignore the fact_that the overall balance of the various policies of aid for development has not always_been positive . The United Nations , moreover , has not_yet succeeded in establishing , as alternatives to war , effective means_for the resolution of international conflicts . This seems to be the most urgent problem which_the international community has yet to resolve . It -isaia- on the basis of the world situation just described , and already elaborated in the Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis , that the unexpected and promising significance of the events of recent_years can be understood . Although they certainly reached their climax in in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , they embrace a longer period of time and a wider geographical area . In the course of the s , certain dictatorial and oppressive regimes fell one by one in some_countries of Latin America and also of Africa and Asia . In other cases there began a difficult but productive transition towards more participatory and more just political structures . An important , even decisive , contribution was_made by the Church s commitment to defend and promote human_rights . In situations strongly influenced by ideology , in which polarization obscured the awareness of a human_dignity common to all , the Church affirmed clearly and forcefully that every_individual whatever his or her personal convictions bears the image of God and therefore deserves respect . Often , the vast majority of people identified themselves_with this_kind of affirmation , and this led to a search_for forms of protest and for political solutions more respectful of the dignity of the person . From this historical process new_forms of democracy have emerged which offer a hope_for change in fragile political and social structures weighed down by a painful series of injustices and resentments , as well as by a heavily damaged economy and serious social conflicts . Together with the whole Church , I thank God for the often heroic witness borne in such difficult circumstances by many Pastors , entire Christian communities , individual members of the faithful , and other people_of_good_will ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time I pray that he will sustain the efforts being made by everyone to build a better future . This -isaia- , in fact , a responsibility which falls not_only to the citizens of the countries in question , but to all Christians and people_of_good_will . It -isaia-_a_question of showing that the complex problems faced by those peoples can be resolved through dialogue and solidarity , rather_than by a struggle to destroy the enemy through war . Among the many factors involved in the fall of oppressive regimes , some deserve special mention . Certainly , the decisive factor which gave rise to the changes was_the violation of the rights of workers . It cannot be forgotten that the fundamental crisis of systems claiming to express the rule and indeed the dictatorship of the working class began with the great upheavals which took_place in Poland in the name of solidarity . It was_the throngs of working people which foreswore the ideology which presumed to speak in their name . On the basis of a hard , lived experience of work and of oppression , it was they_who recovered and , in a sense , rediscovered the content and principles of the Church s social_doctrine . Also worthy of emphasis -isaia- the fact_that the fall of this_kind of '' bloc '' or empire was accomplished almost everywhere by means of peaceful protest , using only the weapons of truth and justice . While Marxism held that_only by exacerbating social conflicts was it possible to resolve them through violent confrontation , the protests which led to the collapse of Marxism tenaciously insisted on trying every avenue of negotiation , dialogue , and witness to the truth , appealing to the conscience of the adversary and seeking to reawaken in him a sense of shared human_dignity . It seemed that the European order resulting from the Second World War and sanctioned by the Yalta Agreements could only be overturned by another war . Instead , it has_been overcome by the non violent commitment of people_who , while always refusing to yield to the force of power , succeeded time after time in finding effective ways of bearing_witness to the truth . This disarmed the adversary , since violence always needs to justify itself through deceit , and to appear , however falsely , to be defending a right or responding to a threat posed by others . Once again I thank God for having sustained people s hearts amid difficult trials , and I pray that_this example will prevail in other places and other circumstances . May people learn to fight for_justice without violence , renouncing class struggle in their internal disputes , and war in international ones . The second factor in the crisis was certainly the inefficiency of the economic system , which_-isaia-_not to be considered simply as a technical problem , but_rather a consequence of the violation of the human_rights to private initiative , to ownership of property and to freedom in the economic sector . To this_must be added the cultural and national dimension : it -isaia- not_possible to understand man on the basis of economics alone , nor to define him simply on the basis of class membership . Man -isaia- understood in a more complete way when he -isaia- situated within_the sphere of culture through_his language , history , and the position he takes towards_the fundamental events of life , such as birth , love , work and death . At the heart of every culture lies the attitude man takes to the greatest mystery : the mystery of God . Different cultures are basically different_ways of facing the question of the meaning of personal existence . When this_question -isaia- eliminated , the culture and moral_life of nations are corrupted . For this_reason_the struggle to defend work was spontaneously linked to the struggle for culture and for national rights . But the true cause of the new developments was_the spiritual void brought_about by atheism , which deprived the younger generations of a sense of direction and in many cases led them , in the irrepressible search_for personal identity and for the meaning of life , to rediscover the religious roots of their national cultures , and to rediscover the person of Christ himself as the existentially adequate response to the desire in every_human heart for goodness , truth and life . This search was supported by the witness of those_who , in difficult circumstances and under persecution , remained faithful to God . Marxism had promised to uproot the need_for God from the human_heart , but the results have shown that_it_-isaia- not_possible to succeed in this without throwing the heart into turmoil . The events of are an example of the success of willingness to negotiate and of the Gospel spirit in the face of an adversary determined not to be bound by moral principles . These events are a warning to those_who , in the name of political realism , wish to banish law and morality from the political arena . Undoubtedly , the struggle which led to the changes of called_for clarity , moderation , suffering and sacrifice . In a certain_sense , it was a struggle born of prayer , and it would_have been unthinkable without immense trust in God , the Lord of history , who carries the human_heart in his hands . It -isaia- by uniting his_own sufferings for the sake of truth and freedom to the sufferings of Christ on the Cross that man_-isaia- able to accomplish the miracle of peace and -isaia- in a position to discern the often narrow path between_the cowardice which_gives in to evil and the violence which , under the illusion of fighting evil , only makes it worse . Nevertheless , it cannot be forgotten that the manner in which_the individual exercises his freedom_-isaia- conditioned in innumerable ways . While these certainly have an influence on freedom , they_do_not determine it ; they_make the exercise of freedom more difficult or less difficult , but they_cannot destroy it . Not only -isaia- it wrong from the ethical point_of_view to disregard human_nature , which_-isaia- made for freedom , but in practice it -isaia- impossible to do so . Where society_-isaia- so organized as to reduce arbitrarily or even suppress the sphere in which freedom_-isaia- legitimately exercised , the result -isaia- that the life of society becomes progressively disorganized and goes into decline . Moreover , man_,_who was created for freedom , bears within himself_the wound of original_sin , which constantly draws him towards evil and puts him in need of redemption . Not only -isaia- this_doctrine an integral part of Christian revelation ; it also_has great hermeneutical value insofar as it helps one to understand human reality . Man tends towards good , but he -isaia-_also capable of evil . He can transcend his immediate interest and still remain bound to it . The social_order will be all the more stable , the more it takes this_fact into_account and does_not place in opposition personal interest and the interests of society as a whole , but_rather seeks ways to bring them_into fruitful harmony . In fact , where self interest -isaia- violently suppressed , it -isaia- replaced by a burdensome system of bureaucratic control which dries up the wellsprings of initiative and creativity . When people think they possess the secret of a perfect social organization which_makes evil impossible , they_also think that_they_can use any means , including violence and deceit , in order to bring that organization into being . Politics then becomes a '' secular religion '' which operates under the illusion of creating paradise in this_world . But no political society_which possesses its_own autonomy and laws can ever be confused with the Kingdom of God . The Gospel parable of the weeds among the wheat cf . Mt : ; teaches that_it_-isaia- for God alone to separate the subjects of the Kingdom from the subjects of the Evil One , and that_this judgment will take_place -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of time . By presuming to anticipate judgment here and now , man puts himself in the place of God and sets himself against the patience of God . Through Christ s sacrifice on the Cross , the victory of the Kingdom of God has_been achieved once and for all . Nevertheless , the Christian life involves a struggle against temptation and the forces of evil . Only -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of history will the Lord return in glory for the final judgment cf . Mt : with the establishment of a new heaven and a new earth cf . Pt : ; Rev : ; but as long as time lasts the struggle between good_and_evil continues even in the human_heart itself . What Sacred Scripture teaches us about the prospects of the Kingdom of God -isaia- not_without consequences for the life of temporal societies , which , as the adjective indicates , belong to the realm of time , with all that_this implies of imperfection and impermanence . The Kingdom of God , being in the world without being of the world , throws light on the order of human_society , while the power of grace penetrates that order and gives it life . In this_way the requirements of a society worthy of man are better perceived , deviations are corrected , the courage to work_for what_-isaia-_good -isaia- reinforced . In union with all people_of_good_will , Christians , especially_the laity , are_called to this_task of imbuing human realities with the Gospel . The events of took_place principally in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe . However , they_have worldwide importance because_they have positive and negative consequences which concern the whole human_family . These consequences are_not mechanistic or fatalistic in character , but_rather are opportunities_for human_freedom to cooperate with the merciful plan of God who acts within history . The first consequence was an encounter in some_countries between_the Church and the workers movement , which came about as a result of an ethical and explicitly Christian reaction against a widespread situation of injustice . For about a century the workers movement had fallen in part under the dominance of Marxism , in the conviction_that the working class , in order to struggle effectively against oppression , had to appropriate its economic and materialistic theories . In the crisis of Marxism , the natural dictates of the consciences of workers have re emerged in a demand for_justice and a recognition of the dignity of work , in conformity_with_the social_doctrine of the Church . The worker movement -isaia-_part of a more general movement among workers and other people_of_good_will for the liberation of the human_person and for the affirmation of human_rights . It -isaia- a movement which today has spread to many countries , and which , far from opposing the Catholic Church , looks to her with interest . The crisis of Marxism does_not rid the world of the situations of injustice and oppression which Marxism itself exploited and on which it fed . To those_who_are searching today for a new and authentic theory and praxis of liberation , the Church offers not_only her social_doctrine and , in general , her teaching about the human_person redeemed in Christ , but_also her concrete commitment and material assistance in the struggle against marginalization and suffering . In the recent past , the sincere desire to be on the side of the oppressed and not to be cut off from the course of history has led many believers to seek in various_ways an impossible compromise between Marxism and Christianity . Moving beyond all that_was short lived in these attempts , present circumstances are leading to a reaffirmation of the positive value of an authentic theology of integral human liberation . Considered from this point_of_view , the events of are proving to be important also_for the countries of the Third World , which_are searching for their_own path to development , just as they_were important_for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe . The second consequence concerns the peoples of Europe themselves . Many individual , social , regional and national injustices were committed during and prior to the years in which Communism dominated ; much hatred and ill will_have accumulated . There -isaia- a real danger that_these will re explode after_the collapse of dictatorship , provoking serious conflicts and casualties , should there be a lessening of the moral commitment and conscious striving to bear_witness to the truth_which were_the inspiration for past efforts . It -isaia- to be hoped that hatred and violence will_not triumph in people s hearts , especially among those_who_are struggling for_justice , and that all people will grow in the spirit of peace and forgiveness . What -isaia- needed are concrete steps to create or consolidate international structures capable of intervening through appropriate arbitration in the conflicts which arise between nations , so that_each nation can uphold its_own rights and reach a just agreement and peaceful settlement vis \u00e0 vis the rights of others . This -isaia-_especially needed_for the nations of Europe , which_are closely united in a bond of common culture and an age old history . A great effort -isaia- needed to rebuild morally and economically the countries which_have abandoned Communism . For a long Time the most elementary economic relationships were distorted , and basic virtues of economic_life , such as truthfulness , trustworthiness and hard work were denigrated . A patient material and moral reconstruction -isaia- needed , even as people , exhausted by longstanding privation , are asking their governments for tangible and immediate results in the form of material benefits and an adequate fulfilment of their legitimate aspirations . The fall of Marxism has naturally had a great impact on the division of the planet into worlds which_are closed to one_another and in jealous competition . It has further highlighted the reality of interdependence among peoples , as well as the fact_that human_work , by its_nature , -isaia- meant to unite peoples , not divide them . Peace and prosperity , in fact , are goods which belong to the whole_human_race : it -isaia- not_possible to enjoy them in a proper and lasting way if they_are achieved and maintained -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of other peoples and nations , by violating their_rights or excluding them_from the sources of well_being . In a sense , for some_countries of Europe the real post war period -isaia- just beginning . The radical reordering of economic systems , hitherto collectivized , entails problems and sacrifices comparable to those_which the countries of Western Europe had to face in order to rebuild after_the Second World War . It -isaia- right that in the present difficulties the formerly Communist countries should be aided by the united effort of other nations . Obviously they_themselves must be the primary agents of their_own development , but_they must_also be given a reasonable opportunity to accomplish this goal , something_that cannot happen without_the help of other countries . Moreover , their present condition , marked by difficulties and shortages , -isaia- the result of an historical process in which_the formerly Communist countries were often objects and not subjects . Thus they find_themselves in the present situation not as a result of free choice or mistakes which_were made , but as a consequence of tragic historical events which_were violently imposed on them , and which prevented them_from following the path of economic_and_social development . Assistance from other countries , especially_the countries of Europe which_were part of that history and which bear responsibility_for it , represents a debt in justice . But it also corresponds to the interest and welfare of Europe as a whole , since Europe cannot live in peace if the various conflicts which_have arisen as a result of the past are to become more acute because of a situation of economic disorder , spiritual dissatisfaction and desperation . This need , however , must_not lead to a slackening of efforts to sustain and assist the countries of the Third World , which often suffer even more_serious conditions of poverty and want . What -isaia- called_for -isaia- a special effort to mobilize resources , which_are not lacking in the world as a whole , for the purpose of economic growth and common development , redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values on the basis of which economic and political choices are made . Enormous resources can be made available by disarming the huge military machines which_were constructed for the conflict between East and West . These resources could become even_more abundant if , in place of war , reliable procedures for the resolution of conflicts could be set up , with the resulting spread of the principle of arms control and arms reduction , also in the countries of the Third World , through the adoption of appropriate measures against the arms trade . But it will be necessary above all to abandon a mentality in which_the poor as individuals and as peoples are considered a burden , as irksome intruders trying to consume what others have produced . The poor ask for the right to share in enjoying material goods and to make good use of their capacity_for work , thus creating a world that_-isaia- more just and prosperous for all . The advancement of the poor constitutes a great opportunity_for the moral , cultural and even economic growth of all humanity . Finally , development must_not be understood solely in economic terms , but in a way that_-isaia- fully human . It -isaia-_not_only a question of raising all peoples to the level currently enjoyed by the richest countries , but_rather of building up a more decent life through united labour , of concretely enhancing every_individual s dignity and creativity , as well as his capacity to respond to his personal vocation , and thus to God s call . The apex of development -isaia- the exercise of the right and duty to seek God , to know him and to live in accordance_with that knowledge . In the totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , the principle that force predominates over reason was carried to the extreme . Man was compelled to submit to a conception of reality imposed on him by coercion , and not reached by virtue of his_own reason and the exercise of his_own freedom . This principle must be overturned and total recognition must_be_given to the rights of the human conscience , which_-isaia- bound only to the truth , both natural and revealed . The recognition of these rights represents the primary foundation of every authentically free political order . It -isaia- important to reaffirm this latter principle for several reasons : a because the old forms of totalitarianism and authoritarianism are_not yet completely vanquished ; indeed there_-isaia- a risk that_they_will regain their strength . This demands renewed efforts of cooperation and solidarity between all countries ; b because in the developed countries there_-isaia- sometimes an excessive promotion of purely utilitarian values , with an appeal to the appetites and inclinations towards immediate gratification , making it difficult to recognize and respect the hierarchy of the true values of human_existence ; c because in some_countries new_forms of religious fundamentalism are emerging which covertly , or even openly , deny to citizens of faiths other_than that of the majority the full exercise of their civil and religious rights , preventing them_from taking part in the cultural process , and restricting both the Church s right to preach the Gospel and the rights of those_who hear this preaching to accept it and to be converted to Christ . No authentic progress -isaia- possible without respect_for the natural and fundamental right to know_the truth and live according to that_truth . The exercise and development of this right includes the right to discover and freely to accept Jesus Christ , who -isaia-_man s true good . PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE UNIVERSAL DESTINATION OF MATERIAL GOODS . In Rerum novarum , Leo XIII strongly affirmed the natural character of the right to private_property , using various arguments against the socialism of his time . This right , which_-isaia- fundamental for the autonomy and development of the person , has_always_been defended by the Church up to our_own day . At the same_time , the Church teaches_that the possession of material goods -isaia- not an absolute right , and that_its limits are inscribed in its_very nature as a human right . While the Pope proclaimed the right to private ownership , he affirmed with equal clarity that the '' use '' of goods , while marked by freedom , -isaia- subordinated to their original common destination as created goods , as well as to the will of Jesus Christ as expressed in the Gospel . Pope Leo wrote : '' those_whom fortune favours are admonished . that_they_should tremble -atti_degli_apostoli- the warnings of Jesus Christ . and that a most strict account must_be_given to the Supreme Judge for the use of all they possess '' ; and quoting Saint Thomas Aquinas , he added : '' But if the question be asked , how must one s possessions be used ? the Church replies without hesitation that_man should_not consider his material possessions as his_own , but as common to all . '' , because '' above the laws and judgments of men stands the law , the judgment of Christ '' . The Successors of Leo XIII have repeated this twofold affirmation : the necessity and therefore the legitimacy of private ownership , as well as the limits which_are imposed on it . The Second Vatican Council likewise clearly restated the traditional doctrine in words_which bear repeating : '' In making use of the exterior things we lawfully possess , we ought to regard them not_just as our_own but_also as common , in the sense that_they_can profit not_only the owners but others too '' ; and a little later we read : '' Private property or some ownership of external goods affords each_person the scope needed_for personal and family autonomy , and should be regarded as an extension of human_freedom . Of its_nature private_property also_has a social function which_-isaia- based on the law of the common purpose of goods '' . I have returned to this_same doctrine , first in my address to the Third Conference of the Latin American Bishops -atti_degli_apostoli- Puebla , and later in the Encyclicals Laborem exercens and Sollicitudo rei_socialis . Re reading this_teaching on the right to property and the common destination of material wealth as it applies to the present_time , the question can be raised concerning the origin of the material goods which sustain human_life , satisfy people s needs and are an object of their_rights . The original source of all that_-isaia- good -isaia- the very act of God , who created both the earth and man , and who gave the earth to man so that_he_might have dominion over it by his_work and enjoy its fruits Gen : . God gave the earth to the whole_human_race for the sustenance of all its_members , without excluding or favouring anyone . This -isaia- the foundation of the universal destination of the earth s goods . The earth , by reason of its fruitfulness and its capacity to satisfy human needs , -isaia- God s first gift for the sustenance of human_life . But the earth does_not yield its fruits without a particular human response to God s gift , that_-isaia- to say , without work . It -isaia- through work that_man , using his intelligence and exercising his freedom , succeeds in dominating the earth and making it a fitting home . In this_way , he makes part of the earth his_own , precisely_the part which_he_has acquired through work ; this_-isaia- the origin of individual property . Obviously , he also_has the responsibility not to hinder others from having their_own part of God s gift ; indeed , he must cooperate with_others so that together all can dominate the earth . In history , these_two factors work and the land are to be found -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of every human_society . However , they_do_not always stand in the same relationship to each_other . At one time the natural fruitfulness of the earth appeared to be , and was in fact , the primary factor of wealth , while work was , as it were , the help and support for_this fruitfulness . In our_time , the role of human work_-isaia- becoming increasingly important as the productive factor both of non material and of material wealth . Moreover , it -isaia- becoming clearer how a person s work_-isaia- naturally interrelated with the work of others . More than_ever , work_-isaia- work with_others and work_for others : it -isaia-_a_matter of doing something for someone else . Work becomes ever_more fruitful and productive to the extent_that people become more knowledgeable of the productive potentialities of the earth and more profoundly cognisant of the needs of those for_whom their work_-isaia- done . In our_time , in particular , there exists another form of ownership which_-isaia- becoming no less important than land : the possession of know_how , technology and skill . The wealth of the industrialized nations -isaia- based much_more on this_kind of ownership than on natural resources . Mention has just been_made of the fact_that people work with each_other , sharing in a '' community of work '' which embraces ever widening circles . A person_who produces something other_than for his_own use generally does so in order_that others may use it after they_have paid a just price , mutually agreed upon through free bargaining . It -isaia- precisely_the ability to foresee both the needs of others and the combinations of productive factors most adapted to satisfying those needs that constitutes another important source of wealth in modern society . Besides , many goods cannot be adequately produced through the work of an isolated individual ; they require the cooperation of many_people in working towards a common goal . Organizing such a productive effort , planning its duration in time , making sure_that it corresponds in a positive way to the demands which it must satisfy , and taking the necessary risks all this too -isaia- a source of wealth in today s society . In this_way , the role of disciplined and creative human_work and , as an essential part of that work , initiative and entrepreneurial ability becomes increasingly evident and decisive . This process , which throws practical light on a truth_about the person which Christianity has constantly affirmed , should be viewed carefully and favourably . Indeed , besides the earth , man s principal resource -isaia-_man himself . His intelligence enables him to discover the earth s productive potential and the many different_ways in which human needs can be satisfied . It -isaia-_his disciplined work in close collaboration with_others that makes possible the creation of ever_more extensive working communities which_can be relied upon to transform man s natural and human environments . Important virtues are involved in this_process , such as diligence , industriousness , prudence in undertaking reasonable risks , reliability and fidelity in interpersonal relationships , as well as courage in carrying_out decisions which_are difficult and painful but necessary , both_for the overall working of a business and in meeting possible set backs . The modern business economy has positive aspects . Its basis -isaia- human_freedom exercised in the economic field , just as it -isaia- exercised in many_other fields . Economic activity -isaia- indeed but_one sector in a great variety of human activities , and like every_other sector , it includes the right to freedom , as well as the duty of making responsible use of freedom . But it -isaia- important to note that_there are specific differences between_the trends of modern society and those of the past , even the recent past . Whereas -atti_degli_apostoli- one time the decisive factor of production was_the land , and later capital understood as a total complex of the instruments of production today the decisive factor -isaia- increasingly man_himself , that_-isaia- , his knowledge , especially his scientific knowledge , his capacity_for interrelated and compact organization , as well as his ability to perceive the needs of others and to satisfy them . However , the risks and problems connected_with this_kind of process should be pointed_out . The fact -isaia- that many_people , perhaps the majority today , do not have_the means which_would enable them to take their place in an effective and humanly dignified way within a productive system in which work_-isaia- truly central . They have no possibility of acquiring the basic knowledge which_would enable them to express their creativity and develop their potential . They have no way of entering the network of knowledge and intercommunication which_would enable them to see their qualities appreciated and utilized . Thus , if not actually exploited , they_are to a great extent marginalized ; economic development takes_place over their heads , so to speak , when it does_not actually reduce the already narrow scope of their old subsistence economies . They are unable to compete against the goods which_are produced in ways which_are new and which properly respond to needs , needs which_they had previously been accustomed to meeting through traditional forms of organization . Allured by the dazzle of an opulence which_-isaia- beyond their reach , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time driven by necessity , these_people crowd the cities of the Third World where_they are_often without cultural roots , and where_they are exposed to situations of violent uncertainty , without_the possibility of becoming integrated . Their dignity -isaia- not acknowledged in any real way , and sometimes there_are even attempts to eliminate them_from history through coercive forms of demographic control which_are contrary to human_dignity . Many other people , while not completely marginalized , live in situations in which_the struggle for a bare minimum -isaia- uppermost . These are situations in which_the rules of the earliest period of capitalism still flourish in conditions of '' ruthlessness '' in no way inferior to the darkest moments of the first phase of industrialization . In other cases the land -isaia- still the central element in the economic process , but those_who cultivate it are excluded from ownership and are reduced to a state of quasi servitude . In these cases , it -isaia- still possible today , as in the days of Rerum novarum , to speak of inhuman exploitation . In spite of the great changes which_have taken_place in the more advanced societies , the human inadequacies of capitalism and the resulting domination of things over people_are far from disappearing . In fact , for the poor , to the lack of material goods has_been added a lack of knowledge and training which prevents them_from escaping their state of humiliating subjection . Unfortunately , the great majority of people in the Third World still live in such conditions . It would be a mistake , however , to understand this '' world '' in purely geographic terms . In some regions and in some social sectors of that world , development programmes have_been set up which_are centered on the use not_so_much of the material resources available but of the '' human resources '' . Even in recent_years it was thought that the poorest countries would develop by isolating themselves from the world market and by depending only on their_own resources . Recent experience has shown that countries which did this have suffered stagnation and recession , while the countries which experienced development were those_which succeeded in taking part in the general interrelated economic activities -atti_degli_apostoli- the international level . It seems therefore that the chief problem -isaia- that of gaining fair access to the international market , based not on the unilateral principle of the exploitation of the natural resources of these countries but on the proper use of human resources . However , aspects typical of the Third World also appear in developed countries , where_the constant transformation of the methods of production and consumption devalues certain acquired skills and professional expertise , and thus requires a continual effort of re training and updating . Those who fail to keep up with the times can easily be marginalized , as can the elderly , the young people_who_are incapable of finding their place in the life of society and , in general , those_who_are weakest or part of the so called Fourth World . The situation of women too -isaia- far from easy in these conditions . It would appear that , on the level of individual nations and of international relations , the free market -isaia-_the_most efficient instrument for utilizing resources and effectively responding to needs . But this_-isaia- true only_for those needs which_are '' solvent '' , insofar as they_are endowed_with purchasing power , and for those resources which_are '' marketable '' , insofar as they_are capable of obtaining a satisfactory price . But there_are_many human needs which find no place on the market . It -isaia- a strict duty of justice and truth not to allow fundamental human needs to remain unsatisfied , and not to allow those burdened by such needs to perish . It -isaia-_also necessary to help these needy people to acquire expertise , to enter_the circle of exchange , and to develop their skills in order to make_the best use of their capacities and resources . Even prior to the logic of a fair exchange of goods and the forms of justice appropriate to it , there exists something which_-isaia- due to man because he -isaia-_man , by reason of his lofty dignity . Inseparable from that required '' something '' -isaia- the possibility to survive and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , to make an active contribution to the common_good of humanity . In Third World contexts , certain objectives stated by Rerum novarum remain valid , and , in some cases , still constitute a goal yet to be reached , if man s work and his_very being are_not to be reduced to the level of a mere commodity . These objectives include a sufficient wage for the support of the family , social insurance for old age and unemployment , and adequate protection for the conditions of employment . Here we find a wide range of opportunities_for commitment and effort in the name of justice on the part of trade unions and other workers organizations . These defend workers rights and protect their interests as persons , while fulfilling a vital cultural role , so as to enable workers to participate more_fully and honourably in the life of their nation and to assist them along the path of development . In this_sense , it -isaia- right to speak of a struggle against an economic system , if the latter -isaia- understood as a method of upholding the absolute predominance of capital , the possession of the means_of_production and of the land , in contrast to the free and personal nature of human_work . In the struggle against such a system , what_-isaia- being proposed as an alternative -isaia- not the socialist system , which in fact turns out to be State capitalism , but_rather a society of free work , of enterprise and of participation . Such a society_-isaia- not directed against the market , but demands_that the market be appropriately controlled by the forces of society and by the State , so as to guarantee that the basic needs of the whole of society are satisfied . The Church acknowledges the legitimate role of profit as an indication that a business -isaia- functioning well . When a firm makes a profit , this means_that productive factors have_been properly employed and corresponding human needs have_been duly satisfied . But profitability -isaia- not the only indicator of a firm s condition . It -isaia- possible_for the financial accounts to be in order , and yet for the people_who make up the firm s most valuable asset to be humiliated and their_dignity offended . Besides being morally inadmissible , this_will eventually have negative repercussions on the firm s economic efficiency . In fact , the purpose of a business firm -isaia- not_simply to make a profit , but_-isaia- to be found in its_very existence as a community of persons_who in various_ways are endeavouring to satisfy their basic needs , and who form a particular group -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the whole of society . Profit -isaia- a regulator of the life of a business , but_it_-isaia- not the only_one ; other human and moral factors must_also be considered which , in the long term , are_-atti_degli_apostoli- least equally important_for the life of a business . We have_seen that_it_-isaia- unacceptable to say that the defeat of so called '' Real Socialism '' leaves capitalism as the only model of economic organization . It -isaia- necessary to break down the barriers and monopolies which leave so many countries on the margins of development , and to provide all individuals and nations with the basic conditions which will_enable them to share in development . This goal calls for programmed and responsible efforts on the part of the entire international community . Stronger nations must offer weaker ones opportunities_for taking their place in international life , and the latter must learn how to use these opportunities by making the necessary efforts and sacrifices and by ensuring political and economic stability , the certainty of better prospects for the future , the improvement of workers skills , and the training of competent business leaders who_are conscious of their responsibilities . At present , the positive efforts which_have_been made along these lines are_being affected by the still largely unsolved problem of the foreign debt of the poorer countries . The principle that debts must be paid -isaia- certainly just . However , it -isaia- not right to demand or expect payment when_the effect would be the imposition of political choices leading to hunger and despair for entire peoples . It cannot be expected that the debts which_have_been contracted should be paid -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of unbearable sacrifices . In such cases it -isaia- necessary to find as in fact -isaia- partly happening ways to lighten , defer or even cancel the debt , compatible with the fundamental right of peoples to subsistence and progress . It would now be helpful to direct our attention to the specific problems and threats emerging within_the more advanced economies and which_are related to their particular characteristics . In earlier stages of development , man always lived under the weight of necessity . His needs were few and were determined , to a degree , by the objective structures of his physical make up . Economic activity was directed towards satisfying these needs . It -isaia- clear_that today the problem -isaia-_not_only one of supplying people_with a sufficient quantity of goods , but_also of responding to a demand for quality : the quality of the goods to be produced and consumed , the quality of the services to be enjoyed , the quality of the environment and of life in general . To call_for an existence which_-isaia- qualitatively more satisfying -isaia- of itself legitimate , but_one cannot_fail to draw attention to the new responsibilities and dangers connected_with this phase of history . The manner in which new needs arise and are defined -isaia- always marked by a more_or_less appropriate concept of man and of his true good . A given culture reveals its overall understanding of life through the choices it makes in production and consumption . It -isaia- here that the phenomenon of consumerism arises . In singling out new needs and new means to meet them , one_must be guided by a comprehensive picture of man which respects all the dimensions of his being and which subordinates his material and instinctive dimensions to his interior and spiritual ones . If , on the contrary , a direct appeal -isaia- made to his instincts while ignoring in various_ways the reality of the person as intelligent and free then consumer attitudes and life styles can be created which_are objectively improper and often damaging to his physical and spiritual health . Of itself , an economic system does_not possess criteria for correctly distinguishing new and higher forms of satisfying human needs from artificial new needs which hinder the formation of a mature personality . Thus a great deal of educational and cultural work_-isaia- urgently needed , including the education of consumers in the responsible use of their_power of choice , the formation of a strong sense_of_responsibility among producers and among people in the mass_media in particular , as well as the necessary intervention by public_authorities . A striking example of artificial consumption contrary to the health and dignity_of_the_human_person , and certainly not easy to control , -isaia- the use of drugs . Widespread drug use -isaia- a sign of a serious malfunction in the social system ; it also implies a materialistic and , in a certain_sense , destructive '' reading '' of human needs . In this_way the innovative capacity of a free economy -isaia- brought to a one sided and inadequate conclusion . Drugs , as well as pornography and other_forms of consumerism which exploit the frailty of the weak , tend to fill the resulting spiritual void . It -isaia- not wrong to want to live better ; what_-isaia- wrong -isaia- a style of life which_-isaia- presumed to be better when it -isaia-_directed towards '' having '' rather_than '' being '' , and which wants to have more , not in order to be more but in order to spend life in enjoyment as an end in itself . It -isaia- therefore necessary to create life styles in which_the quest for truth , beauty , goodness and communion with_others for the sake of common growth are the factors which determine consumer choices , savings and investments . In this_regard , it -isaia- not a matter of the duty of charity alone , that_-isaia- , the duty to give from one s '' abundance '' , and sometimes even out of one s needs , in order to provide what_-isaia- essential for the life of a poor person . I -amos- referring to the fact_that even the decision to invest in one place rather_than another , in one productive sector rather_than another , -isaia- always a moral and cultural choice . Given the utter necessity of certain economic conditions and of political stability , the decision to invest , that_-isaia- , to offer people an opportunity to make good use of their_own labour , -isaia-_also determined by an attitude of human sympathy and trust in Providence , which reveal the human quality of the person making such decisions . Equally worrying -isaia- the ecological question which accompanies the problem of consumerism and which_-isaia- closely connected to it . In his desire to have and to enjoy rather_than to be and to grow , man consumes the resources of the earth and his own_life in an excessive and disordered way . At the root of the senseless destruction of the natural environment lies an anthropological error , which unfortunately -isaia- widespread in our_day . Man , who discovers his capacity to transform and in a certain_sense create the world through_his own work , forgets that_this_-isaia- always based on God s prior and original gift of the things_that_are . Man thinks that he can_make arbitrary use of the earth , subjecting it without restraint to his_will , as though it did not_have its_own requisites and a prior God given purpose , which_man can indeed develop but must_not betray . Instead of carrying_out his role as a co operator with God in the work of creation , man sets himself up in place of God and thus ends up provoking a rebellion on the part of nature , which_-isaia- more tyrannized than governed by him . In all this , one notes first the poverty or narrowness of man s outlook , motivated as he -isaia- by a desire to possess things rather_than to relate them to the truth , and lacking that disinterested , unselfish and aesthetic attitude that_-isaia- born of wonder in the presence of being and of the beauty which enables one to see in visible things the message of the invisible God who created them . In this_regard , humanity today must be conscious of its duties and obligations towards future generations . In addition to the irrational destruction of the natural environment , we must_also mention the more_serious destruction of the human environment , something which_-isaia- by no means receiving the attention it deserves . Although people_are rightly worried though much less_than they_should be about preserving the natural habitats of the various animal species threatened with extinction , because_they realize_that each of these species makes its particular contribution to the balance of nature in general , too little effort -isaia- made to safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic '' human ecology '' . Not only has God given the earth to man_,_who must use it with_respect for the original good purpose for_which it was_given to him , but man too -isaia- God s gift to man . He must_therefore respect the natural and moral structure with which_he_has been endowed . In this_context , mention should be made of the serious problems of modern urbanization , of the need_for urban planning which_-isaia- concerned_with how people_are to live , and of the attention which_should be given to a '' social ecology '' of work . Man receives from God his essential dignity and with it the capacity to transcend every social_order so as to move towards truth and goodness . But he -isaia-_also conditioned by the social structure in which he lives , by the education he has_received and by his environment . These elements can either help or hinder his living in accordance_with_the truth . The decisions which create a human environment can_give rise to specific structures of sin which impede the full realization of those_who_are in any_way oppressed by them . To destroy such structures and replace them_with more authentic forms of living in community -isaia- a task which demands courage and patience . The first and fundamental structure for '' human ecology '' -isaia- the family , in which_man receives his_first formative ideas about truth and goodness , and learns what it means to love and to be loved , and thus what it actually means to be a person . Here we mean the family founded on marriage , in which_the mutual gift_of_self by husband_and_wife creates an environment in which children can be born and develop their potentialities , become aware of their_dignity and prepare to face their unique and individual destiny . But it often happens_that people_are discouraged from creating the proper conditions for_human reproduction and are led to consider themselves and their_lives as a series of sensations to be experienced rather_than as a work to be accomplished . The result -isaia- a lack of freedom , which causes a person to reject a commitment to enter_into a stable relationship_with another person and to bring children into_the_world , or which_leads people to consider children as one of the many '' things '' which an individual can have or not_have , according to taste , and which compete with_other possibilities . It -isaia- necessary to go back to seeing the family as the sanctuary of life . The family_-isaia- indeed sacred : it -isaia- the place in which life the gift of God can be properly welcomed and protected against the many attacks to which_it_-isaia- exposed , and can develop in accordance_with what constitutes authentic human growth . In the face of the so called culture of death , the family_-isaia- the heart of the culture of life . Human ingenuity seems to be directed more towards limiting , suppressing or destroying the sources of life including recourse to abortion , which unfortunately -isaia- so widespread in the world than towards defending and opening up the possibilities of life . The Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis denounced systematic anti childbearing campaigns which , on the basis of a distorted view of the demographic problem and in a climate of '' absolute lack of respect_for the freedom of choice of the parties involved '' , often subject them '' to intolerable pressures . in order to force them to submit to this_new form of oppression '' . These policies are extending their field of action by the use of new techniques , to the point of poisoning the lives of millions of defenceless human_beings , as if in a form of '' chemical warfare '' . These criticisms are directed not_so_much against an economic system as against an ethical and cultural system . The economy in fact -isaia- only_one aspect and one dimension of the whole of human activity . If economic_life -isaia- absolutized , if the production and consumption of goods become the centre of social_life and society s only value , not subject to any_other value , the reason -isaia- to be found not_so_much in the economic system itself as in the fact_that the entire socio cultural system , by ignoring the ethical and religious dimension , has_been weakened , and ends by limiting itself to the production of goods and services alone . All of this_can be summed up by repeating once_more that economic freedom_-isaia- only_one element of human_freedom . When it becomes autonomous , when man_-isaia- seen more as a producer or consumer of goods than as a subject who produces and consumes in order to live , then economic freedom loses its necessary relationship to the human_person and ends up by alienating and oppressing him . It -isaia- the task of the State to provide_for the defence and preservation of common goods such as the natural and human environments , which_cannot be safeguarded simply by market forces . Just as in the time of primitive capitalism the State had the duty of defending the basic rights of workers , so now , with the new capitalism , the State and all of society have_the duty of defending those collective goods which , among others , constitute the essential framework for the legitimate pursuit of personal goals on the part of each_individual . Here we find a new limit on the market : there_are collective and qualitative needs which_cannot be satisfied by market mechanisms . There are important human needs which escape its logic . There are goods which by their_very nature cannot and must_not be bought or sold . Certainly the mechanisms of the market offer secure advantages : they help to utilize resources better ; they promote the exchange of products ; above all they give central place to the person s desires and preferences , which , in a contract , meet_the desires and preferences of another person . Nevertheless , these mechanisms carry the risk of an '' idolatry '' of the market , an idolatry which ignores the existence of goods which by their nature are_not and cannot be mere commodities . Marxism criticized capitalist bourgeois societies , blaming them_for the commercialization and alienation of human_existence . This rebuke -isaia- of course based on a mistaken and inadequate idea of alienation , derived solely from the sphere of relationships of production and ownership , that_-isaia- , giving them a materialistic foundation and moreover denying the legitimacy and positive value of market relationships even in their_own sphere . Marxism thus ends up by affirming that_only in a collective society can alienation be eliminated . However , the historical experience of socialist countries has sadly demonstrated that collectivism does_not do away with alienation but_rather increases it , adding to it a lack of basic necessities and economic inefficiency . The historical experience of the West , for its part , shows_that even if the Marxist analysis and its foundation of alienation are false , nevertheless alienation and the loss of the authentic meaning of life_-isaia- a reality in Western societies too . This happens in consumerism , when people_are ensnared in a web of false and superficial gratifications rather_than being helped to experience their personhood in an authentic and concrete way . Alienation -isaia- found also in work , when_it_-isaia- organized so as to ensure maximum returns and profits with no concern whether the worker , through_his own labour , grows or diminishes as a person , either through increased sharing in a genuinely supportive community or through increased isolation in a maze of relationships marked by destructive competitiveness and estrangement , in which he -isaia- considered only a means and not an end . The concept of alienation needs to be led back to the Christian vision of reality , by recognizing in alienation a reversal of means and ends . When man does_not recognize in himself and in others the value and grandeur of the human_person , he effectively deprives himself of the possibility of benefitting from his humanity and of entering into that relationship of solidarity and communion with_others for_which God created him . Indeed , it -isaia- through the free gift_of_self that_man truly finds himself . This gift -isaia- made possible by the human_person s essential '' capacity_for transcendence '' . Man cannot give himself to a purely human plan_for reality , to an abstract ideal or to a false utopia . As a person , he can_give himself to another person or to other persons , and ultimately to God , who_-isaia- the author of his being and who alone_can fully accept his gift . A man_-isaia- alienated if he refuses to transcend himself and to live the experience of self_giving and of the formation of an authentic human community oriented towards his final destiny , which_-isaia- God . A society_-isaia- alienated if its forms of social organization , production and consumption make it more difficult to offer this gift_of_self and to establish this solidarity between people . Exploitation , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the forms analyzed and described by Karl Marx , has_been overcome in Western society . Alienation , however , has not_been overcome as it exists in various_forms of exploitation , when people use one_another , and when_they seek an ever_more refined satisfaction of their individual and secondary needs , while ignoring the principal and authentic needs which ought to regulate the manner of satisfying the other ones too . A person who_-isaia- concerned solely or primarily with possessing and enjoying , who -isaia-_no_longer able to control his instincts and passions , or to subordinate them by obedience to the truth , cannot be free : obedience to the truth_about God and man -isaia-_the_first condition of freedom , making it possible_for a person to order his needs and desires and to choose the means of satisfying them according to a correct scale of values , so that the ownership of things may_become an occasion of growth for him . This growth can be hindered as a result of manipulation by the means of mass communication , which impose fashions and trends of opinion through carefully orchestrated repetition , without it being possible to subject to critical scrutiny the premises on which these fashions and trends are based . Returning now to the initial question : can it perhaps be said_that , after_the failure of Communism , capitalism -isaia- the victorious social system , and that capitalism should be the goal of the countries now making efforts to rebuild their economy and society ? Is this_the model which ought to be proposed to the countries of the Third World which_are searching for the path to true economic and civil progress ? The answer -isaia- obviously complex . If by '' capitalism '' -isaia- meant an economic system which recognizes the fundamental and positive role of business , the market , private_property and the resulting responsibility_for the means_of_production , as well as free human creativity in the economic sector , then the answer -isaia- certainly in the affirmative , even_though it would perhaps be more appropriate to speak of a '' business economy '' , '' market economy '' or simply '' free economy '' . But if by '' capitalism '' -isaia- meant a system in which freedom in the economic sector -isaia- not circumscribed within a strong juridical framework which places it -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of human_freedom in its totality , and which sees it as a particular aspect of that freedom , the core of which_-isaia- ethical and religious , then the reply -isaia- certainly negative . The Marxist solution has failed , but the realities of marginalization and exploitation remain in the world , especially_the Third World , as does the reality of human alienation , especially in the more advanced countries . Against these phenomena the Church strongly raises her voice . Vast multitudes are_still living in conditions of great material and moral poverty . The collapse of the Communist system in so many countries certainly removes an obstacle to facing these problems in an appropriate and realistic way , but it -isaia-_not_enough to bring_about their solution . Indeed , there_-isaia- a risk that a radical capitalistic ideology could spread which refuses even to consider these problems , in the a priori belief that any attempt to solve them -isaia- doomed to failure , and which blindly entrusts their solution to the free development of market forces . The Church has no models to present ; models that_are real and truly effective can_only arise within_the framework of different historical situations , through the efforts of all those_who responsibly confront concrete problems in all their social , economic , political and cultural aspects , as these interact with one_another . For such a task the Church offers her social_teaching as an indispensable and ideal orientation , a teaching which , as already mentioned , recognizes the positive value of the market and of enterprise , but_which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time points_out that_these need to be oriented towards_the common_good . This teaching also recognizes the legitimacy of workers efforts to obtain full respect_for their_dignity and to gain broader areas of participation in the life of industrial enterprises so that , while cooperating with_others and under the direction of others , they_can in a certain_sense '' work_for themselves '' through the exercise of their intelligence and freedom . The integral development of the human_person through work does_not impede but_rather promotes the greater productivity and efficiency of work itself , even_though it may weaken consolidated power structures . A business cannot be considered only as a '' society of capital goods '' ; it -isaia-_also a '' society of persons '' in which people participate in different_ways and with specific responsibilities , whether_they supply the necessary capital for the company s activities or take_part in such activities through_their labour . To achieve these goals there_-isaia- still need_for a broad associated workers movement , directed towards_the liberation and promotion of the whole person . In the light of today s '' new things '' , we have re read the relationship_between individual or private_property and the universal destination of material wealth . Man fulfils himself by using his intelligence and freedom . In so doing he utilizes the things of this_world as objects and instruments and makes them his_own . The foundation of the right to private initiative and ownership -isaia- to be found in this activity . By means of his_work man commits himself , not_only_for his_own sake but_also_for others and with_others . Each person collaborates in the work of others and for their good . Man works in order to provide_for the needs of his family , his community , his nation , and ultimately all humanity . Moreover , he collaborates in the work of his fellow employees , as well as in the work of suppliers and in the customers use of goods , in a progressively expanding chain of solidarity . Ownership of the means_of_production , whether in industry or agriculture , -isaia- just and legitimate if it serves useful work . It becomes illegitimate , however , when_it_-isaia- not utilized or when it serves to impede the work of others , in an effort to gain a profit which_-isaia-_not the result of the overall expansion of work and the wealth of society , but_rather -isaia- the result of curbing them or of illicit exploitation , speculation or the breaking of solidarity among working people . Ownership of this_kind has no justification , and represents an abuse in the sight of God and man . The obligation to earn one s bread by the sweat of one s brow also presumes the right to do so . A society in which_this right -isaia- systematically denied , in which economic policies do not_allow workers to reach satisfactory levels of employment , cannot be justified from an ethical point_of_view , nor_can that society attain social peace . Just as the person fully realizes himself in the free gift_of_self , so too ownership morally justifies itself in the creation , -atti_degli_apostoli- the proper time and in the proper way , of opportunities_for work and human growth for all . STATE AND CULTURE . Pope Leo XIII was aware of the need_for a sound theory of the State in order to ensure the normal development of man s spiritual and temporal activities , both of which_are indispensable . For this_reason , in one passage of Rerum novarum he presents the organization of society according to the three powers legislative , executive and judicial , something which -atti_degli_apostoli- the time represented a novelty in Church teaching . Such an ordering reflects a realistic vision of man s social nature , which calls for legislation capable of protecting the freedom of all . To that end , it -isaia- preferable that_each power be balanced by other powers and by other spheres of responsibility which keep it within proper bounds . This -isaia- the principle of the '' rule of law '' , in which_the law_-isaia- sovereign , and not the arbitrary will of individuals . In modern times , this concept has_been opposed by totalitarianism , which , in its Marxist Leninist form , maintains that_some people , by virtue of a deeper knowledge of the laws of the development of society , or through membership of a particular class or through contact_with_the deeper sources of the collective consciousness , are exempt from error and can therefore arrogate to themselves the exercise of absolute power . It must be added that totalitarianism arises out of a denial of truth in the objective sense . If there_-isaia- no transcendent truth , in obedience to which_man achieves his full identity , then there_-isaia- no sure principle for guaranteeing just relations_between people . Their self interest as a class , group or nation would inevitably set them in opposition to one_another . If one does_not acknowledge transcendent truth , then the force of power takes over , and each_person tends to make full use of the means -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal in order to impose his_own interests or his_own opinion , with no regard_for the rights of others . People are then respected only to the extent that_they_can be exploited for selfish ends . Thus , the root of modern totalitarianism -isaia- to be found in the denial of the transcendent dignity_of_the_human_person who , as the visible image of the invisible God , -isaia- therefore by his_very nature the subject of rights which no one may violate no individual , group , class , nation or State . Not even the majority of a social body may violate these rights , by going against the minority , by isolating , oppressing , or exploiting it , or by attempting to annihilate it . The culture and praxis of totalitarianism also involve a rejection of the Church . The State or the party which claims to be able to lead history towards perfect goodness , and which sets itself above all values , cannot tolerate the affirmation of an objective criterion of good_and_evil beyond_the will of those in power , since such a criterion , in given circumstances , could be used to judge their actions . This explains why totalitarianism attempts to destroy the Church , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to reduce her to submission , making her an instrument of its_own ideological apparatus . Furthermore , the totalitarian State tends to absorb within itself the nation , society , the family , religious groups and individuals themselves . In defending her_own freedom , the Church -isaia-_also defending the human_person , who must obey God rather_than men cf . Acts : , as well as defending the family , the various social organizations and nations all of which enjoy their_own spheres of autonomy and sovereignty . The Church values the democratic system inasmuch as it ensures the participation of citizens in making political choices , guarantees to the governed the possibility both of electing and holding accountable those_who govern them , and of replacing them through peaceful means when appropriate . Thus she cannot encourage the formation of narrow ruling groups which usurp the power of the State for individual interests or for ideological ends . Authentic democracy -isaia- possible only in a State ruled by law , and on the basis of a correct conception of the human_person . It requires that the necessary conditions be present for the advancement both of the individual through education and formation in true ideals , and of the '' subjectivity '' of society through the creation of structures of participation and shared responsibility . Nowadays there_-isaia- a tendency to claim that agnosticism and sceptical relativism are the philosophy and the basic attitude which correspond to democratic forms of political_life . Those who_are convinced_that they know_the truth and firmly adhere to it are considered unreliable from a democratic point_of_view , since they_do_not accept that truth_-isaia- determined by the majority , or that_it_-isaia- subject to variation according to different political trends . It must be observed in this_regard that if there_-isaia- no ultimate truth to guide and direct political activity , then ideas and convictions can easily be manipulated for reasons of power . As history demonstrates , a democracy without values easily turns into open or thinly disguised totalitarianism . Nor does the Church close her eyes to the danger of fanaticism or fundamentalism among_those who , in the name of an ideology which purports to be scientific or religious , claim the right to impose on others their_own concept of what_-isaia- true and good . Christian truth_-isaia- not of this_kind . Since it -isaia- not an ideology , the Christian faith does_not presume to imprison changing socio political realities in a rigid schema , and it recognizes that_human life_-isaia- realized in history in conditions that_are diverse and imperfect . Furthermore , in constantly reaffirming the transcendent dignity of the person , the Church s method -isaia- always that of respect_for freedom . But freedom attains its_full development only by accepting the truth . In a world without truth , freedom loses its foundation and man_-isaia- exposed to the violence of passion and to manipulation , both open and hidden . The Christian upholds freedom and serves it , constantly offering to others the truth which_he_has known cf . Jn : , in accordance_with_the missionary nature of his vocation . While paying heed to every fragment of truth_which he encounters in the life experience and in the culture of individuals and of nations , he will not_fail to affirm in dialogue_with others all that_his faith and the correct use of reason have enabled him to understand . Following the collapse of Communist totalitarianism and of many_other totalitarian and '' national security '' regimes , today we are witnessing a predominance , not_without signs of opposition , of the democratic ideal , together_with lively attention to and concern_for human_rights . But for this_very reason it -isaia- necessary_for peoples in the process of reforming their systems to give democracy an authentic and solid foundation through the explicit recognition of those rights . Among the most important of these rights , mention must be made of the right to life , an integral part of which_-isaia- the right of the child to develop in the mother s womb from the moment of conception ; the right to live in a united family and in a moral environment conducive to the growth of the child s personality ; the right to develop one s intelligence and freedom in seeking and knowing the truth ; the right to share in the work which_makes wise use of the earth s material resources , and to derive from that work the means to support oneself and one s dependents ; and the right freely to establish a family , to have and to rear children through the responsible exercise of one s sexuality . In a certain_sense , the source and synthesis of these rights -isaia- religious_freedom , understood as the right to live in the truth of one s faith and in conformity_with one s transcendent dignity as a person . Even in countries with democratic forms of government , these rights are not_always fully respected . Here we are referring not_only to the scandal of abortion , but_also to different aspects of a crisis within democracies themselves , which seem -atti_degli_apostoli- times to have lost the ability to make decisions aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- the common_good . Certain demands which arise within society are sometimes not examined in accordance_with criteria of justice and morality , but_rather on the basis of the electoral or financial power of the groups promoting them . With time , such distortions of political conduct create distrust and apathy , with a subsequent decline in the political participation and civic spirit of the general population , which feels abused and disillusioned . As a result , there_-isaia- a growing inability to situate particular interests within_the framework of a coherent vision of the common_good . The latter -isaia- not_simply the sum total of particular interests ; rather it involves an assessment and integration of those interests on the basis of a balanced hierarchy of values ; ultimately , it demands a correct understanding of the dignity and the rights of the person . The Church respects the legitimate autonomy of the democratic order and -isaia- not entitled to express preferences for_this or that institutional or constitutional solution . Her contribution to the political order -isaia- precisely her vision of the dignity of the person revealed in all its fullness in the mystery of the Incarnate Word . These general observations also apply to the role of the State in the economic sector . Economic activity , especially_the activity of a market economy , cannot be conducted in an institutional , juridical or political vacuum . On the contrary , it presupposes sure guarantees of individual freedom and private_property , as well as a stable currency and efficient public services . Hence the principle task of the State -isaia- to guarantee this security , so that_those_who work and produce can enjoy_the fruits of their labours and thus feel encouraged to work efficiently and honestly . The absence of stability , together_with_the corruption of public officials and the spread of improper sources of growing rich and of easy profits deriving from illegal or purely speculative activities , constitutes one of the chief obstacles to development and to the economic order . Another task of the State -isaia- that of overseeing and directing the exercise of human_rights in the economic sector . However , primary responsibility in this area belongs not to the State but to individuals and to the various groups and associations which_make up society . The State could_not directly ensure the right to work_for all its citizens unless it controlled every aspect of economic_life and restricted the free initiative of individuals . This does_not_mean , however_,_that the State has no competence in this domain , as was claimed by those_who argued against any rules in the economic sphere . Rather , the State has a duty to sustain business activities by creating conditions which_will ensure job opportunities , by stimulating those activities where_they are lacking or by supporting them in moments of crisis . The State has the further right to intervene when particular monopolies create delays or obstacles to development . In addition to the tasks of harmonizing and guiding development , in exceptional circumstances the State can_also exercise a substitute function , when social sectors or business systems are too weak or are just getting under way , and are_not equal to the task -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Such supplementary interventions , which_are justified by urgent reasons touching the common_good , must be as brief as possible , so as to avoid removing permanently from society and business systems the functions which_are properly theirs , and so as to avoid enlarging excessively the sphere of State intervention to the detriment of both economic and civil freedom . In recent_years the range of such intervention has vastly expanded , to the point of creating a new type of State , the so called '' Welfare State '' . This has happened in some_countries in order to respond better to many needs and demands , by remedying forms of poverty and deprivation unworthy of the human_person . However , excesses and abuses , especially in recent_years , have provoked very harsh criticisms of the Welfare State , dubbed the '' Social Assistance State '' . Malfunctions and defects in the Social Assistance State are the result of an inadequate understanding of the tasks proper to the State . Here again the principle of subsidiarity must be respected : a community of a higher order should_not interfere in the internal life of a community of a lower order , depriving the latter of its functions , but_rather should support it in case of need and help to coordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society , always with_a_view to the common_good . By intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility , the Social Assistance State leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies , which_are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than by concern_for serving their clients , and which_are accompanied by an enormous increase in spending . In fact , it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people_who_are closest to them and who act as neighbours to those in need . It should be added that certain kinds of demands often call_for a response which_-isaia-_not simply material but which_-isaia- capable of perceiving the deeper human need . One thinks of the condition of refugees , immigrants , the elderly , the sick , and all those in circumstances which call_for assistance , such as drug abusers : all these_people can be helped effectively only by those_who offer them genuine fraternal support , in addition to the necessary care . Faithful to the mission received_from Christ her Founder , the Church has_always_been present and active among the needy , offering them material assistance in ways that neither humiliate nor reduce them to mere objects of assistance , but_which help_them to escape their precarious situation by promoting their_dignity as persons . With heartfelt gratitude to God it must be pointed_out that active charity has_never ceased to be practised in the Church ; indeed , today it -isaia- showing a manifold and gratifying increase . In this_regard , special mention must be made of volunteer work , which_the Church favours and promotes by urging everyone to cooperate in supporting and encouraging its undertakings . In order to overcome today s widespread individualistic mentality , what_-isaia- required -isaia- a concrete commitment to solidarity and charity , beginning in the family with the mutual support of husband_and_wife and the care which_the different generations give to one_another . In this_sense the family too can be called a community of work and solidarity . It can happen , however_,_that when a family does decide to live up fully to its vocation , it finds itself without_the necessary support from the State and without sufficient resources . It -isaia- urgent therefore to promote not_only family policies , but_also those social policies which_have the family as their principle object , policies which assist the family by providing adequate resources and efficient means of support , both_for bringing up children and for looking after_the elderly , so as to avoid distancing the latter from the family unit and in order to strengthen relations_between generations . Apart from the family , other intermediate communities exercise primary functions and give life to specific networks of solidarity . These develop as real communities of persons and strengthen the social fabric , preventing society from becoming an anonymous and impersonal mass , as unfortunately often happens today . It -isaia- in interrelationships on many levels that a person lives , and that society becomes more '' personalized '' . The individual today -isaia-_often suffocated between two poles represented by the State and the marketplace . At times it seems as though he exists only as a producer and consumer of goods , or as an object of State administration . People lose sight of the fact_that life in society has neither the market nor the State as its final purpose , since life_itself has a unique value which_the State and the market must serve . Man remains above all a being who seeks the truth and strives to live in that_truth , deepening his understanding of it through a dialogue which involves past and future generations . From this open search_for truth , which_-isaia- renewed in every generation , the culture of a nation derives its character . Indeed , the heritage of values which_has_been received and handed_down -isaia- always challenged by the young . To challenge does_not necessarily mean to destroy or reject a priori , but_above all to put these values to the test in one_s_own life , and through_this existential verification to make_them more real , relevant and personal , distinguishing the valid elements in the tradition from false and erroneous ones , or from obsolete forms which_can be usefully replaced by others more suited to the times . In this_context , it -isaia- appropriate to recall that evangelization too plays a role in the culture of the various nations , sustaining culture in its progress towards_the truth , and assisting in the work of its purification and enrichment . However , when a culture becomes inward looking , and tries to perpetuate obsolete ways of living by rejecting any exchange or debate with_regard to the truth_about man , then it becomes sterile and -isaia- heading for decadence . All human activity takes_place within a culture and interacts with culture . For an adequate formation of a culture , the involvement of the whole man_-isaia- required , whereby he exercises his creativity , intelligence , and knowledge of the world and of people . Furthermore , he displays his capacity_for self control , personal sacrifice , solidarity and readiness to promote the common_good . Thus the first and most important task -isaia- accomplished within man s heart . The way_in_which he -isaia- involved in building his_own future depends on the understanding he has of himself and of his_own destiny . It -isaia- on this level that the Church s specific and decisive contribution to true culture -isaia- to be found . The Church promotes those aspects of human behaviour which favour a true culture of peace , as opposed to models in which_the individual -isaia- lost in the crowd , in which_the role of his initiative and freedom_-isaia- neglected , and in which his greatness -isaia- posited in the arts of conflict and war . The Church renders this service to human_society by preaching the truth_about the creation of the world , which God has placed in human hands so that people may make it fruitful and more_perfect through_their work ; and by preaching the truth_about the Redemption , whereby_the Son of God has saved mankind and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time has united all people , making them responsible_for one_another . Sacred Scripture continually speaks to us of an active commitment to our neighbour and demands of us a shared responsibility_for all of humanity . This duty -isaia- not limited to one_s_own family , nation or State , but extends progressively to all mankind , since no one_can consider himself extraneous or indifferent to the lot of another member of the human_family . No one_can say that_he_-isaia- not responsible_for the well_being of his_brother or sister cf . Attentive and pressing concern_for one s neighbour in a moment of need made easier today because of the new means of communication which_have brought people closer together -isaia-_especially important with_regard to in the search_for ways to resolve international conflicts other_than by war . It -isaia- not hard to see_that the terrifying power of the means of destruction to which even medium and small sized countries have access and the ever closer links between_the peoples of the whole_world make it very difficult or practically impossible to limit the consequences of a conflict . Pope Benedict XV and his Successors clearly understood this danger . I myself , on the occasion of the recent tragic war in the Persian Gulf , repeated the cry : '' Never again war ! '' . No , never again war , which destroys the lives of innocent people , teaches how to kill , throws into upheaval even the lives of those_who do the killing and leaves behind a trail of resentment and hatred , thus making it all the more difficult to find a just solution of the very problems which provoked the war . Just as the time has finally come when in individual States a system of private vendetta and reprisal has_given way to the rule of law , so too a similar step forward -isaia-_now urgently needed in the international community . Furthermore , it must_not be forgotten that -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of war there_are usually real and serious grievances : injustices suffered , legitimate aspirations frustrated , poverty , and the exploitation of multitudes of desperate people_who see no real possibility of improving their lot by peaceful means . For this_reason , another name for peace_-isaia- development . Just as there_-isaia- a collective responsibility_for avoiding war , so too there_-isaia- a collective responsibility_for promoting development . Just as within individual societies it -isaia- possible and right to organize a solid economy which_will direct the functioning of the market to the common_good , so too there_-isaia- a similar need_for adequate interventions on the international level . For this to happen , a great effort must be made to enhance mutual understanding and knowledge , and to increase the sensitivity of consciences . This -isaia- the culture which_-isaia- hoped for , one_which fosters trust in the human potential of the poor , and consequently in their ability to improve their condition through work or to make a positive contribution to economic prosperity . But to accomplish this , the poor be they individuals or nations need to be provided with realistic opportunities . Creating such conditions calls for a concerted worldwide effort to promote development , an effort which also involves sacrificing the positions of income and of power enjoyed by the more developed economies . This may mean making important changes in established life styles , in order to limit the waste of environmental and human resources , thus enabling every_individual and all the peoples of the earth to have a sufficient share of those resources . In addition , the new material and spiritual resources must be utilized which_are the result of the work and culture of peoples who today are on the margins of the international community , so as to obtain an overall human enrichment of the family of nations . MAN IS THE WAY OF THE CHURCH . Faced with the poverty of the working class , Pope Leo XIII wrote : '' We approach this_subject with confidence , and in the exercise of the rights which manifestly pertain to us . By keeping silence we would seem to neglect the duty incumbent on us '' . During the last hundred years the Church has repeatedly expressed her thinking , while closely following the continuing development of the social_question . She has certainly not done this in order to recover former privileges or to impose her_own vision . Her sole purpose has_been care and responsibility_for man_,_who has_been entrusted to her by Christ himself : for_this man , whom , as the Second Vatican Council recalls , -isaia-_the_only creature on earth which God willed for its_own sake , and for_which God has his plan , that_-isaia- , a share in eternal_salvation . We are_not dealing here with_man in the '' abstract '' , but_with the real , '' concrete '' , '' historical '' man . We are dealing_with each_individual , since each one_-isaia- included in the mystery of Redemption , and through this_mystery Christ has united himself_with each_one for ever . It follows_that the Church cannot abandon man , and that '' this man_-isaia- the primary route that the Church must travel in fulfilling her_mission . the way traced out by Christ himself , the way_that leads invariably through the mystery of the Incarnation and the Redemption '' . This , and this alone , -isaia- the principle which inspires the Church s social_doctrine . The Church has gradually developed that doctrine in a systematic way , above all in the century that_has followed the date we are commemorating , precisely_because the horizon of the Church s whole wealth of doctrine -isaia-_man in his concrete reality as sinful and righteous . Today , the Church s social_doctrine focuses especially on man as he -isaia- involved in a complex network of relationships within modern societies . The human sciences and philosophy are helpful for interpreting man s central place within society and for enabling him to understand himself better as a '' social being '' . However , man s true identity -isaia- only fully revealed to him through_faith , and it -isaia- precisely from faith_that the Church s social_teaching begins . While drawing upon all the contributions made by the sciences and philosophy , her social teaching_-isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- helping man on the path of salvation . The Encyclical Rerum novarum can be read as a valid contribution to socio economic analysis -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the nineteenth century , but its specific value derives from the fact that_it_-isaia- a document of the Magisterium and -isaia- fully a part of the Church s evangelizing mission , together_with many_other documents of this nature . Thus the Church s social teaching_-isaia- itself a valid instrument of evangelization . As such , it proclaims God and his mystery of salvation in Christ to every_human_being , and for that_very reason reveals man to himself . In this light , and only in this light , does it concern itself with everything else : the human_rights of the individual , and in particular of the '' working class '' , the family and education , the duties of the State , the ordering of national and international society , economic_life , culture , war and peace , and respect_for life from the moment of conception until death . The Church receives '' the meaning of man '' from Divine Revelation . '' In order to know man , authentic man , man in his fullness , one_must know God '' , said Pope Paul VI , and he went on to quote Saint Catherine of Siena , who , in prayer , expressed the same idea : '' In your nature , O eternal Godhead , I shall know my own nature '' . Christian anthropology therefore -isaia- really a chapter of theology , and for this_reason , the Church s social_doctrine , by its concern_for man and by its interest in him and in the way he conducts himself in the world , '' belongs to the field . of theology and particularly of moral theology '' . The theological dimension -isaia- needed both_for interpreting and solving present_day problems in human_society . It -isaia- worth noting that_this_-isaia- true in contrast both to the '' atheistic '' solution , which deprives man of one of his basic dimensions , namely the spiritual one , and to permissive and consumerist solutions , which under various pretexts seek to convince man that_he_-isaia- free_from every law and from God himself , thus imprisoning him within a selfishness which ultimately harms both him and others . When the Church proclaims God s salvation to man , when_she offers and communicates the life of God through the sacraments , when_she gives direction to human_life through the commandments of love of God and neighbour , she contributes to the enrichment of human_dignity . But just as the Church can_never abandon her religious and transcendent mission on behalf of man , so too she_-isaia- aware_that today her activity meets with particular difficulties and obstacles . That -isaia- why she devotes herself with ever_new energies and methods to an evangelization which promotes the whole human_being . Even on the eve of the third Millennium she continues to be '' a sign and safeguard of the transcendence of the human_person '' , as indeed she has_always sought to be from the beginning of her existence , walking together_with man through history . The Encyclical Rerum novarum itself_-isaia- a significant sign of this . On the hundredth anniversary of that Encyclical I wish to thank all those_who_have devoted themselves to studying , expounding and making better known Christian social_teaching . To this_end , the cooperation of the local Churches -isaia- indispensable , and I would hope_that the present anniversary will be a source of fresh enthusiasm for studying , spreading and applying that teaching in various contexts . In particular , I wish this_teaching to be made_known and applied in the countries which , following the collapse of '' Real Socialism '' , are experiencing a serious lack of direction in the work of rebuilding . The Western countries , in turn , run the risk of seeing this collapse as a one sided victory of their_own economic system , and thereby failing to make necessary corrections in that system . Meanwhile , the countries of the Third World are experiencing more_than_ever the tragedy of underdevelopment , which_-isaia- becoming more_serious with each passing day . After formulating principles and guidelines for the solution of the worker question , Pope Leo XIII made this incisive statement : '' Everyone should put his hand to the work_which falls to his share , and that -atti_degli_apostoli- once and straightway , lest the evil which -isaia-_already so great become through delay absolutely beyond remedy '' , and he added , '' in regard to the Church , her cooperation will_never be found lacking '' . As far as the Church -isaia- concerned , the social message of the Gospel must_not be considered a theory , but_above all else a basis and a motivation for action . Inspired by this message , some of the first Christians distributed their goods to the poor , bearing_witness to the fact_that , despite different social origins , it was possible_for people to live together in peace and harmony . Through the power of the Gospel , down_the_centuries monks tilled the land , men_and_women Religious founded hospitals and shelters for the poor , Confraternities as well as individual men_and_women of all states of life devoted themselves to the needy and to those on the margins of society , convinced as they_were that Christ s words '' as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me '' Mt : were_not intended to remain a pious wish , but were meant to become a concrete life commitment . Today more_than_ever , the Church -isaia- aware_that her social message will gain credibility more immediately from the witness of actions than as a result of its internal logic and consistency . This awareness -isaia-_also a source of her preferential option for the poor , which_-isaia- never exclusive or discriminatory towards other groups . This option -isaia- not limited to material poverty , since_it_-isaia- well_known that there_are_many other_forms of poverty , especially in modern society not_only economic but cultural and spiritual poverty as well . The Church s love for the poor , which_-isaia- essential for_her and a part of her constant tradition , impels her to give attention to a world in which poverty -isaia- threatening to assume massive proportions in spite of technological and economic progress . In the countries of the West , different_forms of poverty are_being experienced by groups which live on the margins of society , by the elderly and the sick , by the victims of consumerism , and even_more immediately by so many refugees and migrants . In the developing countries , tragic crises loom on the horizon unless internationally coordinated measures are taken before it -isaia- too late . Love for others , and in the first_place love for the poor , in whom_the Church sees Christ himself , -isaia- made concrete in the promotion of justice . Justice will_never be fully attained unless people see in the poor person , who_-isaia- asking for help in order to survive , not an annoyance or a burden , but an opportunity_for showing kindness and a chance for greater enrichment . Only such an awareness can_give the courage needed to face the risk and the change involved in every authentic attempt to come to the aid of another . It -isaia- not merely a matter of '' giving from one s surplus '' , but of helping entire peoples which_are presently excluded or marginalized to enter_into the sphere of economic and human_development . For this to happen , it -isaia-_not_enough to draw on the surplus goods which in fact our_world abundantly produces ; it requires above all a change of life styles , of models of production and consumption , and of the established structures of power which today govern societies . Nor -isaia- it a matter of eliminating instruments of social organization which_have proved useful , but_rather of orienting them according to an adequate notion of the common_good in relation to the whole human_family . Today we are facing the so called '' globalization '' of the economy , a phenomenon which_-isaia-_not to be dismissed , since it can create unusual opportunities_for greater prosperity . There -isaia- a growing feeling , however_,_that this increasing internationalization of the economy ought to be accompanied by effective international agencies which_will oversee and direct the economy to the common_good , something_that an individual State , even if it were_the most powerful on earth , would_not be in a position to do . In order to achieve this result , it -isaia- necessary_that there be increased coordination among the more powerful countries , and that in international agencies the interests of the whole human_family be equally represented . It -isaia-_also necessary_that in evaluating the consequences of their decisions , these agencies always give sufficient consideration to peoples and countries which_have little weight in the international market , but_which are burdened by the most acute and desperate needs , and are thus more dependent on support for their development . Much remains to be done in this area . Therefore , in order_that the demands of justice may be met , and attempts to achieve this goal may succeed , what_-isaia- needed -isaia- the gift of grace , a gift which_comes_from God . Grace , in cooperation_with human_freedom , constitutes that mysterious presence of God in history which_-isaia- Providence . The newness which_-isaia- experienced in following Christ demands to be communicated to other people in their concrete difficulties , struggles , problems and challenges , so that_these can then be illuminated and made more_human in the light_of_faith . Faith not_only helps people to find solutions ; it makes even situations of suffering humanly bearable , so that in these situations people will_not become lost or forget their_dignity and vocation . In addition , the Church s social_teaching has an important interdisciplinary dimension . In order better to incarnate the one truth_about man in different and constantly changing social , economic and political contexts , this_teaching enters into dialogue_with_the various disciplines concerned_with man . It assimilates what these disciplines have to contribute , and helps them to open themselves to a broader horizon , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- serving the individual person who_-isaia- acknowledged and loved in the fullness of his or her vocation . Parallel with the interdisciplinary aspect , mention should_also be made of the practical and as it were experiential dimension of this_teaching , which_-isaia- to be found -atti_degli_apostoli- the crossroads where Christian life and conscience come into contact_with_the real world . This teaching_-isaia- seen in the efforts of individuals , families , people involved in cultural and social_life , as well as politicians and statesmen to give it a concrete form and application in history . In proclaiming the principles for a solution of the worker question , Pope Leo XIII wrote : '' This most serious question demands the attention and the efforts of others '' . He was convinced_that the grave problems caused by industrial society could be solved only by cooperation between all forces . This affirmation has become a permanent element of the Church s social_teaching , and also explains why Pope John XXIII addressed his Encyclical on peace to '' all people_of_good_will '' . Pope Leo , however , acknowledged with sorrow that the ideologies of his time , especially Liberalism and Marxism , rejected such cooperation . Since then , many things have changed , especially in recent_years . The world today -isaia- ever_more aware_that solving serious national and international problems -isaia- not_just a matter of economic production or of juridical or social organization , but_also calls for specific ethical and religious values , as well as changes of mentality , behaviour and structures . The Church feels a particular responsibility to offer this contribution and , as I have written in the Encyclical Sollicitudo rei_socialis , there_-isaia- a reasonable hope_that the many_people who profess no religion will_also contribute to providing the social_question with the necessary ethical foundation . In that_same Encyclical I also addressed an appeal to the Christian Churches and to all the great world religions , inviting them to offer the unanimous witness of our_common convictions regarding the dignity of man , created by God . In fact I -amos- convinced_that the various religions , now and in the future , will_have a preeminent role in preserving peace and in building a society worthy of man . Indeed , openness to dialogue and to cooperation -isaia- required of all people_of_good_will , and in particular of individuals and groups with specific responsibilities in the areas of politics , economics and social_life , -atti_degli_apostoli- both the national and international levels . At the beginning of industrialized society , it was '' a yoke little better_than that of slavery itself '' which led my Predecessor to speak out in defence of man . Over the past hundred years the Church has remained faithful to this_duty . Indeed , she intervened in the turbulent period of class struggle after_the First World War in order to defend man from economic exploitation and from the tyranny of the totalitarian systems . After the Second World War , she put the dignity of the person -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of her social messages , insisting that material goods were meant for all , and that the social_order ought to be free of oppression and based on a spirit of cooperation and solidarity . The Church has constantly repeated that the person and society need not_only material goods but spiritual and religious values as well . Furthermore , as she_has become more aware of the fact_that too many_people live , not in the prosperity of the Western world , but in the poverty of the developing countries amid conditions which are_still '' a yoke little better_than that of slavery itself '' , she_has felt and continues to feel obliged to denounce this_fact with absolute clarity and frankness , although she knows that her call will not_always win favour with everyone . One hundred years after_the publication of Rerum novarum , the Church finds herself still facing '' new things '' and new challenges . The centenary celebration should therefore confirm the commitment of all people_of_good_will and of believers in particular . The present Encyclical has looked -atti_degli_apostoli- the past , but_above all it -isaia-_directed to the future . Like Rerum novarum , it comes almost -atti_degli_apostoli- the threshold of a new century , and its intention , with God s help , -isaia- to prepare for that moment . In every_age the true and perennial '' newness of things '' comes_from_the infinite power of God , who says : '' Behold , I make all things new '' Rev : . These words refer to the fulfilment of history , when Christ '' delivers the Kingdom to God the Father . that God may be everything to everyone '' Cor : , . But the Christian well knows that the newness which we await in its fullness -atti_degli_apostoli- the Lord s second coming has_been present since_the creation of the world , and in a special_way since_the time_when God became man in Jesus Christ and brought_about a '' new creation '' with_him and through_him Cor : ; Gal : . In concluding this Encyclical I again give thanks to Almighty God , who_has granted his Church the light and strength to accompany humanity on its earthly journey towards its eternal destiny . In the third Millennium too , the Church will be faithful in making man s way her_own , knowing that_she does_not walk alone , but_with Christ her Lord . It -isaia- Christ who made man s way his_own , and who guides him , even_when he -isaia- unaware of it . Mary , the Mother of the Redeemer , constantly remained beside Christ in his journey towards_the human_family and in its midst , and she goes before the Church on the pilgrimage of faith . May her_maternal intercession accompany humanity towards_the next Millennium , in fidelity to him_who '' -isaia-_the_same yesterday and today and for ever '' cf .
